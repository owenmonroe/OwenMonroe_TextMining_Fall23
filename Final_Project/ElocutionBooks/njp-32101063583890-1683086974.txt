PREFACE
22
ELOCUTION is one of the Fine Arts. It belongs to that
7
department of knowledge in which we find Music, Paint-
ing, Poetry, and Sculpture. Each one of these arts aims to ex-
press the divine principle of beauty, and they have thus received
the appellation of the Fine Arts. All art is the embodiment of
the ideals of the imagination; and the art of expressing thought
and sentiment in living words, for beauty and power, stands
among the highest of the polite or liberal arts. By no influence
is the soul more deeply touched than by the words that come
vibrating from the lips of eloquence, all warm with the emo-
tions of the speaker's heart. The utterances of the great mas-
ters of expression are heard sounding down through the ages
with a power that their printed words fail to convey to the
mind.
Origin of the Work.-With such an appreciation of the
character and value of artistic expression, I consented to at-
tempt the revision of a Manual of Elocution of which the
publishers held the copyright. Having worked out what I
regarded as a correct theory of elocution for my “teaching
classes,” I thought it would be an easy matter to connect this
theory with the practical exercises of the manual, and thus give
both a wider circulation. After beginning the work, however,
it was soon found that instead of merely revising the old book,
it would be necessary, in order to carry out my ideal, to write a
new, one. I have thus, almost by accident, become an author in

a line of school literature quite different from that with which
I have before been associated.
Nature of the Work. In the accomplishment of the task,
I have made use of the results of many years' experience in
training normal school students in the methods of teaching
reading, besides a wide observation of the methods and prac-
tice of our best elocutionists. The germ of the treatise will be
found in my Normal Methods of Teaching. The subject is here
developed in a more practical form, and adapted to actual in-
struction. The work, as will be seen, is divided into two parts
-the Theory of Elocution and the Practice of Elocution. In
other words, it is a treatise upon the Theory of Reading, and
also a practical School Reader. A brief statement in respect to
the character of each of these parts will be made.
The Theory of Elocution.—In the theoretical part, I have
attempted to unfold a correct theory of elocution, arranged in a
practical form for teaching the subject. The aim has been to
present what is thought to be the true philosophy of elocution
in a scientific form that can be readily understood and applied.
Elocutionary expression is regarded as embracing three ele-
ments,-a Mental Element, a Physical Element, and a Vocal
Element; and the leading features of these three elements are
unfolded in a simple and concise manner, and in a form conven-
ient for study and instruction. The Vocal Element being the
central and principal element, receives, of course, the greatest
share of attention. The voice is the instrument of expression;
the mind furnishes the matter to be expressed; while the body
adds the force of visible language to the oral utterance.
Illustrations. The principles, as stated, are briefly illustrated,
though the teacher will often find occasion to supplement the
illustrations. Following the Theory of Elocution are several
pages of exercises for the further illustration and the practical
application of the principles of the subject. These extracts are
nearly all taken from the work whose revision was contemplated.
They present an unusually fine set of practical examples, and

reflect great credit on the author of that work, showing a cul-
tivated literary taste, extensive reading, and excellent judgment
of the elocutionary needs of students and teachers.
The Practical Part.—The practical part of the work, or
the Reader proper, is designed to be used in connection with the
study of the theory of the subject. In making the selections
for this part, several objects have been kept prominently in view.
First the aim has been to give examples of good literature; no
piece has been inserted merely for its novelty or dramatic ele-
ments. The reading-book, it has been remembered, is often the
principal source of the culture of the literary taste of the pupil ;
it should abound, therefore, with selections from the most ele-
gant and polished writers.
Literary Selections.-Most of the selections, as will be seen,
are thus taken from among the classics of the language. Many
of the old familiar pieces, that have become embalmed in the
hearts and memories of teachers of reading, have been inserted;
while at the same time many new selections are presented,
which, it is hoped, will also become favorites with the teachers
and pupils who may use the work. Short extracts from some
of the masterpieces of oratory are frequently introduced to
train to classic and impressive expression and delivery. A large
number of these selections are so choice in their literary char-
acter that it would be well for the student to commit them to
memory. A few pieces, however, which have attained a popu-
larity on account of some good moral sentiment, independent
of their literary excellence, have also been introduced.
Elocutionary Effect.-A second object in making selections
has been to insert those that are especially fitted to train the
pupil in delivery. Literature, however excellent in itself, if
not suited to cultivate the art of vocal expression, would not
be adapted to a work on reading; a good reading-book needs
pieces especially adapted to train pupils to read. For this pur-
pose, also, there should be as much variety in style as possible-
a requirement that has been kept constantly in mind. The

PREFACE.
effort has been made to combine selections that will give the
pupil varied culture in reading; enabling him to read narrative,
descriptive, pathetic, dramatic, and humorous pieces, and also
to impersonate character and imitate personal peculiarities.
The selections of admired passages from classical orations have
been made especially large, the author believing that good ora-
torical delivery contains in itself the spirit of all excellence in
recitation and reading.
Throughout the entire work there has been a sincere effort to
present such instruction and exercises as may train pupils to a
refined and effective expression of thought and sentiment.
Acknowledging my obligations to the writers on elocution from
whose works I have drawn ideas and inspiration, and to the
authors and their publishers for the privilege of making so
many choice selections of literature, I submit the work to the
kind consideration of teachers and pupils, with the sincere wish
that it may aid in the culture of a higher appreciation of the
beautiful art of reading, and increased excellence in the prac-
tice thereof.

A MANUAL OF
ELOCUTION AND READING.
INTRODUCTION.
Elocution is the art of vocal delivery. It is the art of
giving correct, elegant, and impressive oral expression to
thought and sentiment. The term elocution is derived from
eloqui, to speak out, or express. In defining elocution as the
art of vocal delivery, we mean, of course, with the speaking
rather than the singing tones of the voice.
Value of Elocution.-Elocution is a fine art, like music and
painting. Its object, like that of the other fine arts, is to
express the beautiful and touch the heart. Skill in elocution
should therefore be prized as a valuable accomplishment.
The recitation of some beautiful poem, or the reading of a
choice selection, can be made as attractive in society as sing-
ing or playing the piano.
Elocution is also a useful as well as a beautiful art. A
well-trained voice and an impressive expression give influence
and success.
The manner of saying things often makes a
deeper impression than the thing that is said. We render
ourselves agreeable in social life, and increase our power by
an attractive and pleasing manner of expression. Even busi-

ness success depends largely upon a person's address; and
eminence in public life is to a great degree the result of a
clear and forcible expression of thought.
A public speaker should be a good elocutionist. The great
orators were noted for their skill in delivery as well as for
their broad and inspiring thought. It is reported of Whit-
field that he could move an audience to laughter or tears by
the utterance of the single word, Mesopotamia. Demosthe-
nes and Cicero cultivated the art of delivery with untiring
industry; and the eloquence of Burke and Sheridan was
largely due to the artistic excellence of their delivery.
Elocution can be taught as well as the arts of music and
painting. A thorough course in vocal culture and the art of
expression will do as much for the reader as a course of train-
ing does for the singer. The human voice, in the hands of a
master, may be made to attain to a wondrous strength and
richness of tone; and the art of artistic and elegant expres-
sion may be taught and acquired. Natural talent and genius
tell here, as they do in the other arts; but nearly all the high
attainments in delivery are the result of natural powers care-
fully and sedulously trained. The cultivation of this delightful
and beautiful art of reading should, therefore, be recognized
as a part of a liberal education.
THE BASIS OF ELOCUTION.
Nature the Basis.—The fundamental principle of elocution
is that of natural expression. Reading is an art, and the basis
of all art is nature. The basis of all artistic expression is
therefore natural expression.
What is Nature But what is natural expression ? Not
every one's manner of reading previous to culture can be
called natural expression. Moulded by fashion and habit,
our so-called natural style does not always reflect nature.
Indeed, we are so affected by habit that we often find it one
of the most natural things to be unnatural. We must there.

TAE BASIS OF ELOCUTION.
15
fore be careful not to confound habit with nature. To talk
through the nose is not natural; it is habit or a defect of
organic structure rather than nature.
Nature is always pure, true, and beautiful; and true art
leads to nature and not to the artificial forms of habit. In
all true artistic culture, therefore, the object is to ascertain
what is natural. Culture endeavors to discover the perfection
of nature, and to take each individual back to that high and
perfect standard from which he may have departed.
Natural Expression.—The object of culture in elocution is
therefore natural expression. It aims not to eliminate the old
and substitute the new, but to train and improve that which
nature has given us. Everything artificial in expression is
regarded as inartistic and distasteful. The reader who "shows
his elocution” in his delivery, offends good taste and shows the
imperfection of his culture. The aim of the study of elocu-
tion is to acquire that beauty and perfection of expression
which gives no suggestion of art. In elocution especially we
should strive to attain that excellent standard of culture in
which “ the highest art conceals art.”
This culture must be on the basis of our own individual
nature. We cannot substitute someone else for ourselves
without incongruity, any more than we can wear one another's
clothes without a sense of unfitness. Culture seeks to draw
out and develop our own natural powers, rather than to sub-
stitute others for them. The character of our expression
must be in harmony with our own individual nature. Elocu-
tion has often been made ridiculous by the incongruous
attempts of one reader to adopt the style and manner of
another.
Conversation.—We are to look for natural expression in
conversation. Conversation is the simplest and most common
form of human expression, and in it are the germs of all speech
and action. In correct and natural conversation, we will find
the truest and purest models to guide us in reading. Natural,
refined, and cultivated conversation is thus to be regarded as

a
the basis of the art of elocution. In this we state the fundos
mental principle of delivery, a principle which contains, and
out of which flow, all other principles.
Conversation is thus the basis of all correct delivery. It is
the source of all true, natural, and artistic expression. The
importance of cultivating correct habits of voice and manner
in conversation, therefore, cannot be overestimated. Conver-
sation is itself a beautiful art, and deserves culture for its own
sake; but especially should we cultivate it as a basis of elocu-
tionary training
The Standard of Reading.—The standard by which we
judge of good reading is a cultivated taste. Man is gifted
with a native taste for beauty and harmony; he can see and
appreciate the divine element of beauty which the Creator
has embodied in the world around him. The divine element
in man thus correlates with the divine element in nature
and art.
This taste is cultivated by the contemplation of the mani-
festations of beauty in nature and art; and when thus culti-
vated, each man becomes a critic of art, and can sit in criti-
cism upon the productions of the artist. Personal peculiarities
allow a margin for slight differences or preferences in art; but
there will be a large general agreement among all persons of
cultivated tastes. If, at any time, through personal idiosyn-
crasies, there seems to be opposition of judgment, we must
in such cases be controlled in our decision by the opinion of
the majority of cultivated persons.
THE COURSE IN ELOCUTION.
The Course of Instruction in elocution may be embraced
under four heads : 1. Exercises ; 2. Imitation ; 3. Principles;
4. Correcting Errors.
First, there should be practice upon suitable exercises ;
second, the student should endeavor to imitate the teacher
and acquire what is excellent in his style of reading; third,


## p. 17 (#35) ##############################################

THE COURSE IN ELOCUTION.
17
there should be some general principles to guide the reader in
the correct expression; and, fourth, all errors should be care-
fully noticed and corrected.
Exercises.—There should be carefully selected exercises
under each head of the subject for the training of the pupil.
When these exercises consist of single sentences or short para-
graphs, they should be committed to memory, that they may
be used without reference to the book. Pupils should commit
choice and appropriate selections, and practise them, as the
young pianist practises her scales and arpeggios.
Imitation. Since elocution is an art, and all art is largely
imitative, elocution must be taught by imitation. In order
to learn to read, we must hear good reading, as in learning
to play or sing it is necessary to hear good playing and sing-
ing. The teacher of elocution, therefore, should be a good
reader, that he may present a model for the imitation of
his pupils. Indeed, it is a condition of prime importance
that the teacher of elocution should be a finished and artistic
reader.
Principles.—There should also be some general principles
to guide a pupil in reading. By a principle of reading is
meant some general law which can be readily applied to the
particular kinds of discourse we meet with. Rules of reading
have been criticised, and properly so, for no one can read cor-
rectly by rule. A principle is more general and more flexible
than a rule, and will be of real value in learning to give cor-
rect expression to sentiment.
Correcting Errors.—The teacher of elocution must notice
carefully the errors of pupils and correct them. He should not
merely call attention to their mistakes, but should train the
pupils in correcting them until they have overcome the old
habit and acquired the new one. Sometimes it will be well to
imitate the error, so that the pupil may clearly see it, under-
stand its gravity, and learn to correct it.

DIVISION OF TREATMENT.
The subject of elocution may be most conveniently discussed
under three heads: the Vocal Element, the Physical Element,
and the Mental Element.
The Vocal Element is that which pertains to the voice. It
is the fundamental element of reading, the basis upon which
the art is founded. It embraces Pronunciation and Modula-
tion. Pronunciation embraces Articulation and Accent. Modu-
lation embraces Quantity, Compass, Quality, and Time.
The Physical Element is that which pertains to the body
and its members. It adds visible language to oral expression,
and thus increases the effect of pure vocal delivery. It em-
braces Breathing, Posture, Gesture, and Facial Expression.
The Mental Element is that by which we understand and
appreciate what we read. It includes two things; an Intel-
lectual and an Emotional Element. The Intellectual Element
is that by which we understand what we read; the Emotional
Element is that by which we feel and appreciate what we read.
Outline. The following outline will give a general idea of
the entire subject of elocution:

PART I.
CHAPTER I.
PRONUNCIATION.
>
Pronunciation is the correct utterance of words. The term
pronunciation is derived from pro, forth, and nuncio, I an-
nounce; and means, literally, a speaking forth.
Pronunciation includes two things; Articulation and Accent.
Every mistake made in the pronunciation of a word is an
error of articulation or of accent.
Arbitrary.—The pronunciation of the English language is,
in a great measure, arbitrary. It changes from one age to
another, and varies in different countries where it is spoken,
and in different sections of the same country. Even people
of the same town or neighborhood differ in the pronunciation
of many words, influenced by the caprices of fashion and
taste.
The Standard.—The standard of pronunciation is the present
usage of literary and cultivated society. In England the usage
of the best society of London is regarded as the standard,
though the usage of good society in that city is not uniform.
In this country there is no one city that holds a corresponding
rank as a centre of intelligence and culture, and thus we have
no special standard of usage to govern us.
A standard dictionary aims to present the best usage of the
19

20
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION AND READING.
present time; the standard, therefore, for students, is the stand-
ard dictionary. The standard dictionaries of this country
are Webster and Worcester. Where these agree, we have a
guide that we may follow with confidence; where they differ,
we must decide by the best speakers we hear, or by other
information we may possess.
Of course we have excellent
authority for our usage, if we follow either one of these dic-
tionaries.
Conventional.—It is a good rule not to differ from those
with whom we associate any further than correct usage actually
requires. It seems like an affectation to use a pronunciation dif-
ferent from that of our general associates when theirs is sup-
ported by good authority. For an American to say i-ther and
ni-ther, in society where these words are pronounced according
to the usual custom, e-ther and nē-ther, is an inexcusable affec-
tation.
We should remember, also, that though our own pronuncia-
tion may be right, another person's may not be wrong when it
differs from ours. The pronunciation of words is not a matter
of absolute right, but of taste and culture. We remark, also,
that to repeat a word after another who has mispronounced it,
in order to call attention to the correct pronunciation, should
be regarded as a piece of unpardonable rudeness.
Difficulty. The pronunciation of the English language is
difficult, owing to the irregularity of our orthography. There
is, also, great carelessness in respect to pronunciation. Many
persons pronounce incorrectly a large number of words which
they use in ordinary conversation; and very few persons can
read a page of an ordinary book without several mispronunci-
ations. It is an exceptional thing to listen to a public speaker
who does not make some mistakes of this kind in an hour's
address.
Neglect.---The correct pronunciation of words does not re-
ceive the attention which its importance deserves. Persons
who would blush at a mistake in grammar, or feel deeply mor-
tified at the misspelling of a word, go on year after year mis-

ARTICULATION.
21
pronouncing many of the ordinary words with apparent indif-
ference. Such mistakes as i'dea for ide'a, complex' for com'plex,
in'quiry for inqui'ry, and the incorrect sounds of the vowels in
such words as food, root, half, past, etc., we hear constantly
made by educated men, who thus show their lack of literary
culture and refinement.
Importance.-Correct pronunciation is of even greater im-
portance than correct spelling, since we make constant and
daily use of spoken words, while we write much less frequently.
A misspelled word is an offense to the eye, but a mispronounced
word is an offense to the ear; and the ear is as delicate and
refined an organ as the eye. Why should we regard a mis-
spelled word in a person's letter a more serious error than a
mispronounced word in his conversation ?
Having thus briefly stated the nature and importance of
Pronunciation, we shall now proceed to show how it is to be
acquired, under the two heads of Articulation and Accent.
a
I. ARTICULATION.
Articulation is the correct and distinct utterance of the
elementary sounds of the language. The term articulation is
derived from articulus, a joint, an articulate sound being, liter-
ally, a jointed sound.
Importance.--Articulation is the basis of accurate and fin-
ished utterance. A correct and artistic articulation will some-
times atone for a bad voice. The secret of the power of Ran-
dolph's oratory, it is said, lay in his articulation ; for his voice
was sharp and disagreeable; but by culture his utterance be-
came so fascinating that "it haunted the hearer like the spell
of an enchantress.”
One of the most striking excellences of the modern French
actors is their distinct articulation; and French teachers of
elocution lay great stress on this element. Says Legouvé:
“Articulation, and articulation alone, gives clearness, energy,
passion, and force. Such is its power that it can even over

come deficiency of voice in the presence of a large audience.
There have been actors of the foremost rank who had scarcely
any voice. Potier had no voice. Monvel, the famous Monvel,
not only had no voice, he had no teeth! and yet no one ever
lost a word that fell from his lips; and never was there a more
delightful, more moving artist than he, thanks to his perfect
articulation.”
Artistic articulation is capable of producing deep and vivid
impressions on the listener. It is said that a speaker, in utter-
ing the expression “ the hiss of a serpent,” by slightly pro-
longing the final sound of hiss, so touched the imagination of
one of his hearers that it led to a vivid dream of a serpent.
Professor Thwing mentions that T. Starr King, just before his
departure to the Pacific coast, in an address spoke of the" wash
of the waves," and by giving a slight fulness to sh, made an
impression on his mind that he has never forgotten.
The Elementary Sounds.—The Elementary Sounds are the
sound-elements which enter into the structure of words. They
are made by the organs of the mouth and throat, called the
Organs of Speech. The organs of speech may be regarded as
a set of flexible moulds, which give form to the voice as it
flows into and through them.
Number. There are about forty elementary sounds in the
English language, though orthoepists, either through real or
affected nicety of the ear, are not agreed upon the exact num-
ber. Some sounds, which, by some writers, are supposed to be
simple, are shown by others to be composed of two simple
vocals.
Three Classes.—The elementary sounds consist of three
classes ; Vocals, Subvocals, and Aspirates. They are also called
Tonics, Subtonics, and Atonics.
A Vocal is a sound which consists of pure voice. It is
articulate voice.
A Subvocal is a sound which consists of voice and breath
combined. The voice is interrupted in its passage through
the vocal organs.


## p. 23 (#41) ##############################################

23
An Aspirate is a sound which consists of pure breath. It
is articulated breath.
Cognate Sounds are those which are produced by the same
organs in a similar position; thus, b and p, d and t, v and f, etc.

EXERCISES.—The pupils should be carefully and frequently
drilled on these elementary sounds. The following are sug-
gested methods of drill:
FIRST CLASS OF EXERCISES.
1. Pronounce the key-word in the column once, then separate
the element and pronounce it; thus, āle—ā, arm—ä, etc.
2. Repeat the list of sounds in order, giving the sound once and
then the key-word; thus, ā-ale, ä-arm, etc.
.


## p. 24 (#42) ##############################################

24

3. Repeat the list of sounds in order, giving each sound but
once.
4. Pronounce the element twice, and then the key-word, and
vice versa.
5. Pronounce the vocals with the rising slide; with the falling
slide; with the circumflex.
6. Pronounce the vocals on different pitch of the musical scale.
7. Pronounce the vocals with slides indicating question and
answer.
8. Prefix the sound of each consonant to each vocal; as, bā, bä,
ba, etc., dā, dä, etc.
9. Prefix each vocal to each consonant sound; as, āb, äb, etc., ād,
äd, etc.
10. Drill in the following subtonic combinations :
bd, robbed. ndz, hounds. lmz, elms.
gd, bragged. njd, hinged.
zm, chasm.
ngd, banged. thz, breathes.
zn, risen.
gd, bulged. thd, breathed.
zmz, spasms.
Note. These exercises may be practised with every variety of emphasis,
inflection, pitch, force, and movement. A short exercise, from three to five
minutes, might be given every day for months.
11. Drill on the following subtonic and atonic combinations:
ldz, molds.
rmd, armed. kts, picts.
rbd, orbed.
rls, curls.
ths, truths.
rjd, urged.
ps, sips.
tht, withed.
rmz, arms.
pt, ripped.
sts, hosts.
12. Drill on the following cognates and equivalents :
f, v, fine, vine.
j, ch, jest, chest.
g, k, guild, killed.
2, sh, zone, shone.
b, p, bark, park.
th, th, think, then.
d, t, dear, tear.
w, wh, wine, whine.
8, 2, seal, zeal.
Phonic Analysis.-By Phonic Analysis we mean the analysis
of words into their elementary sounds. It should receive the
careful attention of the student.
The exercises are of two kinds: first, the giving of the ele-
mentary sounds of a word orally; and second, the represen-
tation of them by means of the proper
notation.

EXERCISE I.-Resolve the following words into their ele-
mentary sounds:
road send nought lady
adept
bone give breathe billow basalt
tune work freaks whether address
fair

Note.—The teacher will give many other words, selecting from the
Reader, etc.
EXERCISE II.—Write the following words, indicating the
sounds of the letters :
leave badly ratio
courtesy
sieve thinker glacial continue
town seize restless inquiry penetrate
sink brought farmer peculiar sanctify
Note.—Silent letters may be indicated by drawing an oblique line
through them; thus, eight.
EXERCISE III.-Write the following words, using only as
many letters as are sounded, and indicate the sound by the
proper
letter or character :
love bright earth
aisle
pretty
road guide sleight brought curved
towel letters sought loathe
earnest
plough sadness
people
beauty hautboy
Note to Teacher.-Drill every day in articulation, selecting individual
words for the exercise. Call constant attention to articulation also in the
reading exercise.
CORRECTING ERRORS.—There are several errors of articu-
lation, the most prominent of which may be embraced under
four heads : Common Defects, Peculiar Defects, Stammering,
and Lisping.
Common Defects. The principal ordinary defects in articu-
lation are Feebleness, Omission, and Obscurity.
FIRST: Feebleness arises from the want of a full and forcible
emission of voice, and of due energy in the action of the
organs, particularly the tongue, the teeth, and the lips.
SECOND: Omission is a fault occasioned by undue rapidity,
and sometimes by an inadvertent compliance with incorrect
3

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION AND READING.
ܐܐ ܙܙ
gave 'im " for
custom; as, an' for and, “in 'is ” for “in his,”
“ gave him,” etc.
THIRD: Obscurity is a fault occasioned by the want of pre-
cision and accuracy in the functions of the organs, and a con-
sequent want of definiteness or correctness in the sounds of
letters and syllables; as, shull for shall, silunt for silent.
Some special words, as which, where, when, etc., are often mis-
pronounced by omitting the sound of h; and shrub and shrink
are pronounced srub and srink. Final ing is often abbreviated
to in, as nothing, something, etc., called nothin', somethin', etc.
The word and is badly abused in pronunciation, being often
passed by “with merely an uncourteous nasal salute.” The
terminations ness and less are often changed to niss and liss,
ment to munt, and ow to er, as feller for fellow, piller for pillow,
etc. Words are also marred by the omission of sounds; as,
histry for history, evry for every, reglar for regular, Febuary for
February, etc.
To cure and prevent these defects, train the ear to notice
the error, and the organs to give the correct sound. Drill the
pupils on the words mentioned, and select a list of other sim-
ilar words for drill.
Peculiar Defects.-In pupils accustomed to use the German
language, we find several distinctly marked errors. Thus, they
confound the s and z, calling is, iss instead of iz, his, hiss instead
of hiz, etc. They confound v and w, saying wine for vine, and vine
for wine, etc. They confound s and th, saying wis for with, sin for
thin, thick for sick, etc. They confound ch and j, as jurch for church,
chug for jug, Chon for John, etc. They confound d and t, as “town
the hill,” for “ down the hill,” and “I can't to it” for “I can't do
it.” They confound d and th, as den for then; and even b and p,
as bray for pray and prick for brick.
In some localities there is a tendency to add the sound of r to
words ending with the Italian a; as, idear, arear, etc. There is
also an inclination to omit the sound of r at the end of words; as,
watah for water, daughtah for daughter; and to omit or soften the r
in other places; as New Yawk for New York, etc. This peculiarity
reminds one of the tendency of the English to misuse the h.

27
How to Correct.—To overcome these bad habits, two things
are suggested.
FIRST: The pupil should perceive that he makes the mis-
take; the ear must learn to detect the difference of the sounds,
and to notice when the mistake is made.
SECOND: Notice the position of the organs in making the
correct sound, and drill upon it until it can be made at will.
Give unremitting attention to it until the old habit is extinct
and the new one is acquired.
Stammering - Stammering is a hindered or obstructed utter-
ance of words. It is due to various causes, which should be
understood, in order to overcome it. A few suggestions will
be made for the cure of this defect.
FIRST: Stammering is sometimes the result of some pecu-
liarity of the vocal organs, and can be cured by speaking with
a marble or pebble in the mouth. Demosthenes is said to have
overcome a defect in enunciation by declaiming with pebbles
in his mouth.
SECOND: Stammering is sometimes the result of rapid and
heedless talking. It is frequently caused by an exuberance
of feeling, as persons often stammer when excited or angry.
In these cases, care to speak slowly and with deliberation will
be sufficient to overcome the habit.
THIRD: Sometimes stammering is due to timidity, in which
case the student should endeavor to acquire confidence in him-
self and feel at ease. Cases have been known, too, in which
it is merely a habit acquired by association with companions
who stammer.
FOURTH: More frequently, stammering arises from some
peculiarity of the nervous system, either natural or the result
of disease. The great remedy in such cases is speaking
slowly. Persons have been cured by practising talking “to
time,” beating time with the finger and speaking their words
at measured intervals. The nervous system seems to respond
to the rhythmical movement, as is seen in the fact that people
who stammer when they talk or read, will not stammer in

:
singing. For the same reason, it will be found that persons
who stammer read poetry more easily than prose.
FIFTH: Another suggestion is, that the pupil accustom
himself to a clear idea of what he is to say before he begins
to speak. Deliberation and confidence are essential elements
of a cure in nearly every case. With care the most inveterate
cases of stammering can usually be cured, if the teacher will
persevere in the attempt, and is able to secure the assistance
of the pupil.
Lisping. --Lisping is mainly the use of the sound th for 8.
It is a habit found more frequently among girls, as stammer-
ing is more frequent among boys. In order to cure it, the first
requisite is to understand its cause.
FIRST: Lisping is sometimes a mere affectation of speaking,
by girls who think “it sounds nice.” In most cases it can be
cured by the pupil's noticing how it mars the speech, and
especially if subject to a little judicious ridicule.
SECOND: Lisping is more frequently a natural defect of
utterance, caused by some peculiarity of the organs of speech.
Occasionally it is due to the tongue being a little large or
a little too long. A person will sometimes lisp, also, when the
front teeth are very large or very prominent. To correct the
habit in these cases, the pupil must first be careful to notice
the defect in his articulation ; a person sometimes lisps and is
not aware of it. The pupil must then notice the positions of
the organs in making the sound of 8 and the sound of th, and
practise these two sounds, and also words containing the sound
of s, until they can be correctly given. It often requires per-
sistent effort to overcome this defect, but it should be continued
until cured.
Notes.—1. If the teacher has pupils with these faults, drill, drill, DRILL
on words containing the erroneous sounds, until the faults are corrected.
For Exercises, see page 91.
2. Those who wish to pursue the subject of articulation further are re-
ferred to Webster's and Worcester's dictionaries.

ACCENT.
29
II. ACCENT.
Accent is a stress of voice upon one or more syllables of a
word. The term is derived from ad, to, and cantus, a song.
Importance. -Accent gives a musical element to speech, and
beauty and harmony to utterance. It is the basis of verse in
the English language. The ancient languages distinguished
syllables by quantity; that is, by long and short syllables.
The French language is so nearly deficient in accent that
blank verse is impossible in French literature.
Kinds of Accent.-Accent is of two kinds; Primary and
Secondary. This distinction can exist only in words of more
than two syllables.
Primary Accent is the stronger accent in pronouncing words.
Secondary Accent is the weaker or slighter accent in pronounc-
ing words. The difference can be noticed in such words as
in'terest'ing, mer' cena'ry, etc.
In some words the secondary accent is almost as strong as the
primary accent; as, vi'olin', car'avan', ar'tisan', etc. Some words
have two secondary accents; as, antipestilential and incomprehensi-
bility. The word amen has both syllables very nearly equally ac-
cented; and many compound words have a slight secondary ac-
cent; as gainsay, lighthouse, etc.
The primary and secondary accents are, in many cases, so nearly
equal that they frequently become exchanged. Many words, such
as ar'tisan, rev'erie, in'valid, etc., have transferred the primary ac-
cent from the last to the first syllable.
Principles of Accent.—Accent is determined by custom, or
good usage. This custom is represented by our standard dic-
tionaries, which are thus our standard for accent. There are,
however, a few general principles which seem to control this
usage.
1. Words of more than one syllable have one accented syllable,
and most polysyllabic words have a primary and secondary accent.
2. In dissyllables there is a tendency to accent nouns and adjec-
tives on the first syllable, and verbs on the second syllable; as,
con'vert and convert'; pro'test and protest'.

same
3. In words of more than two syllables, there is a tendency to
place the primary accent on the antepenult; as, eloquent, ac'cident,
opportu'nity, etc.
4. Derivative words take, for a time, if not permanently, the
accent of the original words from which they are formed. The
also true of words derived from other English words by
adding one or more syllables to their beginning or end; as, im-
prop'er from prop'er, pleas'antly from pleas'ant, etc.
5. Ease of utterance has some influence in deciding the place
of accent; thus, accept'able was formerly ac'ceptable, uten'sil was
U'tensil, etc.
6. When two words, which differ only or principally in one of
their syllables, are used antithetically, the primary accent is
placed on that syllable; as, “He must increase, but I must de-
crease.”
The accent of the numerals is peculiar. In counting, we say,
thir'teen, four'teen, fif'teen, etc.; but in answering a question, as,
“How many dollars did it cost?” we should answer, “Sixteen'."
When emphatic, the accent is almost evenly divided; as, “We
had to pay fourteen dollars for a pair of boots!”
Note. We cannot depend much on these principles, however, but must
follow good custom or be guided by the standard dictionary.
LESSONS ON ACCENT.
Method.—In learning accent, the pupils should drill on suit-
able exercises, and carefully correct all errors.
EXERCISES.-Drill carefully on the accent of words similar
to the following:
adult contrary vehement composite legislature
adept aspirant illustrate expletive allopathist
basalt caloric allopathy morale irrevocable
construe contumely precedence rationale apotheosis
extant excretory contumacy comparable irrefragable
CORRECTING ERRORS.—The errors of accent are numerous,
and should be carefully corrected.
1. The student will carefully notice his mistakes in accent, make
a list of such errors, and drill upon them until he has fixed the
correct accent in his mind.


## p. 31 (#49) ##############################################

LESSONS ON ACCENT.

2. There should be a frequent drill on words which are usually
accented incorrectly. The following words will suggest a list, te
which additions can be made by teachers or students :
idea
inquiry reparable condolence Phenice
complex opponent refutable composite Philippi
compound integral Coliseum misconstrue Delilah
lyceum enervate disputant bitumen Sardanapalus
3. Recitations, now and then, as often as once a week, in the
pronunciation of words, will be of great benefit to pupils. There
may be “Pronouncing Matches” as well as “Spelling Matches,”
and they will be found of great value.

CHAPTER II.
MODULATION.
Modulation has reference to the variations of the voice in
reading and speaking.
It includes four things; Quantity, Quality, Compass, and
Time. Each of these will be considered in detail.
I. QUANTITY.
Quantity has reference to the volume of voice. It includes
Force, Emphasis, Stress, and Slur.
-
I. Force.-Force is the quantity of voice used in reading
and speaking. It is quantity as applied to vocal delivery.
Kinds of Force.—There are three kinds of force; Soft, Mod-
erate, and Loud. Moderate Force is the ordinary force of the
voice in reading and speaking.
Soft Force is less than the ordinary quantity. Loud Force is
more than the ordinary quantity. We also speak of Very Soft
and Very Loud Force. These divisions denote not absolute,
but merely relative degrees of force.
Notation.-The various degrees of force may be thus repre-
sented.

EXERCISES.— The exercises include three things: 1. Drill
on the elementary sounds; 2. Drill on sentences; 3. Physical
Exercises.
FIRST.—The pupils should have the following drill on the
Vocals.
1. Repeat the vocals with moderate force; with loud force;
with soft force.
2. Beginning with moderate force, increase the force gradu-
ally to the limit of loudness, then pass gradually back to the
moderate tones.
3. Begin very softly and pass to very loud, and then back
to very soft.
4. Begin also very loud, pass to very soft, and then back to
very loud.
5. Give the same exercise also on individual words. Thus;
all, art, dare, march, hurrah, etc.
6. Strike at once different degrees of force on vocals or in-
dividual words, varying from whispering to shouting.
7. Make these changes without varying the pitch; and also
by allowing the pitch to vary naturally.
SECOND.—The pupils should drill on appropriate sentences.
1. Repeat sentences passing gradually from soft to loud and
back, and vice versa. Thus,
"
“To arms! they come! the Greek, the Greek!”-Halleck.
"The war is inevitable; and let it come. I repeat it, sir, let it
come.”—Patrick Henry.
“Were I an American, as I am an Englishman, while a foreign
troop was landed in my country, I would never lay down my arms
-never! never! never!”-Chatham.
2. Drill also on sentences demanding variety of force, re-
quiring the pupil to give correct force. Thus,
“Hark! I hear the bugles of the enemy! Our only safety
is in the screen of the hedge. Keep close to it; be silent; and
stoop as you run. For the boats ! FORWARD!”
Note.-For Exercises on Force, see page 93.

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION AND READING.
THIRD.—When the voice is weak through a lack of physical
strength, the pupil should take a course in gymnastics.
The weak voices of many clergymen could be cured on the
base-ball ground or in the gymnasium. All public speakers
should take special pains to secure and preserve a strong consti-
tution.
PRINCIPLE.—We determine the standard force by the gen-
eral nature of the composition.
1. If the sentiment is unemotional, the standard force is
moderate.
2. If the sentiment it bold, noble, dignified, etc., the stand-
ard force is loud.
3. If the sentiment is grave, subdued, pathetic, etc., the
standard force is soft.
Loud. “How long, 0 Catiline, wilt thou abuse our patience?”
Cicero.
“The quality of mercy is not strained;
Moderate. It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath.”—Merchant of Venice.
Soft. “Look how the floor of heaven.
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold!”
Merchant of Venice.
Language of Force.—Quantity of voice is an important ele-
ment of expression. Each sentiment has its appropriate quantity
of voice; and the quantity, if properly used, will indicate the
sentiment.
Thus joy is expressed by a full tone, sorrow by a subdued tone;
modesty, humility, shame, doubt, mystery, etc., require soft and
subdued tones. Anger declares itself in loud tones, confidence
asserts itself with a full voice, secrecy softens the tone and speaks
with muffled voice or whispered accents.
ERRORS.—There are three general classes of errors ; read-
ing too low, reading too loud, and not adapting the force to
the sentiment.
Too Low.—Many pupils read too softly, or with too little
force. This is especially the case with young ladies. The
admiration of the “low yoice in women, causes some to act
>

35
as if they thought it was unlady-like to read in public so as
to be heard.
To correct the error, seek the cause of it, and act accord-
ingly. If it is caused by timidity, the pupil should try to
acquire confidence. If the result of weakness, the pupil
should take exercise. When caused by affectation, a little
judicious ridicule will cure it. Sometimes it is an unconscious
habit, which can be cured by reading with proper attention.
A pupil who reads too softly may be placed at a distance from
the teacher while reading. To require pupils to read dialogues
standing on opposite sides of the room, or at some convenient
distance from each other, is valuable.
Too Loud.—Some pupils read too loud. This is a common
fault of young boys. Loud reading was formerly regarded as
the best reading, and boys often read almost as loud as they
could shout. Correct this error by noticing how unnatural
and inappropriate it is, and try to adopt a natural method of
expression.
Adaptation. Many readers do not adapt the force to the
sentiment. They read one composition with about the same
force as another, with no thought of the natural relation of
force to sentiment. To correct this error, remember that
reading is natural expression, and that different sentiments
are naturally expressed with different force.
The last word of a sentence should be given with a little extra
force. This makes the sentence more impressive, gives a sugges-
tion of reserved power, and seems an appropriate ending of a
complete thought.
Note.-For Exercises to drill on Force, see page 93.
II. Emphasis.—Emphasis is particular force, applied to one
or more words of a sentence to distinguish them from other
words. Its object is to give prominence and distinction to im-
portant ideas.
Importance.-Emphasis brings out the meaning of an
author, makes his thoughts and sentiments impressive, and

36
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION AND READING.
gives beauty to expression as the play of light and shade gives
beauty to a picture.
Kinds.—There are two kinds of emphasis ; Absolute Em-
phasis and Antithetic Emphasis.
Absolute Emphasis is that which is applied to the prominent
ideas of a sentence without any particular comparison with
other ideas; as,
“Put a ring on his hand, and shoes on his feet; and bring hither
the fatted calf and kill it; and let us eat and be merry.”—Bible.
Antithetic Emphasis is that which is used in comparing or
contrasting ideas; as,
“In reading, be careful to distinguish between a thought and a
feeling-an idea and a sentiment."
“He is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but
also for the sins of the whole world."--Bible.
Note. It should be remarked that in emphasis there is not only more
force, but also more time and longer slides. Thus emphasis embraces three
things; force, time, and slides.
EXERCISES.—The pupils should have a drill on the follow-
ing exercises :
1. Repeat the elementary sounds, emphasizing at regular
intervals.
2. Repeat the following short quotations, placing the em-
phasis properly :
"For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face;
now I know in part; but then shall I know even as I am known.”-
Bible.
3. Read some of the selections under emphasis on page
97.
PRINCIPLES.—The application of emphasis is a matter of
taste and judgment. The following principles will guide the
reader:
Principle 1. Determine, by a careful analysis, the promi-
nent ideas, and give them emphatic force according to their rel-
ative importance.

Our brethren are already in the field. Why stand we here idle ?
What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life
so dear, or peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains
and slavery ? Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course
others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death !”-
Patrick Henry.
Principle 2. Words expressing antithetic or contrasted ideas
should receive antithetic emphasis.
Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give my hand and my
heart to this vote.”— Webster.
“There are two wings by which a man soars above the world-
Sincerity and Purity. The former regards the intention, the latter the
affections; that aspires and aims at a likeness to God; this makes us
really like him.”—Thomas à Kempis.
“The only reward of virtue is virtue; the way to have a friend is
to be one . ... The essence of friendship is entireness, or total mag-
nanimity and trust.”—Emerson.
Principle 3. Words sometimes become emphatic on account
of their association with other words, or on account of similar
grammatical relations.
"For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrongs, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin ?”—Hamlet.
1. Sometimes several words in the same sentence are emphatic
in different degrees, and the force of voice is to be proportioned
to the degree of their importance.
2. An emphatic word repeated in the same sentence, should not
be made emphatic more than once unless used for the purpose of
expressing more strongly the same idea, or when the word has a new
meaning or refers to a different object.
Noty.—The analysis for emphasis is one of the most important points
of Elocution. A fuller analysis will be given near the close of the treatise
on Elocution.
4

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION AND READING.
ERRORS. — The most common errors of emphasis are those
of incorrect emphasis and random emphasis.
1. The reader sometimes misplaces the emphasis because he
mistakes the sense. This error may be corrected by carefully
analyzing the subject and ascertaining the important ideas.
2. The most common error is that of applying the emphasis
at random, without any thought as to the prominent ideas.
This error is often heard in the pulpit, and in the reading of
the Bible and sacred hymns.
3. A common fault in emphasis is the use of the circumflex
on the emphatic word instead of the simple slide. This fault
needs the special care of the pupil, and can be overcome
only by practice and drill.
4. Another fault, often met with, is that of stiff and exces-
sive emphasis, which can be removed by practice, the study of
good models, and the culture of taste.
Note.—The teacher should give strict attention to all these errors, and
drill the pupils until they are corrected.
III. Stress. Stress is force applied to particular parts of
monosyllabic words or syllables. It is an unequal distribution
of voice on a syllable, and gives variety in the expression of
a single word, as emphasis does in the expression of a sentence.
Kinds. There are five kinds of stress; Radical, Vanishing,
Median, Compound, and Thorough. The first two are often
distinguished as Initial and Terminal stress.
1. Radical Stress.—Radical Stress is special force applied to
the first part of a monosyllabic word or syllable. It may be
illustrated by pronouncing the words on, out, up, etc.
Its Use. This stress is the natural language of anger, com-
,
mand, positive assertion, and of energetic sentiment of all kinds.
By it audiences are startled, thrilled, and swayed, and even
brute animals are awed into submission.
EXERCISES.—The student should drill on exercises similar
to the following:
1. Pronounce the vocals with radical stress.


## p. 39 (#57) ##############################################

QUANTITY.
39
666
2. Pronounce the following words with radical stress,-and,
oar, out, up, here, etc.
3. Drill on selections similar to the following:
"Get out!' said the boy, as the dog sprang towards him; 'get
out!!!!
“We will be revenged; revenge; about-seek-burn-fire-
kill-slay! Let not a traitor live!”—Julius Cæsar.
PRINCIPLE.-Radical stress is used in positive assertion, in
expressing a command, in angry ejaculation, and in energetic
expression of all kinds.
The degree of the stress is determined by the intensity of
the feeling to be expressed.
“Pr'y thee, peace:
I dare do all that may become a man;
Who dares do more, is none.”—Macbeth.
ERRORS.—A too frequent use of radical stress gives a per-
son's delivery an appearance of self-assurance, or self-assertion.
Without it, gentle delivery becomes drawling and forcible
delivery bombastic.
2. Median Stress.-Median Stress is special force applied to
the middle of the word or syllable. It may be illustrated in
pronouncing gold, far, leap, etc.
Its Use.—Median Stress gives beauty and expression to de-
livery. It is the natural utterance of thoughtful sentiment,
and is used in expressing dignity, grandeur, solemnity, suppli-
cation, plaintiveness, etc. It gives music to poetry, the spirit
of elevation to sacred composition, and the touch of eloquence
to oratory.
EXERCISES.—The student should drill on exercises similar
to the following:
1. Utter the vocals with median stress.
2. Pronounce the following words with median stress,-lone,
moan, golden days, glorious autumn, etc.
3. Drill on selections similar to the following:

“Like as a father pitieth his children, so the Lord pitieth them
that fear Him."— Bible.
“The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me
to lie down in green pastures; he leadeth me beside the still
waters.” — Bible.
PRINCIPLE.-Median Stress is used in expressing dignity,
—
,
grandeur, solemnity, supplication, plaintiveness, etc.
The degree of the stress is determined by the intensity of
the feeling expressed.
“Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do."— Bible.
“O thou who dry'st the mourner's tear,
How dark this world would be;
If when deceived and wounded here,
We could not fly to Thee.”—Moore.
ERRORS.—An excessive use of median stress leads to what
is called mouthing, often heard on the stage in second-rate
actors. The monotonous chanting, known as the pious tone,
is also the result of using long, loud median stress, and should
be carefully avoided, except now and then in very solemn
utterances.
3. Vanishing Stress.- Vanishing Stress is special force ap-
plied to the latter part of a word or syllable. In it a syllable
begins softly and gradually increases in force till it ends with
an explosive sound.
Its Use. Though not so much an element of dignity as the
median stress, it is nevertheless an essential condition of high-
wrought feeling and impassioned utterance. It often gives to
oratory a manly energy of determined will, and expresses the
elevated purpose and high-wrought sentiment of the orator;
and, for the natural utterance of the elevated emotion and ex-
treme passion of lyric and dramatic poetry, it is indispensable.
EXERCISES.—The pupils should have a drill on exercises
similar to the following:
1. Utter the vocals with vanishing stress.
2. Pronounce the following words with vanishing stress, —
no, fall, postpone, bestow,

3. Let pupils drill on quotations similar to the following:
“Fret, till your proud heart break;
Gò, show your slaves how choleric you are,
And make your
bondmen tremble. Must I budge?”
Julius Cæsar.
a
PRINCIPLE.—The vanishing stress is used in expressing
earnest purpose, determination, stern rebuke, contempt, as-
tonishment, horror, etc.
The degree of the stress is determined by the intensity of
the feeling expressed.
“ – Down soothless insulter! I trust not the tale :
For never shall Albion a destiny meet
So black with dishonor, so foul with retreat.”—Campbeli.
ERRORS.-If vanishing stress is used excessively it gives
an appearance of willfulness to delivery, and thus deprives it
of that persuasive quality that appeals to the sympathy of an
audience.
4. Compound Stress.- Compound Stress is a combination of
the radical and vanishing stress. It is special force applied on
the first and last part of a word, as may be illustrated in the
sarcastic utterance of yes.
Its Use.-Compound stress is not an agreeable form of
stress, and should be used only on those rare occasions which
especially require it.
EXERCISES.— The pupils should have a drill on exercises
similar to the following:
1. Repeat the vocals with compound stress.
2. Repeat the following words with compound stress, -yes,
cowards, traitors, etc.
3. Drill on the following and similar selections:
“You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
cruel men of Rome!” – Julius Cæsar.
O you
hard hearts ! you
PRINCIPLE.—Compound stress is used in expressing surprise,
4*


## p. 42 (#60) ##############################################

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION AND READING.
sarcasm, mockery, in Irish brogue, in snappish sentiments, etc.
The degree of the stress is determined by the sentiment ex-
pressed
“Gone to be married! Gone to swear a peace!
False blood to false blood joined! Gone to be friends!
Shall Louis have Blanche, and Blanche these provinces ? ?”
King John.
ERRORS.—When compound stress is used to excess, it
makes delivery appear strained and snappish, and the em-
phasis exaggerated or overdone.
5. Thorough Stress.-Thorough Stress is stress running
through the entire word or syllable. It is sometimes described
as a combination of radical, median, and vanishing stress; but
it is more nearly a very strong form of median stress.
Its Use.—When judiciously employed, it is often a powerful
weapon of oratory, but when indiscriminately used it destroys
the
grace and delicacy of utterance, and becomes mere mouth-
ing or ranting, and excites feelings of ridicule and disgust.
EXERCISES.— The pupils should have a drill on the follow-
ing and similar exercises :
1. Utter the vocals with thorough stress.
2. Pronounce the following words with thorough stress,
will, shall, never, march forward, etc.
3. Apply thorough stress to selections like the following:
"Charge, Chester, charge! on, Stanley, on!
Were the last words of Marmion.”-Scott.
PRINCIPLE.—Thorough stress is used in expressing forcible
sentiments, lofty command, denunciation, bravado, and in ex-
aggerated and mock-heroic sentiment.
"If men, when Wrong beats down the Right,
Would strike together and restore it;
If Right made Might in every fight,
The world would be the better for it.”—Cobb.
ERRORS.—When thorough stress is used to excess it de-
stroys the grace and delicacy of utterance, imparts a disa-
a

greeable mannerism to delivery that indicates rudeness and
vulgarity. It gives us mouthing and ranting in their worst
forms.
Notation.-Elocutionists often indicate stress by a notation,
which may be conveniently used with a blackboard exercise.

Note.-For further Exercises in Stress, see page 99.
IV. Slur.-Slur is a smooth, subdued, gliding movement of
the voice, applied to the less important parts of a discourse.
It is generally used in what are called parenthetical passages.
EXERCISES. -For a drill on slur repeat the following, and
similar selections,
“To my mind,—though I am native here,
And to the manner born,-it is a custom
More honored in the breach, than in the observance."
Hamlet.
PRINCIPLE.—The parts of a sentence connecting emphatic
words are often read with a diminution of force and an increase
of rate. The less important parts of a sentence are often
gently slighted in delivery, the voice gliding smoothly over them,
and thus by contrast, bringing out the emphatic words.

Is the immediate jewel of their souls.
Who steals my purse, steals trash ; 't is something, nothing;
'T was mine, 't is his, and has been slave to thousands;
But he who filches from me my good name,
Robs me of that which not enriches him,
And makes me poor indeed.”—Shakespeare.

II. QUALITY.
The Quality of the voice has reference to the kind of tone
used in reading or speaking.
Importance. -Quality of voice is one of the most important
elements of reading. The tone itself, independent of the words,
is expressive of thought and feeling. Tone is the language
of the heart; a pure, sweet voice will cast a charm around the
dullest composition. The soul can be thrilled by the utterance
of melodious and varied sounds; and an audience may be held
in breathless attention by the intonations of a rich and culti-
vated voice.
Kinds of Voice. The different kinds or qualities of tone
are Pure, Orotund, Tremulous, Aspirated, Guttural, and Falsetto.
These vary in different persons according to the natural quality
of the voice; yet they represent distinct characteristics of the
voice of each individual.
Pure Tone.—Pure Tone is a pure, clear, smooth, round tone
of voice. It is the ordinary tone of a good, natural, or well-
trained voice. All the breath is vocalized, and the tone is
produced by very slight resonance in the head.
EXERCISES.—Drill on the following exercises to cultivate
pure tone:
1. Sing the scale ascending and descending, with a medium
stress on each note.
2. Repeat the vocals in the ordinary tone of the voice used
in conversation.
PRINCIPLE.—Pure tone is used in the natural expression of
all kinds of discourse not strongly emotional.
“How far that little candle throws its beams!
So shines go deed in a naughty world.”
Merchant of Venice.
Oh, my brothers, God exists. There is a soul at the centre of
nature, and over the will of every man, so that none of us can

Orotund.- Orotund is a full, deep, round, chest tone of voice.

It is produced by a greater resonance in the head and chest,
and requires a depression of the larynx, an opening of the
throat, extension of the mouth, and expansion of the chest.
Kinds.—Orotund quality admits of three degrees; Effusive,
Expulsive, and Explosive.
Effusive Orotund is used in the utterance of sentiments of
solemnity and pathos, when mingled with grandeur and sub-
limity. It is also the appropriate tone of reverence and adora-
tion.
Expulsive Orotund belongs to earnest and vehement declama-
tion, to impassioned emotion, and to any sentiment uttered in
the form of shouting.
Explosive Orotund is the language of intense passion. It is
heard when the violence of the emotion seems to pass beyond
the control of the will, as in a sudden ecstasy of terror or
anger.
EXERCISES.—Drill on exercises similar to the following to
cultivate the orotund voice.
1. Pronounce long o with loud force in a low key, with the
vocal organs expanded.
2. Repeat the vocals with loud force on a low key, with the
vocal organs expanded.
PRINCIPLE.—The orotund is used in oratory, in epic and
dramatic poetry, in the expression of sentiments of grandeur
and sublimity, in reverence, adoration, etc. The kind of oro-
tund is determined by the sentiment, as previously explained.
Efusive “O earth, so full of dreary noises !
Orotund. O men, with wailing in your voices!”—Mrs. Browning.
"The war is actually begun! The next gale that

sweeps from the North will bring to our ears the clash
of resounding arms!”- Patrick Henry.
Explosive “Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead! –
Orotund. Run hence! proclaim, cry it about the streets!"
Julius Cæsar.
Tremulous Tone. — Tremulous Tone is a vibratory tone of

-
voice. It consists of a slight variation of the pitch of the
voice in the utterance of a word.
Its Use.- A slight tremor often adds a charm to utterance,
as the tremulo in singing and violin playing does to music. It
should be used with discretion, however, for when it is over-
done it savors of affectation. Dropping in now and then un-
expectedly on expressive or tender words, it produces a very
fine effect.
EXERCISES.—To cultivate the tremulous tone, drill on exer-
cises similar to the following:
1. Repeat the vocals with tremulous voice.
2. Repeat individual words, as 0, ah, father, etc., with trem-
ulous movement.
PRINCIPLE.—The tremulous tone is used in expressing
pathetic sentiment, in grief, pity, sympathy, tenderness, etc.,
in suppressed excitement, in the trembling tones of old age,
and occasionally in the exuberance of joy.
“St. Agnes Eve-Ah, bitter chill it was !
The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold.”—Keats.
Pity the sorrows of a poor old man,
Whose trembling limbs have borne him to your door!”
Aspirated Tone.- Aspirated Tone is a whispered articulation,
or a speaking by articulating the breath instead of the voice.
Its Use. It indicates intensity of feeling, as if behind the
tone there is a suppression of strong emotion. Scorn, contempt,
rage, etc., are usually expressed with the aspirated tone, as if
the intensity of feeling seemed to choke or destroy the power
of vocal utterance. It sometimes imparts an air of mystery
to a subject, and is thus the natural expression of wonder, fear,
etc., where the voice seems awed into silence.
EXERCISES.—To cultivate the aspirated tone, drill on exer-
cises like the following:
1. Utter the aspirates; utter the vocals in whispers.
2. Repeat appropriate words and sentences in whispers.
3. Keep the throat open; and make use of the waist-muscles
in breathing, uttering words in aspiration.

47
PRINCIPLE.—The aspirated tone may be used in expressing
secrecy, mystery, fear, apprehension, scorn, contempt, rage, etc.
It may also be used, in connection with other qualities of voice,
to intensify the feeling expressed.
“While throng'd the citize with terror dumb,
Or whispering with white lips,—The foe! they come! they
come!”—Byron.
“Angels and ministers of grace defend us !
Be thou a spirit of health, or goblin damn’d,
Bring with thee airs from heaven, or blasts from hell.”
Hamlet.
“Mac.-I've done the deed! Didst thou not hear a noise ?
L. Mac.-I heard the owl scream and the cricket cry.
Did not you speak ?”
Macbeth.
The Guttural.—The Guttural is a deep throat tone of voice.
It is a depth of utterance so low as to pass beyond the range
of pure tone.
EXERCISES.—To become familiar with the guttural tone,
drill on the following exercises :
1. Utter the throat consonants; as, 9
and k.
2. Utter the vocals with guttural tone.
3. Utter suitable words with guttural tone; as, go, dog, rogue,
cursed, grudge, etc.
PRINCIPLE.—The guttural tone is used in expressing hatred,
contempt, loathing, defiance, etc.
“I'll have my bond: I will not hear thee speak:
I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.”
Merchant of Venice.
“How like a fawning publican he looks!
I hate him, for he is a Christian.”—Merchant of Venice.
The Falsetto.—The Falsetto is that peculiar tone heard in
the higher degrees of pitch after the natural voice breaks or
apparently transcends its range.
PRINCIPLE.-The falsetto is used in the expression of ex-
treme surprise, in the emphatic scream of terror or pain, and
by gentlemen in imitating female voices.

Notes.—1. Some elocutionists speak of the Pectoral quality of voice, the
result of a relaxed condition of the vocal organs. It is used in the expres-
sion of remorse, horror, etc. There is also a nasal tone appropriate in
Yankee dialect.
2. For further drill on Quality of Voice, see page 102.
III. PITCH OR COMPASS.
Pitch has reference to the highness and lowness of the voice
in reading or speaking. The range of the voice between its
highest and lowest limits is its compass.
Intervals.—The distance between any two tones of the
musical scale is called an Interval. The distance between any
two successive tones is called a second. The intervals between
the third and fourth, and seventh and eighth, of the musical scale
are minor seconds; the other seconds are major seconds.
The distance from one to three is called a third, from one to
four a fourth, etc. A third, which consists of two major seconds,
is called a major third; a third of one major and one minor
second is called a minor third.
Concrete and Discrete.—The voice may skip from any one
tone of the scale to another, as in singing; or it may slide from
one degree to another, as in speaking. The former is called a
discrete interval, the latter a concrete interval.
а
a
In the concrete interval, the voice rises concretely through the
different intervals, as in sliding the finger on a violin-string. The
discrete interval steps, as it were, from one tone to another, like
the tones of the piano or flute. The former, figuratively speak-
ing, is a rising or falling stream of voice; the latter is a voiceless
space.
The pitch on which a word begins is called the radical pitch;

PITCH OR COMPASS.
49
the pitch at which the voice arrives by a concrete or discrete
movement, is called its concrete or discrete pitch.
Divisions. The subject of Pitch embraces three things;
Key-note, Slides, and Melody.
-
a
I. Key-note.-Key-note, in Elocution, is the standard pitch
of the voice in reading and speaking. Every sentence or
paragraph usually requires some particular pitch which is most
appropriate to the sentiment expressed.
Kinds of Pitch.—There are usually three degrees of pitch
named; Medium, High, and Low. These are not absolute, but
merely relative, degrees of pitch.
Different voices differ naturally in pitch, and what is medium
to one voice may be high or low to another; and the medium
pitch of any voice will range through several notes.
Women's voices are an octave higher than men's voices.
Women's voices are of two general classes ; Soprano, a high female
voice, and Alto, a low female voice. There is also a voice some-
times met with between these two, called Contralto. The soprano
is the finest voice for singing; but the alto and contralto voices
are usually the most effective in reading.
Men's voices are also of two general classes; Tenor and Bass.
Tenor is a high male voice; Base is a low, deep male voice.
There is also a voice intermediate between these, called Baritone.
The bass voice is the most impressive in reading and speaking,
and is especially adapted to solemn and grave delivery, as in read-
ing the church service, etc. The tenor is capable of more variety,
and, while less impressive than the bass voice, is less tiresome to
the listener. The baritone is often less musical than either of the
others, and less serviceable either in reading or speaking, though
a rich and flexible baritone is the best of all voices for oratory.
EXERCISES.—The pupils should drill carefully on the fol-
lowing exercises :
1. Practice the musical scale ascending and descending.
2. Give the vocals on different degrees of the scale,—ascend-
ing, descending, and by skips.
3. Repeat sentences on different degrees of the scale; read
a paragraph in different pitch.

PRINCIPLE.—There is a natural relation between the pitch
of the voice and the emotions of the heart, from which we can
derive a principle for the standard pitch.
1. If the sentiment is unemotional, the standard pitch is
medium.
2. If the sentiment is animated, joyous or pathetic, the
standard pitch is high.
3. If the sentiment is noble, grave, or dignified, the stand-
ard pitch is low.
“On with the dance! let joy be unconfined;
High
No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet
pitch.
To chase the glowing hours with flying feet.”—Byron.
Slowly comes a hungry people, as a lion, creeping nigher,
Low
Glares at one that nods and winks behind a slowly-
pitch.
dying fire.”
Tennyson.
Moderate “He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan-
pitch. Without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown.”
Byron.
ERRORS.—There are several errors in pitch which should
be carefully guarded against.
Too High.—Many readers pitch their voices too high ; this
is especially the case with young persons of a joyous and lively
temperament. Many public speakers speak in too high a key,
and a large number of persons do so in ordinary conversation.
This is a serious fault, for a high pitch is not only unpleasant
to the cultivated ear, but it is totally inadequate to the expres-
sion of sentiments of veneration, dignity, or sublimity.
Too Low.—A few readers pitch their voices too low; and
some speakers use a grave and hollow tone of voice, and thus
impart a deep and sepulchral solemnity to all subjects alike.
Not Adapted.-Most readers do not adapt the pitch to the
sentiment, reading all things with about the same degree of
pitch. Thus we sometimes hear a notice of a Sabbath-school
picnic read with as deep a solemnity of tone as would be used
in announcing a funeral sermon.
Mistake Pitch and Force.—Many readers do not discriminate
a


## p. 51 (#69) ##############################################

PITCH OR COMPASS.
51
-
between pitch and force. If told to read lower, they read
more softly, and perhaps pitch the voice on a higher key.
How Correct.—All these errors should be carefully corrected.
The reader should try to adapt the pitch of the voice to the
sentiment expressed. A given pitch, as a key-note, may be
given to those who habitually speak too high or too low.
Some of the ancient orators arranged to have a key-note
sounded near them as they began a new division of their
speech.
II. Slides or Inflections.-Slides or Inflections are variations
of the pitch of the voice on different words and syllables of a
sentence.
In ordinary natural expression, the pitch of the voice varies
in pronouncing nearly every word and syllable of a sentence.
We begin a word on a certain pitch and end it on a lower or
a higher pitch.
In this variation of the pitch, the voice moves concretely on
words and syllables from one degree of pitch to another. Such
variations of the pitch are called slides.
Use of Slides.Slides constitute an essential part of empha-
sis; for in emphasis we have not only more force but longer
slides. They thus give variety, beauty, and impressiveness to
speech, add the charm of melody to our words, and thus render
our utterances more significant to the mind and more pleasing
to the ear.
Kinds of Slides.Slides are of three kinds; Rising Slides,
Falling Slides, and the Circumflex.
The Rising Slide is an upward movement of the voice; it is
often indicated by the acute accent (). The Falling Slide is
a downward movement of the voice; it is often indicated by
the grave accent (\).
The Circumflex is a union of the rising and falling inflection.
It is called Direct when the first movement ascends; Inverted
when the first movement descends. It is said to be Equal when
the two slides are of the same degree; and Unequal when they
are of different degrees. It is called Single when two intervals

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION AND READING.
only are joined ; as (V); and Double, when there are more
than two, as (W).
The Emphatic Slide always begins on the accented syllable of a
word. When this is followed by syllables having a secondary
accent, the slide is continued downward or upward on them. Thus,
“It was an impossibility for me to come.” This is especially
noticeable in the circumflex.
Language of Slides. The falling Inflection denotes decision
and completeness of expression. The voice falls for the purpose
of closing up or completing some idea, or of laying down that
which is finished.
The Rising Inflection denotes hesitation or incompleteness of
expression. The voice rises for the purpose of opening up or
introducing an idea, or for the purpose of holding something up
for consideration.
The Circumflex indicates a kind of double idea, in which
there is a contrast between the idea and the expression. The
voice moves crookedly to show the crookedness of the move-
ment of the mind.
Thus in punning and double entendre, where there is a play on the
double meaning of words; in irony, a kind of double speaking,
which says one thing with the word and another with the voice,
etc. The voice varies between the upward and downward slides
to show the variation of the mind between the two ideas.
Degrees of Slides.Slides are of various degrees, called re-
spectively, Seconds, Thirds, Fourths, etc.
The Second is the rise or fall of the voice between any two
consecutive degrees of the scale. Seconds are both major and
minor; the term second, in reading, is usually applied to the
major second.
The Third is the rise or fall of the voice between three de-
grees of the scale. Thirds are also major, as from the first to
the third of the scale; and minor, as from the sixth to the
eighth of the scale.
The Second.—The Second is the basis of correct and
agree-
able expression. It is more used than any other interval, being

53
appropriate to those parts of discourse which convey the plain
thoughts of the speaker, rather than those which express pas-
sion and excitement. It is the least obtrusive interval of the
scale, and is the symbol of the unexcited sentiment of wisdom
and truth.
The Third.The slide of the Third is used for more earnest
and animated discourse than the Second. The downward Third
expresses considerable feeling, though somewhat subdued and
dignified. In simple narration it is used with the second in
giving emphasis to the emphatic ideas.
The Falling Third is used in affirmative expression; and the
Rising Third in asking questions. It is the sign of interroga-
tion in its most moderate form, and denotes but little earnest-
ness in the inquiry. The Minor Third is used in the emphatic
words of pathetic utterance; as,
“Little Nell is dead. She died last night.
”
The Fifth.—The slide of the Fifth is used for very earnest
and animated discourse. The Downward Fifth is employed in
expressing surprise, admiration, and dignified command. It
indicates strong emotion, but under the influence of the will
and without the excitement of passion.
The Rising Fifth is used for earnest interrogation, or for the
emphatic expression of inquiry or doubt. Very few inquiries
need a longer slide than the fifth. Any larger interval, on
account of the difficulty of managing the voice, generally loses
instead of gaining in force of expression.
The Octave.—The Octave Slide is used for the most earnest
and animated discourse. The Falling Octave expresses the
highest degree of admiration or astonishment, and the most
positive command. Very few pieces of composition require
the octave, and in all ordinary utterances it would seem exag-
gerated and inappropriate.
The Rising Octave expresses the most forcible degree of
interrogation and of emphasis on a rising interval. It is ap-
propriate for the expression of contempt, mirth, railing, and
5*

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION AND READING.
of peevish or indignant argument. When employed in ordi-
nary or moderately earnest discourse, it becomes ludicrous.
Slides on the other degrees of the scale are so seldom used that
they are not described.
EXERCISES.—Drill on slides until they can readily be given
of any kind and degree. Some teachers use the violin in
training the ear and voice in respect to slides.
1. Give the vocals with falling slides; with rising slides ;
with circumflex slides.
2. Give the vocals with rising and falling seconds; thirds ;
fifths; octaves; minor seconds; minor thirds.
3. Repeat a sentence, giving major thirds on the emphatic
words; minor thirds on the emphatic words; fifths; octaves.
Note.-Some teachers and pupils will be aided in giving the minor third
slides by thinking of the interval of the musical scale from do to la de-
scending, that is, from the eighth to the sixth of the scale.
Nature of Ideas.-In order to establish a principle for
slides, we divide emphatic ideas into two general classes, -Com-
plete Ideas and Incomplete Ideas.
Complete Ideas are those used in making a complete or defi-
nite statement, as in affirming or denying, or in asking a ques-
tion in a form which seems to affirm the answer. They are
expressions which seem to be complete in themselves.
Incomplete Ideas are those which indicate something unfin-
ished or incomplete, as in asking a question or stating something
anticipative of something else, or in contrast with that which is
expected to be expressed, etc.
The incomplete ideas are those which are in contrast with com-
plete ideas. The former denote something completed and definitely
laid down; the latter indicate something incomplete, unfinished, or
held ир for further consideration. Complete ideas include those
that are conclusive, decisive, positive, affirmative, etc. Incomplete
ideas include those that are anticipative, indecisive, negative, interro-
gative, etc.
Sometimes there seems to be a double idea expressed, the
voice saying one thing and the mind meaning another thing;
>


## p. 55 (#73) ##############################################

PITCH OR COMPASS.
55
>
as in irony, sarcasm, the pun, the double entendre, etc. Such
sentiments are naturally expressed by double slides or by the
circumflex.
Under indirect or double ideas, we include punning and double en-
tendre where there is a play on the double meaning of words; also
irony and sarcasm, in which there is a kind of double speaking,
one thing being said with the words and another thing with the
voice. They include also all insincere expressions; as, jesting,
ridicule, scorn, etc.
PRINCIPLES.—There are several principles to govern the
use of slides, which we now present.
Principle I.—All complete ideas require falling slides. Thus,
“Life is real, life is earnest;
And the grave is not its goal.”—Longfellow.
1. Affirmative expressions usually express complete ideas
and require the falling slide; as,
“Beautiful Evelyn Hope is dead!
sit and watch by her side an hour.”
Robert Browning.
2. Interrogative sentences presented in a positive form, ex-
pressing an affirmation or indicating the certainty of the
answer in the speaker's mind, require the falling slide; as,
“Who then is Paul, and who is Apollos, but ministers by whom
ye believed ?”—Bible.
3. Interrogative sentences beginning with a pronoun or an
adverb, usually require the falling inflection; as,
'Who are they? Where did they come from? When will they
leave us?”
4. Exclamatory expressions are regarded as expressing com-
plete ideas, and require the falling slide; as,
“ Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold.”—Macbeth.
66


## p. 56 (#74) ##############################################

56
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION AND READING.
66
5. A negative expression may express a complete idea, and
should then have the falling slide; as,
* Daily, with souls that cringe and plot,
We Sinais climb, and know it not.”—Lowell.
6. Other cases also embraced under complete ideas are the
following :-expressions of determination, sternness, reproach,
command, defiance, astonishment, indignation, contempt, etc.
Principle II.-All incomplete ideas require the rising slide.
Thus,
“To my mind, though I am native here,
And to the manner born,-it is a custom
More honored in the breach than in the observance."
Hamlet.
1. A simple negative sentence often expresses an incomplete
idea and requires the rising slide; as,
“Touch her not scornfully;
Think of her mournfully.”—Hood.
2. An interrogative sentence presented in doubt about the
answer, or without any spirit of affirmation, is regarded as ex-
pressing an incomplete idea, and requires the rising slide; as,
“Is there, then, no death for a word once spoken ?
Was never a deed but left its token
Written on tables never broken ?"_Whittier.
3. An interrogative sentence beginning with a verb usually
closes with the rising slide; as,
“Would you make men trustworthy? Trust them. Would you
make them trúe? Believe then.”—Robertson.
4. An affirmative sentence which contains the spirit of doubt
or uncertainty is regarded as expressing an incomplete idea,
and requires the rising slide; as,
“I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honorable men.” - Julius Cæsar.


## p. 57 (#75) ##############################################

PITCH OR COMPASS.
57
5. Other cases also embraced under incomplete ideas are the
following a suspension of the sense; a concession; an expres-
:
sion of weakness, indecision, indifference, surprise, uncertainty,
etc.
Principle III.- Contrasted sertences, or words expressing
contrasted ideas, require contrasted slides, the more important
member (generally the second) requiring the falling slide.
"It is sown in corruption, it is raised in incorruption; it is sown
in dishonor, it is raised in glory; it is sown in weakness, it is raised
in power; it is sown a natural body, it is raised a spiritual body."
Bible,
1.—The idea of complete and incomplete, of positive and neg-
ative, of dependent and independent, control in contrasted words;
as,
“ Through the shadow of the globe we sweep into the younger
day;
Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay."
Tennyson.
Principle IV. Sometimes the voice neither rises nor falle
on an emphatic word, the mind seeming to be in a condition of
suspense.
"To die,-to sleep:
To sleep! Perchance to dream.”—Hamlet.
Principle V.-All indirect, or double, or crooked ideas,
-as
jesting, irony, sarcasm, ridicule, mockery, etc., -require cir-
cumflex slides.
“Cry aloud : for he is a god; either he is talking, or he is
pursuing, or he is in a journey; or peradventure he sleepeth and
must be awaked."— Bible.
1. When there is an idea of incompleteness or subordina-
tion, the circumflex bends upwards: when there is a spirit of
completeness, independence, etc., the circumflex bends down
ward.

Principle VI.-The length of the slide is determined by the
nature of the sentiment. Unemotional sentiments have mod-
erate slides; bold, noble, dignified sentiments have long
slides; joyous, animated sentiments have short slides.
These principles of slides will aid the reader in many cases, but
the slide is largely subject to the demand of variety, melody, and
the relation of the different parts of the sentiment to be expressed.
Note.-For a further Exercise on Slides, see page 114.
A Series.—A series is a list of particulars expressed by sim-
ple words, or by phrases or clauses, following each other in
regular succession. The series which begins a thought is called
a commencing series ; a series which completes the thought is
called a concluding series.
PRINCIPLE.—In reading a series, the principle of complete
and incomplete ideas will enable us to give the slides correctly.
a

1. In a commencing series, the last member generally closes
with the rising inflection, and the others with the falling.
2. In a concluding series, the next to the last generally closes
with the rising, and the others with the falling inflection.
“And now abideth faith, hope, charity ; these three; but the
greatest of these is charity.”—Bible.
“The painful service,
The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood,
Shed for my thankless country, are requited
But with that surname."- Coriolanus.
A Series of Series is a list of series, or it is the recurrence of
expressions which in themselves contain a series; as,
“To eat and drink and sleep; to be exposed to the darkness and
the light; to pace round in the circle of habit, and turn the wheel
of wealth; to make reason our bookkeeper and turn thought into
an implement of trade,—this is not life.-Martineau.
III. Melody.-Melody, in reading, is an agreeable variation
of the pitch of the voice on and between the successive words
and syllables of a sentence. It is thus a series of simple
sounds so varied in pitch as to produce a pleasing effect on
а
3
the ear.
-
It will be noticed that in natural expression there is a difference
of pitch between words and syllables as well as on them. The pitch
at which any word begins is usually a little lower or higher than
the pitch at which the previous word ends. This variation, as well
as the variation of pitch on the words, is included under the term
melody. When the variation of pitch in a word is greater than a
second, it is called a slide.
Object.—The object of melody is to give beauty and variety
to reading. It is the musical element of speech; it imparts a
grace and charm to utterance, and prevents the wearisome effect
of the monotone. It also enables the voice to rise or fall grad-
ually on the unemphatic words, that it may have an opportu-
nity for longer slides on the emphatic words.
Kinds of Melody.—There are two kinds of melody; Diatonic
and Semitonic melody.


## p. 60 (#78) ##############################################

60
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION AND READING.
Diatonic Melody is a variation of a major second on and
between successive words and syllables. Semitonic Melody is a
variation of a minor second on and between successive words
and syllables.
The absence of melody produces Monotone. Monotone is a
sameness of pitch on and between successive words and sylla-
bles. Monotone may also be given when there is a slight
variation between the words, but not on them.
Use of Melody.--Diatonic melody is used for the expression
of all sentiments except the very pathetic or sublime. It in-
dicates manly confidence and the self-reliance of truth.
Semitonic melody is used in very pathetic discourse. It ex-
presses complaint, pity, grief, plaintive supplication, and the
like. A misuse of the semitone leads to what is called whining.
It is difficult to give semitonic melody with artistic effect; and
when overdone it awakens feelings of the ludicrous.
The Monotone is appropriate to the expression of grandeur
of thought and sublimity of feeling. It is also used in ex-
pressing fear, vastness, majesty, power, etc., sentiments which
seem to partially obstruct or overawe the powers of utterance.
When properly employed the reading will possess a solemnity,
dignity, and grandeur in harmony with the sentiment ex-
pressed, and the effect produced will be deep and impressive.
EXERCISES.—The pupils should drill on exercises similar
to the following:
1. Utter the vocals in monotone.
2. Utter the vocals without any change of pitch on them,
but with a difference of a major second between them, ascending
and descending.
3. Utter the vocals with a major second slide and a major
second between them.
4. Utter the vocals without any change on them but with a
minor second between them, ascending and descending.
5. Utter the vocals with a minor second slide and a minor
second interval between them.

6. Read the following with diatonic melody and with major
third slides on the emphatic words:
"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
Than are dreamt of in your philosophy.”—Hamlet.
7. Read the following with semitonic melody and minor third
slides on the emphatic words :
“Here's the smell of the blood still. All the perfumes of Arabia
will not sweeten this little hand. Oh! Oh! Oh!”—Lady Macbeth.
8. Read the following in monotone:
“List, list, O list!
If thou didst ever thy dear father love."--Hamlet.
PRINCIPLES.-From the explanation given, we may derive
the following principles for melody:
1. All ordinary sentiment requires diatonic melody; very
pathetic sentiment requires semitonic melody; very grand and
solemn discourse may be given with the monotone.
2. To allow for emphasis requiring falling slides, we should
let the voice gradually ascend in the unemphatic parts of the
discourse, so that it may have room to slide down on the em-
phatic ideas. The melody should descend for the upward slide,
that it may have an opportunity to ascend on the emphatic
word.
Remark.--Sometimes the downward slide is a continuation of
the descending melody, and the upward slide a continuation of
the ascending melody.
The different kinds of melody are often combined in the same
paragraph or sentence. Diatonic and semitonic melody may occur
in the same passage; in many cases the constant use of semitonic
melody would be offensive, while the occasional introduction of
it gives the charm of plaintiveness and tenderness to the expres-
sion.
So also very few passages require the exclusive use of the mono-
tone. In grand and dignified passages, the unemphatic words
are spoken to a great extent on one key, from which the voice
ascends or descends to give the appropriate slide on the emphatic
words.

Cadence.—Melody gives rise to what is called Cadence.
Cadence may be defined as the melody on the closing words
of a sentence.
furt
In natural expression, the completion of a thought is expressed
not only with a pause at the end of the sentence, but usually with
a falling of the voice on the closing words to a lower pitch than
that which prevailed in the body of the sentence.
This closing descent in the tone prevents the abruptness and
irregularity of sound which would be produced by continuing the
prevailing pitch to the close of the sentence. Cadence is thus a
prophecy of a close-it prepares the mind for it, and thus avoids
that surprise which would be at variance with both harmony and
meaning.
Kinds of Cadence.—Two kinds of cadence have been noticed ;
Partial and Complete. Partial Cadence occurs when a distinct.
part of the sentence is finished, though the whole sentence is
not completed. Complete Cadence occurs when a sentence and
its thought are complete.
Illustration. In the following sentence, partial cadence is
heard on the two or three words before the semicolon; com-
plete cadence occurs on the last two or three words of the
sentence:

PRINCIPLE OF CADENCE.—The note to which the cadence
falls, and the space through which it descends, are dependent
on the emotion to be uttered and on the length and complica-
tion of the sentence.
1. In strong emotion the cadence is often both abrupt and
low; as,
!
“Let us do, or die.”-
“He most lives
Who thinks most-feels the noblest—acts the best.”—Bailey.
2. In gentler emotion and longer sentences, the cadence is
gradual and moderate; as,
“How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank.”
Merchant of Venice.
3. In short sentences, where the emotion is slight, the fall is
slight; as,
“Night brings out stars, as sorrow shows us truth.”
Gerald Massey.
4. In long sentences, the fall is more obvious and begins
further from the close; as,
“ 'Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore;
And coming events cast their shadows before.”—Campbell.
ERRORS OF CADENCE.—Some of the more common errors
of cadence are the following:
1. Delaying the fall of the voice till the last word or words of a
sentence, and dropping abruptly from a preceding uniform
pitch. This is a common fault with children before they can
read with ease and freedom; and also with pupils who try to
read what they do not understand.
2. Falling very low on the closing phrase. This fault is often
contracted by reading only grave and formal selections. It is
frequently heard in the pulpit and among young people who
have inadvertently adopted the “ministerial style."
3. A gradual sliding downward from the beginning of a sen-
tence. Some speakers or readers begin a sentence on a high

key and with full force, and then gradually lower the pitch
and diminish the force in the progress of the sentence, until
the tone has nearly died away at its close. This fault is some-
times acquired by attempting to read in too large a room. It
is occasionally heard in the pulpit and on the lecture platform.
4. Using the rising slide on the last word of a sentence. This
is occasionally heard among public speakers, especially in the
pulpit, and is often adopted by young men, who seem to
think it gives beauty and effectiveness to utterance.
and very
IV. TIME.
Time in Reading has reference to the time used in express-
ing thought and sentiment. It includes three things; Move-
ment, Quantity, and Pauses.
I. Movement.--Movement is the rate of the voice in reading
or speaking. There are three degrees of rate; Fast, Slow, and
Moderate. Some writers also make the divisions of very fast
slow.
These divisions, of course, express relative rather than absolute
degrees of time. They vary several degrees for each individual ;
and vary also with different individuals according to the character
of the voice.
Moderate rate is the ordinary rate used in speaking or read-
ing. It denotes self possession, an unexcited state of feeling,
and a complete command over one's mental powers. It is
suitable to unimpassioned language, and is employed in narra-
tions, descriptions, and didactic compositions.
Fast or Rapid Movement is that which is quicker than mod-
erate rate. It indicates some mental excitement; and is char-
acteristic of gay, exhilarated, and joyful feelings. It is used
,
in giving utterance to all playful, humorous, and mirthful
sentiment, in excited argument, and also in expressing indigna-
tion and fear. Very quick or rapid movement is expressive of
haste, alarm, confusion, and extreme terror.
Slow Movement is a slower rate than moderate. It is sug-
a

65
gestive of repose, grandeur, majesty, vastness, power, and
splendor. It is used in expressing the deeper emotions of
grief, reverence, grandeur, sublimity, etc., and gives dignity
and impressiveness to discourse. Very slow movement is used
in expressing the very strongest and deepest emotions; as, hor-
ror, awe, profound reverence, solemnity, adoration, etc. It is
especially suitable to many parts of the Bible, and to the dis-
cussion of sacred themes.
Time in Emphasis.—Time is used in giving emphasis to words by
prolonging the sound of the vocals. The variation of time in pro-
nouncing words is often called quantity. With respect to the time
of utterance, syllables are of two kinds; long and short. The long
syllables can be easily prolonged when necessary; the short sylla-
ble cannot be prolonged without a drawl.
In emphasis, we not only give more force to the emphatic word
but more time also. The voice lingers on the word that the mind
may dwell upon the idea. This is done by prolonging the vowel
sounds of the words, the time being expended mainly on the ac-
cented syllable.
The increase of time on emphatic words prevents the voice from
ceasing after each emphatic syllable, and gives that continuity of
utterance which is requisite in good delivery.
Time is also required to give variety to expression and prevent
that formality of utterance which falls on the ear with painful
monotony. It enables one to read poetry smoothly and with a
rhythmical flow, and gives to oratory that swelling movement
which is demanded by the utterance of what is noble and digni-
fied.
EXERCISES.—Pupils should drill on suitable exercises so
that they may be able to read rapidly or slowly at pleasure.
The importance of such a drill will be seen in the fact that
it is more difficult to command the rate of reading than one
would naturally suppose.
1. Pronounce the vocals with varied time ;-slow, moderate,
fast, very slow, very fast.
2. Select words and utter them with varied rate; as, all,
gold, might, tune, sorrow, glory, defile, sublimity.
3. Select sentences containing emphatic words and drill
6 *
E

in prolonging the time in their utterance; as, “This was the
noblest Roman of them all."
4. Select sentences and repeat them with varied time; as,
“The glorious achievements of the nineteenth century will
never be forgotten."
PRINCIPLE.—We determine the standard rate by the gen-
eral nature of the sentiment.
1. Unemotional sentiment requires moderate rate; animated,
joyous, and gay sentiment requires fast rate; bold, grave, and
dignified sentiment requires slow rate.
2. Taking the standard rate for the unemphatic ideas, give
additional time to the emphatic ideas according to their rela-
tive importance.
“Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and
have not charity, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling
cymbal."- Bible.
>
ERRORS — There are three principal errors of rate; too fast,
two slow, lack of adaptation.
Too Fast.—Many pupils read too fast, and nearly all young
speakers speak too rapidly in debate and declamation. Rapid
speaking is also a very general fault of extemporaneous
speakers. This fault can be corrected by dwelling on the vowel
sounds of words. Concert reading is a useful exercise with
young pupils, as they naturally read much slower when pro-
nouncing words together.
Too Slow.-A few persons read too slowly, prolonging the
words with a drawl. Such pupils should practice speaking
their words more quickly by shortening the vowel sounds. They
should have lively sentences to read, and should try to impart
vivacity and animation to their style.
Not Adapted.—Nearly all pupils fail to adapt the rate to
the sentiment, reading all kinds of discourse with the same
rate. This fault can be corrected by giving attention to the
relation of rate to sentiment, and by constant and intelligent
drill.

II. Pauses.—Pauses are cessations of the voice in reading
and speaking. They are intervals of time between the utter-
ance of words, sentences, clauses, and paragraphs, which cor-
respond with and mark the divisions of meaning.
Kinds.—There are two kinds of pauses; the Grammatical
and the Rhetorical pause.
The Grammatical Pauses are those which indicate the log-
ical or grammatical relation of the different parts of a discourse.
a
They are represented by the marks of punctuation.
The Rhetorical Pauses are those which are required to bring
out the sense or express the sentiment of a discourse. They are
not marked, but are determined by the sense of the piece and
the judgment of the reader.
Importance. -Pauses are of great importance in reading and
speaking. They are needed both for ease of utterance and em-
phasis, and are thus useful to both the reader and listener.
To the speaker they are required, both for ease of utterance and
for clear and emphatic expression. After uttering a succession of
sounds, containing at least one word which demands a great im-
pulse of the organs, a pause is necessary for breathing.
The rhetorical pause is especially important to the listener. A
proper pause at the end of a sentence rests the mind of the hearer,
and gives it time to dwell a moment upon the idea or sentiment
expressed. A pause after an emphatic word gives the mind an
opportunity to linger upon the idea and receive a full impression
of it. As some one remarks, it gives time for the idea “to soak
in" the mind of the hearer. It is thus true, that “a pause is more
eloquent than words;" and that though "speech is silvern, silence
is golden.”
PRINCIPLE.—The principle of pauses relates both to place
and length. First, the place of the pause is determined by the
relation of ideas, and by the demands of emphasis.
1. A pause is generally made after (occasionally before)
emphatic word; as,
"A judicious silence . . . is always better than truth spoken
without charity.”—Francis de Sales.
2. A pause is required wherever the connection of ideas is

not close, whether marked by grammatical pauses or not; as
in parenthetical expressions, transpositions, ellipses, separate
clauses, etc.
“Be noble! and the nobleness that lies
In other men, . . . sleeping, but never dead,
Will rise in majesty to meet thine own.”—Lowell.
“Neither a borrower nor a lender ... be,
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
And borrowing . dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all, To thine own self be true;
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.”-Hamlet.
Second.--The length of the pause depends on the nature of
the discourse spoken or read.
1. In unemotional composition the pauses are moderate; in
energetic and impassioned utterance the pauses are long; in
strong and excited utterance they are often short and irregular.
2. Awe, solemnity, grandeur, etc., require long pauses, both
at the end of sentences and for emphasis.
"The man of genius dwells with men and with nature; the
man of talent, in his study; but the clever man dances here,
there, and everywhere, like a butterfly in a hurricane, strik-
ing everything and enjoying nothing, but too light to be
dashed to pieces.”—Hazlitt.
A woman's voice can tell a long history of sorrow in a
single word. This wonderful instrument, our voice, alters
its timbre with every note it yields, as the face changes with
every look, until at last the dominant emotion is master,
and gives quality to tone and character to expression.”
Theodore Winthrop.
“O the long and dreary Winter!
O the cold and cruel Winter!

Through the forest, round the village."

READING POETRY.
69
READING POETRY.
Poetry, as defined by Poe, is a rhythmical creation of beauty.
It is the union of speech and music, and is thus the language
of the intellect and the heart.
Prof. Wilson defines poetry as "the intellect colored by the
feelings;" Wordsworth as “the spontaneous overflow of pow-
erful emotions ;” and Milton, as “Thoughts that voluntary move
harmonious numbers.”
Verse.—Poetry is usually written in lines or verses. A Verse
consists of a certain number of accented and unaccented syl-
lables, arranged according to fixed rules.
The term verse is from verto, to turn, because when we have fin-
ished one line we turn back to begin another.
U
U
Poetical Feet.-A Poetical Foot is one of the rhythmical di-
visions of a line of poetry.
Poetical Feet are of two kinds, those consisting of two
syllables, Dissyllabic, and those consisting of three syllables,
Trisyllabic.
Dissyllabic Feet. There are four kinds of feet of two syl-
lables, namely:
Trochee (-u), accented on the first syllable; as, part-ing.
Iambus (u - ), accented on the second syllable; as, con-tent.
Spondee (- -), with both syllables long; as, A-men.
Pyrrhic (u v), with both syllables short; as, pi-ly, in happily.
Trisyllabic Feet. There are eight kinds of feet of three
syllables, namely:
Dactyl (- Uu), accented on the first syllable; as, ten-der-ly.
Anapoest (u U -), accented on the last syllable; as, rep-ar-tee.
Amphibrach (u - u), accented on the second syllable; as, re-
luc-tant.
Tribrach (u u u), with all short; as, it-a-ble, in illimitable.

Poetical Pauses.—The measured character of verse requires
certain pauses not used in prose. These are called Poetical or
Harmonic Pauses.
Kinds.—The Final Pause is a short pause often used at the
end of a line to mark its close. The Cæsural Pause is one
used to divide a line into equal or unequal parts. The Demi-
Cæsural Pause is a short pause which is sometimes used to
divide the parts of a verse already divided by the Cæsura.
These three pauses are represented in the following lines :
“ Diverse | as their varied labors || the rewards | to each that
fall, .
But love | what she loves in others, || evermore | her own
doth call; .
Thus | the several joy of each || becomes the common | joy
of all."
Cardinal Damiani.
The cæsural pauses usually come where there is a rhetorical or
grammatical pause. When no pause is required, either by the
punctuation or the sentiment, the harmonic pause should not be
observed.
a
PRINCIPLE.—Poetry should be read a little more slowly than
prose, with a moderate prolongation of vowel and liquid sounds.
There should be a slight degree of musical utterance, and an
indication of an exactness of time modified by the nature of the
verse and the emotion expressed. The utterance should indicate
the metre, but should never render it prominent.
ERRORS.—The chief errors to be avoided in reading poetry
are the following:

EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
71
1. Too rapid utterance, by which the effect of the verse is
lost to the ear.
2. A plain and dry articulation, which, though it may bring
out the meaning, does not indicate the beauty of the senti-
ments and the rhythm.
3. A mechanical observance of the harmonic
pauses,
without
regard to the meaning.
4. A mouthing and chanting tone, producing the effect of
bombast and mock solemnity.
5. A singing tone, such as is often heard among young pupils.

CHAPTER III.
THE PHYSICAL ELEMENT.
The Physical Element in reading is that which pertains to
the body and its members. It includes four things; Breathing,
Posture, Gesture, and Facial Expression.
Importance.—The physical element is of great importance
in the art of reading. It is, as it were, the addition of visible
language to oral expression, and is thus used to give emphasis
and a deeper impression to the spoken words.
1. BREATHING.
Breathing has reference to the inspiration, expiration, and
proper use of the breath in reading and speaking.
A reader or speaker should know how to breathe correctly.
Many public speakers ruin their voices merely because they do
not know how to breathe. Teachers' voices “give out” often be-
cause they make the muscles of the throat do the work of the
sides and waist. Preachers are on the retired list who might
have preached half a century if they had known how to breathe
properly.
How to BREATHE.—The following suggestions will indicate
the method of breathing :
1. Breathe deeply. Do not breathe merely with the upper
part of the lungs. Let the entire lungs be brought into action.
Breathe all the way down to the waist. Lower the diaphragm;
bring the muscles of the side and back into action ; enlarge
72


## p. 73 (#91) ##############################################

BREATHING.
73
the waist even at the sacrifice of tight clothing and a false
ideal of beauty.
2. Use no more breath than is needed. Very little breath is
vocalized in speaking or reading, as may be seen by holding
a piece of tissue paper, hung by a silken thread, before the
mouth when speaking. The paper will scarcely move.
Let the breath, therefore, be used with economy, to insure ease
and freedom of utterance. There is no need of persons getting
out of breath in reading or speaking; and the puffing and blowing
of some speakers are not only unnecessary, but ridiculous, remind-
ing one of the spouting of a porpoise.
3. Be careful not to mix breath and voice. This is a fault
occasionally met with among young persons and is a serious
fault in delivery.
“Every tone,” says Madame Seiler, “ requires for its greatest pos-
sible perfection only a certain quantity of breath, which cannot
be increased or diminished without injury to its strength in the
one case, and its agreeable sound in the other.” The use of too
much breath mars the beauty of utterance and exhausts the reader.
4. In breathing, the air should be inspired through the nose,
and not through the mouth. A speaker who takes in air through
his mouth will find his throat becoming dry by the evaporation
of the mucus, or natural moisture which lubricates the vocal
organs.
Besides, if there are any irritating particles in the air, they will
produce an irritation and titillation in the throat. Breathing
through the nose is a matter of health. It has been found that
persons who, during sleep, breathe through the mouth instead of
through the nose, are much more liable to malarial diseases than
others.
EXERCISES IN BREATHING.-The following exercises are
designed to give control of the organs of breathing, and im-
part elasticity, strength, and beauty to the voice. They will
be found of great advantage in giving strength to weak lungs,
and vigor and tone to feeble voices.
1. Full Breathing.–Standing in the proper position, draw
7


## p. 74 (#92) ##############################################

74
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION AND READING.
-
in the breath slowly until the chest is fully expanded, and
then emit it with the same degree of slowness. Repeat this
as often as desirable.
2. Audible Effusive Breathing.–Draw in a full breath as
before, and expire it audibly in a prolonged sound of the letter
h. It is called effusive because the breath merely effuses itself
into the surrounding air. It produces a sound something like
the murmur of a sea-shell.
3. Expulsive Breathing.Draw in a full breath and then
emit it with a strong expulsive force, in the sound of the letter
h, as in a moderate and somewhat prolonged "whispered cough."
The breath is thus projected into the air.
4. Explosive Breathing.–Fill the lungs, and then emit the
breath suddenly and forcibly, in the manner of an abrupt
" whispered cough." The breath is thus thrown out with
abrupt force, reminding one of the coughs of a locomotive
when starting a heavy train.
5. Sighing, Gasping, etc.-For an exercise in Sighing, fill
the lungs suddenly with a full breath and expire it as quickly
as possible. For an exercise in Gasping, inflate the lungs
with a convulsive effort, and then expire the breath somewhat
gently. In Panting, breathe quickly and violently, making
the emissions of the breath loud and forcible.
a
II. POSTURE.
Posture has reference to the position of the body and its
members in reading or speaking.
Importance.-The position of the reader is a matter of consid-
erable importance. A person's appearance before an audience
has much to do with the attention with which people listen to
what he says; and, consequently, to the impression it makes
upon their minds.
Learning Posture.—In studying posture the pupil must
rely mainly upon imitation and the correction of errors. Some
suggestions will be made under the two heads of Elements of
Posture and Principles of Posture.


## p. 75 (#93) ##############################################

POSTURE.
75
>
ELEMENTS OF POSTURE.—Posture includes the position of
the feet, the hands, the head, and the body. Directions will be
given under each one of these heads, and suggestions for the
correction of errors.
General Characteristics.—The characteristics of a good at-
titude are firmness, freedom, simplicity, and grace. An over
nicety in respect to position, that attracts attention, is objec-
tionable. The posture should be equally removed from the
awkwardness of the rustic and the affectation of the dancing-
master. It should be natural, free from any bad habits, and
it will thus be both easy and graceful.
The Feet.—The feet should be placed at an angle with each
other, the weight of the body resting on one foot instead of
on both. The foot not sustaining the body should be thrown
slightly forward of the other, in such a position that, if drawn
towards the other, the heel of the former would come into the
hollow of the latter. The weight should be occasionally
changed from one foot to the other, care being taken that the
transition be gently and easily made.
Another position of the feet is that in which the toes are on a
line, the feet being slightly inclined to each other, the toes turned
outward. There are persons with some peculiarity of the shape
of the legs or feet to whom this position is more suitable than the
one previously described. This position is usually more becoming
to short than to tall persons, and is especially suitable to children.
The Errors of position with respect to the feet are as follows:
turning in the toes; crossing the feet or legs; standing with
one foot on a stool or chair-round, etc.; continually changing
the weight of the body from one foot to the other; awkward-
ness in changing the position of the feet; etc.
The Hands.—The hands should hang naturally and easily
down at the side, except when they are being used for gestures.
The fingers should be slightly bent and just touch one another,
and the thumb should be parallel with the fingers.
Gentlemen sometimes place one hand on the waist, supported
by the vest, or buttoned coat, or watch-chain; and ladies often read

and recite with one or both hands at the front of the waist. These
positions are perhaps not very objectionable, but are regarded as
less elegant than when the hands are at the side. When a book
is used in reading, it should be generally held in the left hand, so
that the right is free to turn the leaf.
as
if a person
The Errors of the position of the hands are those of place
and form. The errors of place are,-putting the hands in the
pockets, placing them on the hips, playing with a button or
the watch-guard or any portion of the dress, frequent changes,
did not know what to do with the hands, etc.
The errors of form are,--spreading the fingers, closing the
fingers too tightly, sticking out the thumb, straightening the
hand, closing the hand into a fist, etc. The reader will en-
deavor to secure a natural, easy, and graceful position of the
hands.
The Head.—The head gives the chief grace to the person,
and is an important element in delivery. The position of the
head should be erect and natural.
The Errors to avoid are as follows: it should not droop,
which indicates humility or diffidence; nor be thrown back,
which indicates arrogance and pride; nor be inclined to one
side, which indicates languor, indifference, or clownishness ; nor
be held too stiff, which indicates a lack of care and self-pos-
session.
The Body.—The position of the body should be erect, easy,
and natural, with the breast fully fronting the audience. The
shoulders should be thrown gently back, so as to give the fullest
freedom and capacity to the organs of the chest.
The Errors to be avoided are,—leaning forward or backward,
leaning to one side, standing too rigidly erect, rounding the
shoulders, making one shoulder higher than another, standing
with the side partly to the audience, etc.
PRINCIPLES OF POSTURE.—There is a natural language in
posture, a language common to all times and races. Every
position of the body and its members has its peculiar signifi-
a

cance.
This natural language is the basis of the principles to
guide us in adapting the posture to the sentiment.
The Head, held up, denotes pride or courage; hung down, denotes
shame or grief; to nod it forward, implies assent; to toss it back,
means dissent; the inclination of the head denotes bashfulness or
languor; it leans forward in giving attention; it is averted in dislike
or horror.
The Eyes are raised, in prayer; they weep, in sorrow; they are
cast on vacancy, in thought; they are restless, in doubt and anxiety;
they stare, in horror and affright; they look out stealthily, in suspicion
or distrust; they glow, with anger or hatred.
The Arms are projected forward, in authority; they are spread
extended, in admiration; they are held forward, in imploring help;
they fall suddenly, in disappointment; they are folded, in medita-
tion or thoughtfulness.
The Hand on the head indicates distress or thoughtfulness; on
the lips, an injunction to silence; on the eyes, shame; on the breast,
an appeal to conscience or the affections; both hands are held su-
pine or clasped, in prayer; both descend prone, in blessing; they
are clasped or wrung, in sorrow and affliction. The outstretched
hands, with the palms turned away from the face, express fear,
abhorrence, rejection, or dismissal ; with the palms toward the
face, they denote approval, acceptation, welcoming, and love.
The Body, held erect, indicates steadiness and courage; thrown
back, pride; stooping forward, condescension or compassion; bend-
ing, reverence or respect; prostration indicates the extremest
humility or abasement.
The Legs, in a firm position, indicate courage or obstinacy; bended
knees, timidity or weakness, and also reverence; frequent change,
embarrassment or disturbed thoughts; they advance, in desire or
courage; they retire, in aversion or fear; they start, in terror; they
stamp, in authority or anger; they kneel, in submission or prayer.
III. GESTURE.
By Gesture is meant the movement of the body and its
members. It is a visible manifestation of thought and senti-
ment which accompanies its oral expression.
Importance. ----Gesture is one of the most important concom-

itants of delivery. Its primary object is to enhance the power
of oral language by the accompaniment of visible language.
Some writer remarks, “In the natural order of passionate ex-
pression, looks are first, gestures second, and words are last."
Demosthenes, when asked what are the requisites of an orator,
replied, “Action, action, action.”
Gesture is the natural language of thought and sentiment.
It is a universal language, understood by all people; no matter
what their speech, all know the meaning of gestures and can
communicate with one another thereby.
An entire play can be presented in pantomime so as to be fully
understood. Indeed, it was a matter of dispute between Roscius
and Cicero which could produce the greater effect-the former by
gesture, or the latter by spoken words.
Kinds of Gestures.—Gestures may be divided into three
classes ; gestures of Location, Illustration, and Emphasis.
Gestures of Location are designed to indicate the position of
the object or idea referred to.
Gestures of Illustration are designed to show the way in
which something appeared or was affected.
Gestures of Emphasis are designed to give greater intensity
to the meaning of words or sentences by physical movements.
ELEMENTS OF GESTURE.-Gesture, in its fullest sense, in-
cludes the Bow, and the position and movement of the Head,
the Eyes, the Arms, the Hands, the Body, and the Legs and
Feet.
The Bow.—The Bow of a speaker should be graceful, easy,
and dignified. The entire body should be bent slightly for-
ward with a gentle movement, and then returned to an upright
position. The foot may be slightly drawn back or not, as is
preferred. The bow should be free from a careless, jerking
abruptness, and from a formal, unnecessary flourish.
The bow should not be too low, so as to seem overdone, nor too
short, so as to seem trifling or disrespectful. It should not be a
mere nod of the head, but the entire body should be slightly
a

79
included in the movement. The body should be bent directly for-
ward, and not on one side. Some teachers prefer that there shall
be a step backward subsequent to the bow; but this is a matter
of taste, and is not essential.
As
The Hands. The hands are the principal members in making
gestures. Attention must be given to the Form, the Position,
and the Movement of the hands.
The hands are the most important members in gesture.
Quintilian remarks, these almost speak themselves. “By them
we ask, promise, call, dismiss, threaten, supplicate, detest, fear;
display joy, sorrow, doubt, acknowledgment, penitence, manner,
abundance, number, time.” “So that amid the great diversity
of language among all races and nations, this appears to me to be
the common speech of all men.”
The Form of the hand in making gestures should be natural and
unconstrained. The fingers should lie near one another, slightly
curved, the thumb being parallel with the fingers. The gesture
with the forefinger is sometimes appropriate, and is very expres-
sive when the finger is long and slender. A gesture with the
fist is very seldom allowable. The errors of gesture are-fingers
straight and rigid, too much apart, too closely pressed together,
thumb projected from the hand, etc.
The Position of the hand in an ordinary gesture of emphasis,
should be a little above the waist, between the waist and shoulder.
In referring to anything above one, or to grand and lofty senti-
ments, it should be elevated; in referring to anything situated
low, or to any low, debased sentiment, etc., it should be below the
ordinary position.
The Movements of the hand should be graceful and in good taste.
The hand should be raised in curved, and not in straight lines;
and the movements should also be in gently curving lines. Ges-
tures will thus embody the elements of grace and beauty. Care
should be taken that the movements and transitions be not abrupt
or angular. After a gesture, the hand should fall gently and nat-
urally to its place, and not go down with a jerk, or with an awk-
ward restraint.
a
The Arms.—The arm, when not used in gesture, should hang
naturally at the side. In gesture, the elbow should be slightly
bent, except in the most emphatic gestures, when it may often

be rigid and straight. Care should be taken not to exhibit an
angle at the elbow.
The Eyes.—The eyes, which are an important element of
expression, should generally be directed as the gesture points,
except when we wish to condemn or refuse, or require any
object to be removed. The eye should rest upon the audience,
not with a familiar stare, but with a kindly, modest, and dig-
nified expression.
To show a modest confidence in your audience goes very far to
secure their confidence and sympathy. There are some motions
of the body, legs, and feet, which emphasize expression, but they
need not be discussed here.
IMITATION.---Gesture must be taught and learned largely
by imitation. The pupil should notice and endeavor to copy
models of gesture worthy of his imitation.
PRINCIPLES OF GESTURE.—The principles of gesture may
be embraced under three heads; general nature, force and
extent, direction of gesture.
General Nature. The first principle of gesture is that it
should be natural and appropriate. The second principle is that
it should be graceful, moving in fluent and connected lines, and
not abrupt and desultory. A third principle is that strong,
bold, determined, and abrupt expressions require straight lines;
while all beautiful, graceful, genial, grave, grand, and exultant
sentiments require curved lines.
Force and Extent.—We determine the force and extent of
the gesture by the sentiment expressed. If the sentiment is
unemotional, as in ordinary conversation, the gestures are
moderate, the movement being mainly from the elbow. If the
sentiment is highly impassioned, as in dramatic composition,
the gestures are still more vigorous and extended. Nice judg-
ment is required to adapt the gesture to the sentiment, but a
cultivated taste must be the guide.
Direction of Gesture. The principles for the direction of
gestures are as follows: In gestures of location, the position of
the hand and body should indicate the position of the object
-

GESTURE.
81
referred to. In gestures of illustration, the physical expression
should be appropriate to the thing which is illustrated. In
gestures of emphasis, the action should fall immediately upon
the emphatic word.
In strong assertion, emphatic declamation, vehement argu-
ment, or forcible appeal, the descending gesture is to be used.
In the expression of noble, lofty, and sublime emotions, the
ascending gesture is required. In descriptions and all ordinary
sentiment, the middle or horizontal gesture is employed.
The gesture in front is used in strong and emphatic statements.
The oblique gesture is used in the expression of negative sentiments.
The extended gesture is used in expressing ideas of extent. When
the subject is of large extent, the two-handed gesture is appropriate.
The hand opened towards the audience indicates kindliness of feel-
ing, benevolence, etc. The palm turned away from the speaker
indicates fear, aversion, etc. The palm turned towards the speaker
indicates something pertaining to himself. The gesture with the
closed hand indicates firmness, determination, etc.
ERRORS OF GESTURE.—Some of the principal errors of
gesture are,-deficiency of gesture, superfluous gesture, random
and thoughtless gesture, improper position of the hands, impro-
per movement of the arm, awkward replacing of the hands
after a gesture, gesture too early or too late, etc.
1. Do not make too many gestures. An excess of gesture is
like redundancy of language, in bad taste and tiresome. Too
few gestures are better than too many.
2. Inexpressive and meaningless gestures should be avoided.
No gesture should be made without a reason for it. Some
speakers accompany nearly every word with a bodily motion,
which fatigues the eye and offends the taste. A gesture that
illustrates nothing is worse than useless—it destroys the effect
at which it aims.
3. When a gesture has been assumed, there should be no
change from it without a reason. It shows an indecision of
character, an obscurity of thought, or a lack of self-possession,
which mars the effect of delivery.
F

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION AND READING.
4. Be careful to bring the hands easily and gracefully into
their natural position after a gesture. The habit of allowing
the hands to fall to the side immediately after a gesture, pro-
duces an ungraceful effect. To allow them to wander around,
apparently not knowing what to do with them, before getting
them into position, is also to be avoided.
5. Be careful also to avoid all improper forms of the hands,-
as the fingers wide apart, the hand too straight, the thumbs
projecting, etc. Awkward positions of the arms, angular
movements, tardiness of the gesture, etc., should all be care-
fully avoided.
IV. FACIAL EXPRESSION.
By Facial Expression is meant the language portrayed by
the face. It includes both the repose and play of the features
that should accompany vocal delivery.
Importance. The importance of this element of delivery
cannot be overestimated. The face is the mirror of the soul.
By nature it reflects promptly all changes of sentiment and
feeling. It is therefore one of the most important elements
of expression. A voice may be artistic in its modulations, it
A
may attune itself harmoniously to language, but if the soul
of the speaker does not shine out from the countenance, much
of the power of expression is lost.
All the great speakers and writers on oratory have understood
the power of facial expression. Quintilian says: “The face is the
dominant power of expression. With this we supplicate; with
this we soothe; with this we mourn; with this we rejoice; with
this we triumph; with this we make our submissions; upon this
the audience hang; upon this they keep their eyes fixed; this they
examine and study even before a word is spoken.”
Division.-Facial expression has been divided into two
kinds; the Unimpassioned and the Impassioned.
The former refers to the face in repose, or to that natural
expression which it wears in ordinary conversation, plain nar-
rative and description, and in all unimpassioned language.
a


## p. 83 (#101) #############################################

FACIAL EXPRESSION.
83
.
The latter refers to that play of the features which is used
in expressing the emotions of the soul which accompany the
delivery of emotional sentiment.
ELEMENTS OF FACIAL EXPRESSION.—The principal features
of Facial Expression are the eyes, the mouth, the nose, and the
brows.
The Eyes.—The Eye is the window of the soul. Out of it
the soul seems to shine, and the heart can be read by peeping
in the eyes. “When there is love in the heart,” says Beecher,
"there are rainbows in the eyes.” “The eye,” says Tucker-
man, “ speaks with an eloquence and truthfulness surpassing
speech. It is the window out of which the winged thoughts
fly unwittingly. It is the tiny magic mirror on whose crystal
surface the moods of feeling fitfully play, like the sunlight and
shadows on a still stream.” Many writers speak of “the mute
eloquence of a look ;” and Byron sings of eyes which “looked
love to eyes that spake again."
The Eyes bend downward in grief, perplexity, diffidence, shame, and
humility; they are raised upward in joy, delight, hope, and admira-
tion; they lock straight forward in expressing courage and determi-
nation; they are averted in disgust, aversion, and listening; they roll
in rage, jealousy, and despair; they glare in madness; they are vacant
in despair, flash in anger or malice, and are wide and fixed in fear
and terror.
The Mouth.—The Mouth is even more expressive than the
eyes. The peculiar character of the face is largely due to the
size and shape of the mouth. A small mouth indicates secre-
tiveness; a large mouth, open-heartedness and good humor;
parted lips indicate listlessness or stupidity ; compressed lips
are a sign of firmness and decision of character; etc.
The expression of the mouth is due principally to the corners
of the mouth. We draw up the corners of the mouth in laughing,
and depress them in crying. “To be down in the mouth” is an
expressive phrase for low spirits. In a picture the same face
may be changed from laughter to weeping by merely making a
change in the corners of the mouth.
The open mouth expresses mirth, love, pity, admiration, desire, fear,

84

and wonder; closed lightly, it expresses tranquillity; compressed,
defiance, hatred, determination; the corners drawn down, pride, scorn,
anger, hatred; when pouting, petulance and discontent; when smiling,
friendship, approval, cheerfulness.
Brow and Nose.—The Brow and Nose aid in facial expres-
sion. They are both elements of beauty and strength, and aid
greatly in imparting dignity and power to the face.
The Brow, when natural, expresses veneration and tranquillity ;
when knit, anger, jealousy, hatred, and remorse; when elevated, ad-
miration, wonder, fear, and terror. The Nose, when expanded, ex-
presses courage and anger; when drawn up or wrinkled, mirth,
contempt, and disgust; when contracted, pain, fear, and melancholy.
;
PRINCIPLES OF FACIAL EXPRESSION.-In facial expression
nature must be our guide. The soul must feel the sentiment
to be expressed, and the countenance must be the mirror of
the soul. The play of features must respond to the sentiment
stirring in the heart. The following propositions will indicate
the general principles of facial expression:
Unemotional sentiments require the countenance to be in repose.
Sentiments of good humor, happiness, etc., require a pleasant and
smiling countenance. Bold, grand, and noble sentiments require
dignity and animation of countenance. Humorous sentiments re-
quire the play of humor in the face; sad and pathetic sentiment
should be accompanied with a dejected and softened expression;
shame requires the averted eyes and blush of guilt. Determina-
tion, anger, and a spirit of defiance are expressed by a contracted
brow and compressed lips; in scorn we elevate the upper lip and
nose; in fear, surprise, and secresy, the brow is raised, the eyes
are opened, and the lips parted.

CHAPTER IV.
THE MENTAL ELEMENT.
The Mental Element in reading is that by which we under-
stand and feel what we read. It includes an Intellectual and
an Emotional element.
The Intellectual Element is that by which we understand
what we read. The Emotional Element is that by which we
feel and appreciate what we read. Both of these are the basis
of good reading, and they will be briefly discussed.
THE INTELLECTUAL ELEMENT.-The Intellectual Element
is of great importance in good reading. There must first be a
proper conception of the subject before there can be a correct
and impressive expression of it. The thought must lie clearly
in the soul of the reader or he cannot, by the force of living
words, put it clearly into the mind of the listener.
1. A person must understand what he reads. No one can read prop-
erly that which he does not understand. He may pronounce
the words correctly, but unless he comprehends the thought it
will be merely “calling words," not reading. Ridiculous mistakes
are sometimes made by pupils in endeavoring to read what they
do not understand; and the artificial and unnatural style in which
young persons often read is due to the same cause.
2. Pupils should study their reading lessons. They should understand
the meaning of the words, the idea intended to be expressed by the
author, the general character of the sentiment, the meaning and
force of the prominent allusions, the rhetorical figures, etc. It
will be well to go over the lesson and mark the emphasis, slides,
8

86
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION AND READING.
varieties of voice, etc., appropriate to the different parts of the
piece to be read; and if it were partly or wholly committed to
memory, it could be read so much more effectively.
3. To excel in reading, one should be a good literary scholar. In no
study does a person require so much general culture as in reading.
He needs a knowledge of history, mythology, rhetoric, etc., in
order to understand the references, allusions, rhetorical construc-
tions, etc., in the selections read. The reading-lesson properly
studied becomes one of the most interesting and profitable studies
in the school. The study of elocution is thus adapted to cultivate
a taste for literature; indeed, many a person has received his first
impulse to literary culture in the reading-class as taught by some
earnest and enthusiastic lover of literature.
THE EMOTIONAL ELEMENT.-The Emotional Element is
also of fundamental importance in reading. The soul of the
reader must feel the sentiment of his selection before he can
awaken a proper feeling in the heart of the listener.
1. A person should feel and appreciate what he reads. Literature
appeals to the heart as well as to the head. The reader must be
susceptible to all the various phases of sentiment, and feel them
when he is reading, so that he may make others feel them. If
the subject is pathetic, his heart should be touched with pity; if
it is humorous, he should appreciate the humor; if it is grand and
sublime, he should feel the emotion of grandeur stirring in his soul.
2. Pupils do not usually feel or appreciate what they read. They
will read one style of composition in just about the same tone and
pitch as another; so that if you judged the composition by the
manner of reading, you could not tell whether they were reading
a funeral sermon of Bossuet or a humorous description by Mark
Twain. There is no response to the touch of pathos or beauty;
no heart-throb to the poet's line or the orator's sentiment. In-
deed, there is often no more feeling than if a talking-machine
were repeating the words of the reading-book.
3. To be a good reader one should not only be a good literary scholar,
but he should also possess a cultivated taste. Refinement of mind, a
heart to feel and appreciate the beautiful and good, will make the
reader susceptible to the beauties of literature and enable him to
touch other hearts by the pathos and beauty of his expression.
An elocutionist should take special pains, by the study of the fine
arts and the cultivation of that which is beautiful and noble in

87
human character, to acquire such refinement of taste and feeling
as shall fit him for the highest attainments in his high art.
TO THE TEACHER.—That the teacher may aid the student in re-
spect to the mental element, the following suggestions are made:
1. The teacher should examine the pupils to see that they understand the
reading lesson. He may ask questions upon the meaning of words, the
thoughts of the author, the figures and allusions, the historical and
biographical references, the general sentiment of the piece, and upon the
style and character of the composition. Pupils may often be required to
give the sense of a passage or paragraph in their own language.
2. The teacher should explain such things as the pupil does not understand.
He may explain the meaning of words, sentences, allusions, figures of
rhetoric, etc.; call attention to the historical fact or mythological story to
which an allusion refers, and show the force and beauty of a figure. He
should try to awaken an appreciation of the beauty of a poetical image
in the mind of the pupil, and make his imagination picture it to his mind
as it was seen by the poet who wrote it.
3. The teacher should endeavor to awaken an appreciation of the senti-
ment in the heart of the pupil. He may give illustrations of the different
kinds of sentiment, and show how the voice and manner should be adapted
to express them. By appropriate questions and explanations he can open
the pupil's eyes that he may see, and unseal his heart that he may feel,
those touches of beauty and humor and pathos which throb in the poet's
line or live in the orator's phrase.
ANALYSIS OF COMPOSITION.
Analysis.—Before reading a selection there should always
be a careful analysis of it, in order to determine the applica-
tion of the principles of elocution which have been explained.
This analysis includes the kind of composition, the force,
compass, rate, quality, emphatic words, slides, etc. Such an
analysis is essential for artistic and finished reading.
There may also be an analysis to explain the figures, the
allusions, etc. This may be called a Literary Analysis, while
the other may be distinguished as the Elocutionary Analysis.
Examples of Analysis.-We present a few extracts, with
an analysis indicating the correct reading.
1. “No man can serve two masters; for either he will hate the
one and love the other, or else he will þold to the one and despise
the other. Ye cannot serve God and Mammon.'— Bible.
?


## p. 88 (#106) #############################################

88
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION AND READING.
>
Analysis.—This is a plain statement, and requires moderate force, pure
tone, medium pitch, moderate rate, and diatonic melody. The emphatic
word in the first sentence is “two," as the object is to distinguish from one
master. In the next sentence there is a contrast between his actions to
each master, and the words love and hate, hold and despise, are emphatic.
In the last sentence the word and is emphatic, as the idea is that ye cannot
serve both God and Mammon. To read it,“ Ye cannot serve God and Mam-
mon," would fail to bring out its meaning. The pupil should show the
slides also.
2. “Thou shalt not bear false-witness against thy neighbor.”—
Bible.
Analysis.-In this sentence false-witness is the emphatic word. It is
often read with emphasis on the last word, neighbor. This would make it
mean that, though we should not bear false-witness against our neighbor,
we might against some one else. If read with the emphasis on against,
it indicates that we might bear false-witness for some one, but not
against him.

opened he thine eyes ?”—Bible.

rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I care not who knows
so much of my mettle.”—Twelfth Night.
10. “In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weep-
ing, and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children, and
would not be comforted, because they are not.”— Bible.

ness: Some are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
have greatness thrust upon them.!? — Twelfth Night,

“Thy soul was like a star, and dwelt apart;
Thou hadst a voice, whose sound was like the sea;
Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free,
So didst thou travel on life's common way
In cheerful godliness; and yet thy heart
The lowliest duties on herself did lay.”

“Beauty, Good, and Knowledge are three sisters
That dote upon each other, friends to man,
Living together under the same roof,
And never can be sundered without tears.
-He that shuts Love out, in turn shall be
Shut out from Love, and on her threshold lie
Howling in outer darkness. Not for this
Was common clay ta'en from the common earth,
Moulded by God, and temper'd with the tears
Of angels, to the perfect shape of man.”
The PALACE OF ART.— Tennyson.
"Think of him [Goldsmith) reckless, thriftless, vain if you like
-but merciful, gentle, generous, full of love and pity. He passes
out of our life, and goes to render his account beyond it. Think
of the poor pensioners weeping at his grave; think of the noble
spirits that admired and deplored him; think of the righteous
pen that wrote his epitaph-and of the wonderful and unanimous
response of affection with which the world has paid back the love
he gave it. His humor delighting us still; his song fresh and
beautiful as when first he charmed with it; his words in all our
mouths; his very weakness beloved and familiar,-his benevo-
lent spirit seems still to smile upon us; to do gentle kindness; to
succor with sweet charity ; to soothe, to caress, and forgive; to
plead with the fortunate for the unhappy and the poor.”—Thack-
eray.
"We hold the keys of Heaven in our hands,
The gift and heirloom of a former state,
And lie in infancy at Heaven's gate,
Transfigured in the light that streams along the lands!
Around our pillars golden ladders rise,
And up and down the skies,
With winged sandals shod,
The angels come and go, the Messengers of God!
Nor do they, fading from us, e'er depart,-
It is the childish heart;
We walk as heretofore,
Adown their shining ranks, but see them-nevermore!
Not Heaven is gone, but we are blind with tears,
Groping our way along the downward slope of years !”

"It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may
cry, peace, peace!—but there is no peace. The war is actually

And, having wound their loathsome track to the top
Of this huge, mouldering monument of Rome,
Hang hissing at the nobler man below !”

But while this muddy vesture of decay
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.”-Shakespeare.

“How beautiful this night! the balmiest sigh,
Which vernal zephyrs breathe in evening's ear,
Were discord to the speaking quietude
That wraps this moveless scene. Heaven's ebon vault,
Studded with stars unutterably bright,
Through which the moon's unclouded grandeur rolls,
Seems like a canopy which love has spread
To curtain her sleeping world.”—Shelley.
"All heaven and earth are still,—though not in sleep,
But breathless, as we grow when feeling most;
And silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep:-
All heaven and earth are still: from the high host
Of stars to the lulled lake, and mountain coast,
All is concenter'd in a life intense,
Where not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,
But hath a part of being, and a sense
Of that which is of all Creator and defence.”—Byron.

“How beautiful is night!
A dewy freshness fills the silent air;
No mist obscures, nor cloud, nor speck, nor stain,
Breaks the serene of heaven:
In full-orbed glory, yonder moon divine
Rolls through the dark-blue depths.
Beneath her steady ray
The desert-circle spreads,
Like the round ocean, girdled with the sky.
How beautiful is night!”-Southey.
“Now came still Evening on, and Twilight gray
Had in her sober livery all things clad;
Silence accompanied; for beast and bird,
They to their grassy couch, these to their nests,
Were slunk, all but the wakeful nightingale ;
She all night long her amorous descant sung;
Silence was pleased: now glowed the firmament
With living sapphires : Hesperus, that led
The starry host, rode brightest, till the Moon,
Rising in clouded majesty, at length,
Apparent queen, unveiled her peerless light,
And o'er the dark her silver mantle threw." -Milion.

EMPHASIS OF SPECIFICATION.
“In all ages, Love is the truth of life. Men cannot injure us
except so far as they exasperate us to forget ourselves.
No man
is really dishonored except by his own act. Calumny, injustice,
ingratitude,—the only harm these can do us is by making us
bitter, or rancorous, or gloomy; by shutting our hearts, or souring
our affections. We rob them of their power, if they only leave
us more sweet and forgiving than before. And this is the only
true victory. We win by love. Love transmutes all curses, and
forces them to rain down blessings. Our enemies become uncon-
sciously our best friends, when their slanders deepen in us heav-
enlier graces. Let them do their worst; they only give us the
godlike victory of forgiving them.”—Rev. F. W. Robertson.
“God and good angels alone know the vast, the incalculable
influence that goes out into the universe of spirit, and thence
flows into the universe of matter, from the conquered evil and
the voiceless prayer of one solitary soul. Wouldst thou bring
the world unto God? Then live near to Him thyself. If divine
life pervade thine own soul, everything that touches thee will
receive the electric spark, though thou mayest be unconscious of
being charged therewith. This surely would be the highest-to
strive to keep near the holy, not for the sake of our own reward
here or hereafter, but that through love to God we might bless
our neighbor.”—Mrs. L. M. Child.
“If men lived like men indeed, their houses would be temples
-temples which we should hardly dare to injure, and in which
it would make us holy to be permitted to live. When men do
not love their hearths, nor reverence their thresholds, it is a sign
that they have dishonored both, and that they have never ac-
knowledged the true universality of that Christian worship, which
was indeed to supersede the idolatry, but not the piety of the
pagan. Our God is a household God as well as a heavenly one.
He has an altar in every man's dwelling: let men look to it when
they rend it lightly and pour out its ashes.”—John Ruskin.
“There is a sacredness in individuality of character. Each one
born into this world is a fresh, new soul, intended by his Maker
to develop himself in a new, fresh way. We are what we are;
we cannot be truly other than ourselves. We reach perfection

not by copying, much less by aiming at originality; but by consist-
ently and steadily working out the life which is common to us
all, according to the character which God has given us. There is
one universe in which each separate star differs from another in
glory; one Church, in which a single spirit, the life of God, per-
vades each separate soul; and just in proportion as that life be-
comes exalted, does it enable every one to shine forth in the dis-
tinctness of his own separate individuality, like the stars of
heaven.”—Robertson.

“He who in his heart of heart reverences the Good, the True,
the Holy,—that is, reverences God,-does not tremble at the appa-
rent success of attacks upon the outworks of his faith. They may
shake those who rested on those outworks; they do not move him
whose soul reposes on the Truth itself.”—Robertson.
It is not by regretting what is irreparable that true work is to
be done, but by making the best of what we are. It is not by
complaining that we have not the right tools, but by using well
the tools we have. What we are, and where we are, is God's
providential arrangement-God's doing, though it may be man's
misdoing; and the manly and the wise way is to look your disad-
vantages in the face, and see what can be made out of them.
Forget mistakes; organize victory out of mistakes.”— Robertson.
“Between Christ mocked and Christ rejected there is but a
step; who shall say how easily it is taken, or how quickly we may
pass from the hollow homage, the 'Hail, Master!' which mocks
our Lord, to the smiting and buffeting of open outrage? When
Christ is invested with but the show of sovereignty, the reed
placed in his hands will be quickly taken, as by the soldiers, to
smite his head. This reed is nominal Christianity, a strange slip of
a degenerate vine, beneath whose blighting shadow a poison-
growth of unbelief never fails to root itself.”—Dora Greenwell.
“He is a man of integrity who hates untruth as untruth; who
resents the smooth and polished falsehood of society, which does
no harm; who turns in indignation from the glittering, whitened
lie of sepulchral Pharisaism, which injures no one. Integrity
recoils from deceptions which men would almost smile to hear
called deception. To a moral, pure mind, the artifices in every
department of life are painful: the stained wood, which passes for
a more firm and costly material in a building, and deceives the

tended to be taken for a reality; the gilding which is meant to
pass for gold; and the glass which is worn to look like jewels :
for there is a moral feeling and a truthfulness in architecture, in
painting, and in dress, as well as in the market-place, and in the
senate, and in the judgment-hall.”— Robertson.
“Man cannot know unless he can worship in some way. His
knowledge is a pedantry and dead thistle otherwise.
It is a
calumny on men to say that they are roused to heroic action by
ease, hope of pleasure, recompense, sugar-plums of any kind in
this world or the next! In the meanest mortal there lies some-
thing nobler. The poor swearing soldier, hired to be shot, has
his 'honor of a soldier,' different from drill regulations and the
shilling a day. It is not to taste sweet things, but to do noble and
true things, and vindicate himself under God's Heaven, as a god-
made Man, that the poorest son of Adam dimly longs. Show him
the way of doing that, the dullest day-drudge kindles into a hero.
They wrong man greatly who say he is to be seduced by ease.
Difficulty, abnegation, martyrdom, death, are the allurements that
act on the heart of man. Kindle the inner genial life of him, you
have a flame that burns up all lower considerations. Not happi-
ness, but something higher; one sees this even in the frivolous
classes with their 'point of honor' and the like. Not by flatter-
ing our appetites; no, by awakening the Heroic that slumbers in
every heart, can any Religion gain followers. . . . Is it not better
to do Right than Wrong; the one is to the other as life is to death,
-as Heaven is to Hell. The one must in nowise be done, the
other in nowise left undone. You shall not measure them; they
are incommeasurable; the one is death-the other life eternal.”-

“Where Christ brings his cross He brings his presence, and
where He is, none are desolate, and there is no room for despair.
At the darkest, you have felt a hand through the dark, closer

“I have heard it said that, when one lifts up his voice against
ngs that are, and wishes for a change, he is raising a clamor
against existing institutions, a clamor against our venerable estab-
lishments, a clamor against the law of the land; but this is no
clamor against the one or the other,-it is a clamor against the
abuse of them all. It is a clamor raised against the grievances
that are felt. Mr. Burke, who was no friend to popular excite-
ment,,who was no ready tool of agitation, no hot-headed enemy
of existing establishments, no undervaluer of the wisdom of our
ancestors, no scoffer against institutions as they are,-has said,
and it deserves to be fixed in letters of gold, over the hall of
every assembly which calls itself a legislative body,-'Where
there is abuse, there ought to be clamor; because it is better to
have our slumber broken by the fire-bell, than to perish amid

St. Agnes' Eve—Ah, bitter chill it was !
The owl, for all his feathers, was a-cold;
The hare limped trembling through the frozen grass,
And silent was the flock in woolly fold:
Numb were the Beadsman's fingers, while he told
His rosary,
and while his frosted breath,
Like pious incense from a censer old,
Seem'd taking flight for heaven, without a death,
Past the sweet Virgin's picture, while his prayers he saith.”
THE EVE OF St. AGNES. — Keats.
“ Life! we've been long together,
Through pleasant and through cloudy weather:
'Tis hard to part when friends are dear;
Perhaps 't will cost a sigh, a tear;
Then steal away, give little warning,
Choose thine own time,
Say not Good Night, but in some brighter clime
Bid me Good Morning.”—LIFE.—Mrs. Barbauld.
Only waiting till the shadows
Are a little longer grown;
Only waiting till the glimmer
Of the day's last beam is flown.
Then, from out the gathered darkness,
Holy, deathless stars shall rise,
By whose light my soul shall gladly
Tread its pathway to the skies."-ONLY WAITING.

“And there was mounting in hot haste: the steed,
The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,
Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,
And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;
And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;
And near, the beat of the alarming drum
Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;
While throngd the citizens with terror dunib,
Or whispering, with white lips,—'The foe! They come!

Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
With a new Gorgon!”—Macduff, in MACBETH.
“Angels and ministers of grace defend us !-
Be thou a spirit of health, or goblin damn'd;
Bring with thee airs from heaven, or blasts from hell ;
Be thy intents wicked or charitable;
Thou com’st in such a questionable shape
That I will speak to thee; I'll call thee Hamlet,
King, father, royal Dane: 0, answer me!
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Wherein we saw thee quietly in-urn’d,
Hath op'd his ponderous and marble jaws
To cast thee up again! What may this mean,
That thou, dead corse, again, in complete steel,
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
Making night hideous; and we fools of nature,
So horribly to shake our disposition,
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls ?
Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?”

The Greeks said grandly in their tragic phrase,
'Let no one be called happy till his death.'
To which I add, Let no one till his death
Be called unhappy. Measure not the work
Until the day 's out and the labor done;
Then bring your gauges. If the day's work 's scant,

Deal with us nobly, women though we be,
And honor us with truth, if not with praise.”

Made glorious summer by this sun of York;

The
function of the first is, to teach ; the function of the second is, to

“Poetry has been as serious a thing to me as life itself; and life

so far, as work; not as mere hand and head work apart from the
personal being, but as the completest expression of that being to
which I could attain,-and as work, I offer it to the public; feel-

“O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,

To stay: to bid farewell, farewell forever,
For this I come! 'Tis over! I must leave thee!
Thekla, I must-must leave thee! Yet thy hatred
Let me not take with me. I pray thee, grant me
One look of sympathy, only one look.
Say that thou dost not hate me. Say it to me, Thekla !
O God! I cannot leave this spot-I cannot,
Cannot let go this hand. O tell me, Thekla !
That thou dost suffer with me, art convinced
That I cannot act otherwise."

The dark crowd moves, and there are sobs and tears :
The blank earth yawns: the mortal disappears;
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust;
He is gone who seem'd so great.-
Gone; but nothing can bereave him
Of the force he made his own
Being here, and we believe him
Something far advanced in State,
And that he wears a truer crown
Than any wreath that man can weave him.
But speak no more of his renown,

“Think not the Faith by which the just shall live

And so make life, death, and that vast forever,
One grand, sweet song.”—A FAREWELL.-Kingsley.

And down to those shadows, on each side, that fall
In time's silent circle, so various for each,
Is it nothing to know that they never can reach
So far but that light lies beyond them forever?”

"Holy intention is to the actions of a man that which the soul
is to the body, or form to its matter, or the root to its tree, or the
sun to the world, or the fountain to a river, or the base to a pillar;
for without these, the body is a dead trunk, the matter is sluggish,
the tree is a block, the river is quickly dry, and the pillar rushes
into flatness or ruin, and the action is sinful, or unprofitable, or

hymns in its fierce agonies, and met death smiling,- from the cell

“A woman's voice can tell a long history of sorrow in a single
word. This wonderful instrument, our voice, alters its timbre with
every note it yields, as the face changes with every look, until at
last the dominant emotion is master, and gives quality to tone and
character to expression.
“Every look, tone, gesture of a man is a symbol of his complete
nature. If we apply the microscope severely enough, we can dis-
cern the fine organism by which the soul sends itself out in every

agony so awful that it not only shook his health to its centre, but
smote his spirit down into so profound a darkness, that of all his

had passed up the hill Difficulty with youthful ardor; he had been

Valley of the Shadow of Death, with the fiends whispering dark
doubts in his ears, till he half believed them to be his own, -

Outwatched with me the envious night:

Unlinked with hope that thou wouldst free
This world from its dark slavery,
That thou, O awful LOVELINESS,
Wouldst live whate'er these words cannot express.

HAMLET'S INSTRUCTION TO THE PLAYERS.—Shakespeare.
SPEAK, the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trip-

players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do
not saw the air too much with your hand, thus; but use all gently:
for in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say) whirlwind of
your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance, that may
give it smoothness. O, it offends me to the soul, to hear a robus-
tious, periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags,
to split the ears of the groundlings; who, for the most part, are
capable of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows, and noise: I
would have such a fellow whipped for o'er-doing Termagant; it
out-herods Herod : pray you avoid it.
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be your
tutor: suit the action to the word, the word to the action: with
this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of na-
ture; for anything so overdone is from the purpose of playing,
whose end, both at the first and now, was, and is to hold, as
't were, the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
scorn her own image, and the very age and body of the time, his
form and pressure. Now this, overdone, or come tardy off, though
it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve,

the censure of which one must, in your allowance, o'erweigh a
whole theatre of others. O, there be players that I have seen
play,—and heard others praise, and that highly,--not to speak it
profanely, that, neither having the accent of Christian, Pagan,
nor man, have so strutted, and bellowed, that I have thought
some of nature's journeymen had made men, and not made them
well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
And let those that play your chorus speak no more than is set
down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh,
to set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too; though,
in the mean time, some necessary question of the play be then to
be considered: that's villainous; and shows a most pitiful ambi-
tion in the fool that uses it. Go, make ready.
Analysis.—Who wrote this? In what play is it? Who speaks the lines ?
To whom are they spoken? Your opinion of the advice? Points which
especially please you ? etc.
What pitch is required? What force? What rate? What stress ? Point
out the emphatic words in the first sentence; in the second sentence; etc.
Why is I emphatic in“ as I pronounced it to you”? What is the idea if

What is the difference in the idea? etc.
GOOD READING AN ACCOMPLISHMENT.-John S. Hart.
THERE is one accomplishment, in particular, which I would
earnestly recommend to you. Cultivate assiduously the ability
to read well. I stop to particularize this, because it is a thing so
very much neglected, and because it is such an elegant and charm-
ing accomplishment. Where one person is really interested by
music, twenty are pleased by good reading. Where one person is
capable of becoming a skilful musician, twenty may become good
readers. Where there is one occasion suitable for the exercise of
musical talent, there are twenty for that of good reading.
The culture of the voice necessary for reading well, gives a de-
lightful charm to the same voice in conversation. Good reading
is the natural exponent and vehicle of all good things. It is the
most effective of all commentaries upon the works of genius. It
seems to bring dead authors to life again, and makes us sit down
familiarly with the great and good of all ages.
Did you ever notice what life and power the Holy Scriptures

have when well read? Have you ever heard of the wonderful
effects produced by Elizabeth Fry on the criminals of Newgate,
by simply reading to them the parable of the Prodigal Son?
Princes and peers of the realm, it is said, counted it a privilege to
stand in the dismal corridors, among felons and murderers, merely
to share with them the privilege of witnessing the marvellous
pathos which genius, taste, and culture could infuse into that sim-
ple story.
What a fascination there is in really good reading! What a
power it gives one! In the hospital, in the chamber of the in-
valid, in the nursery, in the domestic and in the social circle,
among chosen friends and companions, how it enables you to min-
ister to the amusement, the comfort, the pleasure of dear ones as
no other art or accomplishment can. No instrument of man's de-
vising can reach the heart as does that most wonderful instrument,
the human voice. It is God's special gift and endowment to his
chosen creatures. Fold it not away in a napkin.
If you would double the value of all your other acquisitions, if
you would add immeasurably to your own enjoyment and to your
power of promoting the enjoyment of others, cultivate, with inces-
sant care, this divine gift. No music below the skies is equal to
that of pure, silvery speech from the lips of a man or woman of
high culture.

SUGGESTIONS FOR READING.-Lloyd.
'T ;
'Tis modulation that must charm the ear.
When desperate heroines grieve with tedious moan
And whine their sorrows in a see-saw tone,
The same soft sounds of unimpassioned woes
Can only make the yawning hearers doze.
The voice all modes of passion can express,
That marks the proper word with proper stress.
But none emphatic can that actor call,
Who lays an equal emphasis on all.
Some o'er the tongue the labored measures roll,
Slow and deliberate as the parting toll:
Point every stop, mark every pause so strong,
Their words, like stage processions, stalk along.
All affectation but creates disgust,
And e'en in speaking we may seem too just.

In vain for them the pleasing measure flows,
Whose recitation runs it all to prose;
Repeating what the poet sets not down,
The verb disjoining from its friendly noun,
While pause, and break, and repetition join
To make a discord in each tuneful line.
Some placid natures fill the allotted scene
With lifeless drone, insipid and serene;
While others thunder every couplet o'er,
And almost crack your ears with rant and roar.
More nature oft, and finer strokes are shown
In the low whisper, than tempestuous tone;
And Hamlet's hollow voice and fixed amaze
More powerful terror to the mind conveys,
Than he who, swollen with big, impetuous rage,
Bullies the bulky phantom off the stage.
He who in earnest studies o'er his part
Will find true nature cling about his heart.
The modes of grief are not included all
In the white handkerchief and mournful drawl;
A single look more marks the internal woe
Than all the windings of the lengthened O!
Up to the face the quick sensation flies,
And darts its meaning from the speaking eyes:
Love, transport, madness, anger, scorn, despair,
And all the passions, all the soul is there.

And he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country;
and he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would fain
have filled his belly with the husks that the swine did eat; and
no man gave unto him. And when he came to himself, he said,
How many hired servants of my father's have bread enough and
to spare, and I perish with hunger! I will arise and go to my
father, and will say unto him, Father, I have sinned against
heaven, and before thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy
son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
And he arose, and came to his father. But when he was yet a
great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran,
and fell on his neck and kissed him. And the son said unto him,
Father, I have sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no
more worthy to be called thy son. But the father said to his ser-
vants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring
on his hand, and shoes on his feet: and bring hither the fatted
calf, and kill it; and let us eat and be merry: for this my son was
dead, and is alive again; he was lost, and is found. And they be-
merry.
Now his elder son was in the field: and as he came and drew
nigh to the house, he heard music and dancing. And he called
one of the servants, and asked what these things meant. And he
said unto him, Thy brother is come; and thy father hath killed
the fatted calf because he hath received him safe and sound. And
he was angry, and would not go in: therefore came his father out,
and entreated him.
And he answering, said to his father, Lo, these many years do I
serve thee, neither transgressed I at any time thy commandment;
and yet thou never gavest me a kid, that I might make merry with
my friends; but as soon as this thy son was come, which hath de-
voured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for him the fatted
calf. And he said unto him, Son, thou art ever with me, and all
that I have is thine. It was meet that we should make merry and
be glad: for this thy brother was dead, and is alive again; and was
lost and is found.

THE QUALITY OF MERCY.-Shakespeare.
CHE quality of mercy is not strained ;
Heaven
Upon the place beneath: it is twice bless'd;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown:
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute of God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,--
That in the course of justice none of us
Should see salvation; we do pray for mercy ;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy.
I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea:
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
Analysis. In the literary analysis call attention to the character of the
play, the character of Portia, of the Jew; the propriety and beauty of the
language, the excellence of the sentiment, the figures, etc.
In the elocutionary analysis call attention to the quality of voice re-
quired, the emphatic words, slides, pauses, etc. Why is "strained ” em-
phatic? “twice," "gives," "takes,” etc.? Is "all" or "render" or "deeds”

"O God! thy' will be done!”
Then suddenly a rifle grasped,
And aimed it at his son':
'Jump -far out, boy, into the wave!!
Jump', or I fire\!” he said ;
“That only chance your lifel can save!!
Jump! JUMP', boy!” He obeyed.
He sank -he rosel-he lived —he moved —
And for the ship' struck out:
On board we hailed the lad beloved,
With many a manly shout'.
His father drew, in silent' joy',
Those wet arms round his neck,
And folded to his heart' his boy-
Then fainted on the deck.

Third Stanza: Read with excitement and deep feeling; half whisper
"horror"and"aghast;" sound theaspirates at theend of“thick”and “hot.”
Fourth Stanza: Imitate the father's natural excitement. Loud voice in
"jump,” “fire,” etc. Change the voice to simple statement in “He obeyed.”
Fifth Stanza: Read first part in a hesitating manner, as if watching with
interest. Let the voice glow with fervor up to the end of the fourth line.
Read the rest of it tenderly and softly.

a
A CHILD'S DREAM OF A STAR.- Charles Dickens.
was once a child, and he strolled about a great deal, and
thought of a number of things. He had a sister, who was a child,
too, and his constant companion. These two used to wonder all
day long. They wondered at the beauty of the flowers; they
wondered at the height and blueness of the sky. They wondered
at the depth of the bright water: they wondered at the goodness
and the power of God who made the lovely world.
They used to say to one another, sometimes : Supposing all the
children upon earth were to die, would the flowers, and the water,
and the sky, be sorry? They believed they would be sorry. For,
said they, the buds are the children of the flowers, and the little
playful streams that gambol down the hill-sides are the children
of the water; and the smallest bright specks, playing at hide-and-
seek in the sky all night, must surely be the children of the stars;
and they would all be grieved to see their playmates, the children
of men, no more.
There was one clear shining star that used to come out in the
sky before the rest, near the church-spire above the graves. It
was larger and more beautiful, they thought, than all the others,
and every night they watched for it, standing hand in hand at a
window. Whoever saw it first, cried out, “I see the star!” And
often they cried out both together, knowing so well when it would
rise, and where. So they grew to be such friends with it, that,
before lying down in their beds, they always looked out once
again, to bid it good-night; and when they were turning round to
sleep, they used to say, “God bless the star!”
But while she was still very young, oh, very, very young, the
sister drooped, and came to be so weak that she could no longer
stand in the window at night; and then the child looked sadly
out by himself, and when he saw the star, turned round and said

to the patient pale face on the bed, “I see the star!” and then a
smile would come upon the face, and a little weak voice used to
say, “ God bless my brother and the star!”
And so the time came all too soon when the child looked out
alone, and when there was no face on the bed; and when there
was a little grave among the graves, not there before; and when
the star made long rays down towards him, as he saw it through
his tears.
Now, these rays were so bright and they seemed to make such
a shining way from earth to heaven, that when the child went to
his solitary bed he dreamed about the star; and dreamed that,
lying where he was, he saw a train of people taken up that spark-
ling road by angels. And the star, opening, showed him a great
world of light, where many more such angels waited to receive
them.
All the angels who were waiting turned their beaming eyes
upon the people who were carried up into the star; and some
came out from the long rows in which they stood, and fell upon
the people's necks, and kissed them tenderly, and went away with
them down avenues of light, and were so happy in their company
that, lying in his bed, he wept for joy.
But there were many angels who did not go with them, and
among them one he knew. The patient face that once had lain
upon the bed was glorified and radiant, but his heart found out
his sister among all the host.
His sister's angel lingered near the entrance of the star, and said
to the leader among those who had brought the people thither:
“Is my brother come ?”
And he said, "No."
She was turning hopefully away, when the child stretched out
his arms, and cried, “O sister, I am here! Take me!” and then
she turned her beaming eyes upon him, and it was night; and the
star was shining into the room, making long rays down towards
him as he saw it through his tears.
From that hour forth the child looked out upon the star as
on the home he was to go to when his time should come: and he
thought that he did not belong to the earth alone, but to the
star, too, because of his sister's angel gone before.
There was a baby born to be a brother to the child; and while
he was so little that he never yet had spoken a word, he stretched
his tiny form out on his bed, and died.
Again the child dreamed of the opened star, and of the company

of angels, and the train of people, and the rows of angels with
their beaming eyes all turned upon those people's faces.
Said his sister's angel to the leader: “Is my brother come?”
And he said, “Not that one, but another.”
As the child beheld his brother's angel in her arms, he cried,
“O sister, I am here! Take me!” And she turned and smiled
upon him; and the star was shining.
He grew to be a young man, and was busy at his books, when
an old servant came to him and said:
“Thy mother is no more. I bring her blessing on her darling
son."
Again at night he saw the star and all that former company.
Said his sister's angel to the leader:
Is my brother come?”
And he said, “Thy mother!”
A mighty cry of joy went forth through all the star, because the
mother was reunited to her two children. And he stretched out
his arms and cried, “O mother, sister, and brother, I am here !
Take me!” And they answered him, “ Not yet;” and the star
was shining
He grew up to be a man, whose hair was turning gray, and he
was sitting in his chair by the fireside, heavy with grief, and with
his face bedewed with tears, when the star opened once again.
Said his sister's angel to the leader, “Is my brother come?”
And he said, “ Nay, but his maiden daughter.”
And the man who had been the child saw his daughter, newly
lost to him, a celestial creature among those three, and he said,
“My daughter's head is on my sister's bosom, and her arm is
around my mother's neck, and at her feet there is the baby of old
time, and I can bear the parting from her, God be praised."
And the star was shining.
Thus the child came to be an old man, and his once smooth
face was wrinkled, and his steps were slow and feeble, and his
back was bent. And one night, as he lay upon his bed, his chil-
dren standing round, he cried, as he had cried so long ago:
“I see the star!”
They whispered one another, “He is dying."
And he said, “I am. My age is falling from me like a garment,
and I move towards the star as a child. And O, my Father, now
I thank thee that it has so often opened to receive those dear ones
who await me!”
And the star was shining: and it shines upon his grave.

PSALM XXX. 5.

Silver stars when the day is done.
After the snow, the emerald leaves;
After the harvest, golden sheaves.
After the clouds, the violet sky;
Quiet woods when the winds go by.
After the tempest, the lull of waves;
After the battle, peaceful graves.
After the knell, the wedding-bells;
Joyful greetings from sad farewells.
After the bud, the radiant rose;
After our weeping, sweet repose.

After the furrow, the waking seed.
After the flight, the downy nest;
Beyond the shadowy river-rest.

And June must bring her roses
To faintest hearts that trustful wait
For what God's love discloses.
We look along the shining way,
To see the angels' faces;
They come to us in darkest days,
And in the blackest places.
We learn our weakness of our pride,
Our strength from out our weakness;
Sweet Patience brings, for gifts denied,
The greater gift of meekness.
The strongest hearts have strongest needs,
For them the fiery trial :

Is saint by self-denial.
We ask of God the sunniest way,
He answers with a sorrow;
We faint beneath the cross to-day,

A PERFECT DAY.- Carl Spencer.
THE earth is wrapped in a dream of bliss,
;
And the touch of the air is like a kiss,
Comforting sweet.
And the tiny creatures are singing low
As a lullaby ;
And the watching silence doth stir and glow
As the wind creeps by.
And there is the sun's own mantle flung
On the che inut tops,
And yonder are tangled rainbows hung
With shimmering drops.
And over the things so soon to die
Is a gentler law,
A hush of peace and a tenderer sky
Than the suminer saw.
Open the windows wide to-day,
Where a soul may dwell,
In the heart of a palace grand and gay,
Or a prison cell.
O look, ye happy, till pleasure grows
To a nobler thing:
Till you bring your joy as the ember flows,
For an offering.
And look, ye weary, till grief and pain
Transfigured shine;
Rejoice for the crimson glory's gain,
The holiest sign.

O mourn ye never that hope is lost,
That rest delays;

These sweetest days.

And hearts be sad;
But the Lord hath made us a perfect day-

THE USE OF STUDIES.—Lord Bacon.
STUDIES serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their
chief use for delight is in privateness and retiring; for orna-
ment, is in discourse; and for ability, is in the judgment and dis-
position of business; for, expert men can execute, and perhaps
judge of particulars, one by one; but the general counsels, and
the plots and marshalling of affairs, come best from those that are
learned.
To spend too much time in studies, is sloth; to use them too
much for ornament, is affectation; to make judgment wholly by
their rules, is the humor of a scholar; they perfect nature, and are
perfected by experience—for natural abilities are like natural
plants, that need pruning by study; and studies themselves do
give forth directions too much at large, except they be bounded in
by experience. Crafty men contemn studies, simple men admire
them, and wise men use them; for they teach not their own use;
but that is a wisdom without them, and above them, won by
observation.
Read not to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for
granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider.
Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few
to be chewed and digested: that is, some books are to be read only
in parts; others to be read, but not curiously; and some few to be
read wholly, and with diligence and attention. Some books also
may be read by deputy, and extracts made of them by others; but
that would be only in the less important arguments, and the
meaner sort of books; else distilled books are, like common dis-
tilled waters, flashy things.
Reading maketh a full man; conference a ready man; and
writing an exact man; and, therefore, if a man write little, he had

ning, to seem to know that he doth not.
CHARACTER.–Ralph Waldo Emerson.
I
there was something finer in the man than anything which he
said. It has been complained of our brilliant English historian
of the French Revolution, that when he has told all his facts about
Mirabeau, they do not justify his estimate of his genius. The
Gracchi, Agis, Cleomenes, and others of Plutarch's heroes, do not
in the record of facts equal their own fame. Sir Philip Sidney,
the Earl of Essex, Sir Walter Raleigh, are men of great figure, and
of few deeds. We cannot find the smallest part of the personal
weight of Washington, in the narrative of his exploits. The au-
thority of the name of Schiller is too great for his books.
This inequality of the reputation to the works or the anecdotes,
is not accounted for by saying that the reverberation is longer than
the thunder-clap: but somewhat resided in these men which begot
an expectation that outran all their performance. The largest part
of their power was latent. This is that which we call Character,
-a reserved force which acts directly by presence, and without
It is conceived of as a certain undemonstrable force, a
Familiar or Genius, by whose impulses the man is guided, but
whose counsels he cannot impart; which is company for him, so
that such men are often solitary, or if they chance to be social, do
not need society, but can entertain themselves very well alone.
The purest literary talent appears at one time great, at another
time small, but character is of a stellar and undiminishable great-
ness. What others effect by talent or by eloquence, this man ac-
complishes by some magnetism. “Half his strength he put not
forth.” His victories are by demonstration of superiority, and not
by crossing of bayonets. He conquers, because his arrival alters
the face of affairs. “O Iole! how didst thou know that Hercules
was a god ?” “Because,” answered Iole, “I was content the mo-
ment my eyes fell on him. When I beheld Theseus, I desired
that I might see him offer battle, or at least guide his horses in
the chariot-race; but Hercules did not wait for a contest; he con-
quered whether he stood, or walked, or sat, or whatever thing he
means.

BRUTUS'S ORATION ON THE DEATH OF CAESAR.

be silent, that you may hear; believe me for mine honor;
and have respect to mine honor, that you may believe; censure
me in your wisdom; and awake your senses, that you may the
better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend
of Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus's love to Caesar was no less
than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus rose against
Caesar, this is my answer,-Not that I loved Caesar less, but that
I loved Rome more.
Had you rather Caesar were living, and die all slaves; than that
Caesar were dead, to live all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep
for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was valiant,
I honor him; but, as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is
tears, for his love; joy, for his fortune; honor, for his valor; and
death, for his ambition. Who is here so base, that would be a
bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here
so base, that would not be a Roman? If any, speak; for him have
I offended. Who is here so vile, that will not love his country?
If any, speak; for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
Cit.-None, Brutus, none. (Several speaking at once.)
Bru.—Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
Caesar than you should do to Brutus. The question of his death
is enrolled in the Capitol ; his glory not extenuated, wherein he
was worthy; nor his offences enforced, for which he suffered death.
Here comes his body, mourn'd by Mark Antony; who, though
he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his dying,
a place in the commonwealth ; as which of you shall not? With
this I depart, That, as I slew my best lover for the good of Rome,
I have the same dagger for myself, when it shall please my coun-
try to need my death.

NO DEARTH OF KINDNESS.—Gerald Massey.
THERE'S no dearth of kindness
In this world of ours;
Only in our blindness
We gather thorns for flowers.
There's no dearth of kindness,
Though it be unspoken.
From the heart it buildeth
Rainbow smiles in token
That there be none so lowly
But have some angel touch;
Yet nursing lives unholy,
We live for self too much.
As the wild rose bloweth,
As runs the happy river,
Kindness lively floweth
In the heart forever;
But if men will hanker
Ever for golden dust,
Kindliest hearts will canker,
Brightest spirits rust.
There's no dearth of kindness
In this world of ours,
Only in our blindness
We gather thorns for flowers)
Oh! cherish God's best giving,
Falling from above!
Life were not worth living
Were it not for Love!

And tolls its perfume on the passing air,
Makes Sabbath in the fields, and ever ringeth

Attest the feebleness of mortal hand,
But to that fane most catholic and solemn,
Which God hath planned;
To that cathedral boundless as our wonder,
Whose quenchless lamps the sun and moon supply;
Its choir, the wind and waves; its organ, thunder;
Its dome, the sky.
There, as in solitude and shade, I wander
Through the lone aisles, or stretched upon the sod,
Awed by the silence, reverently ponder

Each a pulpit, and each leaf a book;
Supplying to my fancy numerous teachers,
In loneliest nook.

THE FIRST SNOW-FALL.--Lowell.
THE
THE snow had begun in the gloaming,
And busily all the night
Had been heaping field and highway
With a silence deep and white.
Every pine, and fir, and hemlock,
Bore ermine too dear for an earl,
And the poorest twig on the elm-tree
Was ridged inch-deep with pearl.
From sheds new-roofed with Carrara
Came Chanticleer's muffled crow;
The stiff rails were softened to swan's-down,
And still fluttered down the snow.
I stood and watched by the window
The noiseless work of the sky,
And the sudden flurries of snow-birds,
Like brown leaves whirling by.
I thought of a mound in sweet Auburn,
Where a little headstone stood ;
How the flakes were folding it gently,
As did robins the babes in the wood.

Up spoke our own little Mabel,
Saying, “Father, who makes it snow ?
And I told of the good All-father
Who cares for us here below.
Again I looked at the snow-fall,
And thought of the leaden sky
That arched o'er our first great sorrow
When that mound was heaped so high.
I remembered the gradual patience
That fell from that cloud like snow,
Flake by flake, healing and hiding
The scar of our deep-plunged woe.
And again to the child I whispered,
“ The snow that husheth all,
Darling, the merciful Father
Alone can make to fall !”
Then, with eyes that saw not, I kissed her;
And she, kissing back, could not know
That my kiss was given to her sister,
Folded close under deepening snow.

THE NINETEENTH PSALM.-The Bible.
IE heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament

Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
knowledge.
There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not heard.
Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words to
the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for the
sun,
Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and re-
joiceth as a strong man to run a race.
His going forth is from the end of heaven, and his circuit unto
the ends of it; and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof.
The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul; the testi-
mony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.

THE FIRE-WORSIIIPPER.—Benjamin Franklin.

ND it came to pass after these things, that Abraham sat in the
door of his tent about the going down of the sun.
And behold a man, bowed with age, came from the way of the
wilderness, leaning on a staff.
And Abraham arose and met him, and said unto him, “Turn in,
I pray thee, and wash thy feet, and tarry all night, and thou shalt
arise early on the morrow, and go on thy way.”
But the man said, “Nay, for I will abide under this tree.”
And Abraham pressed him greatly; so he turned, and they went
into the tent, and Abraham baked unleavened bread, and they
did eat.
And when Abraham saw that the man blessed not God, he said
unto him, “Wherefore dost thou not worship the Most High God,
creator of heaven and earth ?”
And the man answered and said, “I do not worship the God
thou speakest of, neither do I call upon his name; for I have made

"
to myself a god, which abideth alway in mine house, and pro-
videth me with all things.”
And Abraham's zeal was kindled against the man, and he arose
and fell upon him, and drove him forth with blows into the wil-
derness.
And at midnight God called unto Abraham, saying, “ Abraham,
where is the stranger ?”
And Abraham answered and said, “Lord, he would not worship
thee, neither would he call upon thy name; therefore have I
driven him out from before my face into the wilderness."
And God said, “Have I borne with him these hundred ninety
and eight years, and nourished him and clothed him, notwith-
standing his rebellion against me; and couldst not thou, that art
thyself a sinner, bear with him one night?”
And Abraham said, “Let not the anger of the Lord wax hot
against his servant; lo, I have sinned ; lo, I have sinned; forgive
me, I pray thee.”
And Abraham arose, and went forth into the wilderness, and
sought diligently for the man and found him, and returned with
him to the tent; and when he had entreated him kindly, he sent
him away on the morrow with gifts.
And God spake again unto Abraham, saying, “For this thy sin
shall thy seed be afflicted four hundred years in a strange land;
But for thy repentance will I deliver them; and they shall
come forth with power, and with gladness of heart, and with much
substance."

choked with poisonous gases, and surrounded with the stench
of sickening odors and rank corruptions, doth your Father in

But in the green glade and grassy dell, where the red deer wan-

And down, low down in the deepest valleys, where the fountains
murmur and the rills sing; and high upon the tall mountain-tops,

storm-cloud broods, and the thunder-storms crash; and away far
out on the wide, wild sea, where the hurricane howls music, and
the big waves roar, the chorus sweeping the march of God: there
he brews it, that beverage of life, the health-giving water.
And everywhere it is a thing of beauty, gleaming in the dew-
drop; singing in the summer rain; shining in the ice-gem, till the
leaves all seem turned to living jewels; spreading a golden veil
over the setting sun, or a white gauze around the midnight moon;
sporting in the cataract; sleeping in the glacier; dancing in the
hail-shower; folding its bright snow-curtain softly about the win-
try world; and weaving the many-colored iris, that seraph’s zone
of the sky, whose warp is the rain-drop of earth, whose woof is
the sunbeam of heaven, all checkered over with celestial flowers
by the mystic hand of refraction.
Still always it is beautiful, that life-giving water; no poison bub-
bles on its brink; its foam brings not madness and murder; no
blood stains its liquid glass; pale widows and starving orphans
weep no burning tears in its depths; no drunken, shrieking ghost
from the grave curses it in the words of eternal despair. Speak
on, my friends; would you exchange it for the demon's drink,
alcohol?
ONLY THE SUNNY HOURS.- Edmund Clarence Stedman.
ONLY the sunny hours,
Are numbered here-
No winter time that lowers,
No twilight drear.
But from a golden sky
When the sunbeams fall,
Though the bright moments fly-
They ’re counted all.
My heart its transient woe
Remembers not!
The ills of long ago
Are half forgot;
But childhood's round of bliss,
Youth's tender thrill,
Hope's whisper, love's first kiss-
They haunt me still!

SHAME upon you, Robin,
THE MILKMAID'S SONG.— Tennyson.

Shame upon you now!
Kiss me, would you ? with my hands
Milking the cow ?
Daisies grow again,
Kingcups blow again,
And you came and kiss'd me milking the cow.
Robin came behind me,
Kiss'd me well, I vow;
Cuff him, could I? with my hands
Milking the cow ?
Swallows fly again,
Cuckoos cry again,
And you came and kiss'd me milking the cow.
Come, Robin, Robin,
Come and kiss me now;
Help it, can I? with my hands
Milking the cow ?
Ringdoves coo again,
All things woo again,
Come behind and kiss me milking the cow!

BEAUTIFUL LEAVES.
FADING beneath our passing feet,
Strewn upon lawn and lane and street,
Beautiful leaves!
Dyed with the hues of the sunset sky,
Falling in glory so silently,
Beautiful leaves !
Never to freshen another spring,
Never to know what the summer may bring,
Beautiful leaves !
Withered beneath the frost and cold,
Soon to decay in the common mould,
Beautiful leaves !
So will the years that change your tint,
Mark upon us their autumnal print,
Beautiful leaves !
So shall we fall from the tree of time,
Fade as ye fade in a wintry clime,
Beautiful leaves!
But when the harvest of life is past,
And we wake in eternal spring at last,
Beautiful leaves !
May he who paints your brilliant hue,
Form of our lives a chaplet new,
Of beautiful leaves !

THE
TOM AND ARTHUR AT RUGBY.- Thomas Hughes.
CHE schoolhouse prayers were the same on the first night as on
the other nights, save for the gaps caused by the absence of
those boys who came late, and the line of new boys, who stood all
together at the farther table of all sorts and sizes, like young
bears with all their troubles to come. Tom Brown thought of it,
as he looked at the line, and poor little slight Arthur standing
with them, and as he was leading him upstairs to No. 4, directly
after prayers, and showing him his bed.
It was a huge, high, airy room, with two large windows looking
on to the school close. There were twelve beds in the room.
The one in the farthest corner was occupied by the sixth-form boy,
who was responsible for the discipline of the room, and the rest by
boys in the lower-fifth and other junior forms,-all fags, for the
fifth-form boys slept in rooms by themselves.
Being fags, the eldest of them was not more than about sixteen
years old, and all were bound to be up and in bed by ten: the
sixth-form boys came to bed from ten to a quarter past (at which
time the old verger came round to put the candles out), except
when they sat up to read.
Within a few minutes, therefore, of their entrance, all the other
boys who slept in No. 4 had come up. The little fellows went
quietly to their own beds, and began undressing, and talking to
each other in whispers; while the elder, amongst whom was Tom,
sat chatting about on one another's beds with their jackets and
waistcoats off.
Poor little Arthur was overwhelmed with the novelty of his
position. The idea of sleeping in the room with strange boys had
clearly never crossed his mind before, and was as painful as it
was strange to him. He could hardly bear to take his jacket off;
however, presently, with an effort, off it came, and then he paused,
and looked at Tom, who was sitting at the bottom of his bed talk-
ing and laughing.
Please, Brown,” he whispered, “may I wash my face and
bands ? "
“Of course, if you like," said Tom, staring. “That's your wash-
stand, under the window, second from your bed. You 'll have to
go down for more water in the morning, if you use it all.” And
on he went with his talk, while Arthur stole timidly from between
the beds out to his washstand, and began his ablutions, thereby
drawing for a moment on himself the attention of the room.

On went the talk and laughter. Arthur finished his washing
and undressing, and put on his night-gown. He then looked round
more nervously than ever. Two or three of the little boys were
already in bed, sitting up with their chins on their knees. The
light burned clear, the noise went on. It was a trying moment
for the poor little lonely boy; however, this time he did n't ask
Tom what he might or might not do, but dropped on his knees by
his bedside, as he had done every day from his childhood.
Tom was sitting at the bottom of his bed, unlacing his boots, so
that his back was towards Arthur, and he did n't see what had
happened, and looked up in wonder at the sudden silence. Then
two or three boys laughed and sneered, and a big brutal fellow,
who was standing in the middle of the room, picked up a slipper,
and shied it at the kneeling boy, calling him a snivelling young
shaver. Then all at once Tom understood what was going on, and
the next moment the boot he had just pulled off flew straight at
the head of the bully, who had just time to throw up his arm and
catch it on his elbow.
“ Confound you, Brown! what do you mean by that?” roared he,
stamping with pain.
“Never mind what I mean,” said Tom, stepping on to the floor,
every drop of blood in his body tingling; “if any fellow wants the
other boot, he knows how to get it."
What would have been the result is doubtful, for at this moment
the sixth-form boy came in, and not another word could be said.
Tom and the rest rushed into bed, and finished their unrobing
there, and the old verger, as punctual as the clock, had put out the
candle in another minute, and toddled on to the next room, shut-
ting their door with his usual “Good-night, genl'm'n.”
There were many boys in the room by whom that little scene
was taken to heart before they slept. But sleep seemed to have
deserted the pillow of poor Tom. For some time his excitement,
and the flood of memories which chased one another through his
brain, kept him from thinking or resolving. His head throbbed,
his heart leaped, and he could hardly keep himself from springing
out of bed and rushing about the room.
Then the thought of his own mother came across him, and the
promise he had made at her knee, years ago, never to forget to
kneel by his bedside, and give himself up to his Father, before
he laid his head on the pillow, from which it might never rise;
and he lay down gently, and cried as if his heart would break.
He was only fourteen years old.

It was no light act of courage in those days, my dear boys, for
a little fellow to say his prayers publicly, even at Rugby. A few
years later, when Arnold's manly piety had begun to leaven the
school, the tables turned; before he died, in the schoolhouse at
least, and I believe in the other houses, the rule was the other
way.
But poor Tom had come to school in other times. The first few
nights after he came, he did not kneel down, because of the noise,
but sat up in bed till the candle was out, and then stole out and
said his prayers, in fear lest some one should find him out. So
did many another poor little fellow. Then he began to think
that he might just as well say his prayers in bed; and then, that
it did n't matter whether he was kneeling, or sitting, or lying
down, and for the last year he had probably not said his prayers
in earnest a dozen times.
Poor Tom! The first and bitterest feeling, which was like to
break his heart, was the sense of his own cowardice. The vice of
all others which he loathed was brought in and burned in on his
own soul. And the poor little weak boy Arthur, whom he had
pitied and almost scorned for his weakness, had done that which
he, braggart as he was, dared not to do.
The first dawn of comfort came to him in swearing to himself
that he would stand by that boy through thick and thin, and cheer
him, and help him, and bear his burdens, for the good deed done
that night. Then Tom resolved to write home next day, and tell
his mother all, and what a coward her son had been. And then
peace came to him as he resolved, lastly, to bear his testimony
next morning. The morning would be harder than the night to
begin with, but he felt that he could not afford to let one chance
slip.
Next morning Tom was up, and washed, and dressed, all but his
jacket and waistcoat, just as the ten-minutes bell began to ring,
and then, in the face of the whole room, knelt down to pray.
Not five words could he say—the bell mocked him; he was listen-
ing for every whisper in the room-what were they all thinking
of him? He was ashamed to go on kneeling, ashamed to rise
from his knees. At last, as it were from his inmost heart, a still
small voice seemed to breathe forth the words of the publican,
“God be merciful to me a sinner!” He repeated them over and
over, clinging to them as for his life, and rose from his knees com-
forted and humbled, and ready to face the whole world.
It was not needed: two other boys besides Arthur had already

followed his example, and he went down to the great school with
a glimmering of another lesson in his heart,—the lesson that he
who has conquered his own coward spirit has conquered the whole
outward world.
He found how greatly he had exaggerated the effect to be pro-
duced by his act. For a few nights there was a sneer or a laugh
when he knelt down, but this passed off soon, and one by one all
the other boys but three or four followed the lead. I fear that
this was in some measure owing to the fact that Tom could prob-
ably have thrashed any boy in the room except the prepositor;
at any rate, every boy knew that he would try upon very slight
provocation, and did n't choose to run the risk of a hard fight be-
cause Tom Brown had taken a fancy to say his prayers.
ONLY A BOY.

ONLY
NLY a boy, with his noise and fun,
The veriest mystery under the sun;
As brimful of mischief, and wit, and glee,
As ever a human frame can be,
And as hard to manage as—what ? ah, me!
'Tis hard to tell,
Yet we loved him well.
Only a boy, with his fearful tread,
Who cannot be driven, must be led.
Who troubles the neighbor's dogs and cats,
And tears more clothes, and spoils more hats,
Loses more kites, and tops, and bats,
Than would stock a store
For a year or more.
Only a boy, with his wild strange ways,
With his idle hours, or his busy days,
With his queer remarks, and his odd replies,
Sometimes foolish, and sometimes wise,
Often brilliant for one of his size,
As a meteor hurled
From the planet world.

Only a boy, who will be a man,
If nature goes on with her first great plan-
If intemperance, or some fatal snare,
Conspire not to rob us of this our heir,
Our blessing, our trouble, our rest, our care,
Our torment, our joy!

THE BOYS.- Oliver Wendell Holmes.
AS there any old fellow got mixed with the boys ?

Hang the almanac's cheat and the catalogue's spite!
Old time is a liar; we 're twenty to-night.
We're twenty! We 're twenty! Who says we are more?
He's tipsy,-young jackanapes !-show him the door!
“Gray temples at twenty ?”—Yes! white, if we please;
Where the snow-flakes fall thickest there's nothing can freeze!
Was it snowing I spoke of! Excuse the mistake!
Look close,-you will not see a sign of a flake!
We want some new garlands for those we have shed,
And these are white roses in place of the red.
We've a trick, we young fellows, you may have been told,
Of talking (in public) as if we were old;
That boy we call “Doctor” and this we call “Judge”!
It's a neat little fiction,-of course, it 's all fudge.
That fellow 's the “Speaker," the one on the right;
“Mr. Mayor," my young one, how are you to-night?
That's our “Member of Congress," we say when we chaff;
There's the “Reverend”-what's his name? - don't make me
laugh.
That boy with the grave mathematical look
Made believe he had written a wonderful book,
And the Royal Society thought it was true,
So they chose him right in,-a good joke it was, too.

There 's a boy, we pretend, with a three-decker brain,
That could harness a team with a logical chain;
When he spoke for our manhood in syllabled fire ;
We call him “The Justice,” but now he's the “Squire."
And there's a nice youngster of excellent pith;
Fate tried to conceal him by naming him Smith;
But he shouted a song for the brave and the free,-
Just read on his medal, “My country,” “ of thee!”
You hear that boy laughing? You think he's all fun;
But the angels laugh, too, at the good he has done;
The children laugh loud as they troop to his call,
And the poor man that knows him laughs loudest of all.
Yes, we ’re boys,-always playing with tongue or with pen;
And I sometimes have asked, Shall we ever be men ?
Shall we always be youthful, and laughing, and gay,
Till the last dear companion drops smiling away ?
Then here's to our boyhood, its gold and its gray !
The stars of its winter, the dews of its May!
And when we have done with our life-lasting toys,
Dear Father, take care of Thy children, THE BOYS!
SOCIETY
THE NECESSITY OF GOVERNMENT.-John C. Calhoun.
can no more exist without government, in one form
or another, than man without society. The political, then, is
man's natural state. It is the one for which his Creator fermed
him, into which he is impelled irresistibly, and the only one in
which his race can exist and all his faculties be fully developed.
It follows that even the worst form of government is better than
anarchy; and that individual liberty or freedom must be subor-
dinate to whatever power may be necessary to protect society
against anarchy within or destruction from without. Just in pro-
portion as people are ignorant, stupid, debased, corrupt, exposed to
violence within and danger without, the power necessary for gov-
ernment to possess, in order to preserve society against anarchy
and destruction, becomes greater and greater, and individual lib-
erty less and less, until the lowest condition is reached, when ah-

solute and despotic power becomes necessary on the part of the
government, and individual liberty becomes extinct.
So, on the contrary, just as a people rise in the scale of intelli-
gence, virtue, and patriotism, and the more perfectly they become
acquainted with the nature of government, the ends for which it
was ordered, and how it ought to be administered, the
power neces-
sary for government becomes less and less, and individual liberty
greater and greater.

ADDRESS AT GETTYSBURG.—Abraham Lincoln.
MOURSCORE and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth
upon this continent a new nation, conceived in liberty and
dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. Now
we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation-
or any nation, so conceived and so dedicated—can long endure.
We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We are met to
dedicate a portion of it as the final resting-place of those who
here gave their lives that that nation might live.
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this. But,
in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we
cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who
struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our power to add or
to detract. The world will little note, nor long remember, what
we say here; but it can never forget what they did here.
It is for us, the living, rather, to be dedicated, here, to the unfin-
ished work that they have thus far so nobly carried on. It is
rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining be-
fore us: that from these honored dead we take increased devotion
to the cause for which they here gave the last full measure of de-
votion;
that we here highly resolve that the dead shall not have
died in vain : that the nation shall, under God, have a new birth
of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people,
and for the people, shall not perish from the earth.
LIBERTY AND UNION.- Daniel Webster.
I
view the prosperity and honor of the whole country, and the
preservation of our Federal Union. It is to that Union we owe
14 *
L

our safety at home, and our consideration and dignity abroad. It
is to that Union that we are chiefly indebted for whatever makes
us most proud of our country.
That Union we reached only by the discipline of our virtues in
the severe school of adversity. It had its origin in the necessities
of disordered finance, prostrate commerce, and ruined credit.
Under its benign influences these great interests immediately
awoke, as from the dead, and sprang forth with newness of life.
Every year of its duration has teemed with fresh proofs of its
utility and its blessings; and, although our territory has stretched
out wider and wider, and our population spread farther and farther,
they have not outrun its protection or its benefits. It has been to
us all a copious fountain of national, social, and personal happi-
ness.
I have not allowed myself, sir, to look beyond the Union to see
what might lie hidden in the dark recess behind. I have not
coolly weighed the chances of preserving liberty when the bonds
that unite us together shall be broken asunder. I have not ac-
customed myself to hang over the precipice of disunion to see
whether, with my short sight, I can fathom the depth of the abyss
below; nor could I regard him as a safe counsellor in the affairs of
this government whose thoughts should be mainly bent on con-
sidering not how the Union may be best preserved, but how toler-
able might be the condition of the people when it should be broken
up and destroyed.
While the Union lasts, we have high, exciting, gratifying pros-
pects spread out before us, for us and our children. Beyond that
I seek not to penetrate the veil. God grant that in my day, at
least, that curtain may not rise! God grant that on my vision
never may be opened what lies behind! When my eyes shall be
turned to behold, for the last time, the sun in heaven, may I not
see him shining on the broken and dishonored fragments of a
once glorious Union; on States dissevered, discordant, belligerent;
on a land rent with civil feuds, or drenched, it may be, in fraternal
blood!
Let their last feeble and lingering glance rather behold the
gorgeous ensign of the Republic, now known and honored through-
out the earth, still full-high advanced, its arms and trophies stream-
ing in their original lustre, not a stripe erased or polluted, nor a
single star obscured; bearing for its motto no such miserable inter-
rogatory as What is all this worth ? nor those other words of delusion
and folly, Liberty first and Union afterwards; but everywhere, spread

Y the flow of the inland river,
Whence the fleets of iron have fled,
Where the blades of the grave-grass quiver,
Asleep are the ranks of the dead;
Under the sod and the dew,
Waiting the judgment-day;
Under the one, the Blue;
Under the other, the Gray.
These in the robings of glory,
Those in the gloom of defeat,
All with the battle-blood gory,
In the dusk of eternity meet:
Under the sod and the dew,
Waiting the judgment-day;
Under the laurel, the Blue;
Under the willow, the Gray.
From the silence of sorrowful hours
The desolate mourners go,
Lovingly laden with flowers,
Alike for the friend and the foe:
Under the sod and the dew,
Waiting the judgment-day;
Under the roses, the Blue;
Under the lilies, the Gray.
So, with an equal splendor,
The morning sun-rays fall,
With a touch impartially tender,
On the blossoms blooming for all:
Under the sod and the dew,
Waiting the judgment-day;

Broidered with gold, the Blue;
Mellowed with gold, the Gray.
So, when the summer calleth,
On forest and field of grain,
With an equal murmur falleth
The cooling drip of the rain:
Under the sod and the dew,
Waiting the judgment-day;
Wet with the rain, the Blue;
Wet with the rain, the Gray.
Sadly, but not with upbraiding,
The generous deed was done;
In the storms of the years that are fading
No braver battle was won:
Under the sod and the dew,
Waiting the judgment-day;
Under the blossoms, the Blue;
Under the garlands, the Gray.
No more shall the war-cry sever,
Or the winding rivers be red;
They banish our anger forever
When they laurel the graves of our dead :
Under the sod and the dew,
Waiting the judgment-day;
Love and tears for the Blue;
Tears and love for the Gray.

She call'd her eagle-bearer down,
And gave into his mighty hand
The symbol of her chosen land.
Majestic monarch of the cloud !
Who rear'st aloft thy regal form,
To hear the tempest trumpings loud
And see the lightning lances driven,
When strive the warriors of the storm,
And rolls the thunder-drum of heaven
Child of the sun! to thee 't is given
To guard the banner of the free,
To hover in the sulphur smoke,
To ward away the battle-stroke,
And bid its blendings shine afar,
Like rainbows on the cloud of war,
The harbingers of victory!
Flag of the brave! thy folds shall fly,
The sign of hope and triumph high !
When speaks the signal trumpet tone,
And the long line comes gleaming on,
Ere yet the life-blood, warm and wet,
Has dimm'd the glistening bayonet,
Each soldier's eye shall brightly turn
To where thy sky-born glories burn,
And as his springing steps advance,
Catch war and vengeance from the glance.
And when the cannon-mouthings loud
Heave in wild wreaths the battle-shroud,
And gory sabres rise and fall,
Like shoots of flame on midnight's pall,
Then shall thy meteor glances glow,
And cowering foes shall sink beneath
Each gallant arm that strikes below
That lovely messenger of death.
Flag of the seas ! on ocean wave .
Thy stars shall glitter o'er the brave;
When death, careering on the gale,
Sweeps darkly round the bellied sail,

With freedom's soil beneath our feet,

WHAT CONSTITUTES A STATE.-Sir William Jones.
WHAT
HAT constitutes a state ?
Not high-raised battlements or labored mound,
Thick wall or moated gate;
Not cities proud, with spires and turrets crowned;
Not bays and broad-arm ports,
Where, laughing at the storm, rich navies ride;
Not starred and spangled courts,
Where low-browed baseness wafts perfume to pride.
No:--men-high-minded men,
With powers as far above dull brutes endued
In forest, brake, or den,
As beasts excel cold rocks and brambles rude;
Men, who their duties know,
But know their rights, and, knowing, dare maintain,
Prevent the long-aimed blow,
And crush the tyrant while they rend the chain ;
These constitute a state;
And sovereign law, that state's collected will,
O'er thrones and globes elate
Sits empress, crowning good, repressing ill.

Smit by her sacred frown,
The fiend, Dissension, like a vapor sinks;
And e'en the all-dazzling crown
Hides his faint rays, and at her bidding shrinks.
Such was this heaven-loved isle,
Than Lesbos fairer, and the Cretan shore!
No more shall Freedom smile?
Shall Britons languish and be men no more?
Since all must life resion,
Those sweet rewards which decorate the brave
'Tis folly to decline,
And steal inglorious to the silent grave.
CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON.- Charles Phillips.
YIR,
the birthplace of such a man as Washington. No people can
claim, no country can appropriate him. The boon of Providence
to the human race, his fame is eternity, and his residence creation.
Though it was the defeat of our arms, and the disgrace of our
policy, I almost bless the convulsion in which he had his origin.
If the heavens thundered, and the earth rocked, yet, when the
storm had past, how pure was the climate that it cleared! how
bright in the brow of the firmament was the planet which it re-
vealed to us!
In the production of Washington it does really appear as if
Nature was endeavoring to improve upon herself, and that all the
virtues of the ancient world were but so many studies preparatory,
to the patriot of the new. Individual instances, no doubt, there
were, splendid exemplifications of some single qualification: Caesar
was merciful, Scipio was continent, Hannibal was patient; but it
was reserved for Washington to blend them all in one, and, like
the lovely masterpiece of the Grecian artist, to exhibit, in one
glow of associated beauty, the pride of every model and the per-
fection of every master.
As a general, he marshalled the peasant into a veteran, and sup-
plied, by discipline, the absence of experience; as a statesman, he.
enlarged the policy of the cabinet into the most comprehensive
system of general advantage; and such was the wisdom of his

views and the philosophy of his counsels, that to the soldier and
the statesman he almost added the character of the sage! A con-
queror, he was untainted with the crime of blood; a revolutionist,
he was free from any stain of treason; for aggression commenced
the contest, and his country called him to the command. Liberty
unsheathed his sword, necessity stained, victory returned it.
If he had paused here, history might have doubted what station
to assign him; whether at the head of her citizens, or her soldiers;
her heroes, or her patriots. But the last glorious act crowns his
career and banishes all hesitation. Who, like Washington, after
having emancipated a hemisphere, resigned its crown and pre-
ferred the retirement of domestic life to the adoration of a land

Happy, proud America! The lightnings of heaven yielded to

AVALANCHES OF THE JUNGFRAU.-G. B. Cheever.
SUDDENLY an enormous mass of snow and ice, in itself a
,
mountain, seems to move; it breaks from the toppling out-
most mountain ridge of snow, where it is hundreds of feet in
depth, and in its first fall of perhaps two thousand feet is broken
into millions of fragments. As you first see the flash of distant
artillery by night, then hear the roar, so here you may see the
white, flashing mass majestically bowing, then hear the astound-
ing din.
A cloud of dusty, dry snow rises into the air from the concus-
sion, forming a white volume of fleecy smoke, or misty light, from
the bosom of which thunders forth the icy torrent in its second
prodigious fall over the rocky battlements. The eye follows it
delighted, as it ploughs through the path which preceding ava-
lanches have worn, till it comes to the brink of a vast ridge of bare
rock, perhaps more than two thousand feet perpendicular; then
pours the whole cataract over the gulf, with a still louder roar of
echoing thunder, to which nothing but the noise of Niagara in its
sublimity is comparable.
Another fall of still greater depth ensues, over a second similar
castellated ridge or reef in the surface of the mountain, with an
awful, majestic slowness, and a tremendous crash in its concus-
sion, awakening again the reverberating peals of thunder. Then

the torrent roars on to another smaller fall, till at length it reaches
a mighty groove of snow and ice. Here its progress is slower; and
last of all, you listen to the roar of the falling fragments as they
drop out of sight, with a dead weight, into the bottom of the gulf,
to rest there forever.
Figure to yourself a cataract like that of Niagara, poured in
foaming grandeur, not merely over one great precipice of two
hundred feet, but over the successive ridgy precipices of two or
three thousand, in the face of a mountain eleven thousand feet
high, and tumbling, crashing, thundering down with a continu-
ous din of far greater sublimity than the sound of the grandest
cataract.
The roar of the falling mass begins to be heard the moment it
is loosened from the mountain; it pours on with the sound of a
vast body of rushing water; then comes the first great concussion,
a booming crash of thunders, breaking on the still air in mid-
heaven; your breath is suspended, and you listen and look; the
mighty, glittering mass shoots headlong over the main precipice,
and the fall is so great that it produces to the eye that impression
of dread, majestic slowness of which I have spoken, though it is
doubtless more rapid than Niagara. But if you should see the
cataract of Niagara itself coming down five thousand feet above
you in the air, there would be the same impression.
The image remains in the mind, and can never fade from it; it
is as if you had seen an alabaster cataract from heaven. The
sound is far more sublime than that of Niagara, because of the
preceding stillness in those Alpine solitudes. In the midst of
such silence and solemnity, from out the bosom of those glorious,
glittering forms of nature, comes that rushing, crashing thunder-
burst of sound! If it were not that your soul, through the eye,
is as filled and fixed with the sublimity of the vision as, through
the sense of hearing, with that of the audible report, methinks
you would wish to bury your face in your hands, and fall prostrate,
as at the voice of the Eternal.
HUMAN LIFE.—THE TEMPEST.-Shakespeare.

And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
The cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,
The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
Yea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve;
And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
As dreams are made of, and our little life
Is rounded with a sleep.
THE POWER OF MUSIC.
Tre MerchanT OF VENICE. --Shakespeare.
WEET soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,
Within the house your mistress is at hand;
And bring your music forth into the air. -
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music
Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
Become the touches of sweet harmony.
Sit, Jessica: Look, how the floor of Heaven
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold.
There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
But in his motion like an angel sings,
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims;
Such harmony is in immortal souls ;
But while this muddy vesture of decay
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.-
The man that hath no music in himself,
Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
Is fit for treason, stratagems, and spoils;
The motions of his spirit are dull as night,
And his affections dark as Erebus:
Let no such man be trusted.

SOLILOQUY OF BRUTUS. -Julius CÆSAR. —Shakespeare.
T must be by his death: and, for my part,
,
But for the general. He would be crowned :
How that might change his nature, there's the question:
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
And that craves wary walking. Crown him ;-that;-
And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
That at his will he may do danger with.
Th’ abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
Remorse from power; and, to speak truth of Cæsar,
I have not known when his affections sway'd
More than his reason. But 't is a common proof,
That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
But, when he once attains the upmost round,
He then unto the ladder turns his back,
Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
By which he did ascend: so Cæsar may;
Then lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
Will bear no color for the thing he is,
Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
Would run to these and these extremities;
And, therefore, think him as a serpent's egg,
Which, hatched, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
And kill him in the shell.
GLIMPSES INTO CLOUDLAND.-H. W. Longfellow.
L
IFE is one and universal, its forms many and individual.
Throughout this beautiful and wonderful creation there is
never-ceasing motion, without rest by night or day; ever weaving
to and fro. Swifter than a weaver's shuttle it flies from Birth to
Death, from Death to Birth; from the beginning seeks the end,
and finds it not, for the seeming end is only a dim beginning of a
new outgoing and endeavor after the end.
As the ice upon the mountain, when the warm breath of the
summer sun breathes upon it, melts and divides into drops, each

love, divides itself into separate forms, each bearing in it and re-
flecting an image of God's love. Of all these forms, the highest
and most perfect in its God-likeness is the human soul.
The vast cathedral of NATURE is full of holy scriptures, and
shapes of deep, mysterious meaning. But all is solitary and silent
there; no bending knee, no uplifted eye, no lip adoring, praying.
Into this vast cathedral comes the human soul, seeking its Cre-
ator; and the universal silence is changed to sound, and the sound
is harmonious and has a meaning, and is comprehended and felt.
It was an ancient saying of the Persians, that the waters rush
from the mountains and hurry forth into all the lands to find the
Lord of the Earth; and the flame of the fire, when it awakes,
gazes no more upon the ground, but mounts heavenward to seek
the Lord of Heaven; and here and there the Earth has built the
great watch-towers of the mountains, and they lift their heads far
up into the sky, and gaze ever upward and around, to see if the
Judge of the World comes not!
Thus in Nature herself, without man, there lies a waiting and
hoping, a looking and yearning, after an unknown somewhat.
Yes; when, above there, where the mountain lifts its head over
all others, that it may be alone with the clouds and storms of
heaven, the lonely eagle looks forth into the gray dawn, to see if
the day comes not; when, by the mountain torrent, the brooding
raven listens to hear if the chamois is returning from his nightly
pasture in the valley; and when the soon uprising sun calls out
the spicy odors of the thousand flowers, the Alpine flowers, with
heaven's deep blue and the blush of sunset on their leaves :—then
there awake in Nature, and the soul of man can see and compre-
hend them, an expectation and a longing for a future revelation
of God's majesty.
They awake, also, when, in the fulness of life, field and forest
rest at noon, and through the stillness are heard only the song of
the grasshopper and the hum of the bee; and when at evening
the singing lark up from the sweet-smelling vineyards rises, or in
the later hours of night Orion puts on his shining armor, to walk
forth into the fields of heaven. But in the soul of man alone is
this longing changed to certainty, and fulfilled.
For, lo! the light of the sun and the stars shines through the
air, and is nowhere visible and seen; the planets hasten with
more than the speed of the storm through infinite space, and their
footsteps are not heard; but where the sunlight strikes the firm
surface of the planets, where the storm-wind smites the wall of

Thus is the glory of God made visible, and may be seen, where in
the soul of man it meets its likeness changeless and firm standing.
Thus, then, stands Man ;-a mountain on the boundary between
two worlds ;-its foot in one, its summit far rising into the other.
From this summit the manifold landscape of life is visible, the
way of the Past and Perishable, which we have left behind us;
and as we evermore ascend, bright glimpses of the day break of
Eternity beyond us!

was many and many a year ago,
In a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden lived, whom you may know
By the name of Annabel Lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love, and be loved by me.
I was a child and she was a child,
In this kingdom by the sea;
But we loved with a love that was more than love,
I and my Annabel Lee-
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me.
And this was the reason that, long ago,
In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful Annabel Lee;
So that her high-born kinsmen came
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom by the sea.
The angels, not half so happy in heaven,
Went envying her and me.
Yes! that was the reason (as all men know)
In this kingdom by the sea,
That the wind came out of the cloud by night
Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we,

And neither the angels in heaven above,
Nor the demons down under the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.
For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee,
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;
And so all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling, my darling, my life and my bride,
In her sepulchre there by the sea,
In her tomb by the sounding sea.

As she swings all day in the boughs above.

And a student ever should books prefer,
But she's such a darling, dainty maiden,
My thoughts go swinging away with her.
See-saw!

Up in the apple-tree Margery swings;
And I, lying under,
Watch her, and wonder
What is the ditty that Margery sings.
And she goes swinging; and I go slaving,
Turning the leaves of a musty book,
But surely that was her white hand waving,
And surely that was my darling's look.
A perfect fortress of books I sit in,
Ethics, economy, politics, law,
But all the pages I vow were written
By that little philosopher, Margery Daw.

And Margery I no more behold her:

But whenever I'm sad and whenever I'm lonely,
Back comes Margery, back again.

EXTRACTS FROM "AN INCIDENT.”- Lowell.
GOD
OD scatters love on every side,
Freely among his children all,
And always hearts are lying open wide,
Wherein some grains may fall.
There is no wind but soweth seeds
Of a more true and open life,
Which burst, unlooked-for, into high-souled deeds,
With wayside beauty rife.
We find within these souls of ours
Some wild germs of a higher birth,
Which in the poet's tropic heart bear flowers
Whose fragrance fills the earth.

All thoughts that mould the age begin
Deep down within the primitive soul,
And from the many slowly upward win
To one who grasps the whole:
All thought begins in feeling,-wide
In the great mass its base is hid,
And, narrowing up to thought, stands glorified,
A moveless pyramid.
Nor is he far astray who deems
That every hope, which rises and grows broad
In the world's heart, by ordered impulse streams
From the great heart of God.
God wills, man hopes: in common souls
Hope is but vague and undefined,
Till from the poet's tongue the message rolls
A blessing to his kind.

gently, that their footsteps made no noise, but there were sobs
from among the group, and sounds of grief and mourning.
For she was dead. There, upon her little bed, she lay at rest.
The solemn stillness was no marvel now.
She was dead. No sleep so beautiful and calm, so free from trace
of pain, so fair to look upon. She seemed a creature fresh from
the hand of God, and waiting for the breath of life; not one who
had lived and suffered death.
Her couch was dressed with here and there some winter berries
and green leaves, gathered in a spot she had been used to favor.
“When I die, put near me something that has loved the light, and
had the sky above it always." These were her words.
She was dead. Dear, gentle, patient, noble Nell was dead. Her
little bird-a poor slight thing the pressure of a finger would have
crushed-was stirring nimbly in its cage; and the strong heart of
its child-mistress was mute and motionless forever.
Where were the traces of her early cares, her sufferings, and
fatigues? All gone. Sorrow was dead indeed in her, but peace
and perfect happiness were born; imaged in her tranquil beauty
and profound repose.
And still her former self lay there, unaltered in this change.
Yes. The old fireside had smiled upon that same sweet face; it
had passed like a dream through haunts of misery and care; at the
door of the poor schoolmaster on the summer evening, before the
furnace fire upon the cold, wet night, at the still bedside of the
dying boy, there had been the same mild, lovely look. So shall we
know the angels in their majesty, after death.
The old man held one languid arm in his, and had the small
hand tight folded to his breast, for warmth. It was the hand she
had stretched out to him with her last smile—the hand that had
led him on through all their wanderings. Ever and anon he pressed
it to his lips; then hugged it to his breast again, murmuring that
it was warmer now; and as he said it, he looked, in agony, to those
who stood around, as if imploring them to help her.
She was dead, and past all help, or need of it. The ancient
rooms she had seemed to fill with life, even while her own was
waning fast-the garden she had tended--the eyes she had glad-
dened-the noiseless haunts of many a thoughtful hour—the
paths she had trodden, as if it were but yesterday—could know
her never more.

Heaven's justice ends. Think what earth is compared with the

THE PEN AND TONGUE.—Henry Ward Beecher.
WHEN
CHEN St. James says, “If any man offend not in word, the
same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the whole
body," one is at first surprised. It would seem to place the sum
of virtue in a very little thing. But a larger experience of life
would change our opinion. The tongue is the exponent of the
soul. It is the flame which it issues, as lightning is the tongue
of the clouds. It is the sword of anger, the club of brutal rage,
the sting of envy. It is the soul's right hand, by which it strikes
with wasting power. On the other hand, the tongue is the soul's
voice of mercy; the string on which its love vibrates as music;
the pencil with which it fashions its fairest pictures; the almoner
of its gifts; the messenger of its bounties !
By speech a man may touch human life within and without.
No sceptre has such power in a king's hand, as the soul hath in a
ready tongue; which also has this advantage, that well uttered
words never die, but go sounding on to the end of the world, not
lost when seemingly silent, but rising and falling between the
generations of men, as ships rise and fall between waves, hidden
at times, but not sunken. A fit speech is like a sweet and favorite
tune. Once struck out, it may be sung or played forever. It flies
from man to man, and makes its nest in the heart as birds do
in trees.
This is remarkably exemplified in maxims and proverbs.
generation of men by their experience prove some moral truth,
and all know it as a matter of consciousness. By and by some
happy man puts the truth into words, and ten thousand people
say, He got that from me; for a proverb is a child born from ten
thousand parents. Afterwards the proverb has the liberty of the
world. A good proverb wears a crown and defies revolution or
dethronement. It walks up and down the earth, an invisible
knight-errant helping the needy. A man might frame and set

loose a star to roll in its orbit, and yet not have done so meinora
ble a thing before God as he who lets go a golden-orbed speech
to roll through the generations of time.
The tongue may be likened to an organ, which, though but one
instrument, has within it an array of different pipes and stops,
and discourses in innumerable combinations. If one man sits
before it not skilled to control its powers, he shall make it but a
monstrous jargon. But when one comes who knows its ways, and
has control of its powers, then it becomes a mountain of melody,
and another might well think he heard the city of God in the
hour of its singing. The tongue is the key-board of the soul; but
it makes a world of difference who sits to play upon it. “There-
with bless we God, and therewith curse we men.” It is sweeter
than honey; it is bitterer than gall. It is balm and consolation; it
is sharper than a serpent's tooth. It is a wand that touches with
hope and lifts us up; it is a mace that beats us down, and leaves
us wounded upon the ground. One trumpet, but how different
the blasts blown upon it, by love, by joy, by humility, or by hatred,
pride, anger!
A heart that is full of goodness, that loves and pities, that yearns
to invest the richest of its mercy in the souls of those that need
it-how sweet a tongue hath such a heart! A flute sounded in a
wood, in the stillness of evening, and rising up among leaves that
are not stirred by the moonlight above, or by those murmuring
sounds beneath; a clock, that sighs at half-hours, and at the full
hours beats the silver bell so gently, that we know not whence the
sound comes, unless it falls through the air from heaven, with
sounds as sweet as dewdrops make, in heaven, falling upon flow-
ers; a bird whom perfumes have intoxicated, sleeping in a blos-
somed tree, so that it speaks in its sleep with a note so soft that
sound and sleep strive together, and neither conquer, but the
sound rocks itself upon the bosom of sleep, each charming the
other; a brook that brings down the greeting of the mountains to
the meadows, and sings a serenade all the way to the faces that
watch themselves in its brightness ;-these, and a hundred like
figures, the imagination brings to liken thereunto the charms of a
tongue which love plays upon.
Even its silence is beautiful. Under a green tree we see the
stream so clear that nothing is hidden to the bottom. We cast in
round, white pebbles to hear them plash, and to see the crystal-
eyed fish run in and sail out again. So there are some whose
speaking is like the fall of jasper stones upon the silent river, and

whose stillness follows speech as silent fish that move like dreams
beneath the untroubled water! It was in some such dreaming
mood, methinks, old Solomon spoke: “A wholesome tongue is a
tree of life.” And what fruit grows thereon, he explains, when
he afterwards
says, “A word fitly spoken, is like apples of gold in
baskets of silver,”—beautiful whether seen through the silver net-
work of the sides, or looked upon from above, resting their orbed
ripeness upon the fretted edge of the silver bed.
THE FIRST VIEW OF THE HEAVENS.-O. M. Mitchel.
OFTEN
FTEN have I swept backward, in imagination, six thousand
years, and stood beside our great ancestor, as he gazed for the
first time upon the going down of the sun. What strange sen-
sations must have swept through his bewildered mind, as he
watched the last departing ray of the sinking orb, unconscious
whether he should ever behold its return.
Wrapped in a maze of thought, strange and startling, he suffers
his eye to linger long about the point at which the sun had slowly
faded from view. A mysterious darkness creeps over the face of
Nature; the beautiful scenes of earth are slowly fading, one by
one, from his dimmed vision.
A gloom deeper than that which covers earth steals across the
mind of earth's solitary inhabitant. He raises his inquiring gaze
towards heaven; and lo! a silver crescent of light, clear and
beautiful, hanging in the western sky, meets his astonished gaze.
The young moon charms his untutored vision, and leads him up-
ward to her bright attendants, which are now stealing, one by
one, from out the deep blue sky. The solitary gazer bows, won-
ders, and adores.
The hours glide by; the silver moon is gone; the stars are
rising, slowly ascending the heights of heaven, and solemnly
sweeping downward in the stillness of the night. A faint streak
of rosy light is seen in the east; it brightens; the stars fade; the
planets are extinguished; the eye is fixed in mute astonishment
on the growing splendor, till the first rays of the returning sun
dart their radiance on the young earth and its solitary inhabitant.
The curiosity excited on this first solemn night, the conscious-
ness that in the heavens God had declared his glory, the eager
desire to comprehend the mysteries that dwell in their bright

orbs, have clung, through the long lapse of six thousand years, to
the descendants of him who first watched and wondered. In
this boundless field of investigation, human genius has won its
most signal victories.
Generation after generation has rolled away, age after age has
swept silently by; but each has swelled, by its contributions, the
stream of discovery. Mysterious movements have been unrav-
elled; mighty laws have been revealed; ponderous orbs have
been weighed; one barrier after another has given way to the
force of intellect; until the mind, majestic in its strength, has
mounted, step by step, up the rocky height of its self-built pyra-
mid, from whose star-crowned summit it looks out upon the
grandeur of the universe self-clothed with the prescience of a
God.
BE A WOMAN.- Edward Brooks.
OFT
T I've heard a gentle mother,
As the twilight hours began,
Pleading with a son, of duty,
Urging him to be a man;
But unto her blue-eyed daughter,
Though with love's words quite as ready,
Points she out this other duty,-
"Strive, my dear, to be a lady."
What’s a lady? Is it something
Made of hoops and silks and airs,
Used to decorate the parlor,
Like the fancy mats and chairs ?
Is it one who wastes on novels
Every feeling that is human ?
If 't is this to be a lady,
'T is not this to be a woman.
Mother, then, unto your daughter
Speak of something higher far
Than to be mere fashion's lady-
Woman is the brightest star.
If you in your strong affection
Urge your son to be a true man,
Urge your daughter no less strongly
To arise and be a woman.

Be a brave, whole-souled, true woman!
THE
THE WOMAN'S CAUSE.- Tennyson.
THE woman's cause is man's: they rise or sink
Together, dwarfed or godlike, bond or free;
For she that out of Lethe scales with man
The shining steps of Nature, shares with man
His nights, his days, moves with him to one goal,
Stays all the fair young planet in her hands-
If she be small, slight-natured, miserable,
How shall men grow? but work no more alone!
Our place is much: as far as in us lies
We two will serve them both in aiding her,-
Will clear away the parasitic forms
That seem to keep her up, but drag her down,-
Will leave her space to burgeon out of all
Within her-let her make herself her own
To give or keep, to live and learn and be
All that not harms distinctive womanhood.
For woman is not undeveloped man,
But diverse; could we make her as the man,
Sweet love were slain; his dearest bond is this, -
Not like to like, but like in difference.

Yet in the long years liker must they grow;
The man be more of woman, she of man;
He gain in sweetness and in moral height,
Nor lose the wrestling thews that throw the world;
She mental breadth, nor fail in childward care,
Nor lose the childlike in the larger mind;
Till at the last she set herself to man,
Like perfect music unto noble words;
And so these twain, upon the skirts of Time,
Sit side by side, full-summed in all their powers,
Dispensing harvest, sowing the To-be,
Self-reverent each and reverencing each,
Distinct in individualities,
But like each other even as those who love.
Then comes the statelier Eden back to men:
Then reign the world's great bridals, chaste and calm:
Then springs the crowning race of humankind.
May these things be.

Whene'er is spoken a noble thought,
Our hearts, in glad surprise,
To higher levels rise.
The tidal wave of deeper souls
Into our inmost being rolls,
And lifts us unawares
Out of all meaner cares.
Honor to those whose words or deeds
Thus help us in our daily needs,
And by their overflow
Raise us from what is low!

Of the great army of the dead,

In dreary hospitals of pain,
The cheerless corridors,
The cold and stony floors.
Lo! in that house of misery
A lady with a lamp I see
Pass through the glimmering gloom,
And fit from room to room.

And slow, as in a dream of bliss,
The speechless sufferer turns to kiss
Her shadow, as it falls
Upon the darkening walls.
As if a door in Heaven should be
Opened and then closed suddenly,
The vision came and went,
The light shone and was spent.
On England's annals, through the long
Hereafter of her speech and song,
That light its rays shall cast
From portals of the past.
A lady with a lamp shall stand
In the great history of the land,
A noble type of good,
Heroic womanhood.
Nor even shall be wanting here
The palm, the lily, and the spear,
The symbols that of yore
Saint Filomena bore.

nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor,
and though I give my body to be burned, and have not charity,
it profiteth me nothing.
Charity suffereth long, and is kind; charity envieth not; charity
vaunteth not itself, is not puffed up, doth not behave itself un-
seemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked, thinketh no
evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; beareth
all things, believeth all things, hopeth all things, endureth all
things. Charity never faileth: but whether there be prophecies,
they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease;
whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away. For we know
in part, and we prophesy in part. But when that which is per-
fect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.
When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child,
I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away
childish things. For now we see through a glass, darkly; but
then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know
even as also I am known. And now abideth faith, hope, charity,
these three; but the greatest of these is charity.
THE WINTER-SPIRIT AND HIS VISITOR.
Cornelius Mathews.
AN
N old man was sitting alone in his lodge by the side of a
frozen stream. It was the close of winter, and his fire was
almost out. He appeared very old and very desolate. His locks
were white with age and he trembled in every joint. Day after
day passed in solitude, and he heard nothing but the sounds of
the tempest, sweeping before it the new-fallen snow.
One day, as his fire was just dying, a handsome young man
approached and entered his dwelling. His cheeks were red with
- the blood of youth; his eyes sparkled with life, and a smile played
upon his lips. He walked with a light and quick step. His fore-
head was bound with a wreath of sweet grass, in place of the
warrior's frontlet, and he carried a bunch of flowers in his hand.
“Ah! my son,” said the old man, “I am happy to see you.
Come in. Come, tell me of your adventures, and what strange
lands you have been to see. Let us pass the night together. I
will tell you of my prowess and exploits, and what I can perform.
You shall do the same, and we will amuse ourselves."

He then drew from his sack a curiously wrought antique pipe,
and having filled it with tobacco, rendered mild by an admixture
of certain dried leaves, he handed it to his guest. When this
ceremony was attended to, they began to speak.
“I blow my breath,” said the old man, “and the streams stand
still. The water becomes stiff and hard as clear stone."
“I breathe,” said the young man, “and flowers spring up all
over the plains.”
“I shake my locks,” retorted the old man, “and snow covers
the land. The leaves fall from the trees at my command, and
my breath blows them away. The birds rise from the water and
fly to a distant land. The animals hide themselves from the
glance of my eye, and the very ground where I walk becomes as
hard as flint.”
“I shake my ringlets,” rejoined the young man, “and warm
showers of soft rain fall upon the earth. The plants lift up their
heads out of the ground, like the eyes of children glistening with
delight. My voice recalls the birds. The warmth of my breath
unlocks the streams. Music fills the groves wherever I walk, and
all nature welcomes my approach.”
At length the sun began to rise. A gentle warmth came over
the place. The tongue of the old man became silent. The robin
and the bluebird began to sing on the top of the lodge. The
stream began to murmur by the door, and the fragrance of grow-
ing herbs and flowers came softly on the vernal breeze.
Daylight fully revealed to the young man the character of his
entertainer. When he looked upon him he had the visage of
Peboan, the icy old Winter-Spirit. Streams began to flow from
his eyes. As the sun increased he grew less and less in stature,
and presently he had melted completely away. Nothing remained
on the place of his lodge-fire but the miskedeed, a small white
flower with a pink border, which the young visitor, Seegwun, the
Spirit of Spring, placed in the wreath upon his brow, as his first
trophy in the North.
INTELLIGENCE AN ELEMENT OF SUCCESS.
Rev. Daniel Wise.

tleman for whom some enamored fairy wrought a precious
talisman, which had the power to attract all persons who came

near the wearer to himself. The charm wrought powerfully on
the companions of the fortunate nobleman; and he was loved
with wondrous affection by a large circle of admiring friends.
If such a talisman were attainable, at the cost of much labor,
suffering, and even of danger, many a young man would seek it
with incredible industry. His imagination would be charmed by
the idea. He would be ready to attempt the ascent of the Andes,
or the exploration of the dreary realms of the Ice King, around
the poles.
But when that same young man is told that, unless neutralized
by moral deficiencies, knowledge is really a precious talisman, com-
manding the respect and influencing the opinions and conduct of
all minds within his sphere of action,-elevating its possessor to
influence, to honor, and, possibly, to fortune,-he turns away with
apathy, perhaps with scorn. He disdains mental toil. However
physically industrious he may be, he is intelle ctually too lazy to
read, reflect, and study. Books are the objects of his fixed dislike.
He would be delighted to wield a commanding influence, to
make a deep mark in the world; but he is too slothful, too sen-
suous, to prosecute the studies which, by expanding, strengthen-
ing, and developing the intellect, lead to high achievements and
eminence. He prefers to waste his leisure hours in idle lounging,
in frivolous amusement, in unprofitable companionships. What is
the consequence? It requires no prophetic afflatus to predict that
such a young man will spend his days in comparative obscurity,–
that on his
“Grassy grave
The men of future times will careless tread,
And read his name upon the sculptured stone;
Nor will the sound, familiar to their ears,
Recall his vanished memory.”
The mind is the glory of the man. The power of the counte-
hance to attract depends more on the thoughtfulness of the soul
than upon its conformity to the laws of beauty. The utmost ele-
gance of physical formation, the most lovely and delicately chis-
elled features, unless accompanied by high intellectual expression,
cease to please after they become familiar; while “ dignity robes
the man who is filled with a lofty thought,” notwithstanding the
symmetry of his features may be imperfect, and the proportions
of his form unequal. And, seeing how much of success in life
often depends upon outward impressions, it is important to 8.
young man to robe himself in the attractive dignity of thought.

HERE is the true man's fatherland ?
Is it where he by chance is born ?
Doth not the yearning spirit scorn
In such scant borders to be spanned ?
O, yes! his fatherland must be,
As the true heaven, wide and free!
Is it alone where freedom is,
Where God is God, and man is man?
Doth he not claim a broader span
For the soul's love of home than this?
O, yes! his fatherland must be,
As the blue heaven, wide and free!
Where'er a human heart doth wear
Joy's myrtle-wreath or sorrow's gyves,
Where'er a human spirit strives
After a life more true and fair,
There is the true man's birthplace grand-
His is a world-wide fatherland!
Where'er a single slave doth pine,
Where'er one man may help another, -
Thank God for such a birthright, brother,–
That spot of earth is thine and mine!
There is the true man's birthplace grand-
His is a world-wide fatherland!

The shutters are shut, no light may pass
Save two long rays through the hinge's chink.

Sixteen years old when she died !
Perhaps she had scarcely heard my name;
It was not her time to love; beside,
Her life had many a hope and aim,
Duties enough, and little cares,
And now was quiet, now astir,
Till God's hand beckoned unawares, -
And the sweet white brow is all of her.
Is it too late, then, Evelyn Hope ?
What! your soul was pure and true;
The good stars met in your horoscope,
Made you of spirit, fire, and dew;
And just because I was thrice as old,
And our paths in the world diverged so wide,
Each was nought to each, must I be told?
We were fellow-mortals,-nought beside ?
No, indeed! for God above
Is great to grant as mighty to make,
And creates the love to reward the love;
I claim you still, for my own love's sake!
Delayed, it may be, for more lives yet,
Through worlds I shall traverse, not a few;
Much is to learn and much to forget
Ere the time be come for taking you.
But the time will come-at last it will
When, Evelyn Hope, what meant, I shall say,
In the lower earth, in the years long still,
That body and soul so pure and gay?
Why your hair was amber, I shall divine,
And your mouth of your own geranium's red, -
And what you would do with me, in fine,
In the new life come in the old one's stead.
I have lived, I shall say, so much since then,
Given up myself so many times,
Gained me the gains of various men,
Ransacked the ages, spoiled the climes ;
Yet one thing, one, in my soul's full scope,
Either I missed or itself missed me,-
And I want and find you, Evelyn Hope!
What is the issue ? let us see!

I loved you, Evelyn, all the while;
My heart seemed full as it could hold, -
There was place and to spare for the frank young smile,
And the red young mouth, and the hair's young gold.
So, hush! I will give you this leaf to keep;
See, I shut it inside the sweet, cold hand.
There, that is our secret! go to sleep;
You will wake, and remember, and understand.
THE SNOW-SHOWER. William Cullen Bryant.
STAN
TAND here by my side and turn, I pray,
On the lake below thy gentle eyes;
The clouds hang over it, heavy and gray,
And dark and silent the water lies;
And out of that frozen mist the snow
In wavering flakes begins to flow;
Flake after flake,
They sink in the dark and silent lake.
See how in the living swarm they come
From the chambers beyond that misty veil;
Some hover awhile in air, and some
Rush prone from the sky like summer hail.
All, dropping swiftly or settling slow,
Meet, and are still in the depths below;
Flake after flake
Dissolved in the dark and silent lake.
Here delicate snow-stars, out of the cloud,
Come floating downward in airy play,
Like spangles dropped from the glistening crowd
That whiten by night the Milky Way;
There broader and burlier masses fall;
The sullen water buries them all, -
Flake after flake,-
All drowned in the dark and silent lake.
-
And some, as on tender wings they glide
From their chilly birth-cloud, dim and gray,

Are joined in their fall, and, side by side,
Come clinging along their unsteady way;
As friend with friend, or husband with wife,
Makes, hand in hand, the passage of life;
Each mated flake
Soon sinks in the dark and silent lake.
Lo! while we are gazing, in swifter haste
Stream down the snows, till the air is white,
As, myriads by myriads madly chased,
They fling themselves from their shadowy height.
The fair, frail creatures of middle sky,
What speed they make, with their grave so nigh;
Flake after flake,
To lie in the dark and silent lake!
I see in thy gentle eyes a tear;
They turn to me in sorrowful thought;
Thou thinkest of friends, the good and dear,
Who were for a time, and now are not;
Like these fair children of cloud and frost,
That glisten a moment and then are lost, -
Flake after fake,-
All lost in the dark and silent lake.
-
Yet look again, for the clouds divide;
A gleam of blue on the water lies;
And far away, on the mountain side,
A sunbeam falls from the opening skies.
But the hurrying host that flew between
The cloud and the water, no more is seen;
Flake after flake,
At rest in the dark and silent lake.
EXECUTION OF MARIE ANTOINETTE.-Thomas Carlyle.
ON
N Monday, the 14th of October, 1793, a cause was pending in
the Hall of Justice, in the new Revolutionary Court, such as
those old stone walls never before witnessed,—the trial of Marie
Antoinette. The once brightest of queens, now tarnished, de-
faced, forsaken, stands here at the judgment-bar, answering for

her life. The indictment was delivered her last night. To such
changes of human fortune, what words are adequate! Silence
alone is adequate.
Marie Antoinette, in this her utter abandonment and hour of ex-
treme need, is not wanting to herself, the imperial woman. Her
look, they say, as that hideous indictment was reading, continued
calm; "she was sometimes observed moving her fingers, as when
one plays on the piano." You discern, not without interest, across
that dim revolutionary bulletin itself, how she bears herself
queen-like. Her answers are prompt, clear, often of laconic
brevity; resolution, which has grown contemptuous without ceas-
ing to be dignified, veils itself in calm words. “You persist,
then, in denial ?” “My plan is not denial; it is the truth I have
said, and I persist in that.”
At four o'clock on Wednesday morning, after two days and two
nights of interrogating, jury-charging, and other darkening of
counsel, the result comes out,-sentence of death!
anything to say?” The accused shook her head, without speech.
Night's candles are burning out; and with her, too, time is finish-
ing, and it will be Eternity and Day. The Hall of Justice is dark
and ill-lighted, except where she stands. Silently she withdraws
from it, to die.
Two processions, or royal progresses, three-and-twenty years
apart, have often struck us with a strange feeling of contrast.
The first is of a beautiful archduchess and dauphiness, quitting
her mother's city, at the age of fifteen, towards hopes, such as no
other daughter of Eve then had. “On the morrow,” says Weber,
an eye-witness, “the dauphiness left Vienna. The whole city
crowded out; at first, with a sorrow which was silent. She ap-
peared; you saw her sunk back into her carriage, her face bathed
in tears; hiding her eyes, now with her handkerchief, now with
her hands; several times putting out her head to see, yet again,
this palace of her fathers, whither she was to return no more.
“She motioned her regret, her gratitude to the good nation
which was crowding here to bid her farewell. Then arose not
only tears, but piercing cries, on all sides. Men and women,
alike, abandoned themselves to such expression of their sorrow.
It was an audible sound of wail, in the streets and avenues of
Vienna. The last courier that followed her disappeared, and the
crowd melted away.”
The young, imperial maiden of fifteen has now become a worn,
discrowned widow of thirty-eight, gray before her time. This is

the last procession: A few minutes after the trial ended, the
drums were beating to arms in all sections; at sunrise, the armed
force was on foot, cannons getting placed at the extremities of the
bridges, in squares and crossways. By ten o'clock, numerous
patrols were circulating in the streets; thirty thousand foot and
horse were drawn up under arms.
“At eleven, Marie Antoinette was brought out, dressed in white.
She was led to the place of execution in the same manner as an
ordinary criminal ;-bound on a cart, accompanied by a constitu-
tional priest in lay dress, escorted by numerous detachments of
infantry and cavalry. These, and the double row of troops all
along the road, she appeared to regard with indifference.
“On her countenance there was visible neither abashment nor
pride. To the cries of 'Live the Republic!' and 'Down with
Tyranny!' which attended her all the way, she seemed to pay no
heed. The tricolor streamers on the housetops, and the inscrip-
tions on the house-fronts, occupied her attention. She mounted
the scaffold with courage, and at a quarter past twelve her head
fell; the executioner showed it to the people, amid universal, long-
continued cries of Vive lu Republique.”
A MAN OVERBOARD.- Victor Hugo.
MAN overboard! What matters it! the ship does not stop.
A
tined course. She passes away. The man disappears, then re-
appears; he plunges and rises again to the surface; he calls, he
stretches out his hands, they hear him not; the ship, staggering
under the gale, is straining every rope; the sailors and passengers
see the drowning man no longer; his miserable head is but a
point in the vastness of the billows.
He hurls cries of despair into the depths. What a spectre is
that disappearing sail! He looks upon it, he looks upon it with
frenzy. It moves away; it grows dim, it diminishes. He was
there but just now; he was one of the crew; he went and came
upon the deck with the rest; he had his share of the air and of
the sunlight; he was a living man. Now, what has become of
him? He slipped, he fell; and it is finished. He is in the mon-
strous deep. He has nothing under his feet but the yielding
fleeing element.

The waves, torn and scattered by the wind, close round him hid-
eously; the rolling of the abyss bears him along; shreds of water
are flying about his head; a populace of waves spit upon him; con-
fused openings half swallow him; when he sinks he catches glimpses
of yawning precipices full of darkness; fearful unknown vegeta-
ons eize upon him, bind his feet, and draw him to themselves;
he feels that he is becoming the great deep; he makes part of the
foam; the billows toss him from one to the other; he tastes the
bitterness; the greedy ocean is eager to devour him; the monster
plays with his agony. It seems as if all this were liquid hate.
But yet he struggles. He tries to defend himself; he tries to
sustain himself; he struggles; he swims. He-that poor strength
that fails so soon-he combats the unfailing. Where now is the
ship? Far away yonder. Hardly visible in the pallid gloom of
the horizon. The wind blows in gusts; the billows overwhelm
him. He raises his eyes, but sees only the livid clouds. He, in
his dying agony, makes part of this immense insanity of the sea.
He is tortured to his death by its immeasurable madness. He
hears sounds, which are strange to man-sounds which seem not
to come from earth, but from some frightful realm beyond. There
are birds in the clouds, even as there are angels above human
distresses, but what can they do for him? They fly, sing, and
float, while he is gasping.
He feels that he is buried at once by those two infinities—the
ocean and the sky; the one is a tomb, the other a pall. Night
descends; he has been swimming for hours, his strength is almost
exhausted; that ship, that far-off thing, where there were men,
is gone; he is alone in the terrible gloom of the abyss; he
sinks, he strains, he struggles, he feels beneath him the shadowy
monsters of the unseen; he shouts. Men are no more. Where
is God? He shouts. Help! Help! He shouts incessantly.
Nothing in the horizon. Nothing in the sky. He implores the
blue vault, the waves, the rocks; all are deaf. He supplicates the
tempest; the imperturbable tempest obeys only the Infinite.
Around him are darkness, storm, solitude, wild and unconscious
tumult, the ceaseless tumbling of the fierce waters; within him,
horror and exhaustion. Beneath him, the engulfing abyss. No
resting-place. He thinks of the shadowy adventures of his life-
less body in the limitless gloom. The biting cold paralyzes him.
His hands clutch spasmodically, and grasp at nothing. Winds,
clouds, whirlwinds, blasts, stars, all useless! What shall he do?
He yields to despair; worn out, he seeks death; he no longer

resists; he gives himself up; he abandons the contest, and he is
rolled away into the dismal of the abyss for ever.
O implacable march of human society! Destruction of men
and of souls marking its path! Ocean, where fall all that the law

T was fifty years ago,
In the pleasant month of May,
In the beautiful Pays de Vaud,
A child in its cradle lay.
And Nature, the old nurse, took
The child upon its knee,
Saying, “Here is a story-book
Thy father has written for thee.
“Come, wander with me,” she said,
“Into regions yet untrod;
And read what is still unread
In the manuscripts of God.”
And he wandered away and away
With Nature, the dear old nurse,
Who sang to him night and day
The rhymes of the universe.
And whenever the way seemed long,
Or his heart began to fail,
She would sing a more wonderful song,
Or tell a more wonderful tale.
So she keeps him still a child,
And will not let him go,
Though at times his heart beats wild
For the beautiful Pays de Vaud;

The Ranz des Vaches of old,

From glaciers, clear and cold;

And thought of the rich man 'cross the way.
“Hammer and anvil for me,” he said,
“And weary toil for the children's bread.
“For him, soft carpets and pictured walls,
A life of ease in his spacious halls."
The clang of bells on his dreaming broke;
flicker of flame, a whirl of smoke.
Ox in travis, forge grown white-hot,
Coat and hat were alike forgot,
As up the highway the blacksmith ran,
In face and mien like a crazy man.
“School-house afire!” Men's hearts stood still,
And the women prayed as women will,
While 'bove the tumult the wailing cry
Of frightened children rose shrill and high.
Night in its shadows hid sun and earth;
The rich man sat by his costly hearth,
Lord of wide acres and untold gold,
But wifeless, childless, forlorn and old.
He thought of the family 'cross the way;
“I would,” he sighed, “I were David Grey."
The blacksmith knelt at his children's bed
To look once more at each shining head.

Give! as the free air and sunshine are given;
Lavishly, utterly, carelessly give.
Not the waste drops of thy cup overflowing,
Not the faint sparks of thy hearth ever glowing,
Not a pale bud from the June roses glowing;
Give as He gave thee, who gave thee to live.
Pour out thy love like the rush of a river
Wasting its waters forever and ever,
Through the burnt sands that reward not the giver;
Silent or songful, when nearest the sea.
Scatter thy life as the summer-shower's pouring!
What if no bird through the pearl-rain is soaring ?
What if no blossom looks upward adoring?
Look to the life that was lavished for thee!
Give, though thy heart may be wasted and weary,
Laid on an altar all ashen and dreary ;
Though from its pulses a faint miserere
Beats to thy soul the sad presage of fate,
Bind it with cords of unshrinking devotion;
Smile at the song of its restless emotion;

What shall thy loving avail in the grave ?
Give as the heart gives whose fetters are breaking,
Life, love, and hope, all thy dreams and thy waking;
Soon heaven's river, thy soul-fever slaking,
Thou shalt know God and the gift that he gave.
WISHING.–Saxe.
OF ,
From logic down to fishing,
There is n't one that you can find
So very cheap as wishing.
A very choice diversion too,
If we but rightly use it,
And not, as we are apt to do,
Pervert it and abuse it.
I wish-a common wish, indeed-
My purse were somewhat fatter,
That I might cheer the child of need,
And not my pride to flatter;
That I might make Oppression reel,
As only gold can make it,
And break the Tyrant's rod of steel,
As only gold can break it.
I wish that Sympathy and Love,
And every human passion
That has its origin above,
Would come and keep in fashion;

That Scorn, and Jealousy, and Hate,
And every base emotion,
Were buried fifty fathom deep
Beneath the waves of Ocean!
I wish that friends were always true,
And motives always pure;
I wish the good were not so few,
I wish the bad were fewer;
I wish that parsons ne'er forgot
To heed their pious teaching;
I wish that practising was not
So different from preaching !
I wish-that modest worth might be
Appraised with truth and candor;
I wish that innocence were free
From treachery and slander;
I wish that men their vows would mind;
That women ne'er were rovers;
I wish that wives were always kind,
And husbands always lovers !
I wish-in fine—that Joy and Mirth,
And every good Ideal,
May come erewhile throughout the earth
To be the glorious Real ;
Till God shall every creature bless
With his supremest blessing,
And Hope be lost in Happiness,
And Wishing in Possessing!

Who can deny that the existence of such a country presents a
subject for human congratulation! Who can deny that its gigantic
advancement offers a field for the most rational conjecture! At
the end of the very next century, if she proceeds as she seems to
promise, what a wondrous spectacle may she not exhibit! Whoº
shall say for what purpose mysterious Providence may not have
designed her! Who shall say that when in its follies or its
crimes the Old World may have buried all the pride of its power,
and all the pomp of its civilization, human nature may not find
its destined renovation in the New? When its temples and its
trophies shall have mouldered into dust; when the glories of its
name shall be but the legend of tradition, and the light of its
achievements live only in song; philosophy will revive again in
the sky of her Franklin, and glory will rekindle at the urn of her
Washington.
Is this the vision of romantic fancy? Is it even improbable?
I appeal to History. Tell me, thou reverend chronicler of the
grave, can all the illusions of ambition realized,-can all the
wealth of an universal commerce,-can all the achievements of
successful heroism, or all the establishments of this world's wis-
dom, secure to empire the permanency of its possessions ? Alas,
Troy thought so once; yet the land of Priam lives only in song !
Thebes thought so once; yet her hundred gates have crumbled,
and her very tombs are but as the dust they were vainly intended
to commemorate! So thought Palmyra, — where is she? So
thought the countries of Demosthenes and the Spartan; yet,
Leonidas is trampled by the timid slave, and Athens insulted by
the servile, mindless, and enervate Ottoman.
In his hurried march, Time has but looked at their imagined
immortality, and all its vanities, from the palace to the tomb,
have, with their ruins, erased the very impression of his footsteps.
The days of their glory are as if they had never been; and the
island that was then a speck, rude and neglected in the barren
ocean, now rivals the ubiquity of their commerce, the glory of
their arms, the fame of their philosophy, the eloquence of their
senate, and the inspiration of their bards! Who shall say, then,
contemplating the past, that England, proud and potent as she
appears, may not one day be what Athens is, and the young
America yet soar to be what Athens was? Who shall say, when
the European column shall have mouldered, and the night of

dark forms upon her deck may be discerned a pale-faced boy,
some sixteen summers old. He is leaning over the bulwarks, ab-
sorbed in a dreamy reverie. His imagination is traversing the
future of his career. Filled with the gay illusions of hope, he
peoples the years to come with images of success. He beholds
himself rising from post to post, in his dangerous profession, until
he fancies himself the commander of a great fleet. He wins brill-
iant victories; wealth, honors, fame, surround him. He is a great
His name is in the mouth of the world. There is a circle
of glory round his brow.
Filled with the idea, he starts! His young heart heaving with
great purposes, his eyes gleaming with the fire of his enkindled
soul, his slender form expanding to its utmost height, and his lips
moving with energy,-he paces the silent deck, exclaiming, “I
will be a hero; and, confiding in Providence, I will brave every
danger!” Such was the romantic dream of young Horatio Nelson;
afterwards the hero of the Nile, the victor of Trafalgar, and the
greatest naval commander in the world! And what young man
has not had imaginings equally romantic?
Where is the poor sailor-boy who has not dreamed of glory and
greatness ? What young law student has not seen in himself a
future Littleton, Coke, or Story? Where is the printer's apprentice
who has not intended to be a Franklin ? What young mechanic
has not, in fancy, written his name beside the names of Ark-
wright, Fulton, or Rumford ? What boyish artist has not, in im-
agination, rivalled Raphael or Michael Angelo? What youthful
orator has not gathered the glory of Burke, Chatham, or Patrick
Henry around his own name? Nay! There never was a young
man, of any advantages, who did not rise to eminent success, in
his hours of reverie. For youth is the period of dreams, in which
Queen Mab, with her fairy crew, holds undisputed reign over the
imagination, and revels at will in the hall of fancy, in the palace
of the soul.

But why, since all dream of greatness, do so few attain it? Why
stand Nelson, Story, Fulton, Burke, etc., alone, in the realization
of imaginings, among ten thousand of their peers, whose early
dreams were as bright and vivid as their own? Why do so few
young men distinguish themselves, out of the many whose hopes,
purposes, and resolves are as radiant as the colors of the rain-
bow?
The answer is obvious. Young men are not willing to devote
themselves to that process of slow, toilsome self-culture which is
the price of great success. Could they soar to eminence on the
lazy wings of genius, the world would be filled with great men.
But this can never be; for, whatever aptitude for particular pur-
suits Nature may donate to her favorite children, she conducts
none but the laborious and the studious to distinction. Cicero
and Demosthenes, those unrivalled orators of antiquity, were
diligent students. Sir William Jones, the greatest of oriental
scholars; Newton, the first of philosophers; Burke, the chief of
modern orators; Michael Angelo, the model of artists; Haydn
and Handel, those peerless masters of the musical art; John Quincy
Adams, the diplomatist and statesman; all mounted the throne
of their fame step by step. Their glory gathered around them by
degrees. Each added ray was the result of intense application.
It was not genius so much as GENIUS SEDULOUSLY CULTIVATED,
that enabled them to write their names so high on the pillar of
fame. Great men have ever been men of thought as well as men
of action. As the magnificent river, rolling in the pride of its
mighty waters, owes its greatness to the hidden springs of the
mountain nook, so does the wide-sweeping influence of distin-
guished men date its origin from hours of privacy resolutely em-
ployed in efforts after self-development. The invisible spring
of self-culture is the source of every great achievement.
TACT AND TALENT.-London Atlas.
TALENT is something, but tact is everything. Talent is serious,
: too
It is not a sixth sense, but it is the life of all the five. It is the
open eye, the quick ear, the judging taste, the keen smell, and the
lively touch ; it is the interpreter of all riddles, the surmounter
of all difficulties, the remover of all obstacles. It is useful in all

places, and at all times; it is useful in solitude, for it shows a man
his way into the world; it is useful in society, for it shows him
his way through the world.
Talent is power, tact is skill; talent is weight, tact is momentum;
talent knows what to do, tact knows how to do it; talent makes a
man respectable, tact will make him respected; talent is wealth,
tact is ready money. For all the practical purposes of life, tact
carries it against talent, ten to one. Take them to the theatre,
and put them against each other on the stage, and talent shall
produce you a tragedy that will scarcely live long enough to be
condemned, while tact keeps the house in a roar, night after night,
with its successful farces. There is no want of dramatic talent,
there is no want of dramatic tact; but they are seldom together:
80 we have successful pieces which are not respectable, and re-
spectable pieces which are not successful.
Take them to the bar, and let them shake their learned curls at
each other in legal rivalry. Talent sees its way clearly, but tact
is first at its journey's end. Talent has many a compliment from
the bench, but tact touches fees from attorneys and clients. Talent.
speaks learnedly and logically, tact triumphantly. Talent makes
the world wonder that it gets on no faster, tact excites astonish-
ment that it gets on so fast. And the secret is, that tact has no
weight to carry; it makes no false steps; it hits the right nail on
the head; it loses no time; it takes all hints; and, by keeping its
eye on the weathercock, is ready to take advantage of every wind
that blows.
Take them into the church. Talent has always something worth
hearing, tact is sure of abundance of hearers; talent may obtain a
living, tact will make one; talent gets a good name, tact a great
one; talent convinces, tact converts; talent is an honor to the
profession, tact gains honor from the profession. Take them to
court. Talent feels its weight, tact finds its way; talent commands,
tact is obeyed; talent is honored with approbation, and tact is
blessed by preferment.
Place them in the senate. Talent has the ear of the house, but
tact wins its heart, and has its votes; talent is fit for employment,
but tact is fitted for it. Tact has a knack of slipping into place
with a sweet silence and glibness of movement, as a billiard bail
insinuates itself into the pocket. It seems to know everything,
without learning anything. It has served an invisible and ex-
temporary apprenticeship; it wants no drilling; it never ranks in
the awkward squad; it has no left hand, no deaf ear, no blind

ABOU BEN ADHEM.-Leigh Hunt.
A
BOU BEN ADHEM (may his tribe increase!)
Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,
And saw, within the moonlight in his room,
Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom,
An angel, writing in a book of gold.
66
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,
And to the Presence in the room he said,
What writest thou?” The vision raised its head,
And, with a look made of all sweet accord,
Answered, “ The names of those who love the Lord.”
“And is mine one?” said Abou; “Nay, not so,"
Replied the angel.—Abou spoke more low,
But cheerily still; and said, “I pray thee, then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow-men.”
The angel wrote, and vanish’d. The next night
It came again, with a great wakening light,
And showed the names whom love of God had bless'd-
And, lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.

To die ;—to sleep ;-
To sleep! perchance to dream ;-Ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life:
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of dispriz'd love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin ?
Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life;
But that the dread of something after death,-
The undiscovered country from whose bourn
No traveller returns,-puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;
And enterprises of great pith and moment,
With this regard, their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.

Through what new scenes and changes must we pass !
The wide, the unbounded prospect lies before me;
But shadows, clouds, and darkness rest upon it.
Here will I hold. If there's a Power above us,
(And that there is, all Nature cries aloud
Through all her works,) He must delight in virtue;
And that which He delights in must be happy.
But when? or where? This world was made for Caesar.
I'm weary of conjectures. This must end them.
(Laying his hand on his sword.)
Thus am I doubly armed: my death and life,
My bane and antidote, are both before me:
This in a moment brings me to an end;
But this informs me I shall never die.
The soul, secured in her existence, smiles
At the drawn dagger, and defies its point.
The stars shall fade away, the sun himself
Grow dim with age, and Nature sink in years;
But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth,
Unhurt amid the war of elements,
The wreck of matter, and the crash of worlds.

And take them kindly, though they touch your pride;
Words lead to things; a scale is more precise, -
Coarse speech, bad grammar, swearing, drinking, vice.

The native freedom of the Saxon lips;
See the brown peasant of the plastic south,
How all his passions play about his mouth!
With us, the feature that transmits the soul,
A frozen, passive, palsied breathing-hole.
The crampy shackles of the ploughboy's walk
Tie the small muscles when he strives to talk;
Not all the pumice of the polished town
Can smooth this roughness of the barnyard down;

Rich, honored, titled, he betrays his race
By this one mark,-he's awkward in the face;-
Nature's rude impress, long before he knew
The sunny street that holds the sifted few.
It can't be helped, though, if we're taken young,
We gain some freedom of the lips and tongue;
But school and college often try in vain
To break the padlock of our boyhood's chain;
One stubborn word will prove this axiom true;-
No quondam rustic can enunciate view.
A few brief stanzas may be well employed
To speak of errors we can all avoid.
Learning condemns beyond the reach of hope
The careless churl who speaks of soap for soap;
Her edict exiles from her fair abode
The clownish voice that utters road for road;
Less stern to him who calls his coat a coat,
And steers his boat, believing it a boat.
She pardoned one, our classic city's boast,
Who said, at Cambridge, most instead of most;
But knit her brows, and stamp'd her angry foot,
To hear a teacher call a rõot a root.
Once more; speak clearly, if you speak at all;
Carve every word before you let it fall;
Don't, like a lecturer or dramatic star,
Try over-hard to roll the British R;
Do put your accents in the proper spot;
Don't-let me beg you don't say
“How?” for “What?”
And, when you stick on conversation's burs,
Don't strew the pathway with those dreadful urs.

brink of the Rubicon!” How came he to the brink of that river ?

of private property, and shall a man pay no respect to the boun-
daries of his country's rights? How dared he cross that river?
Oh! but he paused upon the brink. He should have perished
upon the brink ere he had crossed it! Why did he pause? Why
does a man's heart palpitate when he is on the point of commit-
ting an unlawful deed? Why does the very murderer, his victim
sleeping before him, and his glaring eye taking the measure of the
blow, strike wide of the mortal part? Because of conscience!
’T was that made Caesar pause upon the brink of the Rubicon.
Compassion! What compassion? The compassion of an assassin
that feels a momentary shudder, as his weapon begins to cut!
Caesar paused upon the brink of the Rubicon! What was the
Rubicon? The boundary of Caesar's province. From what did
it separate his province ? From his country. Was that country a
desert? No; it was cultivated and fertile, rich and populous !
Its sons were men of genius, spirit, and generosity! Its daughters
were lovely, susceptible, and chaste! Friendship was its inhab-
itant! Love was its inhabitant! Domestic affection was its in-
habitant! Liberty was its inhabitant! All bounded by the stream
of the Rubicon!
What was Caesar, that stood upon the bank of that stream? A
traitor, bringing war and pestilence into the heart of that country!
No wonder that he paused,
1,-no wonder if, his imagination wrought
upon by his conscience, he had beheld blood instead of water, and
heard groans instead of murmurs! No wonder, if some Gorgon
horror had turned him into stone upon the spot! But no!-he
cried, “The die is cast!” He plunged !-he crossed! and Rome
was free no more!

noon, they are pale and wan, and in the southern sky a red, fiery
glow, as of sunset, burns along the horizon, and then goes out.
And pleasantly under the silver moon, and under the silent,
solemn stars, ring the steel-shoes of the skaters on the frozen
sea, and voices, and the sound of bells.
And now the Northern Lights begin to burn, faintly at first,
like sunbeams playing in the waters of the blue sea. Then a soft
crimson glow tinges the heavens. There is a blush on the cheek
of night. The colors come and go; and change from crimson to
gold, from gold to crimson. The snow is stained with rosy light.
Twofold from the zenith, east and west, flames a fiery sword; and
a broad band passes athwart the heavens, like a summer sunset.
Soft purple clouds come sailing over the sky, and through their
vapory folds the winking stars shine white as silver. With such
pomp as this is Merry Christmas ushered in, though only a single
star heralded the first Christmas.
And in memory of that day, the Swedish peasants dance on
straw; and the peasant girls throw straws at the timbered roof
of the hall, and for every one that sticks in a crack shall a gentle-
man come to their wedding. Merry Christmas, indeed! For
pious souls there shall be church songs and sermons, but for
Swedish peasants brandy and nut-brown ale in wooden bowls;
and the great yule-cake crowned with a cheese, and garlanded
with apples, and upholding a three-armed candlestick over the
Christmas feast. They may tell tales, too, of Jöns Lundsbracka,
and Lunkenfus, and the great Riddar Finke of Pingsdaga.*
And now the glad, leafy midsummer, full of blossoms and the
song of nightingales, is come! Saint John has taken the flowers
and festival of heathen Balder; and in every village there is a
May-pole fifty feet high, with wreaths and roses and ribbons
streaming in the wind, and a noisy weathercock on top, to tell the
village whence the wind cometh and whither it goeth. The sun
does not set till ten o'clock at night; and the children are at play
in the streets an hour later. The windows and doors are all open,
and you may sit and read till midnight without a candle. O
how beautiful is the summer night, which is not night, but a
sunless, yet unclouded day, descending upon earth with dews; and
shadows, and refreshing coolness! How beautiful the long, mild
twilight, which like a silver clasp unites to-day with yesterday!

night!
From the church tower in the public square the bell tolls the
hour, with a soft, musical chime; and the watchman, whose watch-
tower is the belfry, blows a blast in his horn, for each stroke of
the hammer, and four times to the four corners of the heavens,
in a sonorous voice he chants,-
“Ho! watchman, ho!
Twelve is the clock !
God keep our town
From fire and brand
And hostile hand!

From his swallow's nest in the belfry he can see the sun all
night long; and farther north the priest stands at his door in the
warm midnight, and lights his pipe with a common burning-
glass.

Where lie those happier hills and meadows low,-
Ah, if beyond the spirit's utmost cavil,
Aught of that country could we surely know,

The hovering angels' high imagined chorus,
Or catch, betimes, with wakeful eyes and clear,
One radiant vista of the realm before us,–
With one rapt moment given to see and hear,
Ah, who would fear?
Were we quite sure
To find the peerless friend who left us lonely,
Or there, by some celestial stream as pure,
To gaze in eyes that here were love-lit only,–
This weary mortal coil, were we quite sure,
Who would endure ?

And to the meadow trips along;
The sunbeams slant along the vale,
And sweetly rings her milking-song:
Heigho! heigho!
A milking I go.
Come, Spot, and come, Bonnie,
Come, Brindle, come, Brownie;
The sun fast is sinking,
The bright stars are blinking;
Come to me, my darlings,
'Tis Katie who calls."
The meadows in the gold rain glisten,
The cricket stops his chirp to listen;
As o'er the grass the sweet voice rings,
Lo! high upon the topmost spray,
A robin gayly sings.
Colin hears the sweet voice call,
And sees the kine go lowing to her;
No call for him, and yet he goes,
Ah! twilight is the time to woo her:
"Heigho! heigho!
A milking I go.
Come, Spot, and come, Bonnie,
Come, Brindle, come, Brownie;
The sun fast is sinking,
The bright stars are blinking;
Come to me, my darlings,
'Tis Katie who calls."
So Colin leans upon the bars,
And wooeth Katie, till the stars
Shine through the haze the twilight brings,
And still, upon the topmast spray,
The robin gayly sings.
The years they roll, the summers go.

While from the vale the sweet voice rings,

THERE IS NO DEATH.-J. L. McCreery.
THERE is no death! The stars go down
!
To rise upon some fairer shore;
And bright in Heaven's jewelled crown
They shine for evermore.
There is no death! The dust we tread
Shall change beneath the summer showers
To golden grain or mellowed fruit,
Or rainbow-tinted flowers.
The granite rocks disorganize,
And feed the hungry moss they bear;
The forest leaves drink daily life
From out the viewless air.
There is no death! The leaves may fall,
And flowers may fade and pass away;
They only wait through wintry hours,
The coming of the May.
There is no death! An angel form
Walks o'er the earth with silent tread;
He bears our best loved things away ;
And then we call them “dead."

He plucks our fairest, sweetest flowers;
Transplanted into bliss, they now
Adorn immortal bowers.
The bird-like voice, whose joyous tones
Made glad these scenes of sin and strife,
Sings now an everlasting song
Around the tree of life.
Where'er he sees a smile too bright,

He bears it to that world of light,
To dwell in Paradise.
Born unto that undying life,

With joy we welcome them the same, —

The dear immortal spirits tread;
For all the boundless universe

THE TEACHERS OF MANKIND.—Lord Brougham.
THERE
WHERE is nothing which these adversaries of improvement are
more wont to make themselves merry with than what is
termed the “march of intellect;" and here I will confess that I
think, as far as the phrase goes, they are in the right. It is a very
absurd, because a very incorrect, expression. It is little calculated
to describe the operation in question. It does not picture an image
at all resembling the proceedings of the true friends of mankind.
It much more resembles the progress of the enemy to all improve-

The conqueror moves in a march. He stalks onward with the
“pride, pomp, and circumstance of war,”—banners flying, shouts
rending the air, guns thundering, and martial music pealing, to
drown the shrieks of the wounded and the lamentations of the
slain. Not thus the school-master, in his peaceful vocation. He

meditates and prepares in secret the plans which are to bless man-
kind; he slowly gathers round him those who are to further their
execution; he quietly, though firmly, advances in his humble
path, laboring steadily, but calmly, till he has opened to the light
all the recesses of ignorance, and torn up by the roots the weeds
of vice. His is a progress not to be compared with anything like
a march; but it leads to a far more brilliant triumph, and to lau-
rels more imperishable, than the destroyer of his species, the
scourge of the world, ever won.
Such men-men deserving the glorious title of Teachers of man-
kind-I have found laboring conscientiously, though perhaps ob-
scurely, in their blessed vocation, wherever I have gone. I have
found them, and shared their fellowship, among the daring, the
ambitious, the ardent, the indomitably active French; I have
found them among the persevering, resolute, industrious Swiss;
I have found them among the laborious, the warm-hearted, the
enthusiastic Germans; I have found them among the high-minded,
but enslaved, Italians; and in our own country, God be thanked,
their number everywhere abounds, and is every day increasing.
Their calling is high and holy; their fame is the property of
nations; their renown will fill the earth in after-ages, in pro-
portion as it sounds not far off in their own times. Each one of
those great teachers of the world, possessing his soul in peace,
performs his appointed course, awaits in patience the fulfilment
of the promises, and, resting from his labors, bequeaths his mem-
ory to the generation whom his works have blessed, and sleeps
under the humble but not inglorious epitaph, commemorating
one in whom mankind lost a friend, and no man got rid of an
enemy."

THE AMERICAN INDIAN.-Charles Sprague.
ОТ
NºT many generations ago, where you now sit, circled with all
that exalts and embellishes civilized life, the rank thistle
nodded in the wind, and the wild fox dug his hole unscared.
Here lived and loved another race of beings. Beneath the same
sun that rolls over your heads, the Indian hunter pursued the
panting deer; gazing on the same moon that smiles for you, the
Indian lover wooed his dusky mate.
Here the wigwam blaze beamed on the tender and helpless, the
council-fire glared on the wise and daring. Now they dipped

their noble limbs in your sedgy lakes, and now they paddled the
light canoe along your rocky shores. Here they warred; the
echoing whoop, the bloody grapple, the defying death-song, all
were here; and when the tiger-strife was over, here curled the
smoke of peace.
Here, too, they worshipped ; and from many a dark bosom
went up a pure prayer to the Great Spirit. He had not written
his laws for them on tables of stone, but he had traced them on
the tables of their hearts. The poor child of nature knew not
the God of revelation, but the God of the universe he acknowl-
edged in everything around. He beheld him in the star that
sunk in beauty behind his lonely dwelling; in the sacred orb that
flamed on him from his midday throne; in the flower that snapped
in the morning breeze; in the lofty pine that defied a thousand
whirlwinds; in the timid warbler, that never left its native grove;
in the fearless eagle, whose untired pinion was wet in clouds; in
the worm that crawled at his feet; and in his own matchless form,
glowing with a spark of that light to whose mysterious source he
bent in humble though blind adoration.
And all this has passed away. Across the ocean came a pilgrim
bark, bearing the seeds of life and death. The former were sown
for you; the latter sprang up in the path of the simple native.
Two hundred years have changed the character of the great con-
tinent, and blotted forever from its face a whole peculiar people.
Art has usurped the bowers of nature, and the children of educa-
tion have been too powerful for the tribes of the ignorant. Here
and there a stricken few remain; but how unlike their bold, un-
tamed, untamable progenitors! The Indian of falcon glance and
lion bearing—the theme of the touching ballad, the hero of the
pathetic tale—is gone! and his degraded offspring crawl upon the
soil where he walked in majesty, to remind us how miserable is
man when the foot of the conqueror is on his neck.
As a race, they have withered from the land. Their arrows are
broken, their springs are dried up, their cabins are in the dust.
Their council-fire has long since gone out on the shore, and their
war-cry is fast fading to the untrodden west. Slowly and sadly they
climb the distant mountains, and read their doom in the setting
sun. They are shrinking before the mighty tide which is pressing
them away; they must soon hear the roar of the last wave, which
will settle over them forever. Ages hence, the inquisitive white
man as he stands by some growing city, will ponder on the struct-
ure of their disturbed remains, and wonder to what manner of

chronicles of their exterminators. Let these be faithful to their
rude virtues, as men, and pay due tribute to their unhappy fate,
as a people.
TRIBUTE TO WASHINGTON.-- W. H. Harrison.
HA
ARD, hard indeed, was the contest for freedom and the strug-
gle for independence. The golden sun of liberty had well-
nigh set in the gloom of an eternal night, ere its radiant beams
illumined our western horizon. Had not the tutelar saint of
Columbia hovered around the American camp, and presided over
her destinies, freedom must have met with an untimely grave.
Never can we sufficiently admire the wisdom of those statesmen,
and the skill and bravery of those unconquerable veterans, who,
by their unwearied exertions in the cabinet and in the field,
achieved for us the glorious revolution.
Never can we duly appreciate the merits of a Washington, who,
with but a handful of undisciplined yeomanry, triumphed over a
royal army, and prostrated the Lion of England at the feet of the
American Eagle. His name—so terrible to his foes, so welcome
to his friends-shall live forever upon the brightest page of the
historian, and be remembered with the warmest emotions of grat-
itude and pleasure by those whom he has contributed to make
happy, and by all mankind, when kings and princes and nobles,
for
ages,
shall have sunk into their merited oblivion.
Unlike them, he needs not the assistance of the sculptor or the
architect to perpetuate his memory: he needs no princely dome,
no monumental pile, no stately pyramid, whose towering height
shall pierce the stormy clouds, and rear its lofty head to heaven,
to tell posterity his fame. His deeds, his worthy deeds alone,
have rendered him immortal! When oblivion shall have swept
away thrones, kingdoms, and principalities—when every vestige
of human greatness, and grandeur, and glory shall have mouldered
into dust, and the last period of time become extinct-eternity
itself shall catch the glowing theme, and dwell with increasing
rapture on his name!

LONGING.–Lowell.
O Frall the myriad moods of mind
That through the soul come thronging,
Which one was e'er so dear, so kind,
So beautiful, as Longing?
The thing we long for, that we are
For one transcendent moment,
Before the Present, poor and bare,
Can make its sneering comment.
Still, through our paltry stir and strife,
Glows down the wished Ideal,
And Longing moulds in clay what Life
Carves in the marble Real;
To let the new life in, we know,
Desire must ope the portal ;-
Perhaps the longing to be so
Helps make the soul immortal.
Longing is God's fresh heavenward will
With our poor earthward striving;
We quench it that we may be still
Content with merely living;
But, would we learn that heart's full scope,
Which we are hourly wronging,
Our lives must climb from hope to hope,
And realize our longing.
Ah! let us hope that to our praise
Good God not only reckons
The moments when we tread his ways,
But when the spirit beckons,-
That some slight good is also wrought
Beyond self-satisfaction,
When we are simply good in thought,
Howe'er we fail in action.

Their grisly chieftain comes:
He steals upon us in the night;
Call up the guards ! light every light!
Beat the alarum drums !
His tramp is at the outer door;
He bears against the shuddering walls;
Lo! what a dismal frost and hoar
Upon the window falls !
Out-bar him while ye may!
Feed, feed the watch-fires everywhere,
Even yet their cheery warmth will scare
This thing of night away.
Ye cannot! something chokes the grate
And clogs the air within its flues,
And runners from the entrance-gate
Come chill with evil news :
The bars are broken ope!
Ha! he has scaled the inner wall !
But fight him still, from hall to hall;
While life remains, there's hope.
Too late! the very frame is dust,
The locks and trammels fall apart;
He reaches, scornful of their trust,
The portals of the heart.
Ay, take the citadel!
But where, grim Conqueror, is thy prey ?
In vain thou ’lt search each secret way,
Its flight is hidden well.
We yield thee, for thy paltry spoils,
This shell, this ruin thou hast made;
Its tenant has escaped thy toils,
Though they were darkly laid.
Even now, immortal, pure,
It gains a house not made with hands,
A refuge in serener lands,
A heritage secure.

THE BALLAD OF THE OYSTERMAN.-Holmes.
IT
was a tall young oysterman lived by the river-side,
His shop was just upon the bank, his boat was on the tide;
The daughter of a fisherman, that was so straight and slim,
Lived over on the other bank, right opposite to him.
It was the pensive oysterman that saw a lovely maid,
Upon a moonlight evening, a sitting in the shade;
He saw her wave her handkerchief, as much as if to say,
“I'm wide awake, young oysterman, and all the folks away.”
1
Then up arose the oysterman, and to himself said he,
"I guess I'll leave the skiff at home, for fear that folks should
see;
I read it in the story-book, that, for to kiss his dear,
Leander swam the Hellespont,-and I will swim this here.”
And he has leaped into the waves, and crossed the shining
stream,
And he has clambered up the bank, all in the moonlight
gleam;
O there were kisses sweet as dew, and words as soft as rain, -
But they have heard her father's step, and in he leaps again!
Out spoke the ancient fisherman,—“O, what was that, my
daughter?"
“'T was nothing but a pebble, sir, I threw into the water;'
And what is that, pray tell me, love, that paddles off so fast ?”
“It's nothing but a porpoise, sir, that's been a swimming past.”
Out spoke the ancient fisherman, —"Now bring me my har-
poon!
I'll get into my fishing-boat, and fix the fellow soon;'
Down fell that pretty innocent, as falls a snow-white lamb,
Her hair drooped round her pallid cheeks, like sea-weed on
a clam.
Alas, for those two loving ones! she waked not from her
swound,
And he was taken with the cramp, and in the waves was
drowned;
But Fate has metamorphosed them, in pity of their woe,
And now they keep an oyster-shop for mermaids down below.

DEATH OF LITTLE PAUL.—Dickens.

ing to the noises in the street, quite tranquilly; not caring
much how the time went, but watching it and watching every-
thing about him with observing eyes.
When the sunbeams struck into his room through the rustling
blinds, and quivered on the opposite wall like golden water, he
knew that evening was coming on, and that the sky was red and
beautiful. As the reflection died away, and a gloom went creep-
ing up the wall, he watched it deepen, deepen, deepen into night.
Then he thought how the long streets were dotted with lamps,
and how the peaceful stars were shining overhead.
His fancy had a strange tendency to wander to the river, which
he knew was flowing through the great city; and now he thought
how black it was, and how deep it would look, reflecting the host
of stars,
and more than all, how steadily it rolled away to
meet the sea.
As it grew later in the night, and footsteps in the street became
so rare that he could hear them coming, count them as they
passed, and lose them in the hollow distance, he would lie and
watch the many-colored rings about the candle, and wait patiently
for the day. His only trouble was, the swift and rapid river. He
felt forced, sometimes, to try to stop it,—to stem it with his child-
ish hands, or choke its way with sand; and when he saw it
coming on, resistless, he cried out! But a word from Florence,
who was always at his side, restored him to himself; and, leaning
his poor head upon her breast, he told Floy of his dream, and
smiled.
When day began to dawn again, he watched for the sun; and
when its cheerful light began to sparkle in the room, he pictured
to himself-pictured! he saw—the high church-towers rising up
into the morning sky, the town reviving, waking, starting into lite
once more, the river glistening as it rolled (but rolling fast as
ever), and the country bright with dew.
Familiar sounds and cries came by degrees into the street below;
the servants in the house were roused and busy ; faces looked in
at the door, and voices asked his attendants softly how he was.
Paul always answered for himself, “I am better. I am a great
deal better, thank you! Tell papa so !”
By little and little, he got tired of the bustle of the day, the
noise of carriages and carts, and people passing and repassing i

and would fall asleep, or be troubled with a restless and uneasy
sense again-the child could hardly tell whether this were in his
sleeping or his waking moments-of that rushing river. “Why,
will it never stop, Floy?” he would sometimes ask her. “It is
bearing me away, I think !”
But Floy could always soothe and reassure him; and it was his
daily delight to make her lay her head down on his pillow and
take some rest.
“Now lay me down,” he said ; "and, Floy, come close to me,
and let me see you!”
Sister and brother wound their arms around each other, and
the golden light came streaming in, and fell upon them, locked
together.
“How fast the river runs between its banks and the rushes,
Floy! But it 's very near the sea. I hear the waves! They
always said so!”
Presently he told her that the motion of the boat upon the
stream was lulling him to rest. How green the banks were now,
how bright the flowers growing on them, and how tall the rushes!
Now the boat was out at sea, but gliding smoothly on. And now
there was a shore before him. Who stood on the bank ?-
He put his hands together, as he had been used to do at his
prayers. He did not remove his arms to do it; but they saw him
fold them so, behind her neck.
Mamma is like you, Floy. I know her by the face! But tell
them that the print upon the stairs at school is not divine enough.
The light about the head is shining on me as I go !”
The golden ripple on the wall came back again, and nothing
else stirred in the room. The old, old fashion! The fashion that
came in with our first garments, and will last unchanged until our
race has run its course, and the wide firmament is rolled up like
a scroll. The old, old fashion,-Death!
O, thank God, all who see it, for that older fashion yet, of Im-
mortality! And look upon us, angels of young children, with
regards not quite estranged, when the swift river bears us to the
ocean!

answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things
whereof I am accused of the Jews: especially because I know
thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among
the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among
mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; which knew
me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the most
straitest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee. And now I
stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God
unto our fathers: unto which promise our twelve tribes, instantly
serving God day and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake,
King Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.
Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you, that God
should raise the dead? I verily thought with myself, that I ought
to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did
I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief
priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice against
them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and com-
pelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against
them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.
Whereupon as I went to Damascus with authority and commis-
sion from the chief priests, at mid-day, O king, I saw in the way
a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining
round about me and them which journeyed with me. And when
we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me,
and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest
thou me? it is hard for thce to kick against the pricks. And I
said, Who art thou, Lord ? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou
persecutest. But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have ap-
peared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a
witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and of those
things in the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from
the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,
to open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light, and
from the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgive-
ness of sins, and inheritance among them which are sanctified
by faith that is in me.
Whereupon, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the
heavenly vision: but shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at
Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judea, and then to
the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do

works meet for repentance. For these causes the Jews caught
me in the temple, and went about to kill me. Having therefore
obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both
to small and great, saying none other things than those which the
prophets and Moses did say should come: that Christ should
suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise from the
dead, and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.
And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice,
Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee
mad. But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak
forth the words of truth and soberness. For the king knoweth
of these things, before whom also I speak freely: for I am per-
suaded that none of these things are hidden from him; for this
thing was not done in a corner. King Agrippa, believest thou
the prophets? I know that thou believest. Then Agrippa said
unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest me to be a Christian. And
Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but also all that
hear me this day, were both almost and altogether such as I am,
except these bonds.
And when he had thus spoken, the king rose up, and the gov-
ernor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them; and when they
were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This
man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds. Then said
Agrippa unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if
he had not appealed unto Caesar.

THE ORDER OF GENTLEMEN.-Theodore Winthrop.
THER
WHERE is a small but ancient fraternity in the world, known as
the order of Gentlemen. ... I cannot but distinguish some
personages of far-off antiquity as worthy members of this fellow-
ship. I believe it coeval with man. But Christ stated the precept
of the order when he gave the whole moral law in two clauses, -
Love to God, and Love to the neighbor. Whoever has this pre-
cept so by heart that it shines through into his life, enters without
question into the inner circles of the order.
But to protect itself against pretenders, this brotherhood, like
any other, has its formulas, its passwords, its shibboleths, even
its uniform. These are external symbols. With some, the sym-
bol is greater than the thing signified. The thing signified, the
principle, is so beautiful, that the outward sign is enough to glorify

any character. The demeanor of a gentleman - being art, the
expression of an idea in form-can become property, like any
art.
It may be an heirloom in an ancient house, like the portrait of
the hero who gave a family name and fame, like the portrait of
the maiden martyr or the faithful wife, who made that name be-
loved, that fame poetry, to all ages.
This precious inheritance, like anything fine and tender, has
sometimes been treated with over-care. Guardians have been so
solicitous that a neophyte should not lose his inherited rank in
the order of gentlemen, that they have forgotten to make a man
of him. Culturing the flower, they have not thought to make the
stalk sturdy, or even healthy. The demeanor of a gentleman may
be possessed by a weakling, or even inherited by one whose heart
is not worthy of his manners.
The formulas of this order are not edited; its passwords are
not syllabled; its uniform was never pictured on a fashion-plate,
or so described that a snob could go to his tailor, and say, “Make
me the habit of a gentleman.” But the brothers know each other
unerringly wherever they meet; be they of the inner shrine,
gentlemen, heart and life; be they of the outer court, gentlemen
in feeling and demeanor.
No disguise delays this recognition. No strangeness of place
and circumstances prevents it. The men meet. The magnetism
passes between them. All is said without words. Gentlemen
know gentlemen by what we name instinct. But observe that
this thing, instinct, is character in its finest, keenest, largest, and
most concentrated action. It is the spirit's touch.
ECHO AND NARCISSUS.— Thomas Bulfinch.
CHO was a beautiful nymph, fond of the woods and hills,
.
favorite of Diana, and attended her in the chase. But Echo had
one failing; she was fond of talking, and whether in chat or argu-
ment, would have the last word. One day Juno was seeking her
husband, who, she had reason to fear, was amusing himself among
the nymphs. Echo by her talk contrived to detain the goddess till
the nymphs made their escape. When Juno discovered it, she
passed sentence upon Echo in these words: “You shall forfeit the
use of that tongue with which you have cheated me, except for

that one purpose you are so fond of-reply. You shall still have
the last word, but no power to speak first.”
This nymph saw Narcissus, a beautiful youth, as he pursued the
chase upon the mountains. She loved him, and followed his foot-
steps. O, how she longed to address him in the softest accents
and win him to converse! but it was not in her power. She waited
with impatience for him to speak first, and had her answer ready.
One day the youth, being separated from his companions, shouted
aloud, “Who's here?” Echo replied, “Here.” Narcissus looked
around, but seeing no one, called out, “Come!” Echo answered,
“ Come.” As no one came, Narcissus called again, “Why do you
shun me?” Echo asked the same question. Let us join one an-
other,” said the youth.
The maid answered with all her heart in the same words, and
hastened to the spot, ready to throw her arms about his neck.
He started back, exclaiming, “ Hands off! I would rather die than
you should have me!” “Have me,” said she; but it was all in
vain. He left her, and she went to hide her blushes in the recesses
of the woods. From that time forth she lived in caves and among
mountain cliffs. Her form faded with grief, till at last all her
flesh shrank away. Her bones were changed into rocks, and
there was nothing left of her but her voice. With that she is still
ready to reply to any one who calls her, and keeps up her old
habit of having the last word.
Narcissus's cruelty in this case was not the only instance. He
shunned all the rest of the nymphs, as he had done poor Echo.
One day a maiden, who had in vain endeavored to attract him,
uttered a prayer that he might some time or other feel what it
was to love and meet no return of affection. The avenging god-
dess heard and granted the prayer.
There was a clear fountain, with water like silver, to which the
shepherds never drove their flocks, nor the mountain goats re-
sorted, nor any of the beasts of the forest; neither was it defaced
with fallen leaves or branches; but the grass grew fresh around
it, and the rocks sheltered it from the sun. Hither came one day
the youth fatigu with hunting, heated and thirsty. He stooped
down to drink, and saw his own image in the water; he thought
it was some beautiful water-spirit living in the fountain. He
stood gazing with admiration at those bright eyes, these locks
curled like the locks of Bacchus or Apollo; the rounded cheeks,
the ivory neck, the parted lips, and the glow of health and exer-
cise over all. He fell in love with himself.

He brought his lips near to take a kiss; he plunged his arms
in to embrace the beloved object. It fled at the touch, but re-
turned again after a moment and renewed the fascination. He
could not tear himself away; he lost all thought of food or rest,
while he hovered over the brink of the fountain gazing upon his
own image. He talked with the supposed spirit: “Why, beauti-
ful being, do you shun me? Surely, my face is not one to repel
you. The nymphs love me, and you yourself look not indifferent
upon me.
When I stretch forth my arms you do the same, and
you smile upon me and answer my beckonings with the like.”
His tears fell into the water and disturbed the image. As he saw
it depart, he exclaimed, “Stay, I entreat you! Let me at least
gaze upon you, if I may not touch you."
With this, and much more of the same kind, he cherished the
flame that had consumed him, so that by degrees he lost his color,
his vigor, and the beauty which formerly had so charmed the
nymph Echo. She kept near him, however, and when he ex-
claimed, "Alas! alas !” she answered him with the same words.
He pined away and died; and when his shade passed the Stygian
river, it leaned over the boat to catch a look of itself in the waters.
The nymphs mourned for him, especially the water-nymphs; and
when they smote their breasts, Echo smote hers also. They pre-
pared a funeral pile, and would have burned the body, but it was
nowhere to be found; but in its place a flower, purple within and
surrounded with white leaves, which bears the name and pre-
serves the memory of Narcissus.
A SINGING LESSON.-Jean Ingelor.

She sang a few notes out of tune-
Her heart was ready to break,
And she hid from the moon.

But was far too proud to weep;
She tuck'd her head under her wing,
And pretended to be asleep.
A lark, arm-in-arm with a thrush,
Came sauntering up to the place;

The nightingale felt herself blush,
Though feathers hid her face.
She knew they had heard her song,
She felt them snicker and sneer;
She thought that this life was too long,
And wished she could skip year.
“Oh, nightingale,” cooed a dove,
“Oh, nightingale, what's the use?
You, a bird of beauty and love,
Why behave like a goose ?
Don't skulk away from our sight
Like a common, contemptible fowl;
You bird of joy and delight,
Why behave like an owl ?
“Only think of all you have done-
Only think of all you can do;
A false note is really fun
From such a bird as you !
Lift up your proud little crest;
Open your musical beak;
Other birds have to do their best,
But you need only speak.”
The nightingale shyly took
Her head from under her wing,
And, giving the dove a look,
Straightway began to sing.
There was never a bird could pass-
The night was divinely calm-
And the people stood on the grass
To hear that wonderful psalm.
The nightingale did not care-
She only sang to the skies :
Her song ascended there,
And there she fixed her eyes.
The people who listened below
She knew but little about-
And this tale has a moral, I know,
If you 'll try to find it out.

THE KING OF DENMARK'S RIDE.—Mrs. Caroline Norton.
ORD was brought to the Danish king
(Hurry!)
That the love of his heart lay suffering,
And pined for the comfort his voice would bring;
(Oh, ride as though you were flying !)
Better he loves each golden curl
On the brow of that Scandinavian girl
Than his rich crown-jewels of ruby and pearl ;
And his Rose of the Isles is dying.
Thirty nobles saddled with speed;
(Hurry!)
Each one mounted a gallant steed
Which he kept for battle and days of need;
(Oh, ride as though you were flying !)
Spurs were struck in the foaming flank;
Worn-out chargers staggered and sank;
Bridles were slackened, and girths were burst;
But, ride as they would, the king rode first,
For his Rose of the Isles lay dying.
His nobles are beaten one by one;
(Hurry!)
They have fainted, and faltered, and homeward gone;
The little fair page now follows alone,
For strength and for courage trying !
The king looked back at that faithful child ;
Wan was the face that answering smiled;
They passed the drawbridge with clattering din,
Then he dropped ; and only the king rode in
Where his Rose of the Isles lay dying.
The king blew a blast on his bugle-horn;
(Silence !)
No answer came; but faint and forlorn
An echo returned on the cold gray morn,
Like the breath of a spirit sighing.
The castle portal stood grimly wide;
None welcomed the king from that weary ride
For, dead in the light of the dawning day,
The pale, sweet form of the welcomer lay,
Who had yearned for his voice while dying.

The panting steed with a drooping crest
Stood weary :
The king returned from her chamber of rest,
The thick sobs choking in his breast;
And, that dumb companion eying,
The tears gushed forth which he strove to check;
He bowed his head on his charger's neck:
“O steed, that every nerve didst strain-
Dear steed! our ride hath been in vain
To the halls where my love lay dying!”
THE FIREMAN.-R. T. Conrad.
THE
NHE city slumbers. O'er its mighty walls
Night's dusky mantle soft and silent falls;
Sleep o'er the world slow waves its wand of lead,
And ready torpors wrap each sinking head.
Stilled is the stir of labor and of life;
Hushed is the hum, and tranquillized the strife.
Man is at rest, with all his hopes and fears;
The young forget their sports, the old their cares;
The grave are careless; those who joy or weep,
All rest contented on the arm of sleep.
Sweet is the pillowed rest of beauty now,
And slumber smiles upon her tranquil brow;
Her bright dreams lead her to the moonlit tide,
Her heart's own partner wandering by her side.
’T is a summer's eve; the soft gales scarcely rouse
The low-voiced ripple and the rustling boughs ;
And faint and far, some minstrel's melting tone
Breathes to her heart a music like its own.
>
When, hark! oh, horror! what a crash is there!
What shriek is that which fills the midnight air?
'T is “FIRE! FIRE!” She wakes to dream no more!
The hot blast rushes through the blazing door!
The dim smoke eddies round; and hark! that cry!
“Help! help! Will no one aid? I die–I die!”
She seeks the casement; shuddering at its height,
She turns again; the fierce flames mock her flight;

Along the crackling stairs they fiercely play,
And roar, exulting as they seize their prey.
“Help! help! Will no one come?” She says no more,
But, pale and breathless, sinks upon the floor.
Will no one save thee? Yes, there yet is one
Remains to save, when hope itself is gone;
When all have fled—when all but he would fly,
The fireman comes to rescue or to die!
He mounts the stair—it wavers 'neath his tread;
He seeks the room,
2-flames flashing round his head;
He bursts the door, he lifts her prostrate frame,
And turns again to brave the raging flame.
The fire-blast smites him with its stifling breath,
The falling timbers menace him with death,
The sinking floors his hurried steps betray,
And ruin crashes round his desperate way;
Hot smoke obscures-ten thousand cinders rise
Yet still he staggers forward with his prize.
He leaps from burning stair to stair. On! on!
Courage! One effort more, and all is won!
The stair is passed—the blazing hall is braved !
Still on! yet on! Once more! Thank Heaven, she's saved!

GREEN APPLES.–J. T. Trowbridge.
PULL
down the bough, Bob! Is n't this fun!
Now give it a shake, and—there goes one!
Now put your thumb up to the other, and see
If it is n't as mellow as mellow can be!
I know by the stripe
It must be ripe!
That's one apiece for you and me.
Green, are they? Well, no matter for that:
Sit down on the grass and we 'll have a chat;
And I'll tell you what old Parson Bute
Said last Sunday of unripe fruit:
“ Life,” says he,
“ Is a bountiful tree,
Heavily laden with beautiful fruit.

“For the youth there's love, just streaked with red,
And great joys hanging just over his head;
Happiness, honor, and great estate,
For those who patiently work and wait;
Blessings,” said he,
“Of every degree,
Ripening early, and ripening late.
“Take them in season, pluck and eat,
And the fruit is wholesome, the fruit is sweet;
But, oh, my friends!” Here he gave a rap
On his desk, like a regular thunder-clap,
And made such a bang,
Old Deacon Lang
Woke up out of his Sunday nap.

“Green fruit,” he said, “God would not bless;
But half life's sorrow and bitterness,
Half the evil and ache and crime,
Came from tasting before their time
The fruits Heaven sent.”
Then on he went
To his fourthly and fifthly-was n't it prime?
But I say, Bob! we fellows don't care
So much for a mouthful of apple or pear;
But what we like is the fun of the thing,
When the fresh winds blow, and the hang-birds bring
Home grubs, and sing
To their young ones, a-swing
In their basket-nest, tied up by its string.

I like apples in various ways:
They 're first-rate roasted before the blaze
Of a winter fire; and, oh, my eyes !
Are n't they nice, though, made into pies ?
I scarce ever saw
One, cooked or raw,
That was n't good for a boy of my size!
But shake your fruit from the orchard-tree,
And the tune of the brook, and the hum of the bee,

And the chipmonks chippering every minute,
And the clear sweet note of the gay little linnet,
And the grass and the flowers,
And the long summer hours,
And the flavor of sun and breeze are in it.
But this is a hard one! Why did n't we
Leave them another week on the tree?
Is yours as bitter? Give us a bite !
And the taste of it puckers
My mouth like a sucker's!
I vow, I believe the old Parson was right.
THE REFORM BILL.-Sydney Smith.
I HAVE spoken so often on this subject, that I am sure both
you and the gentlemen here present will be obliged to me for
saying but little, and that favor I am as willing to confer as you
can be to receive it. I feel most deeply the event which has
taken place, because, by putting the two houses of Parliament in
collision with each other, it will impede the public business and
diminish the public prosperity. I feel it as a churchman, because
I cannot but blush to see so many dignitaries of the church ar-
rayed against the wishes and happiness of the people. I feel it
more than all, because I believe it will sow the seeds of deadly
hatred between the aristocracy and the great mass of the people.
The loss of the bill I do not feel, and for the best of all possible
reasons—because I have not the slightest idea that it is lost. I
have no more doubt before the expiration of the winter, that this
bill will pass, than I have that the annual tax bills will pass, and
greater certainty than this no man can have, for Franklin tells us
there are but two things certain in this world-death and taxes.
As for the possibility of the House of Lords preventing, erelong,
a reform of Parliament, I hold it to be the most absurd notion
that ever entered into human imagination. I do not mean to be
disrespectful, but the attempt of the Lords to stop the progress
of reform, reminds me very forcibly of the great storm of Sid-
mouth, and of the conduct of the excellent Mrs. Partington on
that occasion.
In the winter of 1824, there set in a great food upon that town;

the tide rose to an incredible height; the waves rushed in upon
the houses, and everything was threatened with destruction. In
the midst of this sublime and terrible storm, Dame Partington,
who lived upon the beach, was seen at the door of her house, with
mop and feathers, trundling her mop, squeezing out the sea-water,
and vigorously pushing away the Atlantic Ocean. The Atlantic
was roused. Mrs. Partington's spirit was up; but I need not tell
you that the contest was unequal. The Atlantic Ocean beat Mrs.
Partington. She was excellent at a slop, or a puddle, but she
should not have meddled with a tempest. Gentlemen, be at your
ease—be quiet and steady. You will beat Mrs. Partington.
FAITH IN THE RIGHT.- Rev. F. W. Robertson.
IT
T is an awful moment when the soul begins to find that the
props on which it has blindly rested so long are, many of
them, rotten, and begins to suspect them all; when it begins to feel
the nothingness of many of the traditionary opinions which have
been received with implicit confidence, and in that horrible inse-
curity begins also to doubt whether there be anything to believe
at all. It is an awful hour,-
let him who has passed through it
say how awful, -when this life has lost its meaning, and seems
shrivelled into a span; when the grave appears to be the end of
all, human goodness nothing but a name; and the sky above this
universe a dead expanse, black with the void from which God
himself has disappeared.
In that fearful loneliness of spirit, when those who should have
been his friends and counsellors only frown upon his misgivings,
and profanely bid him stifle doubts, which, for aught he knows,
may arise from the fountain of truth itself; to extinguish, as a
glare from hell, that which, for aught he knows, may be light from
heaven,-and everything seems wrapped in hideous uncertainty,
I know but one way in which a man may come forth from his
agony scatheless; it is by holding fast to those things which are
certain still,—the grand, simple landmarks of morality. In the
darkest hour through which a human soul can pass, whatever else
is doubtful, this at least is certain.
If there be no God, and no future state, yet even then, it is
better to be generous than selfish, better to be chaste than licen-
tious, better to be true than false, better to be brave than to be a

coward. Blessed beyond all earthly blessedness is the man who,
in the tempestuous darkness of the soul, has dared to hold fast to
these venerable landmarks. Thrice blessed is he who-when all
is drear and cheerless within and without, when his teachers
terrify him, and his friends shrink from him-has obstinately
clung to moral good. Thrice blessed, because his night shall pass
into clear, bright day.
I appeal to the recollection of any man who has passed through
that hour of agony, and stood upon the rock at last, the surges
stilled below him, and the last cloud drifted from the sky above,
with a faith, and hope, and trust no longer traditional but of his
own,-a trust which neither earth nor hell shall shake henceforth
forever.
THE BELL OF LIBERTY.-J. T. Headley.
THE
66
"HE representatives of the people assembled in solemn conclave,
and long and anxiously surveyed the perilous ground on which
they were treading. To recede was now impossible; to go on
seemed fraught with terrible consequences. The result of the long
and fearful conflict that must follow was more than doubtful. For
twenty days Congress was tossed on a sea of perplexity.
At length, Richard Henry Lee, shaking off the fetters that galled
his noble spirit, arose on the 7th of June, and in a clear, deliberate
tone, every accent of which rang to the farthest extremity of the
silent hall, proposed the following resolution:“ Resolved, That these
United Colonies are, and ought to be, free and independent States,
and all political connection between us and the States of Great
Britain is, and ought to be, totally dissolved.”
John Adams, in whose soul glowed the burning future, seconded
the resolution in a speech so full of impassioned fervor, thrilling
eloquence, and prophetic power, that Congress was carried away
before it as by a resistless wave. The die was cast, and every man
was now compelled to meet the issue. The resolution was finally
erred till the 1st of July, to allow a committee, appointed for
that purpose, to draft a Declaration of Independence.
When the day arrived, the Declaration was taken up and de-
bated, article by article. . The discussion continued for three days,
and was characterized by great excitement. At length, the various
sections having been gone through with, the next day, July 4th,
was appointed for action. It was soon known throughout the city;

and in the morning, before Congress assembled, the streets were
filled with excited men, some gathered in groups, engaged in eager
discussion, and others moving towards the State-House. All busi-
ness was forgotten in the momentous crisis which the country had
now reached.
No sooner had the members taken their seats than the multi-
tude gathered in a dense mass around the entrance. The bell-
man mounted to the belfry, to be ready to proclaim the joyful
tidings of freedom as soon as the final vote was passed. A bright-
eyed boy was stationed below to give the signal. Around the bell,
brought from England, had been cast more than twenty years
before the prophetic motto:
“PROCLAIM LIBERTY THROUGHOUT ALL THE LAND UNTO ALL THE
INHABITANTS THEREOF."
Although its loud clang had often sounded over the city, the proc-
lamation engraved on its iron lip had never yet been spoken
aloud.
It was expected that the final vote would be taken without
delay; but hour after hour wore on, and no report came from that
mysterious hall where the fate of a continent was in suspense.
The multitude grew impatient; the old man leaned over the rail-
ing, straining his eyes downward, till his heart misgave him and
hope yielded to fear. But at length, at about two o'clock, the door
of the hall opened, and a voice exclaimed, “It has passed.” The
word leaped like lightning from lip to lip, followed by huzzas that
shook the building. The boy-sentinel turned to the belfry, clap-
ped his hands, and shouted, “Ring! ring !”
The desponding bellman, electrified into life by the joyful news,
seized the iron tongue, and hurled it backward and forward with
a clang that startled every heart in Philadelphia like a bugle-blast.
“Clang! clang!” the bell of Liberty resounded on higher and
clearer, and more joyous, blending in its deep and thrilling vibra-
tions, and proclaiming in loud and long accents over all the land,
the motto that encircled it.
Glad messengers caught the tidings as they floated out on the
air, and sped off in every direction to bear them onward. When
they reached New York, the bells rang out the glorious news,
and the excited multitude, surging hither and thither, at length
gathered around the Bowling Green, and, seizing the leaden statue
of George III., which stood there, tore it into fragments. These

were afterwards run into bullets, and hurled against his Majesty's
troops.
When the Declaration arrived in Boston, the people gathered
to old Faneuil Hall to hear it read; and as the last sentence fell
from the lips of the reader, a loud shout went up, and soon from
every fortified height and every battery the thunder of cannon
reëchoed the joy.

THERE was a tumult in the city,

In the quaint old Quaker town,
And the streets were rife with people
Pacing restless up and down,
People gathering at the corners,
Where they whispered each to each,
And the sweat stood on their temples
With the earnestness of speech.
As the bleak Atlantic currents
Lash the wild Newfoundland shore,
So they beat against the State-House,
So they surged against the door;
And the mingling of their voices
Made a harmony profound,
Till the quiet street of Chestnut
Was all turbulent with sound.

“Will they do it?” “Dare they do it?"
Who is speaking ?”
“ What's the news?”
What of Adams ?” “What of Sherman?”
“Oh, God grant they won't refuse ! ”
“Make some way there!' “Let me nearer!”
“I am stilling !” “Stifle, then!
When a nation's life's at hazard,
We've no time to think of men !”
"
So they surged against the State House,
While all solemnly inside
Sat the “Continental Congress,"
Truth and reason for their guide.

O'er a simple scroll debating,
Which, though simple it might be,
Yet should shake the cliffs of England
With the thunders of the free.
Far aloft in that high steeple
Sat the bellman, old and gray;
He was weary of the tyrant
And his iron-sceptred sway.
So he sat, with one hand ready
On the clapper of the bell,
When his eye could catch the signal,
The long-expected news to tell.
See! See! The dense crowd quivers
Through all its lengthy line,
As the boy beside the portal
Hastens forth to give the sign!
With his little hands uplifted,
Breezes dallying with his hair,
Hark! with deep, clear intonation
Breaks his young voice on the air:
Hushed the people's swelling murmur,
Whilst the boy cries joyously;
“Ring!” he shouts, "Ring! grandpapa,
Ring! oh, ring for Liberty!”
Quickly, at the given signal,
The old bellman lifts his hand,
Forth he sends the good news, making
Iron music through the land.
How they shouted! What rejoicing!
How the old bell shook the air,
Till the clang of freedom ruffled
The calmly gliding Delaware!
How the bonfires and the torches
Lighted up the night's repose,
And from the flames, like fabled Phenix,
Our glorious liberty arose !
That old State-House bell is silent,
Hushed now its clamorous tongue,

But the spirit it awakened
Still is living-ever young;
And when we greet the smiling sunlight
On the fourth of each July,
We will ne'er forget the bellman
Who, betwixt the earth and sky,
Rung out, loudly, "Independence!”
Which, please God, shall never die!
PAUSE
LABOR.—Mrs. Frances S. Osgood.
AUSE not to dream of the future before us,
Pause not to weep the wild cares that come o'er us;
Hark how Creation's deep musical chorus
Unintermitting goes up into heaven!
Never the ocean-wave stops in its flowing;
Never the little seed stops in its growing;
More and more richly the rose-heart keeps glowing
Till from its nourishing stem it is riven.
“Labor is worship!” the robin is singing:
“Labor is worship!” the wild bee is ringing:
Listen! that eloquent whisper upspringing
Speaks to thy soul from out nature's great heart.
From the dark cloud flows the life-giving shower:
From the rough sod blows the soft-breathing flower;
From the small insect the rich coral bower;
Only man, in the plan, ever shrinks from his part.
Labor is life! 'Tis the still water faileth;
Idleness ever despaireth, bewaileth;
Keep the watch wound, for the dark rust assaileth;
Flowers droop and die in the stillness of noon.
Labor is glory! the flying cloud lightens;
Only the waving wing changes and brightens;
Idle hearts only the dark future frightens;
Play the sweet keys wouldst thou keep them in tune!
Labor is rest from the sorrows that greet us;
Rest from all petty vexations that meet us;
Rest from the sin-promptings that ever entreat us;
Rest from the world-sirens that lure us to ill.

Work—and pure slumbers shall wait on thy pillow;
Work—thou shalt ride over care's coming billow.
Lie not down wearied 'neath woe's weeping willow!
Work with a stout heart and resolute will.
Labor is health! Lo! the husbandman reaping,
How through his veins goes the life-current leaping!
How his strong arm, in its stalwart pride sweeping,
True as a sunbeam the swift sickle guides !
Labor is wealth-in the sea the pearl groweth;
Rich the queen's robe from the frail cocoon floweth;
From the fine acorn the strong forest bloweth;
Temple and statue the marble block hides.
Droop not, though shame, sin, and anguish are round thee,
Bravely fling off the cold chain that hath bound thee;
Look to yon pure heaven smiling beyond thee;
Rest not content in thy darkness-a clod!
Work for some good, be it ever so slowly!
Cherish some flower, be it ever so lowly;
Labor-all labor is noble and holy;
Let thy great deeds be thy prayer to thy God.

little lad, my Elihu,
A sailing with your ship?”
The sailor's eyes were dim with dew,-
“Your little lad, your Elihu?”
He said, with trembling lip,-
“What little lad? what ship?”
“What little lad? as if there could be
Another such an one as he!
What little lad, do you say?
Why, Elihu, that took to the sea,
The moment I put him off my knee!
It was just the other day
The Gray Swan sailed away.”

“The other day ?” the sailor's eyes
Stood open with a great surprise, -
"The other day? the Swan ?”
His heart began in his throat to rise.
“Aye, aye, sir, here in the cupboard lies
The jacket he had on.”
“And so your lad is gone?".
“Gone with the Swan." “And did she stand
With her anchor clutching hold of the sand,
For a month, and never stir?”
“Why, to be sure! I've seen from the land,
Like a lover kissing his lady's hand,
The wild sea kissing her,-
A sight to remember, sir.”
“But, my good mother, do you know
All this was twenty years ago ?
I stood on the Gray Swan's deck,
And to that lad I saw you throw,
Taking it off, as it might be, so!
The kerchief from your neck.”
“Aye, and he'll bring it back!”
“And did the little lawless lad
That has made you sick and made you sad,
Sail with the Gray Swan's crew ?”
“Lawless! the man is going mad!
The best boy ever mother had,-
Be sure he sailed with the crew!
What would you have him do ?”
“And he has never written line,
Nor sent you word, nor made you sign
To say he was alive?”

Besides, he may be in the brine,
And could he write from the grave ?

ET us pause! This step, once taken, cannot be retraced. This
resolution, once passed, will cut off all hope of reconciliation.
If success attend the arms of England, we shall then be no longer
colonies, with charters and with privileges; these will all be for-
feited by this act; and we shall be in the condition of other con-
quered people, at the mercy of the conquerors.
For ourselves, we may be ready to run the hazard; but are we
ready to carry the country to that length? Is success so probable
as to justify it? Where is the military, where the naval power,
by which we are to resist the whole strength of the arm of Eng-
land; for she will exert that strength to the utmost? Can we
rely on the constancy and perseverance of the people? or will
they not act as the people of other countries have acted, and,
wearied with a long war, submit, in the end, to a worse oppres-
sion? While we stand on our old ground and insist on redress
of grievances, we know we are right and are not answerable for
consequences. Nothing, then, can be imputed to us.
But if we now change our object, carry our pretensions farther,
and set up for absolute independence, we shall lose the sympathy
of mankind. We shall no longer be defending what we possess,
but struggling for something which we never did possess, and
which we have solemnly and uniformly disclaimed all intention
of pursuing, from the very outset of the troubles. Abandoning
thus our old ground, of resistance only to arbitrary acts of oppres-

sion, the nations will believe the whole to have been mere pre-
tence, and they will look on us, not as injured, but as ambitious,
subjects. I shudder before this responsibility.
It will be on us, if, relinquishing the ground we have stood on
so long, and stood on so safely, we now proclaim independence,
and carry on the war for that object, while these cities burn, these
pleasant fields whiten and bleach with the bones of their owners,
and these streams run blood. It will be upon us, it will be upon
us, if, failing to maintain this unseasonable and ill-judged declara-
tion, a sterner despotism, maintained by military power, shall be
established over our posterity, when we ourselves, given up by
an exhausted, a harassed, a misled people, shall have expiated
our rashness and atoned for our presumption on the scaffold.

from “Webster's Eulogy on Adams and Jefferson.” In the first speech

SUPPOSED SPEECH OF JOHN ADAMS.—Daniel Webster.
SINK
CINK or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give my hand
and my heart to this vote. It is true, indeed, that in the
beginning we aimed not at independence. But there's a divinity
which shapes our ends. The injustice of England has driven us
to arms; and, blinded to her own interest for our good, she has
obstinately persisted, till independence is now within our grasp.
We have but to reach forth to it, and it is ours. Why, then,
should we defer the declaration ?
Is any man so weak as now to hope for a reconciliation with
England, which shall leave either safety to the country and its
liberties, or safety to his own life and his own honor? Are not
you, sir, who sit in that chair-is not he, our venerable colleague
near you—are you not both already the proscribed and predestined
objects of punishment and of vengeance? Cut off from all hope
of royal clemency, what are you, what can you be, while the
power of England remains, but outlaws? If we postpone inde-
pendence, do we mean to carry on or to give up the war? Do we
mean to submit to the measures of Parliament, Boston Port Bill
and all ? Do we mean to submit, and consent that we ourselves

shall be ground to powder, and our country and its rights trodden
down in the dust?
I know we do not mean to submit. We never shall submit.
Do we intend to violate that most solemn obligation ever entered
into by men, that plighting, before God, of our sacred honor to
Washington, when, putting him forth to incur the dangers of
war, as well as the political hazards of the times, we promised to
adhere to him, in every extremity, with our fortunes and our
lives? I know there is not a man here, who would not rather
see a general conflagration sweep over the land, or an earthquake
sink it, than one jot or tittle of that plighted faith fall to the
ground. For myself, having, twelve months ago, in this place,
moved you, that George Washington be appointed commander of
the forces raised, or to be raised, for defence of American liberty,
may my right hand forget her cunning, and my tongue cleave to
the roof of my mouth, if I hesitate or waver in the support I
give him.
The war, then, must go on. We must fight it through. And if
the war must go on, why put off longer the declaration of inde-
pendence? That measure will strengthen us. It will give us
character abroad. The nations will then treat with us, which
they never can do while we acknowledge ourselves subjects in
arms against our sovereign. Nay, I maintain that England her-
self will sooner treat for peace with us on the footing of indepen-
dence, than consent, by repealing her acts, to acknowledge that
her whole conduct towards us has been a course of injustice and
oppression.
Her pride will be less wounded by submitting to that course of
things which now predestinates our independence, than by yield-
ing the points in controversy to her rebellious subjects. The for-
mer she would regard as the result of fortune; the latter she
would feel as her own deep disgrace. Why then, why then, sir,
do we not as soon as possible change this from a civil to a national
war? And since we must fight it through, why not put ourselves
in a state to enjoy all the benefits of victory, if we gain the victory?
If we fail, it can be no worse for us. But we shall not fail. The
cause will raise up armies; the cause will create navies. The
people, the people, if we are true to them, will carry us, and will
carry themselves, gloriously, through this struggle. I care not
how fickle other people have been found. I know the people of
these colonies, and I know that resistance to British aggression is
deep and settled in their hearts, and cannot be eradicated. Every

a
colony, indeed, has expressed its willingness to follow, if we but
take the lead.
Sir, the declaration will inspire the people with increased
courage. Instead of a long and bloody war for the restoration of
privileges, for redress of grievances, for chartered immunities held
under a British king, set before them the glorious object of entire
independence, and it will breathe into them anew the breath of
life. Read this declaration at the head of the army; every sword
will be drawn from its scabbard, and the solemn vow uttered, to
maintain it, or to perish on the bed of honor. Publish it from the
pulpit; religion will approve it, and the love of religious liberty
will cling round it, resolved to stand with it, or fall with it. Send
it to the public halls; proclaim it there; let them hear it who
heard the first roar of the enemy's cannon; let them see it who
saw their brothers and their sons fall on the field of Bunker Hill,
and in the streets of Lexington and Concord, and the very walls
will cry out in its support.
Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs, but I see, I see
clearly through this day's business. You and I, indeed, may rue
it. We may not live to the time when this declaration shall be
made good. We may die; die colonists; die slaves; die, it may
be, ignominiously, and on the scaffold. Be it so. Be it so. If it
be the pleasure of Heaven that my country shall require the poor
offering of my life, the victim shall be ready, at the appointed
hour of sacrifice, come when that hour may. But while I do live,
let me have a country, or at least the hope of a country, and that
a free country.
But whatever may be our fate, be assured, be assured that this
declaration will stand. It may cost treasure, and it may cost
blood; but it will stand, and it will richly compensate for both.
Through the thick gloom of the present, I see the brightness of
the future as the sun in heaven. We shall make this a glorious,
an immortal day. When we are in our graves, our children will
honor it. They will celebrate it with thanksgiving, with festivity,
with bonfires, and illuminations. On its annual return, they will
shed tears, copious, gushing tears, not of subjection and slavery,
not of agony and distress, but of exultation, of gratitude, and
of joy.
Sir, before God, I believe the hour is come. My judgment ap-
proves this measure, and my whole heart is in it. All that I have,
and all that I am, and all that I hope in this life, I am now ready
here to stake upon it; and I leave off as I began, that, live or die,

CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE.—Tennyson.

Half a league onward,
All in the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.
“Forward, the Light Brigadę!
Charge for the guns !” he said:
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.
"Forward, the Light Brigade !"
Was there a man dismayed ?
Not though the soldiers knew
Some one had blundered !
Theirs not to make reply,
Theirs not to reason why,
Theirs but to do and die:
Into the valley of Death
Rode the six hundred.
Cannon to right of them,
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon in front of them
Volleyed and thundered:
Stormed at with shot and shell,
Boldly they rode and well,
Into the jaws of Death,
Into the mouth of Hell,
Rode the six hundred.
Flashed all their sabres bare,
Flashed as they turned in air,
Sab'ring the gunners there,
Charging an army, while
All the world wondered :

Right through the line they broke;
Cossack and Russian
Reeled from the sabre-stroke,
Shattered and sundered.
Then they rode back; but not-
Not the six hundred.
Cannon to right of them,
Cannon to left of them,
Cannon behind them
Volleyed and thundered:
Stormed at with shot and shell,
While horse and hero fell,
They that had fought so well
Came through the jaws of Death
Back from the mouth of Hell,
All that was left of them
Left of six hundred.
When can their glory fade ?
O the wild charge they made!
All the world wondered.
Honor the charge they made!
Honor the Light Brigade,
Noble six hundred !
THE EVE BEFORE WATERLOO.- Lord Byron.
THERE
PHERE was a sound of revelry by night,
And Belgium's capital had gathered then
Her beauty and her chivalry, and bright
The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;
A thousand hearts beat happily; and when
Music arose with its voluptuous swell,
Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,
And all went merry as a marriage-bell;
But, hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!
Did ye not hear it?-No; 't was but the wind,
Or the car rattling o'er the stony street;

On with the dance! let joy be unconfined !
No sleep till morn when Youth and Pleasure meet
To chase the glowing hours with flying feet !
But, hark! that heavy sound breaks in once more,
As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!
Arm! arm! it is—it is—the cannon's opening roar!
Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,
And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,
And cheeks all pale which but an hour ago
Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness;
And there were sudden partings, such as press
The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
Which ne'er might be repeated: who could guess
If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,
Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise!
And there was mounting in hot haste: the steed,
The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,
Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,
And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;
And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;
And near, the beat of the alarming drum
Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;
While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,
Or whispering with white lips—“The foe! They come! they
come!”
And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,
Dewy with Nature's tear-drops, as they pass,
Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,
Over the unreturning brave-alas !
Ere evening to be trodden like the grass
Which now beneath them, but above shall grow
In its next verdure, when this fiery mass
Of living valor, rolling on the foe,
And burning with high hope, shall moulder cold and low.
Last noon beheld them full of lusty life,
Last eve in Beauty's circle proudly gay ;
The midnight brought the signal-sound of strife,
The morn the marshalling in arms—the day
Battle's magnificently stern array !

It falls from her delicate hand
In feathery films, as soft and slow

In the lap of a summer land.
There are jewels of price in her roseate ears,
And gold round her white wrist coils;
There are costly trifles on every hand,
And gems of art from many a land,
In the chamber where she toils.
A rare bird sings in a gilded cage
At the open casement near;
A sun ray glints through a swaying bough,
And lights with a diamond radiance now
The dew of a falling tear!
A sob floats out to the summer air
With the song-bird's latest trill;
The gossamer folds of the drapery
Are waved by the swell of a long, low sigh,
And the delicate hands are still.

And a gilded youth is vain!

With a youth and beauty all divine

But she plucks the gems from her delicate ears,
And the gold from her slender wrist.
The bird still sings in his gilded cage;
But the angel in her heart
Hath stung her soul with a noble pain;
And beauty is nought, and youth is vain,
While the patriot's wounds still smart.
Fibre by fibre, shred by shred,
Still fall from her delicate hand
The feathery films, as soft and slow
As fall the flakes of a vanishing snow
In the lap of a summer land.
There are crimson stains on breasts and brows,
And fillets in ghastly coils;
The walls are lofty and white and bare,
And moaning echoes roll ever there
Through the chamber where she toils.
No glitter of gold on her slender wrist,
Nor gem in her roseate ears;
But a youth and a beauty all divine
In the face of the Christian maiden shine,
And her gems are the soldier's tears.
SHAKE
SHAKESPEARE'S POETRY.-Francis Jeffrey.
SHAKESPEARE alone, when the object requires it, is always
keen and worldly and practical; and yet, without changing
his hand or stopping his course, scatters around him, as he goes,
all sounds and shapes of sweetness, and conjures up landscapes
of immortal fragrance and freshness, and peoples them with
spirits of ious aspect and attractive grace. He is a thousand
times more full of fancy and imagery and splendor than those
who, in pursuit of such enchantments, have shrunk back from
the delineation of character or passion, and declined the discus-
sion of human duties and cares.
More full of wisdom and ridicule and sagacity than all the
moralists and satirists that ever existed, he is also more wild, airy,

and inventive, and more pathetic and fantastic, than all the poets
of all regions and ages of the world. And he has all those ele-
ments so happily mixed up in him, and bears his high faculties
so temperately, that the most severe reader cannot complain of
him for want of strength or of reason, nor the most sensitive for
defect of ornament or ingenuity. Everything in him is in un-
measured abundance and unequalled perfection; but everything
is so balanced and kept in subordination, as not to jostle or disturb
or take the place of another.
The most exquisite poetical conceptions, images, and descrip-
tions are given with such brevity, and introduced with such skill,
as merely to adorn, without loading the sense they accompany.
Although his sails are purple and perfumed, and his prow of
beaten gold, they waft him on his voyage, not less, but more
rapidly and directly than if they had been composed of baser
materials. All his excellences, like those of Nature herself, are
thrown out together; and, instead of interfering with, support
and recommend each other. His flowers are not tied up in gar-
lands, nor his fruits crushed into baskets; but spring living from
the soil, in all the dew and freshness of youth; while the graceful
foliage in which they lurk, and the ample branches, the rough
and vigorous stem, and the wide-spreading roots on which they
depend, are present along with them, and share, in their places,
the equal care of their creator.
HOMER AND VIRGIL.-Pope.
NOTHING is more absurd or endless than the common method
of comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular
passages in them, and forming a judgment from thence of their
merit upon the whole. We ought to have a certain knowledge
of the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each:
it is in that we are to consider him, and in proportion to his
degree in that we are to admire him.
No author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one
faculty, and as Homer has done this in invention, Virgil has in
judgment. Not that we are to think Homer wanted judgment,
because Virgil had it in a more eminent degree; or that Virgil
wanted invention, because Homer possessed a larger share of it:
each of these great authors had more of both than perhaps any

man besides, and are only said to have less in comparison with
one another. Homer was the greater genius; Virgil the better
artist. In one we most admire the man, in the other the work.
Homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity;
Virgil leads us with an attractive majesty. Homer scatters with a
generous profusion; Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence.
Homer, like the Nile, pours out his riches with a boundless over-
flow; Virgil, like a river in its banks, with a gentle and constant
stream.
When we behold their battles, methinks the two poets resemble
the heroes they celebrate: Homer, boundless and irresistible as
Achilles, bears all before him, and shines more and more as the
tumult increases; Virgil, calmly daring like Æneas, appears un-
disturbed in the midst of the action, disposes all about him, and
conquers with tranquillity. And when we look upon their ma-
chines, Homer seems like his own Jupiter in his terrors, shaking
Olympus, scattering the lightnings, and firing the heavens; Virgil,
like the same power in his benevolence, counselling with the
gods, laying plans for empires, and regularly ordering his whole
creation.
DECAY OF CHIVALRY.- Edmund Burke.
IT
T is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the Queen of
France, then the Dauphiness, at Versailles; and surely never
lighted on this orb, which she hardly seemed to touch, a more
delightful vision. I saw her just above the horizon, decorating
and cheering the elevated sphere she just began to move in,
glittering like the morning-star, full of life, and splendor, and
joy. 0, what a revolution! and what a heart must I have to con-
template without emotion that elevation and that fall! Little did
I dream, when she added titles of veneration to those of enthusi-
astic, distant, respectful love, that she would ever be obliged to
carry the sharp antidote against disgrace concealed in that bosom:
little did I dream that I should have lived to see such disasters
fallen upon her in a nation of gallant men, in a nation of men of
honor, and of cavaliers. I thought ten thousand swords must
have leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look that
threatened her with insult.
But the age of chivalry is gone. That of sophisters, economists,
and calculators has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is extin-

guished for ever. Never, never more shall we behold that generous
loyalty to rank and sex, that proud submission, that dignified
obedience, that subordination of the heart, which kept alive, even
in servitude itself, the spirit of an exalted freedom. The unbought
grace of life, the cheap defence of nations, the nurse of manly sen-
timent and heroic enterprise, is gone! It is gone, that sensibility
of principle, that chastity of honor, which felt a stain like a
wound, which inspired courage whilst it mitigated ferocity, which
ennobled whatever it touched, and under which vice itself lost
half its evil, by losing all its grossness.
This mixed system of opinion and sentiment had its origin in
the ancient chivalry; and the principle, though varied in its
appearance by the varying state of human affairs, subsisted and
influenced through a long succession of generations, even to the
time we live in. If it should ever be totally extinguished, the loss
I fear will be great. It is this which has given its character to
modern Europe. It is this which has distinguished it under all its
forms of government, and distinguished it to its advantage, from
the States of Asia, and possibly from those States which flourished
in the most brilliant periods of the antique world. It was this
which, without confounding ranks, had produced a noble equality,
and handed it down through all the gradations of social life. It
was this opinion which mitigated kings into companions, and
raised private men to be fellows with kings. Without force or
opposition, it subdued the fierceness of pride and power; it
obliged sovereigns to submit to the soft collar of social esteem,
compelled stern authority to submit to elegance, and gave a dom-
inating vanquisher of laws to be subdued by manners.
But now all is to be changed. All the pleasing illusions which
made power gentle and obedience liberal, which harmonized
the different shades of life, and which, by a bland assimilation,
incorporated into politics the sentiments which beautify and
soften private society, are to be dissolved by this new conquering
empire of light and reason. All the decent drapery of life is to
be rudely torn off. All the superadded ideas, furnished from the
wardrobe of a moral imagination, which the heart owns and the
understanding ratifies, as necessary to cover the defects of our
naked, shivering nature, and to raise it to dignity in our own
estimation, are to be exploded as a ridiculous, absurd, and anti-
quated fashion.
On this scheme of things, a king is but a man, a queen is but a
woman; a woman is but an animal, and an animal not of the

highest order. All homage paid to the sex in general as such,
and without distinct views, is to be regarded as romance and
folly. Regicide and parricide and sacrilege are but fictions of su-
perstition, corrupting jurisprudence by destroying its simplicity.
The murder of a king, or a queen, or a bishop, or a father, is only
common homicide; and, if the people are by any chance, or in
any way, gainers by it, a sort of homicide much the most pardon-
able, and into which we ought not to make too severe a scrutiny.
CHRISTMAS CAROL.--Dickens.
MAR
ARLEY was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt whatever
about that. The register of his burial was signed by the
clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner.
Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change,
for anything he chose to put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead
as a door-nail.
Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge,
what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have
been inclined myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece
of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is
in the simile;
and
my
unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or
the country's done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat,
emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.
Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it
be otherwise ? Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know
how many years. Scrooge was his sole executor, his sole adminis-
trator, his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend,
and sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut
up by the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business
on the very day of the funeral, and solemnized it with an un-
doubted bargain.
Scrooge never painted out old Marley's name. There it stood,
years afterwards, above the warehouse door ; Scrooge and Marley.
The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people
new to the business called Scrooge, Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,
but he answered to both names. It was all the same to him.
Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge!
a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old
sinner! Hard and sharp as flint from which no steel had ever

struck out generous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary
as an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped
his pointed nose, shrivelled his cheek, stiffened his gait; made his
eyes red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating
voice. A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and
his wiry chin. He carried his own low temperature always about
with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and did n't thaw it
one degree at Christmas.
External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No
warmth could warm, no wintry weather chill him. No wind that
blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon
its purpose, no pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather
did n't know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow,
and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only
one respect. They often “ came down handsomely,” and Scrooge
never did.
Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome
looks, “My dear Scrooge, how are you? When will you come to
see me?" No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no chil-
dren asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once
in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge.
Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him; and when
they saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways
and up courts; and then would wag their tails as though they
said, “No eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!”
But what did Scrooge care! It was the very thing he liked.
To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all
human sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing
ones called “nuts” to Scrooge.
Once upon a time-of all the good days in the year, on Christ-
mas eve-old Scrooge sat busy in his counting-house. It was
cold, bleak, biting weather: foggy withal; and he could hear the
people in the court outside go wheezing up and down, beating
their hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon the
pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks had only just
gone three, but it was quite dark already,—it had not been light
all day,—and candles were flaring in the windows of the neigh-
boring offices, like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air.
The fog came pouring in at every chink and key-hole, and was so
dense without, that although the court was of the narrowest, the
houses opposite were mere phantoms. To see the dingy cloud
come drooping down, obscuring everything, one might have

thought that Nature lived hard by, and was brewing on a large
scale.
The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open, that he might
keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a dismal little cell beyond, a
sort of tank, was copying letters. Scrooge had a very small fire,
but the clerk's fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one
coal. But he could not replenish it, for Scrooge kept the coal-box
in his own room; and so surely as the clerk came in with the
shovel, the master predicted that it would be necessary for them
to part. Wherefore, the clerk put on his white comforter, and
tried to warm himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a
man of a strong imagination, he failed.
IF
THE WORLD WOULD BE THE BETTER FOR IT.
M. H. Cobb.
F men cared less for wealth and fame,
And less for battle-fields and glory;
If, writ in human hearts, a name
Seemed better than in song and story;
If men, instead of nursing pride,
Would learn to hate it and abhor it;
If more relied on love to guide,
The world would be the better for it.
If men dealt less in stocks and lands,
And more in bonds and deeds fraternal;
If Love's work had more willing hands
To link this world to the supernal;
If men stored up Love's oil and wine,
And on bruised human hearts would pour it;
If “yours” and “mine” would once combine,
The world would be the better for it.
If more would act the play of life,
And fewer spoil it in rehearsal ;
If Bigotry would sheathe its knife
Till good becomes more universal ;
If custom, gray with ages grown,
Had fewer blind men to adore it;
If talents shone in Truth alone,
The world would be the better for it.

If men were wise in little things-

“ROCK OF AGES."
“ROC
OCK of ages, cleft for me,”
Thoughtlessly the maiden sung;
Fell the words unconsciously
From her girlish, gleeful tongue;
Sang as little children sing;
Sang as sing the birds in June;
Fell the words like light leaves down
On the current of the tune-
“Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.”
“Let me hide myself in Thee,”-
Felt her soul no need to hide-
Sweet the song as song could be,
And she thought of naught beside;
All the words unheedingly
Fell from lips untouched by care,
Dreaming not that they might be
On some other lips a prayer-
“Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.”

Every word her heart did know.

Every note with sorrow stirred,
Every syllable a prayer-
“Rock of ages, cleft for me,

“Rock of ages, cleft for me,”—
Lips grown aged sung the hymn
Trustingly and tenderly,
Voice grown weak and eyes grown dim-
“Let me hide myself in Thee,”
Trembling though the voice and low,
Ran the sweet strain peacefully,
Like a river in its flow;
Sung as only they can sing
Who life's thorny path have prest;
Sung as only they can sing
Who behold the promised rest—
“Rock of ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.”
Rock of ages, cleft for me,”–
Sung above a coffin-lid ;-
Underneath, all restfully,
All life's joys and sorrows hid;
Nevermore, O storm-tossed soul!
Nevermore from wind or tide,
Nevermore from billow's roll
Wilt thou need thyself to hide.
Could the sightless, sunken eyes,
Closed beneath the soft gray hair,
Could the mute and stiffened lips
Move again in pleading prayer,
Still, aye, still, the words would be,–
“Let me hide myself in Thee.”

Within, the master's desk is seen,
Deep scarred by raps official ;
The warping floor, the battered seats,
The jack-knife's carved initial;
The charcoal frescoes on its wall;
Its door's worn sill betraying
The feet that, creeping slow to school,
Went storming out to playing.
Long years ago a winter sun
Shone over it at setting;
Lit up its western window-panes,
And low eaves' icy fretting.
It touched the tangled golden curls,
And brown eyes full of grieving,
Of one who still her steps delayed
When all the school were leaving.
For near her stood the little boy
Her childish favor singled,
His cap pulled low upon a face
Where pride and shame were mingled.
Pushing with restless feet the snow
To right and left, he lingered;
As restlessly her tiny hands
The blue-checked apron fingered.
He saw her lift her eyes; he felt
The soft hands light caressing,
And heard the tremble of her voice,
As if a fault confessing.
“I'm sorry that I spelt the word:
I hate to go above you,
Because "—the brown eyes lower fell-
“Because, you see, I love you!”
>
Still, memory to a gray-haired man
That sweet child-face is showing.
Dear girl! the grasses on her grave
Have forty years been growing.

He lives to learn, in life's hard school,
How few who pass above him
Lament their triumph and his loss,
Like her–because they love him.
HARK !-Rose Terry Cooke.
HARK!”
She sat upright in her bed,
The gold hair from her head
Crisping, coiling, wandering low
O'er her bosom cold as snow.
For the heart in her breast stood still,
And the blood in her veins ran chill,
At the sound she heard in the dark.
“ Hark!”
It sounded like the scream
Of a dreamer in his dream.
Yet her eyes were wide and blue,
Piercing midnight through and through;
Her parted lips were white
With the terror of the night,
And her arms spread stiff and stark.
“ Hark!”
Wakened the mother mild:
"Why dost thou call, my child ?
The kindling morn is not yet red,
The night is silent, the winds are dead.
To-morrow thou art a bride :
Sleep, darling, at my side.”
But again she whispered, “Hark!"
- Hark!
Hear the slow steps that bring,
Stumbling, some dreadful thing!
Hear the low, hushed voices calling!
Hear the sullen water falling!
Hear! oh, mother, hear!
They are setting down the bier;
And the watch-dogs do not bark.”

“ Hark!”
The sudden taper burned,
The key in her cold hand turned ;
Nothing in the lofty hall,-
Stillness, darkness, over all.
“There is not a creature here,
Nor bearers, nor a bier,
Nor anything but the dark.”
Hark!”
The wedding-bells ring loud,
The wedding-revellers crowd.
Waiting, watching, still she stood,
In her bower's white solitude,
Waiting in her bower
For the bridegroom and the hour,
Watching the dial's mark.
“ Hark!”
The creeping shadow is there:
He is coming up the stair,
Coming! Stumbling steps and slow
Up the stately staircase go.
Low, hushed voices,—“Bring him here.
Softly! now set down the hier."
Dripping water's dropping fall
On the flagstones of the hall,
It is this she heard in the dark.
“ Hark!”
The tolling bells ring low,
And the mourners come and go.
Whiter than the palest bride,
Low she lieth at his side:
For she looked out on the deadl,
And her life was smitten and sped.
She will nevermore say, “Hark!”

procession, chanted the praises of liberty and the gods,—where
and what is she? For two thousand years the oppressor has
ground her to the earth. Her arts are no more. The last sad
relics of her temples are but the barracks of a ruthless soldiery.
The fragments of her columns and her palaces are in the dust, yet
beautiful in ruins. She fell not when the mighty were upon her.
Her sons were united at Thermopylæ and Marathon, and the tide
of her triumph rolled back upon the Hellespont. She was con-
quered by her own factions. She fell by the hands of her own
people. The man of Macedonia did not the work of destruction.
It was already done, by her own corruptions, banishments, and
dissensions.
Rome, republican Rome, whose eagles glanced in the rising and
the setting sun,-where and what is she? The Eternal City yet
remains, proud even in her desolation, noble in her decline, ven-
erable in the majesty of religion, and calm as in the composure
of death. The malaria has but travelled in the paths worn by
her destroyers. More than eighteen centuries have mourned over
the loss of her empire. A mortal disease was upon her vitals
before Caesar had crossed the Rubicon; and Brutus did not restore
her health by the deep probings of the Senate chamber. The
Goths, and Vandals, and Huns, the swarms of the North, com-
pleted only what was already begun at home. Romans betrayed
Rome. The legions were bought and sold; but the people offered
the tribute-money.
We stand the latest, and, if we fail, probably the last experi-
ment of self-government by the people. We have begun it under
circumstances of the most auspicious nature. We are in the vigor
of youth. Our growth has never been checked by the oppressions
of tyranny. Our constitutions have never been enfeebled by the
vices or luxuries of the Old World. Such as we are, we have
been from the beginning ;-simple, hardy, intelligent, accustomed
to self-government and self-respect. The government is
mild. The press is free. Religion is free. Knowledge reaches,
or may reach, every home. What fairer prospect of success could
be presented ? What means more adequate to accomplish the
sublime end? What more is necessary than for the people to
preserve what they themselves have created ?
Already has the age caught the spirit of our institutions. It has
already ascended the Andes, and snuffed the breezes of both oceans.
It has infused itself into the life-blood of Europe, and warmed

the sunny plains of France and the lowlands of Holland. It has
touched the philosophy of Germany and the North, and, moving
onward to the South, has opened to Greece the lessons of her
better days. Can it be that America, under such circumstances,
can betray herself? Can it be that she is to be added to the cata-
logue of republics, the inscription of whose ruins is,—“They
were, but they are not !” Forbid it, my countrymen; forbid it,
Heaven!
I call upon you, fathers, by the shades of your ancestors, by the
dear ashes which repose in this precious soil, by all you are and
all you hope to be: resist every project of disunion; resist every
encroachment upon your liberties ; resist every attempt to fetter
your consciences, or smother your public schools, or extinguish
your system of public instruction. I call upon you, mothers, by
that which never fails in woman,-the love of your offspring ;-
teach them, as they climb your knees or lean upon your bosom,
the blessing of liberty. Swear them at the altar, as with their
baptismal vows, to be true to their country, and never to forget or
forsake her. I call upon you, young men, to remember whose
sons you are, whose inheritance you possess. Life can never be
too short, which brings nothing but disgrace and oppression.
Death can never come too soon, if necessary in defence of the
liberties of your country. I call upon you,.old men, for your
counsel, your prayers, and your benedictions. May your gray
hairs not go down in sorrow to the grave, with the recollection
that you have lived in vain. May your last sun not sink in the
west upon a nation of slaves.
No! I read in the destiny of my country far better hopes, far
brighter visions. We who are now assembled here must soon be
gathered to the congregation of other days. The time for our
departure is at hand, to make way for our children upon the
theatre of life. May God speed them and theirs. May he, who
at the distance of another century shall stand here to celebrate
this day, still look round upon a free, happy, and virtuous people.
May he have reason to exult, as we do. May he, with all the
enthusiasm of truth, as well as of poetry, exclaim that here is
still his country, -
“Zealous, yet modest; innocent, though free;
Patient of toil; serene amidst alarms;
Inflexible in faith ; invincible in arms."

MILITARY SUPREMACY DANGEROUS TO LIBERTY.
Henry Clay.
>
a
I
WILL not trespass much longer upon the time of the committee;
but I trust I shall be indulged with some few reflections upon
the danger of permitting the conduct on which it has been my
painful duty to animadvert, to pass without a solemn expression
of the disapprobation of this House. Recall to your mind the free
nations which have gone before us. Where are they now?
“Gone glimmering through the dream of things that were,
A school-boy's tale, the wonder of an hour.”
And how have they lost their liberties? If we could transport
ourselves back to the ages when Greece and Rome flourished in
their greatest prosperity, and, mingling in the throng, should ask
a Grecian whether he did not fear that some daring military chief-
tain, covered with glory, some Philip or Alexander, would one day
overthrow the liberties of his country, the confident and indignant
Grecian would exclaim, “No! no! we have nothing to fear from
our heroes; our liberties shall be eternal.” If a Roman citizen
had been asked whether he did not fear that the conqueror of
Gaul might establish a throne upon the ruins of public liberty, he
would have instantly repelled the unjust insinuation. Yet Greece
fell ; Caesar passed the Rubicon, and the patriotic arm even of
Brutus could not preserve the liberties of his devoted country!
We are fighting a great moral battle, for the benefit not only of
our country, but of all mankind. The eyes of the whole world
are in fixed attention upon us. One, and the largest portion of it,
is gazing with contempt, with jealousy, and with envy; the other
portion, with hope, with confidence, and with affection. Every.
where the black cloud of Legitimacy is suspended over the world,
save only one bright spot, which breaks out from the political
hemisphere of the West, to enlighten, and animate, and gladden
the human heart. Obscure that, by the downfall of liberty here,
and all mankind are enshrouded in a pall of universal darkness.
To you belongs the high privilege of transmitting unimpaired
to posterity the fair character and liberty of our country. Do you
expect to execute this high trust by trampling or suffering to be
trampled down law, justice, the constitution, and the rights of the
people? by exhibiting examples of inhumanity, and cruelty, and
ambition ? Beware how you give a fatal sanction, in this infant
period of our Republic, scarcely yet twoscore years old, to mili-

God must be also omnipresent in time. There is no second of

THE FROST.-Hannah Gould.

THE Frost looked forth one still, clear night,
And he said, “Now I shall be out of sight;
So through the valley and over the height
In silence I'll take my way.
I will not go like that blustering train,
The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain,
Who make so much bustle and noise in vain,
But I'll be as busy as they !”
Then he went to the mountain, and powdered its crest,
He climbed up the trees, and their boughs bą dressed
With diamonds and pearls, and over the breast
of the quivering lake he spread
A coat of mail, that it need not fear
The downward point of many a spear
That he hung on its margin, far and near,
Where a rock could rear its head.
He went to the windows of those who slept,
And over each pane like a fairy crept;
Wherever he breathed, wherever he stepped,
By the light of the moon were seen
Most beautiful things. There were, flowers and trees,
There were bevies of birds and swarms of bees,
There were cities, thrones, temples, and towers, and these
All pictured in silver sheen!
But he did one thing that was hardly fair,-
He peeped in the cupboard, and, finding there
That all had forgotten for him to prepare, —
“Now, just to set them a thinking,
I'll bite this basket of fruit,” said he;
“This costly pitcher I'll burst in three ;
And the glass of water they've left for me
Shall “'t chick !' to tell them I'm drinking."

THE PRESENT CRISIS.—Lowell.
WHEN a deed is done for Freedom, through the broad
,
Runs a thrill of joy prophetic, trembling on from east to west;
And the slave, where'er he cowers, feels the soul within him
climb
To the awful verge of manhood, as the energy sublime
Of a century bursts full-blossomed on the thorny stem of Time.
Through the walls of hut and palace shoots the instantaneous
throe,
When the travail of the Ages wrings earth's systems to and fro;
At the birth of each new Era, with a recognizing start,
Nation wildly looks at nation, standing with mute lips apart,
And glad Truth's yet mightier man-child leaps beneath the
Future's heart.
Once to every man and nation comes the moment to decide,
In the strife of Truth with Falsehood, for the good or evil side;
Some great cause, God's new Messiah, offering each the bloom
or blight,
Parts the goats upon the left hand, and the sheep upon the
right,
And the choice goes by forever 'twixt that darkness and that
light.
Careless seems the great Avenger; history's pages but record
One death-grapple in the darkness 'twixt old systems and the
Word;
Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne, -
Yet that scaffold sway's the future, and, behind the dim un-
known,
Standeth God within the shadow, keeping watch above his own.
Then to side with Truth is noble when we share her wretched
crust,
Ere her cause bring fame and profit, and 't is prosperous to be
just;
Then it is the brave man chooses, while the coward stands
aside,
Doubting in his abject spirit, till his Lord is crucified,
And the multitude make virtue of the faith they had denied.

Count me o'er Earth's chosen heroes,-they were souls that
stood alone
While the men they agonized for hurled the contumelious stone,
Stood serene and down the future saw the golden beam incline
To the side of perfect justice, mastered by their faith divine,
By one man's plain truth to manhood and to God's supreme
design.
For Humanity sweeps onward: where to-day the martyr stands,
On the morrow crouches Judas with the silver in his hands ;
Far in front the cross stands ready and the crackling fagots
burn,
While the hooting mob of yesterday in silent awe return
To glean up the scattered ashes into History's golden urn.
New occasions teach new duties; Time makes ancient good un-
couth;
They must upward still, and onward, who would keep abreast
of Truth;
Lo, before us gleam her camp-fires! we ourselves must Pil-
grims be,
Launch our Mayflower, and steer boldly through the desperate
winter sea,
Nor attempt the Future's portal with the Past's blood-rusted
key.
CHRIST IN THE TEMPEST.- Whittier.
STORM on the midnight waters! The vast sky
Is stooping with the thunder. Cloud on cloud
Rolls heavily in the darkness, like a shroud
Shook by some warning spirit from the high
And terrible wall of heaven. The mighty wave
Tosses beneath its shadow, like the bold
Upheavings of a giant from the grave,
Which bound him prematurely to its cold
And desolate bosom. Lo-they mingle now-
Tempest and heaving wave, along whose brow
Trembles the lightning from its thick cloud fold.
And it is very terrible! The roar
Ascendeth unto heaven, and thunders back,

Like a response of demons, from the black
Rifts of the hanging tempests—yawning o'er
The wild waves in their torments. Hark! the cry
Of the strong man in peril, piercing through
The uproar of the waters and the sky;
As the rent bark one moment rides to view,
On the tall billows, with the thunder-cloud
Closing around, above her, like a shroud !
He stood upon the reeling deck-his form
Made visible by the lightning, and his brow,
Uncovered to the visiting of the storm,
Told of a triumph man may never know-
Power underived and mighty,—“ Peace, be still !”
The great waves heard him, and the storm's loud tone
Went moaning into silence at his will;
And the thick clouds, where yet the lightning shone,
And slept the latent thunder, rolled away
Until no trace of tempest lurked behind,
Changing upon the pinions of the wind
To stormless wanderers, beautiful and gay.
Dread Ruler of the tempest! Thou, before
Whose presence boweth the uprisen storm,-
To whom the waves do homage, round the shore
Of many an island empire !—if the form
Of the frail dust beneath thine eye may claim
Thy infinite regard-oh, breathe upon
The storm and darkness of man's soul, the same
Quiet, and peace, and humbleness, which came
O'er the roused waters, where Thy voice had gone,
A minister of power-to conquer in Thy name!

we will greet our longed-for native land, and our heart-loved
homes.
And so the throng streamed along from Berlin, from Paris, from
the Orient, converging upon London, still hastening toward the
welcome ship, and narrowing every day the circle of engagements
and preparations. They crowded aboard. Never had the Arctic
borne such a host of passengers, nor passengers so nearly related
to so many of us. The hour was come. The signal-ball fell at
Greenwich. It was noon also at Liverpool. The anchors were
weighed; the great hull swayed to the current; the national colors
streamed abroad, as if themselves instinct with life and national
sympathy. The bell strikes; the wheels revolve; the signal-gun
beats its echoes in upon every structure along the shore, and the
Arctic glides joyfully forth from the Mersey, and turns her prow
to the winding channel, and begins her homeward run. The pilot
stood at the wheel, and men saw him. Death sat upon the
prow,
and no eye beheld him. Whoever stood at the wheel in all the
voyage, Death was the pilot that steered the craft, and none knew
it. He neither revealed his presence nor whispered his errand.
And so hope was effulgent, and lithe gayety disported itself,
and joy was with every guest. Amid all the inconveniences of
the voyage, there was still that which hushed every murmur,-
“Home is not far away.” And every morning it was still one
night nearer home! Eight days had passed. They beheld that
distant bank of mist that forever haunts the vast shallows of
Newfoundland. Boldly they made it; and plunging in, its pliant
wreaths wrapped them about. They shall never emerge. The
last sunlight has flashed from that deck. The last voyage is done
to ship and passengers. At noon there came noiselessly stealing
from the north that fated instrument of destruction. In that
mysterious shroud, that vast atmosphere of mist, both steamers
were holding their way with rushing prow and roaring wheels,
but invisible.
At a league's distance, unconscious; and at nearer approach,
unwarned; within hail, and bearing right toward each other, un-
seen, unfelt, till in a moment more, emerging from the gray mists,
the ill-omened Vesta dealt her deadly stroke to the Arctic. The
death-blow was scarcely felt along the mighty hull. She neither
reeled nor shivered. Neither commander nor officers deemed that
they had suffered harm. Prompt upon humanity, the brave Luce
(let his name be ever spoken with admiration and respect) ordered
away his boat with the first officer to inquire if the stranger had

suffered harm. As Gourley went over the ship's side, oh, that
some good angel had called to the brave commander in the words
of Paul on a like occasion, “Except these abide in the ship, ye
cannot be saved.”
They departed, and with them the hope of the ship, for now
the waters gaining upon the hold, and rising upon the fires, re-
vealed the mortal blow. Oh, had now that stern, brave mate,
Gourley, been on deck, whom the sailors were wont to mind,-
had he stood to execute efficiently the commander's will, -we
may believe that we should not have had to blush for the coward-
ice and recreancy of the crew, nor weep for the untimely dead.
But, apparently, each subordinate officer lost all presence of mind,
then courage, and so honor. In a wild scramble, that ignoble
mob of firemen, engineers, waiters, and crew, rushed for the boats,
and abandoned the helpless women, children, and men to the
mercy of the deep! Four hours there were from the catastrophe
of collision to the catastrophe of sinking!
Oh, what a burial was here! Not as when one is borne from
his home, among weeping throngs, and gently carried to the green
fields, and laid peacefully beneath the turf and flowers. No priest
stood to pronounce a burial-service. It was an ocean-grave. The
mists alone shrouded the burial-place. No spade prepared the
grave, nor sexton filled up the hollowed earth. Down, down they
sank, and the quick returning waters smoothed out every ripple,
and left the sea as if it had not been.

TOME from his journey, Farmer John
Arrived this morning, safe and sound;
His black coat off, and his old clothes on,-

And he thinks, “I'll look around.”
Up leaps the dog : “Get down, you pup!
Are you so glad you would eat me up ?”

The horses prick up their ears to meet him.

“You have n't a rib,” says Farmer John;
“The cattle are looking round and sleek;
The colt is going to be a roan,
And a beauty, too; how he has grown!
We'll wean the calf next week.”
Says Farmer John, “When I've been off,
To call you again about the trough,
And watch you and pet you while you drink,
Is a greater comfort than you can think!”
And he pats old Bay,
And he slaps old Gray;
Ah, this is the comfort of going away!

“For, after all,” says Farmer John,
“The best of a journey is getting home!
I've seen great sights, but I would not give
This spot, and the peaceful life I live,
For all their Paris and Rome:
These hills, for the city's stifled air,
And big hotels all bustle and glare;
Land all houses, and roads all stones,
That deafen your ears, and batter your bones!
Would you, old Bay ?
Would you, old Gray ?
That's what one gets by going away!

“And Fashion is queen; and it's mighty queer
To see how, sometimes, while the man
Is raking and scraping all he can,
The wife spends, every year,
Enough, you would think, for a score of wives,
To keep them in luxury all their lives !
The town is a perfect Babylon
To a quiet chap,” says Farmer John.

And clutched in a life of waste and hurry,
In nights of pleasure, and days of worry;
And wealth is n't all in gold,
Mortgage and stocks, and ten per cent,
But in simple ways and sweet content,
Few wants, pure hopes, and noble ends,
Some land to till, and a few good friends,
Like you, old Bay,
And you, old Gray,-
That's what I've learned by going away.”
And a happy man is Farmer John,-
0, a rich and happy man is he!
He sees the peas and pumpkins growing,
The corn in tassel, the buckwheat blowing,
And fruit on vine and tree;
The large, kind oxen look their thanks,
As he rubs their foreheads and strokes their flanks;
The doves light round him, and strut and coo:
Says Farmer John, “I'll take you, too, -
And you, old Bay,
And you, old Gray,
Next time I travel so far away.”
THE FATE OF HOFER.— Walter S. Landor.
AT
T Innspruck I entered the church in which Andreas Hofer is
buried. He lies under a plain slab, on the left, near the
door. I admired the magnificent tomb of bronze, in the centre,
surrounded by heroes, real and imaginary. They did not fight,
tens against thousands; they did not fight for wives and children,
-but for lands and plunder;—therefore they are heroes! My
admiration for these works of art was soon satisfied, which per-
haps it would not have been in any other place.
Snow, mixed with rain, was falling, and was blown by the wind
upon the tomb of Hofer. I thought how often he had taken ad-
vantage of such weather for his attacks against the enemies of his
country, and I seemed to hear his whistle in the wind. At the
little village of Landro (I feel a whimsical satisfaction in the like-
ness of the name to mine), the innkeeper was the friend of this

a
truly great man,-the greatest man that Europe has produced in
our days, excepting his true compeer, Kosciusko. Andreas Hofer
gave him the chain and crucifix he wore three days before his
death. You may imagine this man's enthusiasm, who, because I
had said that Hofer was greater than king or emperor, and had
made him a present of small value, as the companion and friend
of that harmless and irreproachable hero, took this precious relic
from his neck and offered it to me.
By the order of Bonaparte, the companions of Hofer, eighty in
number, were chained, thumbscrewed, and taken out of prison in
couples, to see him shot. He had about him one thousand florins,
in paper currency, which he delivered to his confessor, requesting
him to divide it impartially among his unfortunate countrymen.
The confessor, an Italian who spoke German, kept it, and never
gave relief from it to any of them, most of whom were suffering,
not only from privation of wholesome air, to which, among other
privations, they never had been accustomed, but also from scan-
tiness of nourishment and clothing. Even in Mantua, where, as
in the rest of Italy, sympathy is both weak and silent, the lowest
of the people were indignant at the sight of so brave a defender
of his country, led into the public square to expiate a crime un-
heard of for many centuries in their nation.
When they saw him walk forth, with unaltered countenance and
firm step before them; when, stopping on the ground which was
about to receive his blood, they heard him with unfaltering voice
commend his soul and his country to the Creator; and, as if still
under his own roof (a custom with him after the evening prayer),
implore a blessing for his boys and his little daughter, and for the
mother who had reared them up carefully and tenderly thus far
through the perils of childhood; finally, when in a lower tone, but
earnestly and emphatically, he besought pardon from the Fount
of Mercy for her brother, his betrayer, many smote their breasts
aloud; many, thinking that sorrow was shameful, lowered their
heads and wept; many, knowing that it was dangerous, yet wept
too.
The people remained upon the spot an unusual time; and the
French, fearing some commotion, pretended to have received an
order from Bonaparte for the mitigation of the sentence, and pub-
licly announced it. Among his many falsehoods, any one of which
would have excluded him forever from the society of men of
honor, this is perhaps the basest ; as indeed of all his atrocities the

the time and circumstances, is, of all his actions, that which the
brave and virtuous will reprobate the most severely. He was urged
by no necessity, he was prompted by no policy: his impatience of
courage in an enemy, his hatred of patriotism and integrity in all,
of which he had no idea himself, and saw no image in those about
him, outstripped his blind passion for fame, and left him nothing
but power and celebrity.
The name of Andreas Hofer will be honored by posterity far
above
any of the present age, and together with the most glorious
of the last, Washington and Kosciusko. For it rests on the same
foundation, and indeed on a higher basis. In virtue and wisdom
their co-equal, he vanquished on several occasions a force greatly
superior to his own in numbers and in discipline, by the courage
and confidence he inspired, and by his brotherly care and anxiety
for those who were fighting at his side.
Differently, far differently, ought we to estimate the squanderers
of human blood and the scorners of human tears.
We also may
boast of our great men in a cause as great; for without it they
could not be so. We may look back upon our Blake; whom the
prodigies of a Nelson do not eclipse, nor would he have wished
(such was his generosity) to obscure it. Blake was among the
founders of freedom; Nelson was the vanquisher of its destroyers;
Washington was both ; Kosciusko was neither; neither was Hofer.
But the aim of all three was alike; and in the armory of God are
suspended the arms the two last of them bore; suspended for suc-
cess more signal and for vengeance more complete.
REMINISCENCES OF ARNOLD AND WORDSWORTH.
Rev. F. W. Robertson.
IT
T was my lot, during a short university career, to witness a.
transition and a reaction, or revulsion of public feeling, with
respect to two great men. The first of these was one who was
every inch a man,-Arnold, of Rugby. You will all recollect how,
in his earlier life, Arnold was covered with suspicion and obloquy,
how the wise men of that day charged him with latitudinarian-
ism, and I know not with how many other heresies. But the
public opinion altered, and he came to Oxford, and read lectures
on modern history.
Such a scene had not been seen in Oxford before. The lecture-

room was too small; all adjourned to the Oxford theatre; and all
that was most brilliant, all that was most wise and most distin-
guished, gathered together there. He walked up to the rostrum
with a quick step and manly dignity. Those who had loved him
when all the world despised him felt that, at last, the hour of
their triumph had come. But there was something deeper than
any personal triumph they could enjoy; and those who saw him
then will not soon forget the lesson read to them by his calm,
dignified, simple step,-a lesson teaching them the utter worth-
lessness of unpopularity or of popularity as a test of manhood's
worth.
The second occasion was when, in the same theatre, Wordsworth
came forward to receive his honorary degree. Scarcely had his
name been pronounced than, from three thousand voices at once,
there broke forth a burst of applause, echoed and taken up again
and again, when it seemed about to die away, and that thrice
repeated,-a cry in which
Old England's heart and voice unite,
Whether she hail the wine-cup or the fight,
Or bid each hand be strong, or bid each heart be light.
There were young eyes there filled with an emotion of which
they had no need to be ashamed; there were hearts beating with
the proud feeling of triumph, that, at last, the world had recog-
nized the merit of the man they had loved so long, and acknowl-
edged as their teacher; and yet, when that noise was protracted,
there came a reaction in their feelings, and they began to perceive
that that was not, after all, the true reward and recompense for all
that Wordsworth had done for England; it seemed as if all that
noise was vulgarizing the poet; it seemed more natural and de-
sirable to think of him afar off in his simple dales and mountains,
the high-priest of nature, weaving in honored poetry his songs to
liberty and truth, than to see him there, clad in a scarlet robe,
and bespattered with applause. Two young men went home
together, part of the way in silence,—and one only gave expres-
sion to the feelings of the other, when he quoted those well-known,
trite, and often-quoted lines,-lines full of deepest truth :-
One self-approving hour whole worlds outweighs
Of stupid starers and of loud huzzas;
And more true joy Marcellus exiled feels,
Than Caesar with a senate at his heels.

SHIPS AT SEA.-R. B. Coffin.
I HAVE ships that went to sea
More than :
None have come home to me,
But keep sailing to and fro.
I have seen them, in my sleep,
Plunging through the shoreless deep,
With tattered sails and battered hulls,
While around them screamed the gulls,
Flying low, flying low.
I have wondered why they stayed
From me, sailing round the world;
And I've said, “I'm half afraid
That their sails will ne'er be furled.”
Great the treasures that they hold, -
Silks, and plumes, and bars of gold;
While the spices which they bear
Fill with fragrance all the air,
As they sail, as they sail.
Every sailor in the port
Knows that I have ships at sea,
Of the waves and winds the sport;
And the sailors pity me.
Oft they come and with me walk,
Cheering me with hopeful talk,
Till I put my fears aside,
And contented watch the tide
Rise and fall, rise and fall.
I have waited on the piers,
Gazing for them down the bay,
Days and nights, for many years,
Till I turned heart-sick away.
But the pilots, when they land,
Stop and take me by the hand,
Saying, “You will live to see
Your proud vessels come from sea,
One and all, one and all."
So I never quite despair,
Nor let hope or courage fail;

And some day, when skies are fair,
Up the bay my ships will sail.
I can buy, then, all I need,
Prints to look at, books to read,
Horses, wines, and works of art,
Everything, except a heart:
That is lost, that is lost.
Once when I was pure and young,
Poorer, too, than I am now,
Ere a cloud was o'er me flung,
Or a wrinkle creased my brow,
There was one whose heart was mine;
But she's something now divine;
And though come my ships from sea,
They can bring no heart to me,
Evermore, evermore.
THE BARON'S LAST BANQUET.--Albert G. Greene.
>
OPEL
'ER a low couch the setting sun had thrown its latest ray,
Where, in his last strong agony, a dying warrior lay,
The stern old Baron Rudiger, whose frame had ne'er been
bent
By wasting pain, till time and toil its iron strength had spent.
“They come around me here, and say my days of life are o'er;
That I shall mount my noble steed and lead my band no
more;
They come, and, to my beard, they dare to tell me now that I,
Their own liege lord and master born, that I,—ha, ha!-must
die.
>
“And what is Death? I've dared him oft, before the Paynim
spear;
Think ye he's entered at my gate,–has come to seek me
here?
I've met him, faced him, scorned him, when the fight was
raging hot:-
I'll try his might, I'll brave his power; defy, and fear him
not.

“Ho! sound the tocsin from my tower, and fire the culverin;
Bid each retainer arm with speed; call every vassal in;
Up with my banner on the wall; the banquet board prepare;
Throw wide the portal of my hall, and bring my armor
there!”
An hundred hands were busy then: the banquet forth was
spread,
And rung the heavy oaken floor with many a martial tread;
While, from the rich, dark tracery, along the vaulted wall,
Lights gleamed on harness, plume, and spear, o'er the proud
old Gothic hall."
Fast hurrying through the outer gate, the mailed retainers
poured,
On through the portal's frowning arch, and thronged around
the board;
While at its head, within his dark, carved, oaken chair of
state,
Armed cap-a-pie, stern Rudiger, with girded falchion, sate.
“Fill
every
beaker
up, my men; pour forth the cheering wine;
There's life and strength in every drop;—thanksgiving to the
vine!
Are ye all there, my vassals true? mine eyes are waxing dim;
Fill round, my tried and fearless ones, each goblet to the
brim.
“Ye 're there, but yet I see you not; draw forth each trusty
sword,
And let me hear your faithful steel clash once around my
board;
I hear it faintly ;-louder yet! What clogs my heavy breath ?
Up, all! and shout for Rudiger, 'Defiance unto Death!'”
Bowl rang to bowl, steel clanged to steel, and rose a deafen-
ing cry,
That made the torches flare around, and shook the flags on
high.
“Ho! cravens! do you fear him? Slaves! traitors! have ye
flown?
Ho! cowards, have ye left me to meet him here alone?

HE GIVETH HIS BELOVED SLEEP.—Mrs. Browning.
OF are
Borne inward into souls afar,
Among the Psalmist's music deep,
Now tell me if that any is
For gift or grace surpassing this,-
“He giveth his beloved sleep”?
What would we give to our beloved ?
The hero's heart, to be unmoved, -
The poet's star-tuned harp, to sweep,
The patriot's voice, to teach and rouse,
The monarch's crown, to light the brows?
“He giveth his beloved sleep.”
What do we give to our beloved ?
A little faith, all undisproved,
A little dust, to overweep, —
And bitter memories, to make
The whole earth blasted for our sake.
“He giveth his beloved sleep.”
O earth, so full of dreary noises !
O men, with wailing in your voices !
O delved gold the wailers heap!
O strife, O curse, that o'er it fall !
God strikes a silence through you all,
And “giveth his beloved sleep."
His dews drop mutely on the hill,
His cloud above it saileth still,
Though on its slope men sow and reap;
More softly, than the dew is shed,

Most like a tired child at a show,

Would now its wearied vision close,
Would childlike on his love repose

With love's sweet notes to grace your song,
To pierce the heart with thrilling lay,
Listen to mine Anne Hathaway!

Phæbus might wondering stop to hear.
To melt the sad, make blithe the gay,
And nature charm, Anne hath a way;
She hath a way,.

To breathe delight Anne hath a way.
When Envy's breath and rancorous tooth
Do soil and bite fair worth and truth,
And merit to distress betray,
To soothe the heart Anne hath a way.
She hath a way to chase despair,
To heal all grief, to cure all care,
Turn foulest night to fairest day,
Thou know'st, fond heart, Anne hath a way;
She hath a way,
Anne Hathaway;
To make grief bliss, Anne hath a way.
Talk not of gems, the orient list,
The diamond, topaz, amethyst,
The emerald mild, the ruby gay;
Talk of my gem, Anne Hathaway!
She hath a way, with her bright eye,
Their various lustres to defy,–

So sweet to look Anne hath a way;

To shame bright gems, Anne hath a way.
But were it to my fancy given
To rate her charms, I'd call them heaven;
For though a mortal made of clay,
Angels must love Anne Hathaway;
She hath a way so to control,
To rapture, the imprisoned soul,
And sweetest heaven on earth display,
That to be heaven Anne hath a way;
She hath a way,

To be heaven's self, Anne hath a way.
REPLY OF PITT TO WALPOLE.-Lord Chatham.

HE atrocious crime of being a young man, which the honor-
able gentleman has, with such spirit and decency, charged
upon me, I shall neither attempt to palliate nor deny; but content
myself with wishing that I may be one of those whose follies may
cease with their youth, and not of that number who are ignorant
in spite of experience. Whether youth can be imputed to any
man as a reproach, I will not assume the province of determin-
ing; but surely age may become justly contemptible, if the oppor-
tunities which it brings have passed away without improvement,
and vices appear to prevail when the passions have subsided.
The wretch, who, after seeing the consequences of a thousand
errors, continues still to blunder, and whose age has only added
obstinacy to stupidity, is surely the object either of abhorrence or
contempt, and deserves not that his gray hairs should secure him
from insult. Much more is he to be abhorred, who, as he has ad-
vanced in age, has receded from virtue, and become more wicked
with less temptation; who prostitutes himself for money which
he cannot enjoy, and spends the remains of his life in the ruin of
his country.
But youth, sir, is not my only crime; I have been accused of
acting a theatrical part. A theatrical part may either imply some

peculiarities of gesture, or a dissimulation of my real sentiments,
and an adoption of the opinions and language of another man.
In the first sense the charge is too trifling to be confuted, and de-
serves only to be mentioned that it may be despised. I am at
liberty, like every other man, to choose my own language; and
though, perhaps, I may have had some ambition to please this
gentleman, I shall not lay myself under any restraint, nor very
solicitously copy his diction or his mien, however matured by age
or modelled by experience.
But if any man shall, by charging me with theatrical behavior,
imply that I utter any sentiments but my own, I shall treat him
as a calumniator and a villain; nor shall any protection shelter
him from the treatment he deserves. I shall, on such an occasion,
without scruple, trample upon all those forms with which wealth
and dignity entrench themselves; nor shall anything but age re-
strain my resentment,-age, which always brings one privilege,
that of being insolent and supercilious, without punishment.
But with regard, sir, to those whom I have offended, I am of
opinion that, if I had acted a borrowed part, I should have
avoided their censure; the heat that offended them, is the ardor
of conviction, and that zeal for the service of my country which
neither hope nor fear shall influence me to suppress. I will not
sit unconcerned while my liberty is invaded, nor look in silence
upon public robbery. I will exert my endeavors, at whatever
hazard, to repel the aggressor, and drag the thief to justice, who-
ever may protect him in his villany, and whoever may partake
of his plunder.

tions which the wit of man can work, would be very apt to
wonder by what kind of legerdemain Aaron Burr had contrived
to shuffle himself down to the bottom of the pack, as an accessory,
and turn up poor Blennerhassett as principal, in this treason.
Who, then, is Aaron Burr, and what the part which he has borne
in this transaction? He is its author, its projector, its active ex-
ecutor. Bold, ardent, restless, and aspiring, his brain conceived
it-his hand brought it into action.
Who is Blennerhassett? A native of Ireland, a man of letters,
who fled from the storms of his own country, to find quiet in ours.

On his arrival in America, he retired even from the population of
the Atlantic States, and sought quiet and solitude in the bosom of
our western forests. But he brought with him taste, and science,
and wealth; and, “lo, the desert smiled!” Possessing himself
of a beautiful island in the Ohio, he rears upon it a palace, and
decorates it with every romantic embellishment of fancy. A
shrubbery that Shenstone might have envied, blooms around
him. Music that might have charmed Calypso and her nymphs,
is his. An extensive library spreads its treasures before him. A
philosophical apparatus offers to him all the secrets and mys-
teries of nature. Peace, tranquillity, and innocence shed their
mingled delights around him. And, to crown the enchantment
of the scene, a wife who is said to be lovely even beyond her sex,
and graced with every accomplishment that can render it irre-
sistible, had blessed him with her love, and made him the father
of several children.
The evidence would convince you, sir, that this is but a faint
picture of the real life. In the midst of all this peace, this inno-
cence, and this tranquillity,—this feast of the mind, this pure
banquet of the heart,—the destroyer comes. He comes to turn
this paradise into a hell. Yet the flowers do not wither at his
approach, and no monitory shuddering through the bosom of their
unfortunate possessor warns him of the ruin that is coming upon
him. A stranger presents himself. It is Aaron Burr. Introduced
to their civilities by the high rank which he had lately held in
his country, he soon finds his way to their hearts, by the dignity
and elegance of his demeanor, the light and beauty of his conver-
sation, and the seductive and fascinating power of his address.
The conquest was not difficult. Innocence is ever simple and
credulous. Conscious of no designs itself, it suspects none in
others. It wears no guards before its breast. Every door and
portal and avenue of the heart is thrown open, and all who choose
it, enter. Such was the state of Eden, when the serpent entered
its bowers !
The prisoner, in a more engaging form, winding himself into
the
open
and unpractised heart of the unfortunate Blennerhassett,
found but little difficulty in changing the native character of that
heart, and the objects of its affection. By degrees, he infuses into
it the poison of his own ambition. He breathes into it the fire
of his own courage; a daring and desperate thirst for glory; an
ardor, panting for all the storm, and bustle, and hurricane of life.
In a short time, the whole man is changed, and every object of

his former delight relinquished. No more he enjoys the tranquil
scene; it has become flat and insipid to his taste. His books are
abandoned. His retort and crucible are thrown aside. His
shrubbery blooms and breathes its fragrance upon the air in vain
- he likes it not. His ear no longer drinks in the rich melody of
music; it longs for the trumpet's clangor and the cannon's roar.
Even the prattle of his babes, once so sweet, no longer affects
him; and the angel smile of his wife, which hitherto touched his
bosom with ecstasy so unspeakable, is now unfelt and unseen.
Greater objects have taken possession of his soul. His imagination
has been dazzled by visions of diadems, and stars, and garters,
and titles of nobility. He has been taught to burn with restless
emulation at the names of great heroes and conquerors,—of Crom-
well, and Caesar, and Bonaparte. His enchanted island is des-
tined soon to relapse into the wilderness; and, in a few months,
we find the tender and beautiful partner of his bosom, whom he
but lately “permitted not the winds” of summer“ to visit too
roughly,”—we find her shivering, at midnight, upon the wintry
banks of the Ohio, and mingling her tears with the torrents that
froze as they fell.
Yet this unfortunate man, thus deluded from his interest and
his happiness,— thus seduced from the paths of innocence and
peace, - thus confounded in the toils which were deliberately
spread for him, and overwhelmed by the mastering spirit and
genius of another,—this man, thus ruined and undone, and made
to play a subordinate part in this grand drama of guilt and treason,
- this man is to be called the principal offender; while he, by
whom he was thus plunged in misery, is comparatively innocent,
a mere accessory! Is this reason? Is it law? Is it humanity ?
Sir, neither the human heart nor the human understanding will
bear a perversion so monstrous and absurd; so shocking to the
soul; so revolting to reason!

Through the king's gate, unquestioned then,
A beggar went, and laughed, “This brings
Me chance, at last, to see if men
Fare better, being kings.”
The king sat bowed beneath his crown,
Propping his face with listless hand;
Watching the hour-glass sifting down
Too slow its shining sand.
“Poor man, what wouldst thou have of me?"
The beggar turned, and pitying,
Replied, like one in dream, “Of thee,
Nothing. I want the king.”
Uprose the king, and from his head
Shook off the crown, and threw it by.
“O man! thou must have known,” he said,
“A greater king than I.”
Through all the gates, unquestioned then,
Went king and beggar hand in hand.
Whispered the king, “Shall I know when
Before his throne I stand ?"
"
The beggar laughed. Free winds in haste
Were wiping from the king's hot brow
The crimson lines the crown had traced,
“This is his presence now.”
At the king's gate, the crafty noon
Unwove its yellow nets of sun;
Out of their sleep in terror soon
The guards waked one by one.
“Ho here! Ho there! Has no man seen
The king?” The cry ran to and fro;
Beggar and king, they laughed, I ween,
The laugh that free men know.
On the king's gate the moss grew gray ;
The king came not. They called him dead;
And made his eldest son one day
Slave in his father's stead.

THE CHANGELING.-J. R. Lowell.
I
HAD a little daughter,
And she was given to me
To lead me gently backward
To the Heavenly Father's knee,
That I, by the force of nature,
Might in some dim wise divine
The depth of his infinite patience
To this wayward soul of mine.
I know not how others saw her,
But to me she was wholly fair,
And the light of the heaven she came from
Still lingered and gleamed in her hair;
For it was as wavy and golden,
And as many changes took,
As the shadows of sungilt ripples
On the yellow bed of a brook.
To what can I liken her smiling
Upon me, her kneeling lover,
How it leaped from her lips to her eyelids
And dimpled her wholly over,
Till her outstretched hands smiled also,
And I almost seemed to see
The very heart of her mother
Sending sun through her veins to me!
She had been with us scarce a twelvemonth,
And it hardly seemed a day,
When a troop of wandering angels
Stole my little daughter away;
Or perhaps those heavenly Zincali
But loosed the hampering strings,
And when they had opened her cage-door,
My little bird used her wings.
But they left in her stead a changeling,
A little angel child,
That seems like her bud in full blossom,
And smiles as she never smiled;

When I wake in the morning, I see it
Where she always used to lie,
And I feel as weak as a violet
Alone 'neath the awful sky;
As weak, yet as trustful also;
For the whole year long I see
All the wonders of faithful Nature
Still worked for the love of me;
Winds wander, and dews drip earthward,
Rain falls, suns rise and set,
Earth whirls, and all but to prosper
A poor little violet.
This child is not mine as the first was,
I cannot sing it to rest,
I cannot lift it up fatherly,
And bliss it upon my breast;
Yet it lies in my little one's cradle
And sits in my little one's chair,
And the light of the heaven she's gone to
Transfigures its golden hair.

THEN the lessons and tasks are all ended,
And the school for the day is dismissed,
And the little ones gather around me,
To bid me good-night and be kissed :
Oh, the little white arms that encircle
My neck in a tender embrace!
Oh, the smiles that are halos of heaven,
Shedding sunshine of love on my face!
And when they are gone I sit dreaming
Of my childhood, too lovely to last :
Of love that my heart will remember
When it wakes to the pulse of the past,
Ere the world and its wickedness made me
A partner of sorrow and sin;
When the glory of God was about me.
And the glory of gladness within.

Oh! my heart grows weak as a woman's,
And the fountains of feeling will flow,
When I think of paths steep and stony,
Where the feet of the dear ones must go;
Of the mountains of sin hanging o'er them,
Of the tempest of fate blowing wild ;
Oh! there is nothing on earth half so holy
As the innocent heart of a child.
They are idols of hearts and of households;
They are angels of God in disguise ;
His sunlight still sleeps in their tresses,
His glory still beams in their eyes.
Oh! those truants from home and from heaven,
They have made me more manly and mild,
And I know how Jesus could liken
The kingdom of God to a child.
I ask not a life for the dear ones,
All radiant, as others have done,
But that life may have just enough shadow
To temper the glare of the sun:
I would pray God to guard them from evil,
But my prayer would bound back to myself;
Ah! a seraph may pray for a sinner,
But a sinner must pray for himself.
The twig is so easily bended,
I have banished the rule and the rod;
I have taught them the goodness of knowledge,
They have taught me the goodness of God;
My heart is a dungeon of darkness,
Where I shut them from breaking a rule;
My frown is sufficient correction;
My love is the law of the school.
I shall leave the old home in the autumn,
To traverse its threshold no more;

That meet me each morn at the door!

THE CHARCOAL-MAN.-J. T. Trowbridge.
HOUGH rudely blows the wintry blast,
And sifting snows fall white and fast,
Mark Haley drives along the street,
Perched high upon his wagon seat;
His sombre face the storm defies,
And thus from morn till eve he cries, –
Charco’! charco'!"
While echo faint and far replies,-
Hark, O! hark, O!”
“Charco’!”—“Hark, O!”-Such cheery sounds
Attend him on his daily rounds.
The dust begrimes his ancient hat;
His coat is darker far than that;
'Tis odd to see his sooty form
All speckled with the feathery storm;
Yet in his honest boscm lies
Nor spot nor speck,-though still he cries,-
“Charco'! charco’!”
And many a roguish lad replies,-
“Ark, ho! ark, ho!”
Charco'!”—“
-“ Ark, ho!”-Such various sounds
Announce Mark Haley's morning rounds.
Thus all the cold and wintry day
He labors much for little pay;
Yet feels no less of happiness
Than many a richer man, I guess,

When through the shades of eve he spies
The light of his own home, and cries,-
Charco’! charco’!”
And Martha from the door replies -
“Mark, ho! Mark, ho!”
"Charco’!”—“Mark, ho!”—Such joy abounds
When he has closed his daily rounds.
The hearth is warm, the fire is bright;
And while his hand, washed clean and white,
Holds Martha's tender hand once more,
His glowing face bends fondly o'er
The crib wherein his darling lies,
And in a coaxing tone he cries,
“Charco'! charco'!”
And baby with a laugh replies, –
“Ah, go! ah,
“Charco'!”—“Ah, go!”—while at the sounds
The mother's heart with gladness bounds.

Then honored be the charcoal-man!
Though dusky as an African,
'T is not for you, that chance to be
A little better clad than he,
His honest manhood to despise,
Although from morn till eve he cries, –

While mocking echo still replies -
“Hark, O! hark, O!”
“Charco'!”_"
-“Hark, O!”—Long may the sounds
Proclaim Mark Haley's daily rounds!

“No.” Jo closes his eyes, muttering, “I am wery thankful.”
After watching him closely a little while, Allan puts his mouth
very near his ear, and says to him in a low, distinct voice:
Did you ever know a prayer?”
“Never knowd nothink, sir.”
“Not so much as one short prayer?”
“No, sir. Nothink at all. Mr. Chadbands he wos a prayin'
wunst at Mr. Sangsby's, and I heerd him, but he sounded as if he
wos a speakin' to his-self, and not to me. He prayed a lot,-but I
could n't make out nothing on it. Different times there wos other
gen’lmen come down Tom-all-Alone's a-prayin', but they all mostly
sed as the t'other wuns prayed wrong, and all mostly sounded to
be a talking to theirselves, or a passing blame on the t'others, and
not a talkin' to us. We never knowd nothink. I never knowd
what it wos all about."
It takes him a long time to say this; and few but an experienced
and attentive listener could hear or, hearing, understand him.
After a short relapse into sleep or stupor, he makes, of a sudden,
a strong effort to get out of bed.
“Stay, Jo! What now?"
“It's time for me to go to that there berryin'-ground, sir," he
returns with a wild look.
Lie down, and tell me. What burying-ground, Jo?”
“Where they laid him as wos wery good to me,-wery good to
me, indeed, he wos. It's time fur me to go down to that there
berryin'-ground, sir, and ask to be put along with him. I wants
to go there and be berried. He used fur to say to me, 'I am as
poor as you to-day, Jo,' he ses. I wants to tell him that I am as
poor as him now, and have come there to be laid along with him.”
“By-and-by, Jo. By-and-by.”
“Ah! P'raps they would n't do it, if I wos to go myself. But
will you promise to have me took there, sir, and me laid along
with him?"
I will, indeed.”
“Thank 'ee, sir; thank 'ee, sir. They 'll have to get the key of

there's a step there, as I used for to clean with my broom. It's

Fast. The cart is shaken all to pieces, and the rugged road is

BEAUTE
BEAUTY.-- Wm. Ellery Channing.
EAUTY is an all-pervading presence. It unfolds to the num-
berless flowers of the spring. It waves in the branches of the
trees and the green blades of grass. It haunts the depths of the
earth and the sea, and gleams out in the hues of the shell and the
precious stone. And not only these minute objects, but the ocean,
the mountains, the clouds, the heavens, the stars, the rising and
setting sun, all overflow with beauty. The universe is its temple;
and those men who are alive to it, cannot lift their eyes without
feeling themselves encompassed with it on every side.
Now, this beauty is so precious, the enjoyments it gives are so
refined and pure, so congenial with our tenderest and noblest feel-
ings, and so akin to worship, that it is painful to think of the mul-
titude of men as living in the midst of it, and living almost as
blind to it as if, instead of this fair earth and glorious sky, they
were tenants of a dungeon. And infinitive joy is lost to the world
by the want of culture of this spiritual endowment.
Suppose that I were to visit a cottage, and see its walls lined
with choicest pictures of Raphael, and every spare nook filled
with statues of the most exquisite workmanship, and that I were
to learn that neither man, woman, nor child ever cast an eye at
these miracles of art,- how should I feel their privation; how
should I want to open their eyes, and to help them to comprehend
and feel the loveliness and grandeur which in vain courted their

notice! But every husbandman is living in sight of the works of
a diviner Artist; and how much would his existence be elevated
could he see the glory which shines forth in their forms, hues,
proportions, and moral expression !
I have spoken only of the beauty of nature, but how much of
this mysterious charm is found in the elegant arts, and especially
in literature! The best books have the most beauty. The greatest
truths are wronged if not linked with beauty, and they win their
way most surely and deeply into the soul when arrayed in this,
their natural and fit attire. Now, no man receives the true
culture of a man, in whom the sensibility to the beautiful is not
cherished; and I know of no condition in life from which it
should be excluded.
A NEW-YEAR'S ADDRESS.-Edward Brooks.
THE old year, hoary with
the snows of age, exhausted with the
labors of its life, tottering under its weight of days, stood
trembling upon the brink of the grave. The closing day of its
life was waning. The last sunset threw its golden beams over the
white robe of the departing monarch. The stars came out on the
tented field of night to keep their vigils with him. Around the
altar of many a rustic church or solemn cathedral gathered God's
children to watch “ the old year out and the new year in.”
The hours fled slowly by-nine, ten, eleven-how solemnly the
last stroke of the clock floats out upon the still air. It dies gently
away, swells out again in the distance, and seems to be caught up
by spirit-voices of departed years, until the air is filled with melan-
choly strains. It is the requiem of the dying year. Tenderly,
mournfully it lingers upon the ear and sinks into the heart;
slowly and softly it dies away. The clock strikes twelve; the
grave opens and closes, and the old year is buried.
Turning with saddened hearts from the tomb, a gush of joyous
melody bursts upon us. The bells are ringing out their gladdest
notes from a thousand church spires. Peal upon peal the music
comes, until an exultant chorus seems to fill the air and rever-
berate from the sky. It is the chorus of welcome to the new-born
year.
“ Brave and strong,
Bright as Phænix, has the young New Year,
Out of the ashes of the old, leaped forth
To rule the world in triumph.”

We buried the old year in silence and sadness. We stood as
mourners at the grave of a departed friend. To many it brought
misfortune and affliction. From some it snatched away a fond
sister or manly brother; from some a doting father or affectionate
mother. The wife hath given her husband and the husband his
wife at its stern behest; the father hath consigned to its cold arms
the son in whom his life centred, and the mother hath torn from
her bosom her tender babe and buried it and her heart in the
cold, cold ground.
To some of us it was a kind, a generous year, and we have
learned to love it with deep and earnest affection. It loaded us
with blessings. It poured its good gifts into our cup until it ran
over with fulness. It was a pleasant, a jolly old year, too. I re-
member how its face was often wreathed with smiles; how its
eyes often twinkled with fun; and how it sometimes shook its old
sides with laughter.
Full of merriment and joy, of benefits and blessings, we had
learned to love the old year with a deep and abiding affection.
Now we have buried it with all it holds dear, in the sepulchre of
the ages. It sleeps there in its dreamless slumber-but its lessons,
its lessons remain. Oh! the lessons of the dead year! How im-
portant and impressive!
Come with me down to the burying-ground of the ages. Let us
enter the tomb of the buried years and learn their lessons of wis-
dom. Here they lie-the six thousand years that have lived and
died. What a spectacle of mingled glory and shame; of honor
and degradation; of the blessings of peace and the devastations
of war! Here is one with the smile of prosperity upon its brow;
there is a ghastly year of want and famine. Here is one bloody
with the carnage of the battle-field; here one lurid with the
flames of burning martyrs. Here is one black with the foul breath
of the plague and pestilence; here one ringing with the sighs and
mournings of stricken households; and here a hundred or more
resounding with the clanking of slave chains and the wails of an
enslaved people.
But the scene is not all so sombre. Light shineth even in the
darkness of the tomb. Here is a year bright with the deeds of a
Howard or a Florence Nightingale. Here is one irradiate with
the flashing star of Napoleon's destiny, which gave light and hope
to the down-trodden masses of Europe. Here lies one resounding
with the shout of victory when Charles Martel met the tide of
Moslem invasion and secured Christian civilization to the world.

Here is one vocal with the prayers that ascended from Plymouth's
rock-bound coast; here another breathing the spirit of peace and
Christian fellowship in Penn's quiet tones; here another filled
with the glad huzzas which welcomed Washington to the chair
of state; and here another ringing with the exultant shouts of
three millions of freemen born into freedom. With hearts swell-
ing with glad emotion we look further, and there in the distance
we see one with the star of Bethlehem upon its brow, and a halo
of glory around a babe sleeping in Bethlehem's manger. We see
the shepherds watching their flocks upon the hill-side of Judea,
and hear the voices of angels singing “Glory to God in the high-
est, and on earth peace and good will to men,” and our hearts join
the angelic chorus and sing “Glory to God” for the brightness
buried in the sepulchre of Time.
We have buried ours, the old year, with these that have gone
before. It lies with them folded in the slumber of death. We
leave them and come forth from the sepulchre.
The passing year is full of solemn admonition. It brings to
mind the rapid flight of time. The years go by like shadows on
the dial. A day, a week, a month, a year-what is it? The sun
rises, climbs to the zenith, sinks down the western slope, and a
day is gone. The week tolls itself away—one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, and it has floated down the stream of time. The
months chase each other through the circling year, and the new
calendar is begun before we were familiar with the old. Old Time
seems to stand like an archer with his quiver full of days, and
shoot them by us with the speed of swift-winged arrows. But
yesterday we lay a babe in the mother's arms; to-day, yoath,
manhood, and womanhood are here; to-morrow, old age, gray
hairs, a tottering form, and the tomb. “We spend our years like
a tale that is told. The days of our years are threescore years
and ten; and if by reason of strength they be fourscore years,
yet is their strength labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and
we fly away.”
Upon every tree the buds are dreaming of the warmer sunshine
which shall awaken them to life and clothe the forest in a mantle
of green. In the flower-buds lies sleeping all the rich profusion
of color and fragrance which shall give beauty to the summer
landscape and perfume to the summer air. Old Winter has turned
the chatter of the rivulet into stone, but the breath of Spring will
loosen its frozen torgue and send it laughing and chattering in
forest stream or mountain cascade. The snow lies on meadow

and grain field-but under the snow, down in the dark cold earth,
there are rootlets nestling together which contain the grass that
shall spread an emerald carpet under our feet, and the grain whose
golden billows shall rise and fall in the summer breeze.
This is the lesson of growth and development. Let us apply it
to the world of thought and feeling. In the mind of the babe,
wrapped in the soft slumbers of infancy, unconscious of its own
existence, are powers which may be developed into the genius of
a Newton or a Humboldt. In our hearts lie sleeping ideas of duty,
love for God and humanity, resolutions for the future, ideals of
spiritual excellence-which, if developed, may make us a blessing
and an example to the world.
The past is buried, the present is with us, the future is before
us; but soon our present and our future will be reckoned with
the past. The months come and go upon the wings of the wind.
The great bell of Time swinging in the dome of space is tolling
away our years. One after another they ring out upon the air and
float away into eternity. In a little while the knell for each one
of us will cease, and we will slumber with our fathers. But with
Christian faith we can see light even in the darkness of the tomb.
The grave is but the portal of Heaven. From above come voices
of loved ones calling us heavenward; and listening, we long for
the land of golden streets, celestial light, and unfading glory.
INVOCATION TO THE NEW YEAR.— Tennyson.
RING out; wild bells, to the wild sky,
The flying cloud, the frosty light;
The year is dying in the night;
Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.
Ring out the old, ring in the new,
Ring, happy bells, across the snow:
The year is going, let him go;
Ring out the false, ring in the true.
Ring out the grief that saps the mind,
For those that here we see no more;
Ring out the feud of rich and poor,
Ring in redress to all mankind.

Ring out a slowly dying cause,
And ancient forms of party strife;
Ring in the nobler modes of life,
With sweeter manners, purer laws.
Ring out the want, the care, the sin,
The faithless coldness of the times;
Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,
But ring the fuller minstrel in.
Ring out false pride in place and blood,
The civic slander and the spite;
Ring in the love of truth and right,
Ring in the common love of good.
Ring out old shapes of foul disease,
Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
Ring out the thousand wars of old,
Ring in the thousand years of peace.
Ring in the valiant man and free,
The larger heart, the kindlier hand;
Ring out the darkness of the land,
Ring in the Christ that is to be.
THE CLOSING YEAR.- Geo. D. Prentice.
'TI
IS midnight's holy hour, and silence now
Is brooding like a gentle spirit o'er
The still and pulseless world. Hark! on the winds
The bell's deep tones are swelling; 't is the knell
Of the departed year. No funeral train
Is sweeping past; yet, on the stream and wood,
With melancholy light, the moonbeams rest
. Like a pale, spotless shroud; the air is stirr'd
As by a mourner's sigh; and on yon cloud
That floats so still and placidly through heaven,
The spirits of the Seasons seem to stand, -
Young Spring, bright Summer, Autumn's solemn form,
And Winter with his aged locks,-and breathe,
In mournful cadences that come abroad
Like the far wind-harp's wild and touching waii,

A melancholy dirge o'er the dead year,
Gone from the earth forever,
'Tis a time
For memory and for tears. Within the deep,
Still chambers of the heart, a spectre dim,
Whose tones are like the wizard voice of Time
Heard from the tomb of ages, points its cold
And solemn finger to the beautiful
And holy visions, that have pass'd away,
And left no shadow of their loveliness
On the dead waste of life. The spectre lifts
The coffin-lid of Hope, and Joy, and Love,
And, bending mournfully above the pale,
Sweet forms that slumber there, scatters dead flowers
O'er what has pass'd to nothingness.
The year
Has gone, and with it many a glorious throng
Of happy dreams. Its mark is on each brow,
Its shadow in each heart. In its swift course,
It waved its sceptre o'er the beautiful, -
And they are not. It laid its pallid hand
Upon the strong man,-and the haughty form
Is fallen, and the flashing eye is dim.
It trod the hall of revelry, where thronged
The bright and joyous,—and the tearful wail
Of stricken ones is heard where erst the song
And reckless shout resounded. It pass'd o'er
The battle-plain, where sword, and spear, and shield,
Flash'd in the light of mid-day,—and the strength
Of serried hosts is shiver'd, and the grass,
Green from the soil of carnage, waves above
The crush'd and mouldering skeleton. It came,
And faded like a wreath of mist at eve;
Yet, ere it melted in the viewless air,
It heralded its millions to their home
In the dim land of dreams.

Remorseless Time!
Fierce spirit of the glass and scythe! What power
Can stay him in his silent course, or melt
His iron heart to pity! On, still on,

He presses, and forever. The proud bird,
The condor of the Andes, that can soar
Through heaven's unfathomable depths, or brave
The fury of the northern hurricane,
And bathe his plumage in the thunder's home,
Furls his broad wings at night-fall, and sinks down
To rest upon his mountain crag; but Time
Knows not the weight of sleep or weariness,
And Night's deep darkness has no chain to bind
His rushing pinion.
Revolutions sweep
O’er earth, like troubled visions o'er the breast
Of dreaming sorrow; cities rise and sink
Like bubbles on the water; fiery isles
Spring blazing from the ocean, and go back
To their mysterious caverns; mountains rear
To heaven their bald and blacken'd cliffs, and bow
Their tall heads to the plain; new empires rise,
Gathering the strength of hoary centuries,
And rush down, like the Alpine avalanche,
Startling the nations; and the very stars,
Yon bright and burning blazonry of God,
Glitter awhile in their eternal depths,
And, like the Pleiad, loveliest of their train,
Shoot fron their glorious spheres, and pass away
To darkle in the trackless void: yet Time,
Time, the tomb-builder, holds his fierce career,
Dark, stern, all pitiless, and pauses not
Amid the mighty wrecks that strew his path,
To sit and muse, like other conquerors,
Upon that fearful ruin he hath wrought.

THE JOLLY OLD PEDAGOGUE.— George Arnold.
'T
WAS a jolly old pedagogue, long ago,
Tall and slender, and sallow, and dry;
His form was bent and his gait was slow,
His long thin hair was as white as snow;
But a wonderful twinkle shone in his eye;
And he sang every night, as he went to bed,
“Let us be happy down here below ;-
The living should live, though the dead be dead,”
Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.

He taught his scholars the rule of three,
Writing, and reading, and history too;
He took the little ones on his knee,
For a kind old heart in his breast had he,
And the wants of the littlest child he knew;
“Learn while you ’re young,” he often said,
“There is much to enjoy down here below;
Life for the living, and rest for the dead!”
Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.
With the stupidest boys he was kind and cool,
Speaking only in gentlest tones;
The rod was hardly known in his school,-
Whipping, to him, was a barbarous rule,
And too hard work for his poor old bones;
Besid it was painful, he sometimes said:
“We should make life pleasant down here below;
The living need charity more than the dead,”
Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.
He lived in the house by the hawthorn lane,
With roses and woodbine over the door;
His rooms were quiet, and neat, and plain,
But a spirit of comfort there held reign,
And made him forget he was old and poor:
“I need so little,” he often said, -
“And my friends and relatives here below
Won't litigate over me, when I am dead,”
Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.
He smoked his pipe in the balmy air,
Every night when the sun went down,
While the soft wind played in his silvery hair,
Leaving his tenderest kisses there,
On the jolly old pedagogue's jolly old crown;
And, feeling the kisses, he smiled and said,
“ 'T is a glorious world, down here below;
Why wait for happiness till we are dead?”
Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.
He sat at his door, one midsummer night,
After the sun had sunk in the west,

And the lingering beams of golden light
Made his kindly old face look warm and bright;
While the odorous night-wind whispered “Rest;”
Gently, gently, he bowed his head,-
There were angels waiting for him, I know;
He was sure of happiness, living or dead, -
This jolly old pedagogue, long ago!
TOM BROWN AT THE TOMB OF DR. ARNOLD.
Thomas Hughes.
A
LL that was left on earth of him whom he had honored was
lying cold and still under the chapel floor. He would go
in
and see the place once more, and then leave it once for all. New
men and new methods might do for other people; let those who
would worship the rising star; he at least would be faithful to the
sun which had set. And so he got up and walked to the chapel
door and unlocked it, fancying himself the only mourner in all
the broad land, and feeding on his own selfish sorrow.
He passed through the vestibule, and then paused for a moment
to glance over the empty benches. His heart was still proud and
high, and he walked up to the seat which he had last occupied as
a sixth-form boy, and sat himself down there to collect his
thoughts. And, truth to tell, they needed collecting and setting
in order not a little. The memories of eight years were all danc-
ing through his brain, and carrying him about whither they
would; while beneath them all, his heart was throbbing with the
dull sense of a loss that could never be made up to him.
The rays of the evening sun came solemnly through the painted
windows above his head, and fell in gorgeous colors on the oppo-
site wall, and the perfect stillness soothed his spirit by little and
little. He turned to the pulpit, and looked at it, and then, leaning
forward with his head on his hands, groaned aloud. If he could
only have seen the Doctor again for one five minutes; have told
him all that was in his heart, what he owed to him, how he loved
and reverenced him, and would, by God's help, follow his steps in
life and death, he could have borne it all without a murmur.
But that he should have gone away forever without knowing
it all, was too much to bear. “But am I sure that he does not
know it all ?”—the thought made him start.—“May he not even

now be near me, in this very chapel ? If he be, am I sorrowing
as he would have me sorrow-as I should wish to have sorrowed
when I shall meet him again?”
He raised himself up and looked around; and after a minute
rose and walked humbly down to the lowest bench, and sat down
on the very seat which he had occupied on his first Sunday at
Rugby. And then the old memories rushed back again, but soft-
ened and subdued, and soothing him as he let himself be carried
away by them.
He looked up at the great painted window above the altar, and
remembered how, when a little boy, he used to try not to look
through it at the elm-trees and the rooks, before the painted glass
came-and the subscription for the painted glass, and the letter
he wrote home for money to give to it. And there, down below,
was the very name of the boy who sat on his right hand on that
first day, scratched rudely in the oak panelling.
And then came the thought of all his old school-fellows; and
form after form of boys, nobler, and braver, and purer than he,
rose up and seemed to rebuke him. Could he not think of them,
and what they had felt and were feeling; they who had honored
and loved from the first, the man whom he had taken years to
know and love? Could he not think of those yet dearer to him
who was gone, who bore his name and shared his blood, and were
now without a husband or a father?
Then the grief which he began to share with others became
gentle and holy, and he rose up once more, and walked up the
steps to the altar; and while the tears flowed freely down his
cheeks, knelt down humbly and hopefully to lay down there his
share of a burden which had proved itself too heavy for him to
bear in his own strength.
Here let us leave him-where better could we leave him, than
at the altar, before which he had first caught a glimpse of the
glory of his birthright, and felt the drawing of the bond which
links all living souls together in one brotherhood-at the grave,
beneath the altar, of him who had opened his eyes to see that
glory, and softened his heart till it could feel that bond ?
And let us not be hard on him, if at that moment his soul is
fuller of the tomb and him who lies there, than of the altar and
Him of whom it speaks. Such stages have to be gone through, I
believe, by all young and brave souls, who must win their way
through hero-worship, to the worship of Him who is the King
and Lord of heroes. For it is only through our mysterious human

relationships, through the love and tenderness and purity of
mothers, and sisters, and wives, through the strength and courage
and wisdom of fathers, and brothers, and teachers, that we can
come to the knowledge of Him, in whom alone the love, and the
tenderness, and the purity, and the strength, and the courage, and
the wisdom of all these dwell forever and ever in perfect fulness.

REAT in life, he was surpassingly great in death. For no
cause, in the very frenzy of wantonness and wickedness, by
the red hand of murder, he was thrust from the full tide of this
world's interest, from its hopes, its aspirations, its victories, into
the visible presence of death-and he did not quail. Not alone
for the one short moment in which, stunned and dazed, he could
give up life, hardly aware of its relinquishment, but through days
of deadly languor, through weeks of agony, that was not less agony
because silently borne, with clear sight and calm courage, he looked
into his open grave. What blight and ruin met his anguished eyes,
whose lips may tell—what brilliant, broken plans, what baffled,
high ambitions, what sundering of strong, warm, manhood's friend-
ships, what bitter rending of sweet household ties! Behind him
a proud, expectant nation, a great host of sustaining friends, a
cherished and happy mother, wearing the full rich honors of her
early toil and tears; the wife of his youth, whose whole life lay in
his; the little boys not yet emerged from childhood's day of frolic;
the fair young daughter; the sturdy sons just springing into closest
companionship, claiming every day and every day rewarding a
father's love and care; and in his heart the eager, rejoicing power
to meet all demand. Before him, desolation and great darkness !
And his soul was not shaken.
His countrymen were thrilled with instant, profound, and uni-
versal sympathy. Masterful in his mortal weakness, he became
the centre of a nation's love, enshrined in the prayers of a world.
But all the love and all the sympathy could not share with him
his suffering. He trod the wine-press alone. With unfaltering
front he faced death. With unfailing tenderness he took leave of
life. Above the demoniac hiss of the assassin's bullet he heard
the voice of God. With simple resignation he bowed to the
Divine decree.

As the end drew near, his early craving for the sea returned
The stately mansion of power had been to him the wearisome
hospital of pain, and he begged to be taken from its prison walls,
from its oppressive, stifling air, from its homelessness and hope-
lessness. Gently, silently, the love of a great nation bore the pale
sufferer to the longed-for healing of the sea, to live or to die, as
God should will, within sight of its heaving billows, within sound
of its manifold voices. With wan, fevered face tenderly lifted to
the cooling breeze, he looked out wistfully upon the ocean's
changing wonders; on its fair sails, whitening in the morning light;
on its restless waves, rolling shoreward to break and die beneath
the noonday sun; on the red clouds of evening arching low to the
horizon; on the serene and shining pathway of the stars. Let us
think that his dying eyes read a mystic meaning which only the
rapt and parting soul may know. Let us believe that in the
silence of the receding world he heard the great waves breaking
on a further shore, and felt already upon his wasted brow the
breath of the eternal morning.

VOICES OF THE DEAD.- Cumming.
WE die, but leave an influence behind us that survives. The
echoes of our words are evermore repeated, and reflected
along the ages. It is what man was that lives and acts after him.
What he said sounds along the years like voices amid the moun-
tain gorges; and what he did is repeated after him in ever-multi-
plying and never-ceasing reverberations. Every man has left
behind him influences, for good or for evil, that will never exhaust
themselves. The sphere in which he acts may be small, or it may
be great. It may be his fireside, or it may be a kingdom; a vil-
lage, or a great nation; it may be a parish, or broad Europe ; but
act he does, ceaselessly and forever. His friends, his family, his
successors in office, his relatives, are all receptive of an influence,
a moral influence which he has transmitted and bequeathed to
mankind; either a blessing, which will repeat itself in showers
of benedictions, or a curse, which will multiply itself in ever-
accumulating evil.
Every man is a missionary, now and forever, for good or for
evil, whether he intends and designs it or not. He may be a blot,
radiating his dark influence outward, to the very circumference

a
of society, or he may be a blessing, spreading benedictions over
the length and breadth of the world; but a blank he cannot be.
The seed sown in life springs up in harvests of blessings, or har-
vests of sorrow. Whether our influence be great or small, whether
it be good or evil, it lasts, it lives somewhere, within some limit,
and is operative wherever it is. The grave buries the dead dust,
but the character walks the world, and distributes itself, as a ben-
ediction or a curse, among the families of mankind.
The sun sets beyond the western hills, but the trail of light he
leaves behind him guides the pilgrim to his distant home. The
tree falls in the forest; but in the lapse of ages it is turned into
coal, and our fires burn now the brighter, because it grew and fell.
The coral insect dies, but the reef it raised breaks the surge on
the shores of great continents, or has formed an isle in the bosom
of the ocean, to wave with harvests for the good of man. We
live and we die; but the good or evil that we do lives after us, and
is not "buried with our bones.”
The babe that perished on the bosom of its mother, like a flower
that bowed its head and drooped amid the death-frosts of time,-
that babe, not only in its image, but in its influence, still lives
and speaks in the chambers of the mother's heart. The friend
with whom we took sweet counsel is removed visibly from the
outward eye; but the lessons that he taught, the grand sentiments
that he uttered, the holy deeds of generosity by which he was
characterized, the moral lineaments and likeness of the man,
still survive, and appear in the silence of eventide, and on the
tablets of memory, and in the light of morn, and noon, and dewy
eve; and, being dead, he yet speaks eloquently, and in the midst
of us.
Mahomet still lives in his practical and disastrous influence in
the East. Napoleon still is France, and France is almost Na-
poleon. Martin Luther's dead dust sleeps at Wittenberg, but
Martin Luther's accents still ring through the churches of Chris-
tendom. Shakespeare, Byron, and Milton, all live in their influ-
ence, for good or evil. The apostle from his chair, the minister
from his pulpit, the martyr from his flame-shroud, the statesman
from his cabinet, the soldier in the field, the sailor on the deck,
who all have passed away to their graves, still live in the practical
deeds that they did, in the lives they lived, and in the powerful
lessons that they left behind them.
Monuments, and columns, and statues, erected to heroes, poets,
orators, statesmen, are all influences that extend into the future

ages.
“The blind old man of Scio's rocky isle" still speaks. “The.
Mantuan bard” still sings in every school. Shakespeare, the bard
of Avon, is still translated into every tongue. The philosophy
of the Stagyrite is still felt in every academy. Whether these
influences are beneficent or the reverse, they are influences fraught
with power. How blest must be the recollection of those who,
like the setting sun, have left a trail of light behind them by which
others may see the way to that rest which remaineth with the
people of God!
It is only the pure fountain that brings forth pure water. The
good tree only will produce the good fruit. If the centre from
which all proceeds is pure and holy, the radii of influence from
it will be pure and holy also. Go forth, then, into the spheres that
you occupy, the employments, the trades, the professions, of social
life ;-go forth into the high places or into the lowly places of the
land ;-mix with the roaring cataracts of social convulsions, or
mingle amid the eddies and streamlets of quiet and domestic life;
whatever sphere you fill, carrying into it a holy heart, you will
radiate around you life and power, and leave behind you holy
and beneficent influences.

Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking;

Days of danger, nights of waking.

Hands unseen thy couch are strewing.

Every sense in slumber dewing.
Soldier, rest! thy warfare o'er,

Morn of toil, nor night of waking.

And the bittern sound his drum,
Booming from the sedgy shallow.
Ruder sounds shall none be near,
Guards nor warders challenge here;
Here's no war-steed's neigh and champing,
Shouting clans, or squadrons stamping.
Huntsman, rest! thy chase is done-
While our slumb'rous spells assail ye,
Dream not, with the rising sun,
Bugles here shall sound reveille.
Sleep! the deer is in his den;
Sleep! thy hounds are by thee lying;
Sleep! nor dream in yonder glen,
How thy gallant steed lay dying.
Huntsman, rest! thy chase is done;
Think not of the rising sun,
For at dawning to assail ye,
Here no bugle sounds reveille.
MARCO BOZZARIS.--Halleck.
AT
T midnight, in his guarded tent,
The Turk was dreaming of the hour
When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,
Should tremble at his power.
In dreams, through camp and court, he bore
The trophies of a conqueror;
In dreams his song of triumph heard;
Then wore his monarch's signet-ring;
Then pressed that monarch's throne-a king;
As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing,
As Eden's garden-bird.
An hour passed on,--the Turk awoke;
That bright dreain was his last;
He woke to hear his sentries shriek, –
“To arms! they come! The Greek! the Greek !"
He woke, to die 'midst flame, and smoke,
And shout, and groan, and sabre-stroke,
And death-shots falling thick and fast

As lightnings from the mountain-cloud;
And heard, with voice as trumpet loud,
Bozzaris cheer his band, -
“Strike-till the last armed foe expires !
Strike-for your altars and your fires !
Strike-for the green graves of your sires !
God, and your native land!”
They fought, like brave men, long and well;
They piled that ground with Moslem slain;
They conquered,,but Bozzaris fell,
Bleeding at every vein.
His few surviving comrades saw
His smile, when rang their proud hurrah,
And the red field was won ;
Then saw in death his eyelids close
Calmly, as to a night's repose,
Like flowers at set of sun.
Come to the bridal-chamber, Death!
Come to the mother when she feels,
For the first time, her first-born's breath;
Come when the blessed seals
That close the pestilence are broke,
And crowded cities wail its stroke;
Come in consumption's ghastly form,
The earthquake's shock, the ocean storm;
Come when the heart beats high and warm
With banquet-song, and dance, and wine,-
And thou art terrible; the tear,
The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier,
And all we know, or dream, or fear
Of agony, are thine.
But to the hero, when his sword
Has won the battle for the free,
Thy voice sounds like a prophet's word,
And in its hollow tones are heard
The thanks of millions yet to be.
Bozzaris! with the storied brave
Greece nurtured in her glory's time,
Rest thee; there is no prouder grave,
Even in her own proud clime.

ODE FOR DECORATION DAY.— Henry Peterson.
RING flowers to strew again
With fragrant purple rain
Of lilacs, and of roses white and red,
The dwellings of our dead, our glorious dead!
Let the bells ring a solemn funeral chime,
And wild war-music bring anew the time
When they who sleep beneath
Were full of vigorous breath,
And in their lusty manhood sallied forth,
Holding in strong right hand
The fortunes of the land,
The pride and power and safety of the North!
It seems but yesterday
The long and proud array-
But yesterday when ev'n the solid rock
Shook as with earthquake shock,
As North and South, like two huge icebergs, ground
Against each other with convulsive bound,
And the whole world stood still
To view the mighty war,
And hear the thunderous roar,
While sheeted lightnings wrapped each plain and hill.
Alas! how few came back,
From battle and from wrack!
Alas! how many lie
Beneath a Southern sky,
Who never heard the fearful fight was done,
And all they fought for won.
Sweeter, I think, their sleep,
More peaceful and more deep,
Could they but know their wounds were not in vain,
Could they but hear the grand triumphal strain,

And see their homes unmarred by hostile tread.
Ah! let us trust it is so with our dead-
That they the thrilling joy of triumph feel,
And in that joy disdain the foeman's steel.
We mourn for all, but each doth think of one
More precious to the heart than aught beside-
Some father, brother, husband, or some son
Who came not back, or coming, sank and died, -
In him the whole sad list is glorified!
“He fell 'fore Richmond, in the seven long days
When battle raged from morn till blood-dewed eve,
And lies there," one pale, widowed mourner says,
And knows not most to triumph or to grieve.
“My boy fell at Fair Oaks,” another sighs;
And mine at Gettysburg!” his neighbor cries,
And that great name each sad-eyed listener thrills.
I think of one who vanished when the press
Of battle surged along the Wilderness,
And mourned the North upon her thousand hills.
Oh! gallant brothers of the generous South,
Foes for a day and brothers for all time,
I charge you by the memories of our youth,
By Yorktown's field and Montezuma's clime,
Hold our dead sacred-let them quietly rest
In your unnumbered vales, where God thought best.
Your vines and flowers learned long since to forgive,
And o'er their graves a 'broidered mantle weave;
Be you as kind as they are, and the word
Shall reach the Northland with each summer bird,
And thoughts as sweet as summer shall awake
Responsive to your kindness, and shall make
Our peace the peace of brothers once again,
And banish utterly the days of pain.
And ye, O Northmen! be ye not outdone
In generous thought and deed.
We all do need forgiveness, every one;
And they that give shall find it in their need.
Spare of your Aowers to deck the stranger's grave,
Who died for a lost cause-

A soul more daring, resolute, and brave
Ne'er won a world's applause !
A brave man's hatred pauses at the tomb.
For him some Southern home was robed in gloom,
Some wife or mother looked with longing eyes
Through the sad days and nights with tears and sighs,-
Hope slowly hardening into gaunt Despair.
Then let your foeman's grave remembrance share;
Pity a higher charm to Valor lends,
And in the realms of Sorrow all are friends.
Yes, bring fresh flowers and strew the.soldier's grave,
Whether he proudly lies
Beneath our Northern skies,
Or where the Southern palms their branches wave.
Let the bells toll and wild war music swell,
And for one day the thought of all the past,
Of all those memories vast-
Come back and haunt us with its mighty spell.
Bring flowers then, once again,
And strew with fragrant rain
Of lilacs, and of roses white and red,
The dwellings of our dead !
WHO SHALL BE KING?- Charles F. Deems.
HO
Who
shall be our king? Let us go out among the sons of men,
and take our oil of consecration, and let them pass in great
procession and array before us, that we may choose our king.
Shall it be Adam, or Noah, or Moses, or Solomon, or Alexander,
or Plato, or Socrates, or Caesar, or Charlemagne, or Napoleon ?
See how these stand head and shoulders above surrounding men!
What loftiness, what breadth, what grandeur! What strength in
each right arm, what speculation in each eye, what command on
each brow, what leadership in each man! Which shall be king ?
But, see. He comes. Up from the loneliness of Judea, out from
a Jewish peasant girl's arms, out of a mechanic's shop, there comes
a man, statelier than the most monarchic ruler, solemn as eternity,
clear as the mid-day, deep as the heavens, purer than infancy,
sweeter than womanhood, older than Adam, more solitary than
Noah, grander than Moses, wiser than Solomon, more splendid

than Alexander, broader than Plato, acuter than Socrates, more
imperial than Julius, greater than Charlemagne, more glorious
than Napoleon.
Let us crown Him! Bring forth the royal diadem! Bring
crowns and coronets and garlands and wreaths! Pour out the
anointing oil on that lofty head of strength and beauty. He has
been grandest Martyr to all grandest truths. He must be King,
Emperor, whatsoever designates supremacy. The order of the
universe, the demands of truth, the exigencies of humanity,
require it.
Henceforth can no man tear that crown away. It adheres to
Jesus. He shall wear it forever. Forever can He appeal to the
utter kingliness of His nature, which is incapable of degradation
or deposition. Forever can He appeal to the fact that “to this
end He had been born, and for this cause had He come into the
world that He should bear witness to the truth.” And that mar-
tyrdom is so splendid that there is no point of space so remote
from the earth, and no point of eternity so remote from His
earthly history, that it shall not be made brilliant by the glory
of the sacrifice of our Martyr King.

E is fallen! We may now pause before that splendid prodigy,
which towered among us like some ancient ruin, whose frown
terrified the glance its magnificence attracted. Grand, gloomy,
and peculiar, he sat upon the throne, a sceptred hermit, wrapt in
the solitude of his own originality. A mind bold, independent,
and decisive,-a will despotic in its dictates,-an energy that
distanced expedition, and a conscience pliable to every touch of
interest, marked the outline of this extraordinary character-the
most extraordinary, perhaps, that in the annals of this world ever
rose, or reigned, or fell.
Flung into life in the midst of a revolution that quickened every
energy of a people who acknowledge no superior, he commenced
his course, a stranger by birth, and a scholar by charity! With
no friend but his sword, and no fortune but his talents, he rushed

into the lists where rank, and wealth, and genius had arrayed
themselves, and competition fled from him as from the glance of
destiny. He knew no motive but interest—he acknowledged no
criterion but success—he worshipped no God but ambition, and,
with an Eastern devotion, he knelt at the shrine of his idolatry.
Subsidiary to this, there was no creed that he did not profess,
there was no opinion that he did not promulgate; in the hope of
a dynasty, he upheld the Crescent; for the sake of a divorce, he
bowed before the Cross; the orphan of St. Louis, he became the
adopted child of the Republic; and, with a parricidal ingratitude,
on the ruins both of the throne and tribune, he reared the throne
of his despotism. A professed Catholic, he imprisoned the Pope; a
pretended patriot, he impoverished the country; and, in the name
of Brutus, he grasped without remorse and wore without shame
the diadem of the Caesars. Through this pantomime of policy,
fortune played the clown to his caprices. At his touch, crowns
crumbled, beggars reigned, systems vanished, the wildest theories
took the color of his whim, and all that was venerable, and all
that was novel, changed places with the rapidity of a drama.
Even apparent defeat assumed the appearance of victory-his
flight from Egypt confirmed his destiny-ruin itself only elevated
him to empire. But, if his fortune was great, his genius was
transcendent; decision flashed upon his counsels; and it was
the same to decide and to perform. To inferior intellects his
combinations appeared perfectly impossible, his plans perfectly
impracticable; but, in his hands, simplicity marked their de-
velopment, and success vindicated their adoption. His person
partook the character of his mind—if the one never yielded in
the cabinet, the other never bent in the field. Nature had no
obstacle that he did not surmount-space no opposition that he
did not spurn: and whether amid Alpine rocks, Arabian sands, or
Polar snows, he seemed proof against peril, and empowered with
ubiquity!
The whole continent trembled at beholding the audacity of his
designs, and the miracle of their execution. Scepticism bowed to
the prodigies of his performance; romance assumed the air of
history; nor was there aught too incredible for belief, or too fanci-
ful for expectation, when the world saw a subaltern of Corsica
waving his imperial flag over her most ancient capitals. All the
visions of antiquity became commonplace in his contemplation;
kings were his people-nations were his outposts; and he disposed
of courts, and crowns, and camps, and churches, and cabinets, as

if they were titular dignitaries of the chess-board. Amid all these
changes, he stood immutable as adamant.
It mattered little whether in the field or in the drawing-room-
with the mob or the levee-wearing the Jacobin bonnet or the
iron crown-banishing a Braganza, or espousing a Hapsburg-dic-
tating peace on a raft to the Czar of Russia, or contemplating defeat
at the gallows of Leipsic-he was still the same military despot.
In this wonderful combination his affectations of literature must
not be omitted. The jailer of the press, he affected the patronage
of letters-the proscriber of books, he encouraged philosophy-
the persecutor of authors and the murderer of printers, he yet
pretended to the protection of learning. Such a medley of con-
tradictions, and, at the same time, such an individual consistency,
were never united in the same character. A royalist—a republican
and an emperor-a Mohammedan-a Catholic and a patron of the
synagogue—a subaltern and a sovereign-a traitor and a tyrant-
a Christian and an infidel-he was, through all his vicissitudes,
the same stern, impatient, inflexible original—the same mysteri-
ous, incomprehensible self—a man without a model, and without
a shadow.
DREW THE WRONG LEVER.-Alexander Anderson.
THIS was what the pointsman said,
With both hands on his throbbing head:
“I drew the wrong lever standing here,
And the danger signals stood at clear;
“But before I could draw it back again,
On came the fast express, and then,-
“Then came a roar and a crash that shook
This cabin-floor, but I could not look
“At the wreck, for I knew the dead would peer
With strange dull eyes at their murderer here.”
“Drew the wrong lever?” “Yes, I say!
Go, tell my wife, and-take me away!”
That was what the pointsman said,
With both hands at his throbbing head.

Listen. So long as a twelve hours' strain
Rests like a load of lead on the brain,
With its ringing of bells and rolling of wheels,

The hand grow numb with a nerveless touch,
And the handles shake and slip in the clutch,

“Oh, that,” he said, “will not make me go;
I like a hand-organ best, you know,
With a monkey; and I do not care
To meet strange people anywhere!”
“But listen!” she said; "in Slumber-House
The cat forgets how to catch the mouse;
The naughty boys are never, there,
Stood in a corner, or set on a chair!”
“Well, that is a little better," said he,
“But I am going, at once, to sea;
I'm a captain, I'm not a little boy,
And this is my trumpet,-ship ahoy!”
But listen!” she said; “in Slumber-Room
Such beautiful flowers you see in bloom;
The best of them all, the very best,
You may pick if you choose-its name is Rest.”
“Why, that's a queer name for a flower,” he said.
“But you need n't think I'm going to bed!
I'm a robber again,-a great, big, brave,
Splendid robber,-and this is my cave!”
How quiet the cave grew, presently;
She smiled, and stooped low down to see,
And vhat she saw was her little brigand
Travelling far into Slumber-Land.
Two curtains white, with their fringes brown,
Had shut him fast into Slumber-Town,
And she knew that the restless little feet
Were walking softly in Slumber-Street.
PADDY BLAKE'S ECHO.-Samuel Lover.
In the gap of Dunlo
There's an Echo, or so,
And some of them echoes is very surprisin ;
You'll think, in a stave
That I mane to desaive,
For a ballad 's a thing you expect to find lies in.

In that hill forninst you
There's an echo as plain and as safe as the Bank, too;
But civilly spake
“How d' ye do, Paddy Blake?”
The echo politely says, “Very well, thank you!”
One day Teddy Keogh
With Kate Connor did go
To hear from the echo such wonderful talk, sir;
But the echo, they say,
Was conthrairy that day,
Or perhaps Paddy Blake bad gone out for a walk, sir.
So Ted says to Kate,
“'Tis too hard to be bate
By that deaf and dumb baste of an echo, so lazy,
But if we both shout
At each other, no doubt,
We'll make up an echo between us, my daisy !”
“Now, Kitty,” says Teddy,
“To answer be ready.”
“Oh, very well, thank you,” cried out Kitty then, sir;
“Would you like to wed,
Kitty darlin'!” says Ted.
“Oh, very well, thank you,” says Kitty again, sir.
“D'ye like me ?” says Teddy ;
And Kitty, quite really,
Cried, “Very well, thank you!” with laughter beguiling.
Now won't you confess,
Teddy could not do less
Than pay his respects to the lips that were smiling?
Oh, dear Paddy Blake,
May you never forsake
Those hills that return us such echoes endearing:
And, girls, all translate
The sweet echoes like Kate,
No faithfulness doubting, no treachery fearing.

“GOOD-NIGHT, PAPA."
"— American Messenger.
THE words of a blue-eyed child as she kissed her chubby hand
-,
you in the morning.”
It came to be a settled thing, and every evening, as the mother
slipped the white night-gown over the plump shoulders, the little
one stopped on the stairs and sang out, “Good-night, papa,” and
as the father heard the silvery accents of the child, he came, and
taking the cherub in his arms, kissed her tenderly, while the
mother's eyes filled, and a swift prayer went up, for, strange to
say, this man, who loved his child with all the warmth of his great
noble nature, had one fault to mar his manliness. From his youth
he loved the wine-cup. Genial in spirit, and with a fascination of
manner that won him friends, he could not resist when surrounded
by his boon companions. Thus his home was darkened, the heart
of his wife bruised and bleeding, the future of his child shadowed.
Three years had the winsome prattle of the baby crept into the
avenues of the father's heart, keeping him closer to his home, but
still the fatal cup was in his hand. Alas for frail humanity, in-
sensible to the calls of love! With unutterable tenderness God
saw there was no other way; this father was dear to him, the pur-
chase of his Son; he could not see him perish, and, calling a swift
messenger, he said, “Speed thee to earth and bring the babe.”
Good-night, papa," sounded from the stairs. What was there
in the voice? was it the echo of the mandate, “Bring me the
babe”-a silvery plaintive sound, a lingering music that touched
the father's heart, as when a cloud crosses the sun ? 'Good-night,
my darling;” but his lips quivered and his broad brow grew pale.
“Is Jessie sick, mother? Her cheeks are flushed, and her eyes
have a strange light.”
“Not sick," and the mother stooped to kiss the flushed brow;
she may have played too much. Pet is not sick ? »
“Jessie tired, mamma; good-night, papa ; Jessie see you in the
morning."

“That is all, she is only tired,” said the mother, as she took the
small hand. Another kiss and the father turned away; but his
heart was not satisfied.
Sweet lullabies were sung; but Jessie was restless and could not
sleep. “Tell me a story, mamma;” and the mother told of the
blessed babe that Mary cradled, following along the story till the
child had grown to walk and play. The blue, wide open eyes
filled with a strange light, as though she saw and comprehended
more than the mother knew.
That night the father did not visit the saloon; tossing on his
bed, starting from a feverish sleep and bending over the crib, the
long weary hours passed. Morning revealed the truth -Jessie
was smitten with the fever.
“Keep her quiet,” the doctor said; a few days of good nurs-
ing, and she will be all right.”
Words easily said ; but the father saw a look on the sweet face
such as he had seen before. He knew the message was at the
door.
Night came. “Jessie is sick; can't say good-night, papa ;” and
the little clasping fingers clung to the father's hand.
"O God, spare her! I cannot, cannot bear it!” was wrung from .
his suffering heart.
Days passed; the mother was tireless in her watching. With
her babe cradled in her arms her heart was slow to take in the
truth, doing her best to solace the father's heart: “A light case!
the doctor says, 'Pet will soon be well.'”
Calmly as one who knows his doom, the father laid his hand
upon the hot brow, looked into the eyes even then covered with
the film of death, and with all the strength of his manhood cried,
“Spare her, O God! spare my child, and I will follow thee."
With a last painful effort the parched lips opened: “Jessie's
too sick; can't say good-night, papa-in the morning.” There
was a convulsive shudder, and the clasping fingers relaxed their
hold; the messenger had taken the child.
Months have passed. Jessie's crib stands by the side of her
father's couch; her blue embroidered dress and white hat hang
in his closet; her boots with the print of the feet just as she last
wore them, as sacred in his eyes as they are in the mother's. Not
dead, but merely risen to a higher life ; while, sounding down
from the upper stairs, “Good-night, papa, Jessie see you in the
morning,” has been the means of winning to a better way one who
had sh'wn himself deaf to every former call.

APPEAL FOR STARVING IRELAND.--S. S. Prentiss.
a
THE
a
'HERE lies upon the other side of the wide Atlantic a beautiful
island, famous in story and in song. Its area is not so great as
that of the State of Louisiana, while its population is almost half
that of the Union. It has given to the world more than its share
of genius and of greatness. It has been prolific in statesmen,
warriors, and poets. Its brave and generous sons have fought suc-
cessfully all battles but their own. In wit and humor it has no
equal; while its harp, like its history, moves to tears by its sweet
but melancholy pathos.
Into this fair region God has seen fit to send the most terrible
of all those fearful ministers that fulfil his inscrutable decrees.
The earth has failed to give her increase. The common mother
has forgotten her offspring, and she no longer affords them their
accustomed nourishment. Famine, gaunt and ghastly famine, has
seized a nation with its strangling grasp. Unhappy Ireland, in the
sad woes of the present, forgets, for a moment, the gloomy history
of the past.
Oh, it is terrible that, in this beautiful world, which the good
God has given us, and in which there is plenty for all, men should
die of starvation! When a man dies of disease, he, it is true,
endures the pain. But around his pillow are gathered sympathiz-
ing friends, who, if they cannot keep back the deadly messenger,
cover his face, and conceal the horrors of his visage, as he delivers
his stern mandate. In battle, in the fulness of his pride and
strength, little recks the soldier whether the hissing bullet sings
his sudden requiem, or the cords of life are severed by the sharp
steel.
But he who dies of hunger, wrestles alone, day after day, with
his grim and unrelenting enemy. He has no friends to cheer him
in the terrible conflict; for, if he had friends, how could he die of
hunger? He has not the hot blood of the soldier to maintain him;
for his foe, vampire-like, has exhausted his veins. Famine comes
not up, like a brave enemy, storming, by a sudden onset, the for-
tress that resists. Famine besieges. He draws his lines round the
doomed garrison. He cuts off all supplies. He never summons
to surrender, for he gives no quarter.
Alas! for poor human nature, how can it sustain this fearful
warfare? Day by day the blood recedes; the flesh deserts; the
muscles relax, and the sinews grow powerless. At last the mind,
which at first had bravely nerved itself against the contest, gives

way, under the mysterious influences which govern its union with
the body. Then the victim begins to doubt the existence of an
overruling Providence. He hates his fellow-men, and glares upon
them with the longing of a cannibal ; and, may be, dies blas-
pheming.
This is one of the cases in which we may, without impiety, as-
sume, as it were, the function of Providence. Who knows but
that one of the very objects of this calamity is to test the benevo-
lence and worthiness of us, upon whom unlimited abundance is
showered ? In the name, then, of common humanity, I invoke
your aid in behalf of starving Ireland. He who is able, and will
not aid in such a cause, is not a man, and has no right to wear the
form. He should be sent back to nature's mint, and reissued as a
counterfeit on humanity, of nature's baser metal.
AMBITION OF A STATESMAN.—Henry Clay.
I"
HAVE been accused of ambition in presenting this measure-
ambition, inordinate ambition. If I had thought of myself
only, I should never have brought it forward. I know well the
perils to which I expose myself; the risk of alienating faithful and
valued friends, with but little prospect of making new ones, if any
new ones could compensate for the loss of those we have long
tried and loved; and the honest misconception both of friends
and foes. Ambition? If I had listened to its soft and seducing
whispers; if I had yielded myself to the dictates of a cold, calcu-
lating, and prudential policy, I would have stood still and unmoved.
I might even have silently gazed on the raging storm, enjoyed its
loudest thunders, and left those who are charged with the care
of the vessel of state to conduct it as they could.
I have been heretofore, often unjustly, accused of ambition.
Low, grovelling souls, who are utterly incapable of elevating them-
selves to the higher and nobler duties of pure patriotism-beings
who, forever keeping their own selfish ends in view, decide all
public measures by their presumed influence on their aggrandize-
ment-judge me by the venal rule which they prescribe to them-
selves. I have given to the winds those false accusations, as I
consign that which now impeaches my motives. I have no desire
for office, not even the highest. The most exalted is a prison, in
which the incarcerated incumbent daily receives his cold, heart-

less visitants, marks his weary hours, and is cut off from the
practical enjoyment of all the blessings of genuine freedom. I
am no candidate for any office in the gift of the people of these
States, united or separated; I never wish, never expect to be.
Pass this bill, tranquillize the country, restore confidence and
affection in the Union, and I am willing to go home to Ashland,
and renounce public service forever. I should there find, in its
groves, under its shades, on its lawns, 'midst my flocks and herds,
in the bosom of my family, sincerity and truth, attachment and
fidelity and gratitude, which I have not always found in the walks
of public life. Yes, I have ambition; but it is the ambition of
being the humble instrument, in the hands of Providence, to
reconcile a divided people; once more to revive concord and har-
mony in a distracted land-the pleasing ambition of contemplat-
ing the glorious spectacle of a free, united, prosperous, and fra-
ternal people.

THE THREE FISHERS.— Chas. Kingsley.
THREE fishers went sailing out into the west, –
,-
Out into the west, as the sun went down;
Each thought on the woman who loved him the best,
And the children stood watching them out of the town.
For men must work and women must weep,
And there's little to earn and many to keep,
Though the harbor bar be moaning.
Three wives sat up in the light-house tower,
And they trimmed the lamps as the sun went down;
They looked at the squall and they looked at the shower
And the night-rack came rolling up ragged and brown;
For men must work and women must weep,
Though storms be sudden and waters deep,
And the harbor bar be moaning.
Three corpses lay out on the shining sands,
In the morning gleam as the tide went down;
And the women are weeping and wringing their hands
For those who will never come home to the town.
For men must work and women must weep,-
And the sooner it's over, the sooner to sleep,
And good-bye to the bar and its moaning.

W
a
HILE I'm in the ones, I can frolic all the day;
I can laugh, I can jump, I can run about and play.
But when I'm in the tens, I must get up with the lark,
And sew, and read, and practise, from early morn till dark.
When I'm in the twenties, I'll be like sister Joe;
I'll wear the sweetest dresses (and, may be, have a beau !)
I'll go to balls and parties, and wear my hair up high,
And not a girl in all the town shall be as gay as I.
When I'm in the thirties, I 'll be just like mamma;
And, may be, I'll be married to a splendid big papa.
I'll cook, and bake, and mend, and mind, and grow a little fat-
But mother is so sweet and nice, I'll not object to that.
Oh, what comes after thirty? the forties ! Mercy, my!
When I grow as old as forty, I think I'll have to die.

But like enough the world won't last until we see that day ;-
It's so very, very, very, very, VERY far away!
THE LITTLE RUNAWAY.—Julia C. R. Dorr.
THE church was dim, and silent
With the hush before the prayer;
Only the solemn trembling
Of the organ stirred the air.
Without, the sweet, still sunshine;
Within, the holy calm,
Where priest and people waited
For the swelling of the psalm.
Slowly the door swung open,
And a little baby girl,
Brown-eyed, with brown hair falling
In many a wavy curl,-
With soft cheeks flushing hotly,
Shy glances downward thrown,
And small hands clasped before her,
Stood in the aisle alone;

Stood half abashed, half frightened,
Unknowing where to go,
While like a wind-rocked flower,
Her form swayed to and fro;
And the changing color fluttered
In her troubled little face
As from side to side she wavered
With a mute, imploring grace.
It was but for a moment;
What wonder that we smiled,
By such a strange, sweet picture
From holy thoughts beguiled?
Then up rose some one softly,
And many an eye grew dim,
As through the tender silence
He bore the child with him.
And I-I wondered (losing
The sermon and the prayer)
If, when, some time, I enter
The “many mansions” fair
And stand, abashed and drooping,
In the portal's golden glow,
Our God will send his angel
To show me where to go?
ZENOBIA'S AMBITION.- William Ware.
I
AM charged with pride and ambition. The charge is true, and
I glory in its truth. Whoever achieved anything great in let-
ters, arts, or arms, who was not ambitious ? Caesar was not more
ambitious than Cicero. It was but in another way. Let the am-
bition be a noble one, and who shall blame it? I confess I did
once aspire to be queen, not only of Palmyra, but of the East.
That I am.
I now aspire to remain so. Is it not an honorable
ambition? Does it not become a descendant of the Ptolemies and
of Cleopatra ?
I am applauded by you all for what I have already done. You
would not it should have been less. But why pause here? Is so

much ambition praiseworthy, and more criminal? Is it fixed in
nature that the limits of this empire should be Egypt, on the one
hand, the Hellespont and the Euxine, on the other? Were not
Suez and Armenia more natural limits? Or hath empire no natural
limit, but is broad as the genius that can devise, and the power
that can win ?
Rome has the West. Let Palmyra possess the East. Not that
nature prescribes this and no more. The gods prospering, and I
swear not that the Mediterranean shall hem me in upon the west,
or Persia on the east. Longinus is right, I would that the world
were mine. I feel, within, the will and the power to bless it, were
it so.
Are not my people happy? I look upon the past and the pres-
ent, upon my nearer and remoter subjects, and ask, nor fear the
answer,—Whom have I wronged? What province have I op-
pressed? What city pillaged? What region drained with taxes ?
Whose life have I unjustly taken, or estates coveted or robbed ?
Whose honor have I wantonly assailed? Whose rights, though
of the weakest and poorest, have I trenched upon? I dwell,
where I would ever dwell, in the hearts of my people. It is written
in your faces, that I reign not more over you than within you.
The foundation of my throne is not more power than love.
Suppose, now, my ambition add another province to our realm.
Is it an evil? The kingdoms already bound to us by the joint
acts of ourself and the late royal Odenatus, we found discordant
and at war. They are now united and at peace. One harmonious
whole has grown out of hostile and sundered parts. At my hands
they receive a common justice and equal benefits. The channels
of their commerce have I opened, and dug them deep and sure.
Prosperity and plenty are in all their borders. The streets of our
capital bear testimony to the distant and various industry which
here seeks its market.
This is no vain boasting,-receive it not so, good friends. It is
but truth. He who traduces himself, sins with him who traduces
another. He who is unjust to himself, or less than just, breaks a
law, as well as he who hurts his neighbor. I tell you what I am,
and what I have done, that your trust for the future may not rest
upon ignorant grounds. If I am more than just to myself, rebuke
me. If I have overstepped the modesty that became me, I am
open to your censure, and will bear it.
But I have spoken, that you may know your queen,-not only
hy her acts, but by her admitted principles. I tell you then that

I am ambitious,—that I crave dominion, and while I live will
reign. Sprung from a line of kings, a throne is my natural seat.
I love it. But I strive, too,-you can bear me witness that I do,-
that it shall be, while I sit upon it, an honored, unpolluted seat.
If I can, I will hang a yet brighter glory around it.
THE TOWN-PUMP.-Hawthorne.
I
HOLD high office in the town, being guardian of the best
treasure it has; and I exhibit, moreover, an admirable example
to the other officials, by the cool and downright discharge of my
business, and the constancy with which I stand to my post. Sun-
mer or winter, nobody seeks me in vain; for all day long I am
seen at the busiest corner, just above the market, stretching out
my arms to rich and poor.
At this sultry noontide, I am cupbearer to the parched populace,
for whose benefit an iron goblet is chained to my waist. To all
and sundry I cry aloud, at the very top of my voice: “Here it is,
gentlemen! here is the good liquor! here is the unadulterated ale
of Father Adam! better than brandy, wine, or beer; here it is, and
not a cent to pay. Walk up, walk up, gentlemen, and help your-
selves!”
It were a pity if all this outcry should draw no customers. Here
they come. “A hot day, gentlemen! Quaff and away again, so as
to keep yourselves in a nice cool sweat. You, my friend! will
need another cupful to wash the dust out of your throat, if it be
as thick there as it is on your cowhide shoes. I see that you have
trudged half a score of miles to-day, and, like a wise man, have
passed by the taverns and stopped at the running brooks and bub-
bling springs. Drink, and make room for that other fellow who
seeks my aid to quench the fever of last night's potations, which
he drained from no cup of mine.
“Welcome, most rubicund sir! You and I have been great
strangers hitherto! But mercy on you, man! The water abso-
lutely hisses down your red-hot gullet. Fill again, and tell me,
on the word of an honest toper, did you ever, in tavern or dram-
shop, spend the price of your children's food for a swig half so
delicious!

the memory of certain taps of the rod by a draught from the Town-
Pump. Take it, pure as the current of your young life; take it,
and may your heart and tongue never be scorched with a fiercer
thirst than now !
There, my dear child! put down the cup, and yield your place
to this elderly gentleman who treads so gingerly over the paving-
stones. What! he limps by, without so much as thanking me,
as if my hospitable offices were meant only for people who have
no wine-cellars.
Well, well, sir! no harm done, I hope? Go! draw the cork,
tip the decanter; but when your great toe shall set you a roaring,
it will be no affair of mine.

THE FOUR SUNBEAMS.-M. K. B.

Resolved that their course should be blest.

Not seek our own pleasuring all the day through,
Then meet in the eve at the west.”
One sunbeam ran in at a low cottage door
And played “hide and seek” with a child on the floor,
Till baby laughed loud in his glee,
And chased with delight his strange playmate so bright;
The little hands grasping in vain for the light,
That ever before them would flee.
One crept to the couch where an invalid lay,
And brought him a dream of the sweet summer day,
Its bird-song and beauty and bloom;
Till pain was forgotten and weary unrest,
And in fancy he roamed through the scenes he loved best,
Far away from the dim, darkened room.
One stole to the heart of a flower that was sad,
: And loved and caressed her until she was glad,

And lifted her white face again.
For love brings content to the lowliest lot,
And finds something sweet in the dreariest spot,
And lightens all labor and pain.
And one, where a little blind girl sat alone
Not sharing the mirth of her play-fellows, shone
On hands that were folded and pale,
And kissed the poor eyes that had never known sight,
That never would gaze on the beautiful light
Till angels had lifted the veil.
At last, when the shadows of evening were falling,
And the sun, their great father, his children was calling,
Four sunbeams sped into the west.
All said: “We have found that in seeking the pleasure
Of others, we fill to the full our own measure,”–
Then softly they sank to their rest.
OVER THE RIVER.- N. A. W. Priest.
OVER
VER the river they beckon to me,
Loved ones who crossed to the other side;
The gleam of their snowy robes I see,
But their voices are drowned by the rushing tide.
There's one with ringlets of sunny gold,
And eyes the reflection of heaven's own blue;
He crossed in the twilight gray and cold,
And the pale mist hid him from mortal view.
We saw not the angels that met him there-
The gate of the city we could not see;
Over the river, over the river,
My brother stands, waiting to welcome me.
Over the river the boatman pale
Carried another, the household pet;
Her brown curls waved in the gentle gale-
Darling Minnie! I see her yet!
She closed on her bosom her dimpled hands,
And fearlessly entered the phantom bark;

We watched it glide from the silver sands,
And all our sunshine grew strangely dark.
We know she is safe on the further side,
Where all the ransomed and angels be;
Over the river, the mystic river,
My childhood's idol is waiting for me.
For none return from those quiet shores,
Who cross with the boatman cold and pale;
We hear the dip of the golden oars,
And catch a glimpse of the snowy sail ;
And lo! they have passed from our yearning hearts-
They cross the stream and are gone for aye.
We may not sunder the veil apart
That hides from our vision the gates of day;
We only know that their barks no more
Sail with us o'er life's stormy sea;
Yet somewhere, I know, on the unseen shore,
They watch, and beckon, and wait for me.
And I sit and think when the sunset's gold
Is flashing on river, and hill, and shore,
I shall one day stand by the waters cold
And list for the sound of the boatman's oar.
I shall watch for a gleam of the flapping sail;
I shall hear the boat as it gains the strand;
I shall pass from sight with the boatman pale
To the better shore of the spirit-land.
I shall know the loved who have gone before,
And joyfully sweet will the meeting be,
When over the river, the peaceful river,
The angel of death shall carry me.
THE LAST CHARGE OF NEY.-Headley.
THE whole continental struggle exhibited no sublimer spectacle
than this last effort of Napoleon to save his sinking empire.
Europe had been put upon the plains of Waterloo to be battled
for. The greatest military energy and skill the world possessed
had been tasked to the utmost during the day. Thrones were
tottering on the ensanguined field, and the shadows of fugitive
kings fitted through the smoke of battle.

Bonaparte's star trembled in the zenith,- ,-now blazing out in its
ancient splendor, now suddenly paling before his anxious eye.
At length, when the Prussians appeared on the field, he resolved
to stake Europe on one bold throw. He committed himself and
France to Ney, and saw his empire rest on a single chance. Ney
felt the pressure of the immense responsibility on his brave heart,
and resolved not to prove unworthy of the great trust. Nothing
could be more imposing than the movement of that grand column
to the assault. That guard had never yet recoiled before a human
foe; and the allied forces beheld with awe its firm and terrible
advance to the final charge.
For a moment the batteries stopped playing, and the firing
ceased along the British lines, as, without the beating of a drum,
or the blast of a bugle, to cheer their steady courage, they moved
in dead silence over the plain. The next moment the artillery
opened, and the head of that gallant column seemed to sink into
the earth. Rank after rank went down; yet they neither stopped
nor faltered. Dissolving squadrons, and whole battalions disap-
pearing one after another in the destructive fire, affected not their
steady courage. The ranks closed up as before, and each, tread-
ing over his fallen comrade, pressed firmly on.
The horse which Ney rode fell under him, and he had scarcely
mounted another before it also sank to the earth. Again and
again did that unflinching man feel his steed sink down, till five
had been shot under him. Then, with his uniform riddled with
bullets, and his face singed and blackened with powder, he
marched on foot, with drawn sabre, at the head of his men. In
vain did the artillery hurl its storm of fire and lead into that
living mass. Up to the very muzzles they pressed, and, driving
the artillerymen from their own pieces, pushed on through the
English lines.
But at that moment a file of soldiers who had lain flat on the
ground, behind a low ridge of earth, suddenly rose, and poured a
volley in their very faces. Another and another followed, till one
broad sheet of flame rolled on their bosoms, and in such a fierce
and unexpected flow, that human courage could not withstand it.
They reeled, shook, staggered back, then turned and fled.
Ney was borne back in the refluent tide, and hurried over the
field. But for the crowd of fugitives that forced him on, he would
have stood alone, and fallen in his footsteps. As it was, disdain-
ing to fly, though the whole army was flying, he formed his men
into two immense squares, and endeavored to stem the terrific

a
current, and would have done so had it not been for the thirty
thousand fresh Prussians that pressed on his exhausted ranks.
For a long time these squares stood and let the artillery plough
through them. But the fate of Napoleon was writ; and though
Ney doubtless did what no other man in the army could have
done, the decree could not be reversed. The star, that had blazed
so brightly over the world, went down in blood, and the “bravest
of the brave” had fought his last battle. It was worthy of his
great name; and the charge of the Old Guard at Waterloo, with
him at their head, will be pointed to by remotest generations
with a shudder.
CHICKADEE.-H. R. Dory.
LL the earth is wrapped in snow,

Through the valley down below,
Whirls the blast.
All the mountain brooks are still,
Not a ripple from the hill,
For each tiny, murmuring rill
Is frozen fast.
Come with me
To the tree,
Where the apples used to hang!
Follow me
To the tree
Where the birds of summer sang!
There's a happy fellow there,
For the cold he does not care,
And he always calls to me,
“Chickadee, chickadee!”

He's a merry little fellow,
Neither red nor blue nor yellow,
For he wears a winter overcoat of gray;
And his cheery little voice
Makes my happy heart rejoice,
While he calls the livelong day-
Calls to me-
“Chickadee!”

Tapping on each tiny sprig,

Neither red nor blue nor yellow
He's the cheery bird of winter,

NATIONAL GLORY.-Henry Clay.
WE
E are asked, "What have we gained by the war?” I have
shown that we have lost nothing in rights, territory, or
honor; nothing for which we ought to have contended, according
to the principles of the gentlemen on the other side, or according
to our own. Have we gained nothing by the war? Let any man
look at the degraded condition of this country before the war, the
scorn of the civilized world, the contempt of ourselves, and tell
me if we have gained nothing by the war. What is our present
situation? Respectability and character abroad, security and confi-
dence at home. If we have not obtained, in the opinion of some,
the full measure of retribution, our character and constitution are
placed on a solid basis, never to be shaken.
The glory acquired by our gallant tars, by our Jacksons and
Browns on the land—is that nothing? True, we had our vicissi-
tudes: there were humiliating events which the patriot cannot
review without deep regret-but the great account, when it comes
to be balanced, will be found vastly in our favor. Is there a man
who would obliterate from the proud pages of our history the
brilliant achievements of Jackson, Brown, and Scott, and the
host of heroes on land and sea, whom I cannot enumerate: Is
there a man who could not desire a participation in the national
glory acquired by the war? Yes, national glory, which, however
the expression may be condemned by some, must be cherished by
every genuine patriot.
What do I mean by national glory? Glory such as Hull, Jack-
son, and Perry have acquired. And are gentlemen insensible to
their deeds—to the value of them in animating the country in the

hour of peril hereafter? Did the battle of Thermopyla preserve
Greece but once? Whilst the Mississippi continues to bear the
tributes of the Iron Mountains and the Alleghenies to her delta
and to the Gulf of Mexico, the eighth of January shall be re-
membered and the glory of that day will stimulate future patriots,
and nerve the arms of unborn freemen in driving the presumptu-
ous invader from our country's soil. Gentlemen may boast of
their insensibility to feelings inspired by the contemplation of
such events. But, I would ask, does the recollection of Bunker
Hill, Saratoga, and Yorktown, afford them no pleasure ? Every
act of noble sacrifice to the country, every instance of patriotic
devotion to her cause, has its beneficial influence. A nation's
character is the sum of its splendid deeds; they constitute one
common patrimony, the nation's inheritance.
THE IRISH-DISTURBANCE BILL.—Daniel O'Connell.
I
a
DO not rise to fawn or cringe to this house. I do not rise to
supplicate you to be merciful towards the nation to which I
belong,-towards a nation which, though subject to England, yet
is distinct from it. It is a distinct nation; it has been treated as
such by this country, as may be proved by history, and by seven
hundred years of tyranny. I call upon this house, as you value
the liberty of England, not to allow the present nefarious bill to
pass. In it are involved the liberties of England, the liberty of
the press, and of every other institution dear to Englishmen.
Against the bill I protest in the name of this Irish people, and
in the face of Heaven. I treat with scorn the puny and pitiful
assertions that grievances are not to be complained of, that our
redress is not to be agitated ! for, in such cases, remonstrances
cannot be too strong, agitation cannot be too violent, to show to
the world with what injustice our fair claims are met, and under
what tyranny the people suffer.
There are two frightful clauses in this bill. The one which does
away with trial by jury, and which I have called upon you to bap-
tize: you call it a court-martial,
,-a mere nickname; I stigmatize
it as a revolutionary tribunal. What, in the name of Heaven, is
it, if it is not a revolutionary tribunal ?
It annihilates the trial by jury; it drives the judge from his
bench,—the man who, from experience, could weigh the nice and

delicate points of a case; who could discriminate between the
straightforward testimony and the suborned evidence; who could
see, plainly and readily, the justice or injustice of the accusation.
It turns out this man, who is free, unshackled, unprejudiced; who
has no previous opinions to control the clear exercise of his duty.
You do away with that which is more sacred than the throne
itself,—that for which your king reigns, your lords deliberate, your
commons assemble.
If ever I doubted before of the success of our agitation for re-
peal, this bill, this infamous bill, the way in which it has been re-
ceived by the house, the manner in which its opponents have been
treated, the personalities to which they have been subjected, the
yells with which one of them has this night been greeted,-all
these things dissipate my doubts, and tell me of its complete and
early triumph.
Do you think those yells will be forgotten? Do you suppose
their echo will not reach the plains of my injured and insulted
country; that they will not be whispered in her green valleys, and
heard from her lofty hills ? Oh, they will be heard there! Yes;
and they will not be forgotten. The youth of Ireland will bound
with indignation : they will say, “We are eight millions ; and you
treat us thus, as though we were no more to your country than the
isle of Guernsey or of Jersey !”
I have done my duty ; I stand acquitted to my conscience and
my country; I have opposed this measure throughout; and I now
protest against it as harsh, oppressive, uncalled for, unjust, -as
establishing an infamous precedent by retaliating crime against
crime,-as tyrannous, cruelly and vindictively tyrannous.

There was scarce a word he uttered that was not a violation of the

because the limited talents of some men render it impossible for
them to be severe without being unparliamentary. But before I

ing with silent contempt anything which might fall from that
honorable member; but there are times when the insignificance
of the accuser is lost in the magnitude of the accusation. I know
the difficulty the honorable gentleman labored under when he
attacked me, conscious that, on a comparative view of our charac-
ters, public and private, there is nothing he could say which would
injure me. The public would not believe the charge. I despise
the falsehood. If such a charge were made by an honest man, I
would answer it in the manner I shall do before I sit down. But
I shall first reply to it when not made by an honest man.
The right honorable gentleman has called me "an unimpeached
traitor.” I ask why not “traitor," unqualified by any epithet? I
will tell him: it was because he durst not. It was the act of a
coward, who raises his arm to strike, but has not courage to give
the blow. I will not call him villain, because it would be un-
parliamentary, and he is a privy counsellor. I will not call him
fool, because he happens to be chancellor of the exchequer. But
I say, he is one who has abused the privilege of Parliament and
the freedom of debate, by uttering language which, if spoken out
of the House, I should answer only with a blour. I care not how
high his situation, how low his character, how contemptible his
speech; whether a privy counsellor or a parasite, my answer
would be a blow.
He has charged me with being connected with the rebels. The
charge is utterly, totally, and meanly false. Does the honorable
gentleman rely on the report of the House of Lords for the foun-
dation of his assertion? If he does, I can prove to the committee
there was a physical impossibility of that report being true. But
I scorn to answer to any man for my conduct, whether he be a
political coxcomb, or whether he brought himself into power by
a false glare of courage or not.
I have returned-not as the right honorable member has said,
to raise another storm-I have returned to discharge an honor-
able debt of gratitude to my country, that conferred a great re-
ward for past services, which, I am proud to say, was not greater
than my desert. I have returned to protect that Constitution of
which I was the parent and founder, from the assassination of
such men as the right honorable gentleman and his unworthy
associates. They are corrupt, they are seditious, and they, at this
very moment, are in a conspiracy against their country. I have
returned to refute a libel, as false as it is malicious, given to the
public under the appellation of a report of the committee of the

LIFE FED BY DEATH.-J. G. Holland.
LIFE exermore is fed by death,
earth and sea and
And, that a rose may breathe its breath,
Something must die.
Earth is a sepulchre of flowers,
Whose vitalizing mould
Through boundless transmutation towers,
In green and gold.
The oak-tree, struggling with the blast,
Devours its father tree,
And sheds its leaves and droops its mast,
That more may be.
The falcon preys upon the finch,
The finch upon the fly;
And nought will loose the hunger-pinch
But death's wild cry.
The milk-haired heifer's life must pass
That it may fill your own,
As passed the sweet life of the grass
She fed upon.
The power enslaved by yonder cask
Shall many burdens bear;
Shall nerve the toiler at his task,
The soul at prayer.
From lowly woe springs lordly joy;
From humbler good diviner;
The greater life must aye destroy
And drink the minor.

MARMION AND DOUGLAS.- Walter Scott.
THE train from out the castle drew,
But Marmion stopped to bid adieu :
“Though something I might 'plain,” he said,
Of cold respect to stranger guest,
Sent hither by your king's behest,
While in Tantallon's towers I stayed,
Part we in friendship from your land,
And, noble Earl, receive my hand.”
But Douglas round him drew his cloak,
Folded his arms, and thus he spoke ;-
“My manors, halls, and bowers shall still
Be open, at my sovereign's will,
To each one whom he lists, howe'er
Unmeet to be the owner's peer;
My castles are my king's alone,
From turret to foundation-stone,-
The hand of Douglas is his own,
And never shall in friendly grasp
The hand of such as Marmion clasp."
Burned Marmion's swarthy cheek like fire,
And shook his very frame for ire,
And—“This to me!” he said, -
“ An't were not for thy hoary beard, -
Such hand as Marmion's had not spared
To cleave the Douglas' head !
And first, I tell thee, haughty peer,
He who does England's message here,
Although the meanest in her state,
May well, proud Angus, be thy mate!
And, Douglas, more I tell thee here,

Even in thy pitch of pride,
Here in thy hold, thy vassals near,
(Nay, never look upon your lord,
And lay your hands upon your sword,)
I tell thee thou 'rt defied !
And if thou saidst I am not peer
To any lord in Scotland here,
Lowland or highland, far or near,
Lord Angus, thou hast lied !”
On the Earl's cheek the flush of rage
O’ercame the ashen hue of age:
Fierce he broke forth,—“And dar’st thou then
To beard the lion in his den,
The Douglas in his hall ?
And hop'st thou hence unscathed to go?
No, by St. Bride of Both well, no!
Up drawbridge, grooms!— What, warder, ho!
Let the portcullis fall.”
Lord Marmion turned, -well was his need!-
And dashed the rowels in his steed,
Like arrow through the archway sprung;
The ponderous grate behind him rung:
To pass there was such scanty room,
The bars, descending, razed his plume.
The steed along the drawbridge flies
Just as it trembled on the rise;
Not lighter does the swallow skim
Along the smooth lake's level brim;
And when Lord Marmion reached his band,
He halts, and turns with clenched hand,
And shout of loud defiance pours,
And shook his gauntlet at the towers.
“Horse! horse!” the Douglas cried, “and chase!”
But soon he reined his fury's pace:
“A royal messenger he came,
Though most unworthy of the name.

A close monopoly by patent right!
Yes,—bless the man who first invented sleep,
(I really can't avoid the iteration ;)
But blast the man with curses loud and deep,
Whate'er the rascal's name or age or station,
Who first invented, and went round advising,
That artificial cut-off,-Early Rising !
“Rise with the lark, and with the lark to bed,”
Observes some solemn, sentimental owl;
Maxims like these are very cheaply said;
But, ere you make yourself a fool or fowl,
Pray just inquire about his rise and fall,
And whether larks have any beds at all !

And he who cannot keep his precious head
Upon his pillow till it's fairly light,
And so enjoy his forty morning winks,

Thomson, who sung about the “Seasons,” said
It was a glorious thing to rise in season;
But then he said it-lying-in his bed,
At ten o'clock A. M.,—the very reason
He wrote so charmingly. The simple fact is,
His preaching was n't sanctioned by his practice.

'T is, doubtless, well to be sometimes awake,-
Awake to duty, and awake to truth,-

the end of time that she could n't say which of them began it;
but I say the kettle did. I ought to know, I hope! The kettle
began it, full five minutes by the little waxy-faced Dutch clock in
the corner, before the Cricket uttered a chirp.
Why, I am not naturally positive. Every one knows that I
would n't set my own opinion against the opinion of Mrs. Peery-
bingle, unless I were quite sure, on any account whatever. Nothing
should induce me. But this is a question of fact. And the fact
is, that the kettle began it, at least five minutes before the Cricket
gave any sign of being in existence. Contradict me, and I'll say
ten.
Let me narrate exactly how it happened. I should have pro-
ceeded to do so, in my very first word, but for this plain considera-
tion—if I am to tell a story I must begin at the beginning; and
how is it possible to begin at the beginning, without beginning at
the kettle?

It appears as if there were a sort of match, or trial of skill, you
must understand, between the kettle and the Cricket. And this
is what led to it, and how it came about.
Mrs. Peerybingle, going out into the raw twilight, and clicking
over the wet stones in a pair of pattens that worked innumerable
rough impressions of the first proposition in Euclid all about the
yard-Mrs. Peerybingle filled the kettle at the water-butt. Pres-
ently returning, less the pattens (and a good deal less, for they
were tall and Mrs. Peerybingle was but short), she set the kettle
on the fire.
In doing which she lost her temper, or mislaid it for an instant;
for, the water being uncomfortably cold, and in that slippy, slushy,
sleety sort of state wherein it seems to penetrate through every
kind of substance, patten-rings included-had laid hold of Mrs.
Peerybingle's toes, and even splashed her.
Besides, the kettle was aggravating and obstinate. It would n't
allow itself to be adjusted on the top bar; it would n't hear of ac-
commodating itself kindly to the knobs of coal, it would lean for-
ward with a drunken air, and dribble, a very idiot of a kettle, on
the hearth. It was quarrelsome, and hissed and spluttered mo-
rosely at the fire.
To sum up all, the lid, resisting Mrs. Peerybingle's fingers, first
of all turned topsy-turvy, and then, with an ingenious pertinacity
deserving of a better cause, dived sideways in-down to the very
bottom of the kettle. And the hull of the Royal George has never
made half the monstrous resistance to coming out of the water,
which the lid of that kettle employed against Mrs. Peery bingle,
before she got it up again.
It looked sullen and pig-headed enough, even then, carrying its
handle with an air of defiance, and cocking its spout pertly and
mockingly at Mrs. Peerybingle, as if it said, “I won't boil. Noth-
ing shall induce me.”
Now it was, you observe, that the kettle began to spend the even-
ing. Now it was, that the kettle, growing mellow and musical,
began to have irrepressible gurglings in its throat, and to indulge
in short vocal snorts, which it checked in the bud, as if it had n't
quite made up its mind yet to be good company. Now it was, that
after two or three such vain attempts to stifle its convivial senti-
ments, it threw off all moroseness, all reserve, and burst into a
stream of song so cosy and hilarious, as never maudlin nightingale
yet formed the least idea of.
And here, if you like, the Cricket did chime in with a Chirrup,
(6

a
Chirrup, Chirrup of such magnitude, by way of chorus,—with a
voice so astoundingly disproportionate to its size as compared with
the kettle, (size! you could n't see it !) that if it had then and
there burst itself like an overcharged gun, if it had fallen a victim
on the spot, and chirruped its little body into fifty pieces, it would
have seemed a natural and inevitable consequence, for which it
had expressly labored.
There was all the excitement of a race about it. Chirp, chirp,
chirp! Cricket a mile ahead. Hum, hum, hum-m-m! Kettle
making play in the distance, like a great top. Chirp, chirp, chirp!
Cricket round the corner. Hum, hum, hum-m-m! Kettle stick-
ing to him in his own way; no idea of giving in. Chirp, chirp,
chirp! Cricket fresher than ever. Hum, hum, hum-m-m!
Kettle slow and steady. Chirp, chirp, chirp! Cricket going in to
finish him. Hum, hum, hum-m-m! Kettle not to be finished.
Until at last, they got so jumbled together, in the hurry-skurry,
helter-skelter of the match, that whether the kettle chirped and
the Cricket hummed, or the Cricket chirped and the kettle hum-
med, or they both chirped and they both hummed, it would have
taken a clearer head than yours or mine to decide with anything
like certainty.
But of this there is no doubt, that the kettle and the Cricket, at
one and the same moment, and by some power of amalgamation
best known to themselves, sent each his fireside song of comfort
streaming into a ray of the candle that shone out through the
window, and a long way down the lane. And this light, bursting
on a certain person who, on the instant, approached towards it
through the gloom, expressed the whole thing to him, literally in
a twinkling, and cried, Welcome home, old fellow! Welcome
home, my boy!

Coincidence beautiful and most sublime! It was the very day
set apart by the elder daughter of the Church for prayer and
sacrifice throughout the world for the children of the sacred isl-
and, perishing by famine and pestilence in their houses and in
their native fields, and on their crowded paths of exile, on the
sea and in the havens, and on the lakes and along the rivers of
this far distant land. The chimes rung out by pity for his country-
men were O'Connell's fitting knell; his soul went forth on clouds
of incense that rose from altars of Christian charity; and the
mournful anthems which recited the faith, and the virtue, and
the endurance of Ireland were his becoming requiem.
But has not O'Connell done more than enough for fame? On
the lofty brow of Monticello, under a green old oak, is a block of
granite, and underneath are the ashes of Jefferson. Read the
epitaph,-it is the sage's claim to immortality : “Author of the
Declaration of Independence, and of the Statute for Religious
Liberty.” Stop now and write an epitaph for Daniel O'Connell:
“He gave liberty of conscience to Europe, and renewed the revo-
lutions of the kingdoms toward universal freedom, which began
in America and had been arrested by the anarchy of France.”
Let the statesmen of the age read that epitaph and be humble.
Let the kings and aristocracies of the earth read it and tremble.
Who has ever accomplished so much for human freedom with
means so feeble? Who but he has ever given liberty to a people
by the mere utterance of his voice, without an army, navy, or
revenues,-without a sword, a spear, or even a shield? Who but
he ever subverted tyranny, and saved the lives of the oppressed,
and yet spared the oppressor ? Who but he ever detached from
a venerable constitution a column of aristocracy, dashed it to the
earth, and yet left the ancient fabric stronger and more beautiful
than before? Who but he has ever lifted up seven millions of
people from the debasement of ages, to the dignity of freedom,
without exacting an ounce of gold, or wasting the blood of one
human heart?
Whose voice yet lingers like O'Connell's in the ear of tyrants,
making them sink with fear of change; and in the ear of the most
degraded slaves on earth, awaking hopes of freedom? Who before
him has brought the schismatics of two centuries together, concili-
ating them at the altar of universal liberty ? Who but he ever
brought Papal Rome and Protestant America to burn incense
together? It was O'Connell's mission to teach mankind that
Liberty was not estranged from Christianity, as was proclaimed

ROME
>
ROME AND CARTHAGE.- Victor Hugo.
OME, like the eagle, her formidable symbol, spreads her
wings, displays her powerful talons, seizes the lightning, and
takes her flight. Carthage is the sun of the world; it is on Car-
thage that her eyes are fixed. Carthage is mistress of seas. Car-
thage is mistress of peoples. She is a magnificent city, full of
splendor and opulence, glowing at every point with the strange
arts of the Orient.
Her inhabitants are polished, refined, finished, and lack nothing
that labor, men, and time can command. In a word, she is the
metropolis of Africa, and at the height of her culture; she can
mount no higher, and every step onward will now be downward.
Rome, on the contrary, has nothing. She is half savage, half
barbarous. She has her education and her fortune alike to gain.
All is before her; nothing behind.
Long the two nations are face to face. The one suns herself in
her glory; the other is growing in obscurity. But, little by little,
air and place are needed by both for development. Rome be-
gins to crowd Carthage; for long has Carthage pressed on Rome.
Seated on the opposite shores of the Mediterranean, the two cities
look one another in the eye. This sea no longer suffices to sepa-
rate them. Europe and Africa are in the balance, weighing one
against the other. Like two overcharged electric clouds, they
approach too near each other. They are eager to mingle their
lightnings. Here is the climax of this sublime drama.
What actors are before us! Two races,—this one, of merchants
and sailors; that one, of farmers and soldiers; two peoples, one
ruling by gold, one ruling by iron; two republics, one theocratic,
one aristocratic; Rome and Carthage; Rome with her army, Car-
thage with her fleet; Carthage, old, rich, and crafty; Rome, young,
poor, and strong; the past and the future; the spirit of discovery
and the spirit of conquest; the genius of travel and commerce,
the demon of war and ambition; the east and the south on one
side, the west and the north on the other; in short, two worlds,
the civilization of Africa and the civilization of Europe.

Each takes full measure of the other. Their attitudes before
the conflict are equally formidable. Rome, within the narrow
confines of her world, gathers all her forces, all her tribes. Car-
thage, who holds in her power Spain, Armorica, and that Britain
that the Romans believed to be at the end of the universe, is
ready to board the European ship.
The battle-flames blaze forth. In coarse, strong lines, Rome
copies the navy of her rival. The war at once breaks forth in
the peninsula and the islands. Rome collides with Carthage in
that Sicily where Greece and Egypt had already met, in that
Spain where, later yet, Europe and Africa met in contest, the east
and the west, the south and the north.
Little by little the combat thickens,—the world takes fire. It
is a hand-to-hand fight of Titans, who seize one another, and quit
their hold only to seize each other again. They meet again, and
are mutually repulsed. Carthage crosses the Alps; Rome passes
the sea. The two nations, personified in their two leaders, Hanni-
bal and Scipio, each grasping the other with fury, strive to end
the conflict. It is a duel without quarter, a combat to the death.
Rome reels; she utters the cry of anguish, “Hannibal at the
gates!”.... But once again she rises, gathers her forces for a
last blow, hurls herself on Carthage, and destroys her from the
face of the earth.

EDWARD GRAY.- Tennyson.
WEET Emma Moreland of yonder town
Met me walking on yonder way,
“And have you lost your heart?” she said;
“And are you married yet, Edward Gray ?”
Sweet Emma Moreland spoke to me;
Bitterly weeping I turned away:
“Sweet Emma Moreland, love no more
Can touch the heart of Edward Gray.
“Ellen Adair she loved me well,
Against her father's and mother's will:
To-day I sat for an hour and wept,
By Ellen's grave, on the windy hill.

Thought her proud, and fled over the sea;

When Ellen Adair was dying for me.
'Cruel, cruel the words I said !
Cruelly they come back to-day:
‘You're too slight and fickle,' I said,
"To trouble the heart of Edward Gray.'
“There I put my face in the grass-
Whispered, 'Listen to my despair:
I repent me of all that I did:
Speak a little, Ellen Adair!'
“Then I took a pencil, and wrote
On the mossy stone, as I lay,
'Here lies the body of Ellen Adair ;
And here the heart of Edward Gray!'

“Love may come, and love may go,
And fly, like a bird, from tree to tree;
But I will love no more, no more,
Till Ellen Adair come back to me.

Bitterly weeping I turned away :
There lies the body of Ellen Adair!
And there the heart of Edward Gray!”

So subtle a tangle of blood, indeed,
No Heraldry Harvey will ever succeed
In finding the circulation.
Depend upon it, my snobbish friend,
Your family thread you can't ascend,
Without good reason to apprehend
You may find it waxed, at the farther end,
By some plebeian vocation!
Or, worse than that, your boasted line
May end in a loop of stronger twine,
That plagued some worthy relation!

Near to the nest of his little dame,
Over the mountain-side or mead,

Snug and safe is that nest of ours,
Hidden among the summer flowers.

Wearing a bright black wedding coat;
White are his shoulders and white his crest,
Hear him call in his merry note:

Look, what a nice new coat is mine,
Sure there was never a bird so fine,

One weak chirp is her only note;
Braggart and prince of braggarts is he,
Pouring boasts from his little throat:

Never was I afraid of man;
Catch me, cowardly knaves, if you can.

Nice good wife, that never goes out,
Keeping house while I frolic about.

Six wide mouths are open for food ;

Gathering seed for the hungry brood.

This new life is likely to be
Hard for a gay young fellow like me.

Sober with work and silent with care;
Off is his holiday garment laid,
Half forgotten that merry air,

Where our nest and our nestlings lie.

THE JESTER CONDEMNED.--Horace Smith.
ONE
NE of the kings of Scanderoon,
A royal jester,
Had in his train a gross buffoon,
Who used to pester
The court with tricks inopportune,
Venting on the highest folks his
Scurvy pleasantries and hoaxes.
It needs some sense to play the fool,
Which wholesome rule
Occurred not to our jackanapes,
Who consequently found his freaks
Lead to innumerable scrapes,
And quite as many kicks and tweaks,
Which only seemed to make him faster
Try the patience of his master.
Some sin, at last, beyond all measure,
Incurred the desperate displeasure
Of his serene and raging Highness;
Whether he twitched his most revered
And sacred beard,
Or had intruded on the shyness
Of the seraglio, or let fly
An epigram at royalty,
None knows: his sin was an occult one;
But record tells us that the sultan
Meaning to terrify the knave,
Exclaimed, “T is time to stop that breath;

Thy doom is sealed ;-presumptuous slave!
Thou standest condemned to certain death.
Silence, base rebel !-no replying;
But such is my indulgence still,
That, of my own free grace and will,
I leave to thee the mode of dying.”
“Thy royal will be done ;-'t is just,”
Replied the wretch and kissed the dust;
“Since, my last moments to assuage,
Your Majesty's humane decree
Has deigned to leave the choice to me,
I'll die, so please you, of old age ! ”

PATRIOTISM.-T. F. Meagher.
BEREFT of patriotism, the heart of a nation will be cold and
cramped and sordid; the arts will have no enduring impulse,
and commerce no invigorating soul; society will degenerate and
the mean and vicious triumph. Patriotism is not a wild and
glittering passion, but a glorious reality. The virtue that gave to
Paganism its dazzling lustre, to Barbarism its redeeming trait, to
Christianity its heroic form, is not dead. It still lives to console,
to sanctify humanity. It has its altar in every clime; its worship
and festivities.
On the heathered hills of Scotland the sword of Wallace is yet
a bright tradition. The genius of France, in the brilliant literature
of the day, pays its high homage to the piety and heroism of the
young Maid of Orleans. In her new Senate-hall, England bids
her sculptor place, among the effigies of her greatest sons, the
images of Hampden and of Russell. In the gay and graceful
capital of Belgium, the daring hand of Geefs has reared a monu-
ment full of glorious meaning to the three hundred martyrs of
the revolution.
By the soft blue waters of Lake Lucerne stands the chapel of
William Tell. On the anniversary of his revolt and victory, across
those waters, as they glitter in the July sun, skim the light boats
of the allied Cantons, from the prows hang the banners of the
Republic, and as they near the sacred spot, the daughters of Lu-
cerne chant the hymns of their old poetic land. Then bursts forth
the glad Te Deum, and Heaven again hears the voice of that wild

chivalry of the mountains, which five centuries since pierced the
white eagle of Vienna, and flung it bleeding on the rocks of Uri.
At Innspruck, in the black aisle of the old Cathedral, the
peas-
ant of the Tyrol kneels before the statue of Andreas Hofer. In
the defiles and valleys of the Tyrol who forgets the day on which
he fell within the walls of Mantua ? It is a festive day all through
his quiet, noble land.
In that old Cathedral his inspiring memory is recalled amid the
pageantries of the altar : his image appears in every house: his
victories and virtues are proclaimed in the songs of the people:
and when the sun goes down, a chain of fires, in the deep red
light of which the eagle spreads his wings and holds his giddy
revelry, proclaims the glory of the chief whose blood has made
his native land a sainted spot in Europe.
BRITISH INFLUENCE.—John Randolph.
IMPO
MPUTATIONS of British influence have been uttered against
the opponents of this war. Against whom are these charges
brought? Against men who, in the war of the Revolution, were
in the councils of the nation, or fighting the battles of your coun-
try! And by whom are these charges made? By runaways,
chiefly from the British dominions, since the breaking out of the
French troubles. The great autocrat of all the Russias receives
the homage of our high consideration. The Dey of Algiers and
his divan of pirates are very civil, good sort of people, with whom
we find no difficulty in maintaining the relations of peace and
amity. “Turks, Jews, and Infidels,” or the barbarians and savages
of every clime and color, are welcome to our arms. With chiefs
of banditti, negro or mulatto, we can treat, and can trade.
Name, however, but England, and all our antipathies are up in
arms against her. Against whom? Against those whose blood
runs in our veins; in common with whom we claim Shakespeare,
and Newton, and Chatham, for our countrymen; whose govern-
ment is the freest on earth, our own only excepted; from whom
every valuable principle of our own institutions has been borrowed
-representation, trial by jury, voting the supplies, writ of habeaj
corpus, our whole civil and criminal jurisprudence ;-against our
fellow-Protestants, identified in blood, in language, in religion,
with ourselves.

In what school did the worthies of our land-the Washingtons,
Henrys, Hancocks, Franklins, Rutledges, of America-learn those
principles of civil liberty which were so nobly asserted by their
wisdom and valor? American resistance to British usurpation
has not been more warmly cherished by these great men and their
compatriots, -not more by Washington, Hancock, and Henry,-
than by Chatham and his illustrious associates in the British Par-
liament. It ought to be remembered, too, that the heart of the
English people was with us. It was a selfish and corrupt ministry,
and their servile tools, to whom we were not more opposed than
they were.
I trust that none such may ever exist among us; for tools will
never be wanting to subserve the purposes, however ruinous or
wicked, of kings and ministers of state. I acknowledge the in-
fluence of a Shakespeare and a Milton upon my imagination; of a
Locke upon my understanding; of a Sidney upon my political
principles; of a Chatham upon qualities which would to God I
possessed in common with that illustrious man; of a Tillotson, a
Sherlock, and a Porteus upon my religion. This is a British in-
fluence which I can never shake off.

THE PARTITION OF POLAND.- Charles James Fox.
Now, sir
, what was the conduct of your own allies to Poland
?
Is there a single atrocity of the French in Italy, in Switzer-
land, in Egypt, if you please, more unprincipled and inhuman
than that of Russia, Austria, and Prussia, in Poland ? What has
there been in the conduct of the French to foreign powers; what
in the violation of solemn treaties; what in the plunder, devas-
tation, and dismemberment of unoffending countries; what in
the horrors and murders perpetrated upon the subdued victims
of their rage in any district which they have overrun,-worse
than the conduct of those three great powers in the miserable,
devoted, trampled-on kingdom of Poland, and who have been, or
are, our allies in this war for religion, social order, and the rights
of nations ?
O, but you "regretted the partition of Poland!” Yes, regretted
-you regretted the violence, and that is all you did. You united
yourselves with the actors; you, in fact, by your acquiescence,
confirmed the atrocity. But they are your allies; and though

they overran and divided Poland, there was nothing perhaps, in
the manner of doing it which stamped it with peculiar infamy
and disgrace. The hero of Poland, perhaps, was merciful and
mild! He was as much superior to Bonaparte in bravery, and
in the discipline which he maintained, as he was his superior in
virtue and humanity!” He was animated by the purest principles
of Christianity, and was restrained in his career by the benevo-
lent precepts which it inculcates! Was he?
Let unfortunate Warsaw, and the miserable inhabitants of the
suburb of Praga in particular, tell! What do we understand to
have been the conduct of this magnanimous hero, with whom, it
seems, Bonaparte is not to be compared ? He entered the suburb
of Praga, the most populous suburb of Warsaw, and there he let
his soldiery loose on the miserable, unarmed, unresisting people!
Men, women, and children,-nay, infants at the breast,—were
doomed to one indiscriminate massacre! Thousands of them
were inhumanly, wantonly butchered! And for what? Because
they had dared to join in a wish to meliorate their own condition
as a people, and to improve their Constitution, which had been
confessed, by their own sovereign, to be in want of amendment.
And such is the hero upon whom the cause of “religion and
social order” is to repose! And such is the man whom we praise
for his discipline and his virtue, and whom we hold out as our
boast and our dependence; while the conduct of Bonaparte unfits
him to be even treated with as an enemy!

Her hair is still in papers,
Her cheeks still fresh with paint,-
Remains of her last night's blushes,
Before she intended to faint.
She dotes upon men unshaven,
And men with “flowing hair;”
She's eloquent over mustaches,
They give such a foreign air.
She talks of Italian music
And falls in love with the moon;
And, if a mouse were to meet her,
She would sink away in a swoon.
Her feet are so very little,
Her hands are so very white,
Her jewels so very heavy,
And her head so very light;
Her color is made of cosmetics
(Though this she will never own),
Her body is made mostly of cotton,
Her heart is made wholly of stone.
She falls in love with a fellow
Who swells with a foreign air;
He marries her for her money,
She marries him for his hair!

Both are well mated in life;
She's got a fool for a husband,
He's got a fool for a wife!

Nor I alone,-a thousand bosoms round
Inhale thee in the fulness of delight;
And languid forms rise up, and pulses bound
Livelier, at coming of the wind of night;
And, languishing to hear thy welcome sound,
Lies the vast inland stretched beyond the sight.
Go forth, into the gathering shade; go forth,
God's blessing breathed upon the fainting earth!
Go, rock the little wood-bird in his nest;
Curl the still waters, bright with stars ;
and rouse
The wide old wood from his majestic rest,
Summoning, from the innumerable boughs,
The strange, deep harmonies that haunt his breast.
Pleasant shall be thy way where meekly bows
The shutting flower, and darkling waters pass,
And where the o'ershadowing branches sweep the grass.
The faint old man shall lean his silver head
To feel thee; thou shalt kiss the child asleep,
And dry the moistened curls that overspread
His temples, while his breathing grows more deep;
And they who stand about the sick man's bed,
Shall joy to listen to thy distant sweep,
And softly part his curtains to allow
Thy visit, grateful to his burning brow.
Go-but the circle of eternal change,
Which is the life of nature, shall restore,
With sounds and scents from all thy mighty range,
Thee to thy birthplace of the deep once more.
Sweet odors in the sea-air, sweet and strange,
Shall tell the home-sick mariner of the shore;
And, listening to thy murmur, he shall deem
He hears the rustling leaf and running stream.

And hold communion with the things about me.
Ah me! how lovely is the golden braid,
That binds the skirt of night's descending robe!
The thin leaves, quivering on their silken threads,
Do make a music like to rustling satin,
As the light breezes smooth their downy nap.
Ha! what is this that rises to my touch,
So like a cushion? Can it be a cabbage ?
It is, it is that deeply injured flower,
Which boys do flout us with ;-but yet I love thee,
Thou giant rose, wrapped in a green surtout.
Doubtless in Eden thou didst blush as bright
As these, thy puny brethren; and thy breath
Sweetened the fragrance of her spicy air;
But now thou seemest like a bankrupt beau,
Stripped of his gaudy hues and essences,
And growing portly in his sober garments.
Is that a swan that rides upon the water?
O no, it is that other gentle bird,
Which is the patron of our noble calling.
I well remember, in my early years,
When these young hands first closed upon a goose;
I have a scar upon my thimble finger,
Which chronicles the hour of young ambition.
My father was a tailor, and his father,
And my sire's grandsire, all of them were tailors;
They had an ancient goose,-it was an heirloom
From some remoter tailor of our race.
It happened I did see it on a time
When none was near, and I did deal with it,
And it did burn me,-oh, most fearfully!
It is a joy to straighten out one's limbs,
And leap elastic from the level counter,
Leaving the petty grievances of earth,
The breaking thread, the din of clashing shears,
And all the needles that do wound the spirit,
For such a pensive hour of soothing silence.

GHOSTS.—De Witt Talmage.
WE
E never met but one ghost in all our life. It was a very dark
night, and we were seven years of age. There was a Ger-
man cooper, who, on the outskirts of the village, had a shop.
It was an interesting spot, and we frequented it. There was a
congregation of barrels, kegs, casks, and firkins that excited our
boyish admiration. There the old man stood, day after day,
hammering away at his trade. He was fond of talk, and had
his head full of all that was weird, mysterious, and tragic.
During the course of his life he had seen almost as many ghosts
as firkins; had seen them in Germany, on the ocean, and in
America.
One summer afternoon, perhaps having made an unusually
lucrative bargain in hoop-poles, the tide of his discourse bore
everything before it. We hung on his lips entranced. We noticed
not that the shadows of the evening were gathering, nor remem-
bered that we were a mile from home. He had wrought up our
boyish imagination to the tip-top pitch. He had told us how doors
opened when there was no hand on the latch, and the eyes of a
face in a picture winked one windy night; and how intangible
objects in white would glide across the room, and headless trunks
rode past on phantom horses; and how boys, on the way home
at night, were met by a sheeted form that picked them up and
carried them off, so that they never were heard of, their mother
going around as disconsolate as the woman in the “Lost Heir,"
crying, “Where's Billy ?"
This last story roused us up to our whereabouts, and we felt we
must go home. Our hair, that usually stood on end, took the
strictly perpendicular. Our flesh crept with horror of the expe-

dition homeward. Our faith in everything solid had been shaken.
We believed only in the subtile and intangible. What could a
boy of seven years old depend upon if one of these headless
horsemen might any moment ride him down, or one of these
sheeted creatures pick him up?
We started up the road. We were barefoot. We were not
impeded by any useless apparel. It took us no time to get under
way. We felt that if we must perish, it would be well to get as
near the doorsill of home as possible. We vowed that if we were
only spared this once to get home, we would never again allow
the night to catch us at the cooper's. The ground flew under our
feet. No headless horseman could have kept up. Not a star was
out. It was the blackness of darkness. We had made half the
distance, and were in “the hollow"—the most lonely and danger-
ous part of the way-and felt that in a minute more we might
abate our speed and take fuller breath.
But, alas! no such good fortune awaited us. Suddenly our feet
struck a monster, whether beastly, human, infernal, or supernal,
witch, ghost, demon, or headless horseman, we could not immedi-
ately tell. We fell prostrate, our hands passing over a hairy
creature; and, as our head struck the ground, the monster rose
up, throwing our feet into the air. To this day it would have
been a mystery, had not a fearful bellow revealed it as a cow,
which had lain down to peaceful slumber in the road, not antici-
pating the terrible collision. She wasted no time, but started up
the road. We joined her in the race. We knew not but that it
was the first instalment of disasters. And, therefore, away we
went, cow and boy; but the cow beat. She came into town a
hundred yards ahead. I have not got over it yet that I let that
cow beat.
That was the first and last ghost we ever met. We made up our
minds for all time to come that the obstacles in life do not walk
on the wind, but have either two legs or four. The only ghosts
that glide across the room are those of the murdered hours of the
past. When the door swings open without any hand, we send for
the locksmith to put on a better latch. Sheeting has been so high
since the war that apparitions will never wear it again. Friday
is an unlucky day only when on it we behave ill. If a salt-cellar
upset, it means no misfortune unless you have not paid for the
salt. Spirits of the departed have enough employment in the next
world to keep them from cutting up monkey-shines in this. Better
look out for cows than for spooks.

My very noble and approved good masters,
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
It is most true; true, I have married her;
The very head and front of my offending
Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in speech,
And little bless'd with the set phrase of peace;
For since these arms of mine had seven years pith,
Till now, some nine moons wasted, they have used
Their dearest action in the tented field;
And little of this great world can I speak,
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle;
And therefore little shall I grace my cause,
In speaking for myself: Yet, by your gracious patience,
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
What conjuration, and what mighty magic,
(For such proceeding I am charged withal,)
I won his daughter with.
Her father loved me; oft invited me,
Still question’d me the story of my life,
From year to year; the battles, sieges, fortunes,
That I have pass’d.
I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
To the very moment that he bade me tell it.
Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances,
Of moving accidents, by flood and field;
Of hair-breadth 'scapes i’ the imminent deadly breach;
Of being taken by the insolent foe,
And sold to slavery; of my redemption thence,
And with it all my travel's history:
These things to hear,
Would Desdemona seriously incline:
But still the house affairs would draw her thence:
Which ever as she could with haste despatch,
She'd come again, and with a greedy ear
Devour up my discourse. Which I observing,
Took once a pliant hour; and found good means
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart,
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,

Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
But not intentively: I did consent;
And often did beguile her of her tears,
When I did speak of some distressful stroke,
That my youth suffer’d. My story being done,
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
She swore,-in faith, 't was strange, 't was passing strange;
’T was pitiful, 't was wondrous pitiful:
She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
That Heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,
And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
I should but teach him how to tell my story,
And that would woo her. Upon this hint, I spake;
She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd;
And I loved her, that she did pity them.
This only is the witchcraft I have used;
Here comes the lady, let her witness it.

ANTONY'S SPEECH OVER CAESAR'S BODY.-Shakespeare.
FRIENDS, Romans, countrymen! lend me your ears ;
to praise
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you, Caesar was ambitious;
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Caesar answered it.
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest, -
For Brutus is an honorable man,
So are they all, all honorable men,-
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says he was ambitious,
And Brutus is an honorable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious ?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept;

Ambition should be made of sterner stuff :
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,
And Brutus is an honorable man.
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal,
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition ?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious,
And, sure, he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause:
What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?
O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason !-Bear with me;
My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.
But yesterday the word of Caesar might
Have stood against the world; now lies he there,
And none so poor to do him reverence.
O masters! if I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honorable men.
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
Than I will wrong such honorable men.
But here's a parchment, with the seal of Caesar;
I found it in his closet; 't is his will.
Let but the commons hear this testament,
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, -
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds,
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood;
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing it, as a rich legacy,
Unto their issue.
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this mantle; I remember
The first time ever Caesar put it on;
’T was on a summer's evening, in his tent;

That day he overcame the Nervii.-
Look! In this place ran Cassius' dagger through ;
See what a rent the envious Casca made;
Through this, the well-beloved Brutus stabbed,
And, as he plucked his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it,
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
If Brutus so unkindly knocked, or no;
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel ;
Judge, O ye gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all;
For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
Quite vanquished him. Then burst his mighty heart;
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey's statue,
Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
Oh, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.
Oh, now you weep; and I perceive you feel
The dint of pity ;-these are gracious drops.
Kind souls! What, weep you when you but behold
Our Caesar's vesture wounded ? Look ye here,
Here is himself, marred, as you see, by traitors.
Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
They that have done this deed are honorable:
What private griefs they have, alas ! I know not,
That made them do it. They are wise and honorable,
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
I am no orator, as Brutus is;
But as you know me all, a plain, blunt man,
That love my friend; and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him.
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men's blood ;-I only speak right on;
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor, poor dumb mouths,
And bid them speak for me. But were I Brutus,

POLONIUS ADVICE TO LAERTES.- Shakespeare.
TAREWELL. My blessing with you:
And these few precepts in thy memory
Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hooks of steel;
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatch'd, unfledy'd comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in,
Bear it, that the opposer may beware of thee.
Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy:
For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
And they in France, of the best rank and station,
Are most select and generous, chief in that.
Neither a borrower, nor a lender be: -
For loan oft loses both itself and friend;
And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
This above all,—To thine own self be true;
And it must follow, as the night the day,
Thou canst not then be false to any man.

A BATTLE OF ICEBERGS.-Harper's Young People.
“ WELL, Jack, my boy, d’ye see anything? Keep a bright look-
out, you know, for we all looks to you !” “Come, don't
make fun o' me, Bob! P'r’aps I'll have as sharp eyes as yourn afore
I'm half your size.” Anybody might well have wondered to hear a
child's voice speaking from the mast-head of a North Sea whaler,
Y

and still more surprised would he have been at sight of the figure
from which that voice proceeded. There were two persons in the
“crow's-nest,” as the lookout post of a whaler is called. This is
simply a big cask firmly lashed to the mast with small ropes, and
supported by two pieces of stout planking.
One of the two watchers on this occasion was a grim old sailor,
with a voice as harsh as his face, which, roughened by the storms
of fifty years, and framed in short iron-gray hair and whiskers,
looked very much like the battered figure-head of some weather-
worn old ship. His companion was a little boy of ten, whose fair hair
and round ruddy face appeared quite babyish beside the granite-
hewn visage of the “old salt.” But young as he looked, Jack
Raikes was no baby. Those blue eyes of his were as sharp as any
on board; and to run up the weather-rigging in a stiff breeze,
climb to the mast-head and hang his cap on it, was mere play to
"little Jack," as the sailors affectionately called him.
“So, my lad," said Bob Watson, laughing, “you thinks your
eyes 'll be as good as mine afore long. Well, you're a sharp-
sighted ’un for your age, you are, but I don't know as how you 're
quite up to me yet. Come, s’pose we tries which 'll sight a whale
first?” But the smile soon vanished from the old seaman's face,
as a gleam of sunshine fades into a rising cloud. He arched his
hand over his eyes, and gazed fixedly on the northward, his look
becoming graver and graver with every moment, until Jack was
quite startled. What's up, Bob? Anything wrong?”
“ Can't
say yet, lad, but I'm afeard so. Let's have another look. Yes,
it's just as I thought. God help us!” And putting both hands
to his mouth, he shouted at the top of his voice: “Deck, ahoy!
Look out for ice!”
The men, who were lying idly about the deck, sprang to their
feet at once, and there was a sudden bustle which showed that
the warning had been heard and understood.
“Where away ?”
hallooed the captain. “Right ahead—two on 'em bearin' down
upon us!” The captain's hard mouth set itself a little tighter, but
that was all. He threw a quick glance to windward, and theu
shouted to the steersman. “Keep her away a point or two!”
“Ay, ay, sir!
There was no sign of fear in either captain or crew-only a grave,
subdued look on every face, which showed that they fully under-
stood their danger, although it could not terrify them. And yet
the peril was one which might well have dismayed the bravest man
alive. Once caught between the two approaching mountains of

ice, the vessel would be crushed like an egg-shell, and she and all
her crew sent to the bottom together. Nor did there seem to be
much chance of escape. The wind was light, and what little there
was of it was driving the ship straight towards the icebergs as they
drifted with the current. Unless they should change their course,
or the wind shift suddenly, the doom of both ship and crew ap-
peared certain.
Little Jack had caught sight of the advancing masses almost as
soon as his old friend, and the sudden paling of his ruddy cheeks
showed how fully he understood the situation. He looked wist-
fully up into Bob's face, as if to ask whether there was any hope
for them; and the old sailor, mindful of his little pet even in the
teeth of that deadly peril, answered as cheerily as ever: “Well,
Jack, my son, them two lubbers are trying to outmanoover us,
ain't they? But you jist see if we don't git the weather-gauge on
'em yet!” By this time the icebergs were near enough to be
plainly visible from the deck, and the sudden chilling of the air
by their approach, like the coldness of coming death, was felt by
every man on board. Onward they came, those great cathedrals
of frost, slowly, steadily, mercilessly, like the march of a destroy-
ing army. And all the while the sea around them was blue and
bright, and the sun shone brightly in a cloudless sky, and the
great battlements of ice glowed like rainbows with every variety
of gorgeous coloring—blue, red, green, and gold. And so, with all
the beauty and splendor of life around them, the doomed men
stood silently awaiting death.
Old Bob set his teeth hard, and pressed his hand firmly upon
little Jack's shoulder. “'Tain't for myself as I minds it,” he
muttered, “ for my time's pretty nigh up; but it do seem hard for
this little chap to be cut off in his just blossomin' like. If my life
could go for hisn, God knows I'd give it gladly.” And now, as if
to destroy the last chance of escape, her terrible assailants parted
suddenly, the one bearing down upon her port and the other upon
her starboard quarter, as if to shut her in between them. Even
the iron-nerved captain changed color, and flung down his speak-
ing-trumpet in despair. But just as all hope seemed gone, the
long-hoped for shift of the wind came.
“Starboard your helm !-starboard !” roared the captain, instant-
ly. “Starboard it is."
One quick turn of the helm, and the vessel glided past the
nearest berg, so close that one of the projecting ice-points scraped
her taffrail. Even that slight contact with the mighty mass made

a
her whole frame quiver from stem to stern; but the danger was
past, and the crew breathed freely once more. “Now, my boys,"
shouted the youngest of the men, “ stand by and see them two
have it out by theirselves.” It was even so. The two destroyers,
balked of their prey, were rushing straight upon each other. The
wind had lulled again as if holding its breath for the coming battle,
and all was as still as death, when the two moving mountains
clashed together.
There came a crash to which the loudest thunder would have
been as nothing, and the smooth sea boiled up into huge waves,
dashing the vessel about like a toy, while the very air was
darkened with flying splinters of ice. When the rush passed, the
contending icebergs were seen to be at some distance, swaying
dizzily to and fro like two living combatants reeling under a heavy
stroke. “At it again, old fellers,” cried young Simmonds; “ that
first bout don't count neither way.” Again came the terrible
shock, followed by a fierce, grinding crash, as a huge pinnacle of
ice, heavy enough to sink a hundred-gun ship, fell thundering into
the sea.
“Port your helm !-port!” shouted the captain. “ Port
it is," answered the steersman, coolly, and the vessel sheered off.
She was not a moment too soon. Hardly had she got clear when
the nearest iceberg was seen to lurch heavily forward. For an
instant it rocked violently to and fro, and then plunged down into
the sea, with a noise that might have been heard for miles. The
billows cast up by its fall tossed the strong ship aloft like a feather,
flinging all the crew upon their faces, and for a moment sea and
sky were all one blinding whirl of foam.
There was a moment of awful silence, then nothing could be
heard but the groaning of the ship’s timbers and the awful roar
of the waves. Then, as the frightened men rose to their feet, Bill
Simmonds cried out,“ We ain't dead this time, anyway." But old
Bob Watson drew little Jack to his side, and whispered to him:
"Jack, lad, when ye say yer prayers to-night, don't forget to
thank God for savin' us, for if 't wasn't for that shift o'wind, all
our lives warn't worth that."

NHREE little maidens out on the grass
Had gambolled the hours away ;
The summer was sweet, and the hours were fleet, —
Gwendolen, Maud, and May.
They had worked at their play the livelong day
As hard as maidens can;
So when six little feet were tired with the heat,
Then three little tongues began.
“What shall we do next?” cried the three, perplexed,
“For we really must have more fun.”
And they all thought deep, till a plan did leap
Full-blown from the brain of one.
“Let us ask of the Fairies"_'t was Maud that exclaimed-
The tallest and fairest was she-
“Let us ask them to grant whatever we want
And to list to wishes three!”
And what did they ask for? The youngest began,
The sweet little maiden May;

The weakest was she, but her spirit was free
And as gentle as the day;
"O, Fairy Queen, whom I never have seen,
I hope I address you aright-
If you have one to spare, I should like to wear
A dress of invisible white!”
Then the second one prayed for the Fairies' aid,
And a different wish had she;
Maud was her name, and she felt no shame,
For she knew what her wish would be.
Her limbs they were long, she was rosy and strong,
Such a maid as men extol,
Yet she begged for a prize that would shock the wise, -
“A wonderful Magic Doll!”
Now, you are the eldest, and what do you want,
Little Gwendolen, “faithful and true;"
With your face like a saint, and your manners so quaint,
Now what shall be done for you?
“O, Fairies,” she said, “let me cut off the head
Of a giant that sups upon men;
Let me grow strong and bold, like the heroes of old,
For now I am only ten!”
So the quick years flew, and the maidens grew,
And how do their wishes fare?
Do the Fairies forget the childish debt,
Or reward the childish prayer?
Oh, kind is the Queen of the Fays unseen!
And to Maud, a wedded bride,
She sent such a doll as mothers extol,
That toddled, and prattled, and cried !

Nor did Gwendolen miss her longed-for bliss,
A giant to conquer and slay ;
There are human needs, there are heroes' deeds,
For heroic hearts to-day.
But sweet little May, she vanished away
Beyond the Fairies' sight;
So the angels gave what the maid did crave,
A robe of invisible white.

Thus our rural hostess said:
Whilst Lou and I shot fitting glances,
Full of vague, unspoken dread.
Had we hither come for quiet,
Hither fled the city's noise,
But to change it for the tumult
Of those horrid country-boys?
Waking one with wild hallooing
Early every summer day ;
Shooting robins, tossing kittens,
Frightening the wrens away:
Stumbling over trailing flources,
Thumbing volumes gold and blue;
Clamoring for sugared dainties,
Tracking earth the passage through.
These and other kindred trials
Fancied we with woful sigh :
Those boys, those horrid boys, to-morrow!”
Sadly whispered Lou and I.

Graceful, easy, polished men;
I vowed to Lou, behind my knitting,
To trust no mother's words again.
For boyhood is a thing immortal
To every mother's heart and eye;
And sons are boys to her forever,
Change as they may to you and I.
To her, no line comes sharply marking
Whither or when their childhood went;

Levelled at last their downward bent.
Now by the window, still and sunny,
Warmed by the rich October glow,
The dear old lady waits and watches,
Just as she waited years ago.
For Lou and I are now her daughters-
We married “those two country-boys,”
In spite of all our sad forebodings
About their awkward ways and noise.
Lou springs up to meet a footfall,
I list no more for coming feet:
Mother and I are waiting longer
For steps on Beulah's golden street.
But when she blesses Lou's beloved,
And seals it with a tender kiss,
I know that loving words go upward,
Words to another world than this.
Alway she speaks in gentle fashion
About “

Though one is gray, and one has vanished
Beyond the touch of time or ill.

CURFEW MUST NOT RING TO-NIGHT.-Rosi Hartwick Thorpe.
'NGLAND'S sun was slowly setting o'er the hills so far away,
Filling all the land with beauty at the close of one sad day;
And the last rays kiss'd the forehead of a man and maiden fair,

Struggling to keep back the murmur, “ Curfew must not ring to-

Like a thousand gleaming arrows-like a deadly poisoned dart;
“Long, long years I've rung the Curfew from that gloomy shadowed
tower;
Every evening, just at sunset, it has told the twilight hour;
I have done my duty ever, tried to do it just and right,
Now I'm old, I will not miss it; girl, the Curfew rings to-night!”
Wild her eyes and pale her features, stern and white her thought-

And within her heart's deep centre, Bessie made a solemn vow;
She had listened while the judges read, without a tear or sigh,
“At the ringing of the Curfew-Basil Underwood must die."
And her breath came fast and faster, and her eyes grew large and
bright-
One low murmur, scarcely spoken—“Curfew must not ring to-

She with light step bounded forward, sprang within the old church-
door,
Left the old man coming slowly, paths he'd trod so oft before;
Not one moment paused the maiden, but with cheek and brow
aglow,
Staggered up the gloomy tower, where the bell swung to and fro:
Then she climbed the slimy ladder, dark, without one ray of light,
Upward still, her pale lips saying: “Curfew shall not ring to-
night.”
She has reached the topmost ladder, o'er her hangs the great dark
bell,
And the awful gloom beneath her, like the pathway down to hell ;
See, the ponderous tongue is swinging, 't is the hour of Curfew
now-
And the sight has chilled her bosom, stopped her breath and paled
her brow.

Out she swung, far out, the city seemed a tiny speck below;
There, 'twixt heaven and earth suspended, as the bell swung to

And the half-deaf sexton ringing (years he had not heard the

And he thought the twilight Curfew rang young Basil's funeral
knell;
Still the maiden clinging firmly, cheek and brow so pale and white,
Stilled her frightened heart's wild beating-—“ Curfew shall not ring
to-night."
It was o'er-the bell ceased swaying, and the maiden stepped once
more
Firmly on the damp old ladder, where for hundred years before
Human foot had not been planted; and what she this night had
done,
Should be told in long years after—as the rays of setting sun
Light the sky with mellow beauty, aged sires with heads of white,
Tell their children why the Curfew did not ring that one sad night.
O’er the distant hills came Cromwell; Bessie saw him, and her
brow,
Lately white with sickly terror, glows with sudden beauty now;
At his feet she told her story, showed her hands all bruised and
torn;
And her sweet young face so haggard, with a look so sad and worn,
Touched his heart with sudden pity-lit his eyes with misty light:
“Go, your lover lives!” cried Cromwell; “Curfew shall not ring

“ It was my cousin,” said Lady Clare;
“ To-morrow he weds with me."

"Oh! God be thanked !” said Alice the nurse,
That all comes round so just and fair;
Lord Ronald is heir of all your lands,
And you are not the Lady Clare.”
"Are ye out of your mind, my nurse, my nurse?”
Said Lady Clare, “that ye speak so wild ?”
"As God's above,” said Alice the nurse,
“I speak the truth; you are my child.
The old Earl's daughter died at my breast;
I speak the truth, as I live by bread!

I buried her like my own sweet child,
And put my child in her stead.”
“Falsely, falsely have ye done,
O mother,” she said, “if this be true,
To keep the best man under the sun
So many years from his due.”
Nay, now, my child,” said Alice the nurse,
But keep the secret for your life,
And all you have will be Lord Ronald's,
When you are man and wife.”
“If I'm a beggar born,” she said,
“I will speak out, for I dare not lie.
Pull off, pull off the brooch of gold,
And fling the diamond necklace by.”
“Nay, now, my child,” said Alice the nurse,
“But keep the secret all ye can.”
She said, “Not so; but I will know
If there be any faith in man."
“Nay, now, what faith !” said Alice the nurse;
“ The man will cleave unto his right.”
“And he shall have it,” the lady replied,
“ Tho' I should die to-night.”
“Yet give one kiss to your mother dear!
Alas, my child! I sinned for thee."
“O mother, mother, mother,” she said,
“So strange it seems to me.
“Yet here's a kiss for my mother dear,
My mother dear, if this be so;
And lay your hand upon my head,
And bless me, mother, ere I go.”
She clad herself in a russet gown,
She was no longer Lady Clare;
She went by dale, and she went by down,
With a single rose in her hair.

Leapt up from where she lay,

Dropt her head in the maiden's hand,
And followed her all the way.
Down stept Lord Ronald from his tower:
“O Lady Clare, you shame your worth!
Why come you drest like a village maid,
That are the flower of the earth ?”
“If I come drest like a viflage maid,
I am but as my fortunes are;
I am a beggar born,” she said,
"And not the Lady Clare.”
Play me no tricks,” said Lord Ronald,
“For I am yours in word and in deed;
Play me no tricks,” said Lord Ronald,
“ Your riddle is hard to read.”
O, and proudly stood she up!
Her heart within her did not fail ;
She looked into Lord Ronald's eyes,
And told him all her nurse's tale.
He laughed a laugh of merry scorn ;
He turned, and kissed her where she stood :
“If you are not the heiress born,
And I,” said he, “the next in blood-

“Ho! ho! for the day of peace is done,
And the day of wrath too well begun!

For Boston lieth in sore distress,
Pallid with hunger and long duress:
Her children starve, while she hears the beat
And the tramp of the red-coats in every street!”
"What, ho! What, ho!” Like a storm unspent,
Over the hillsides he came and went;
And Parson White, from his open door
Leaning bareheaded that August day,
While the sun beat down on his temples gray,
Watched him until he could see no more.
Then straight he strode to the church, and flung
His whole soul into the peal he rung;
Pulling the bell-rope till the tower
Seemed to rock in the sudden shower.
The shower of sound the farmers heard,
Rending the air like a living word !
Then swift they gathered with right good-will
From field and anvil and shop and mill,
To hear what the parson had to say
That would not keep till the Sabbath-day.
For only the women and children knew
The tale of the horseman galloping through-
The message he bore, as up and down,
He rode through the streets of Windham town.
That night, as the parson sat at his ease
In the porch, with his Bible on his knees
(Thanking God that at break of day
Frederick Manning would take his way,
With cattle and sheep from off the hills,
And a load of grain from the barns and mills,
To the starving city where General Gage
Waited unholy war to wage),
His little daughter beside him stood,
Hiding her face in her muslin hood.
In her arms her own pet lamb she bore,
As it struggled down to the oaken floor:
“It must go; I must give my lamb,” she said,
“To the children that cry for meat and bread,”
Then lifted to his her holy eyes,

“Nay, nay,” he answered, “there is no need
That the hearts of babes should ache and bleed;
Run away to your bed, and to-morrow play,
You and your pet, through the livelong day.”
He laid his hand on her shining hair,
And smiled as he blessed her, standing there,
With kerchief folded across her breast,
And her small brown hands together pressed,
A quaint little maiden, shy and sweet,
With her lambkin crouched at her dainty feet.
Away to its place the lamb she led,
Then climbed the stairs to her own white bed,
While the moon rose up, and the stars looked down
On the silent streets of Windham town.
But when the heralds of morning came,
Flushing the east with rosy flame,
With low of cattle and scurry of feet,
Driving his herd down the village street,
Young Manning heard from a low stone wall
A child's voice clearly yet softly call,
And saw in the gray dusk standing there
A little maiden with shining hair,
While crowding close to her tender side
Was a snow-white lamb to her apron tied.
“Oh, wait!" she cried, “ for my lamb must go
To the children crying in want and woe.
It is all I have.” And her tears fell fast
As she gave it one eager kiss—the last.
“The road will be long to its feet. I pray
Let your arms be its bed a part of the way;
And give it cool water and tender grass
Whenever a wayside brook you pass.”
Then away she flew like a startled deer,
Nor waited the bleat of her lamb to hear.
Young Manning lifted his steel-blue eyes
One moment up to the morning skies,
Then, raising the lamb to his breast, he strode
Sturdily down the lengthening road.

THE BALLAD OF BABIE BELL.-T. B. Aldrich.
HAYE
you
not heard the poets tell
How came the dainty Babie Bell
Into this world of ours?
The gates of heaven were left ajar;
With folded hands and dreamy eyes,
Wandering out of Paradise,
She saw this planet, like a star,
Hung in the glistening depths of even -
Its bridges running to and fro,
O'er which the white-winged angels go,
Bearing the holy dead to heaven.
She touched a bridge of flowers,—those feet,
So light they did not bend the bells
Of the celestial asphodels !
They fell like dew upon the flowers,
Then all the air grew strangely sweet-
And thus came dainty Babie Bell
Into this world of ours.
She came and brought delicious May;
The swallows built beneath the eaves;
Like sunlight in and out the leaves,
The robins went the livelong day;
The lily swung its noiseless bell,
And o'er the porch the trembling vine,
Seemed bursting with its veins of wine.
How sweetly, softly, twilight fell !
Oh, earth was full of singing-birds,
And opening spring-tide flowers,
When the dainty Babie Bell
Came to this world of ours!

O Babie, dainty Babie Bell,
How fair she grew from day to day!
What woman-nature filled her eyes,
What poetry within them lay !
Those deep and tender twilight eyes,
So full of meaning, pure and bright,
As if she yet stood in the light
Of those oped gates of Paradise.
And so we loved her more and more;
Ah, never in our hearts before
Was love so lovely born:
We felt we had a link between
This real world and that unseen-
The land beyond the morn.
And for the love of those dear eyes,
For love of her whom God led forth
(The mother's being ceased on earth
When Babie came from Paradise),-
For love of Him who smote our lives,
And woke the chords of joy and pain,
We said, Dear Christ-our hearts bent down
Like violets after rain.
And now the orchards, which were white,
And red with blossoms when she came,
Were rich in autumn's mellow prime.
The clustered apples burnt like flame,
The soft-cheeked peaches blushed and fell,
The ivory chestnut burst its shell,
The grapes hung purpling in the grange ;
And time wrought just as rich a change
In little Babie Bell.
Her lissome form more perfect grew,
And in her features we could trace,
In softened curves, her mother's face!
Her angel-nature ripened too.
We thought her lovely when she came,
But she was holy, saintly now :-
Around her pale, angelic brow
We saw a slender ring of flame.
God's hand had taken away the seal
that held the portals of her speech;

And oft she said a few strange words
Whose meaning lay beyond our reach.
She never was a child to us,
We never held her being's key,
We could not teach her holy things;
She was Christ's self in purity.

It came upon us by degrees :
We saw its shadow ere it fell,
The knowledge that our God had sent
His messenger for Babie Bell;
We shuddered with unlanguaged pain,
And all our hopes were changed to fears,
And all our thoughts ran into tears
Like sunshine into rain.
We cried aloud in our belief,
“Oh, smite us gently, gently, God!
Teach us to bend and kiss the rod,
And perfect grow through grief.”
Ah, how we loved her, God can tell;
Her heart was folded deep in ours.
Our hearts are broken, Babie Bell!
At last he came, the messenger,
The messenger from unseen lands:
And what did dainty Babie Bell?
She only crossed her little hands,
She only looked more meek and fair!
We parted back her silken hair,
We wove the roses round her brow,-
White buds, the summer's drifted snow,-
Wrapt her from head to foot in flowers;
And then went dainty Babie Bell
Out of this world of ours !

To yield to that foe meant worse than death,
And the men and we all worked on;
It was one day more of smoke and roar,
And then it would all be done.
There was one of us, a corporal's wife,
A fair young gentle thing,
Wasted with fever in the siege,
And her mind was wandering.
She lay on the ground, in her Scottish plaid,
And I took her head on my knee;
“When my father comes hame frae the pleugh,” she said,
“Oh! please then waken me.”
She slept like a child on her father's floor,
In the flecking of woodbine shade,
When the house dog sprawls by the half-open door,
And the mother's wheel is stayed.
It was smoke and roar and powder stench,
And hopeless waiting for death;
But the soldier's wife, like a full tired child,
Seemed scarce to draw her breath.
I sank to sleep, and I had my dream
Of an English village lane
And wall and garden-till a sudden scream
Brought me back to the rear again.
There Jessie Brown stood listening,
And then a broad gladness broke
All over her face, and she took my hand,
And drew me near and spoke:
"The Highlanders! O dinna ye hear
The slogan far awa?
The McGregor's? Ah! I ken it weel ;
It is the grandest of them a'.
“God bless the bonny Highlanders;
We're saved! we're saved!” she cried ;
And fell on her knees, and thanks to God
Poured forth, like a full flood tide.

Along the battery line her cry
Had fallen among the men;
And they started; for they were there to die,-
Was life so near them then?
They listened, for life, and the rattling fire
Far off, and the far off roar
Were all,-and the colonel shook his head,
And they turned to their guns once more.
Then Jessie said, “The slogan's dune,
But can ye no hear them, noo?
The Campbells are comin! It's nae a dream,
Our succors hae broken through !”
We heard the roar and the rattle afar,
But the pipers we could not hear;
So the men plied their work of hopeless war,
And knew that the end was near.
It was not long ere it must be heard,
A shrilling, ceaseless sound;
It was no noise of the strife afar,
Or the sappers under ground.
It was the pipe of the Highlanders,
And now they played “Auld Lang Syne;"
It came to our men like the voice of God;
And they shouted along the line.
And they wept and shook each other's hands,
And the women sobbed in a crowd ;
And every one knelt down where we stood,
And we all thanked God aloud.
That happy day, when we welcomed them in,
Our men put Jessie first;
And the General took her hand; and cheers
From the men like a volley burst.
And the pipers' ribbons and tartan streamed,
Marching round and round our line;
And our joyful cheers were broken with tears,
As the pipers played “Auld Lang Syne.”

AN ORDER FOR A PICTURE.-Alice Cary.

GOOD painter, tell me true,
Has your hand the cunning to draw
Shapes of things that you never saw ?
Ay? Well, here is an order for you.
Woods and cornfields, a little brown,-
The picture must not be over-bright,
Yet all in the golden and gracious light
Of a cloud, when the summer sun is down.
Alway and alway, night and morn,
Woods upon woods, with fields of corn
Lying between them, not quite sere,
And not in the full, thick, leafy bloom,
When the wind can hardly find breathing-room
Under their tassels ;-cattle near,
Biting shorter the short, green grass ;
And a hedge of sumach and sassafras,
With bluebirds twittering all around,
(Ah, good painter, you can't paint sound!)
These, and the house where I was born,
Low and little, and black and old,
With children, many as it can hold,
All at the windows, open wide, -
Heads and shoulders clear outside,
And fair young faces all ablush:
Perhaps you may have seen, some day,
Roses crowding the self-same way,
Out of a wilding, wayside bush.
Listen closer. When you have done
With woods and cornfields and grazing herds,
A lady, the loveliest ever the sun
Looked down upon, you must paint for me;
Oh, if I only could make you see
The clear blue eyes, the tender smile,
The sovereign sweetness, the gentle grace,
The woman's soul, and the angel’s face,
That are beaming on me all the while,
I need not speak these foolish words:
Yet one word tells you all I would say, —

She is my mother: you will agree
That all the rest may be thrown away.
Two little urchins at her knee
You must paint, sir; one like me,
The other with a clearer brow,
And the light of his adventurous eyes
Flashing with boldest enterprise:
At ten years old he went to sea,--
God knoweth if he be living now;
He sailed in the good ship“ Commodore,”-
Nobody ever crossed her track
To bring us news, and she never came back.
Ah, 't is twenty long years and more
Since that old ship went out of the bay
With my great-hearted brother on her deck:
I watched him till he shrank to a speck,
And his face was toward me all the way.
Bright his hair was, a golden brown,
The time we stood at our mother's knee:
That beauteous head, if it did go down,
Carried sunshine into the sea!
Out in the fields, one summer night,
We were together, half afraid
Of the corn-leaves' rustling, and of the shade
Of the high hills, stretching so still and far,-
Loitering till after the low little light
Of the candle shone through the open door,
And over the haystack's pointed top,
All of a tremble, and ready to drop.
The first half-hour, the great yellow star,
That we, with staring, ignorant eyes,
Had often and often watched to see
Propped and held in its place in the skies
By the fork of a tall red mulberry tree,
Which close in the edge of our flax-field grew,-
Dead at the top,--just one branch full
Of leaves, notched round, and lined with wool,
From which it tenderly shook the dew
Over our heads, when we came to play
In its handbreadth of shadow, day after day.
Afraid to go home, sir; for one of us bore

A nest full of speckled and thin-shelled eggs;
The other, a bird, held fast by the legs,
Not so big as a straw of wheat:
The berries we gave her she would n't eat,
But cried and cried, till we held her bill,
So slim and shining, to keep her still.
At last we stood at our mother's knee.
Do you think, sir, if you try,
You can paint the look of a lie ?
If you can, pray have the grace
To put it solely in the face
Of the urchin that is likest me:
I think ’t was solely mine, indeed :
But that's no matter ;-paint it so:
The eyes of our mother-take good heed-
Looking not on the nestful of eggs,
Nor the fluttering bird, held so fast by the legs,
But straight through our faces down to our lies,
And, oh, with such injured, reproachful surprise!
I felt my heart bleed where that glance went, as though
A sharp blade struck through it. You, sir, know
That you on the canvas are to repeat
Things that are fairest, things most sweet, -
Woods and cornfields and mulberry tree;
The mother; the lads, with their bird, at her knee:
But, oh, that look of reproachful woe!
High as the heavens your name I'll shout,
If you paint me the picture, and leave that out.

Lady Clara Vere de Vere,
I know you proud to bear your name;
Your pride is yet no mate for mine,
Too proud to care from whence I came.
Nor would I break for your sweet sake
A heart that dotes on truer charms;
A simple maiden in her flower
Is worth a hundred coats-of-arms.
Lady Clara Vere de Vere,
Some meeker pupil you must find,
For were you queen of all that is,
I could not stoop to such a mind.
You sought to prove how I could love,
And my disdain is my reply.
The lion on your old stone gates
Is not more cold to you than I.
Lady Clara Vere de Vere,
You put strange memories in my head.
Not thrice your branching limes have blown
Since I beheld young Laurence dead.
Oh, your sweet eyes, your low replies :
A great enchantress you may be:
But there was that across his throat
Which you had hardly cared to see.
Lady Clara Vere de Vere,
When thus he met his mother's view,
She had the passions of her kind,
She spake some certain truths of you.
Indeed, I heard one bitter word
That scarce is fit for you to hear;
Her manners had not that repose
Which stamps the caste of Vere de Vere.
Lady Clara Vere de Vere,
There stands a spectre in your hall:
The guilt of blood is at your door:
You changed a wholesome heart to gall.
You held your course without remorse,
To make him trust his modest worth,
And, last, you fixed a vacant stare,
And slew him with your noble birth.

Smile at the claims of long descent.
Howe'er it be, it seems to me,

Kind hearts are more than coronets,
And simple faith than Norman blood.

You pine among your halls and towers:
The languid light of your proud eyes

In glowing health, with boundless wealth,
But sickening of a vague disease,
You know so ill to deal with time,
You needs must play such pranks as these.

If time be heavy on your hands,
Are there no beggars at your gate,
Nor any poor about your lands?

Or teach the orphan-girl to sew,
Pray Heaven for a human heart,
And let the foolish yeoman go.

An' when I seed them grin,
I “bid farewell to every fear,"
And boldly waded in.

An' tried with all my might;
But though my voice is good an’ strong

When they was high, then I was low,
An' also contra’wise;
And I too fast, or they too slow,

And laid it on the seat,
And then a pensive sigh he drew,
And looked completely beat.
An' when they took another bout,
He did n't even rise,
But drawed his red bandanner out,

PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.—Longfellow.
ISTEN, my children, and you shall hear
Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five:
Hardly a man is now alive
Who remembers that famous day and year.
He said to his friend—“If the British march
By land or sea from the town to-night,
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch
Of the North Church tower, as a signal-light-
One if by land, and two if by sea;
And I on the opposite shore will be,
Ready to ride and spread the alarm
Through every Middlesex village and farm,
For the country-folk to be up and to arm.”
Then he said good-night, and with muffled oar
Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,
Just as the moon rose over the bay,
Where swinging wide at her moorings lay
The Somerset, British man-of-war:
A phantom ship, with each mast and spar
Across the moon like a prison bar,
And a huge, black hulk, that was magnified
By its own reflection in the tide.
Meanwhile his friend, through alley and street,
Wanders and watches with eager ears,
Till in the silence around him he hears
The muster of men at the barrack-door,
The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,
And the measured tread of the grenadiers
Marching down to their boats on the shore.
Then he climbed the tower of the old North Church,
Up the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,

To the belfry-chamber overhead,
And startled the pigeons from their perch
On the sombre rafters, that round him made
Masses and moving shapes of shade-
By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,
To the highest window in the wall,
Where he paused to listen and look down
A moment on the roofs of the quiet town,
And the moonlight flowing over all.
Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead
In their night-encampment on the hill,
Wrapped in silence so deep and still,
That he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,
The watchful night-wind, as it went
Creeping along from tent to tent,
And seeming to whisper, “All is well!”
A moment only he feels the spell
Of the place and the hour, the secret dread
Of the lonely belfry and the dead;
For suddenly all his thoughts are bent
On a shadowy something far away,
Where the river widens to meet the bay-
A line of black, that bends and floats
On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.
Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,
Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride,
On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.
Now he patted his horse's side,
Now gazed on the landscape far and near,
Then impetuous stamped the earth,
And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;
But mostly he watched with eager search
The belfry-tower of the old North Church,
As it rose above the graves on the hill,
Lonely, and spectral, and sombre, and still.
And lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height
A glimmer, and then a gleam of light !
He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,
But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight
A second lamp in the belfry burns !

A hurry of hoofs in the village street,
A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,
And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark
Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet:
That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,
The fate of a nation was riding that night;
And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,
Kindled the land into flame with its heat.
It was twelve by the village clock,
When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.
He heard the crowing of the cock,
And the barking of the farmer's dog,
And felt the damp of the river-fog,
That rises after the sun goes down.
It was one by the village clock,
When he galloped into Lexington.
He saw the gilded weathercock
Swim in the moonlight as he passed,
And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,
Gaze at him with a spectral glare,
As if they already stood aghast
At the bloody work they would look upon.
It was two by the village clock,
When he came to the bridge in Concord town.
He heard the bleating of the flock,
And the twitter of birds among the trees,
And felt the breath of the morning breeze
Blowing over the meadows brown.
And one was safe and asleep in his bed
Who at the bridge would be first to fall,
Who that day would be lying dead,
Pierced by a British musket-ball.
You know the rest. In the books you have read
How the British regulars fired and fled-
How the farmers gave them ball for ball,
From behind each fence and farm-yard wall,
Chasing the red-coats down the lane,
Then crossing the fields to emerge again

Under the trees at the turn of the road,
And only pausing to fire and load.
So through the night rode Paul Rerere;
And so through the night went his cry of alarm
To every Middlesex village and farm-
A cry of defiance, and not of fear-
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
And a word that shall echo for evermore!
For, borne on the night-wind of the Past,
Through all our history, to the last,
In the hour of darkness, and peril, and need,
The people will waken and listen to hear
The hurrying hoof-beats of that steed,
And the midnight message of Paul Rerere.
THE OLD POLITICIAN.- Robert Buchanan.

TOW that Tom Dunstan's cold,
Our shop is duller;
Scarce a story is told!
And our chat has lost the old
Red republican color!
Though he was sickly and thin,
He gladdened us with his face ;-
How, warming at rich man's sin,
With bang of the fist, and chin
Thrust out, he argued the case!
He prophesied folk should be free,
And the money-bags be bled ;-
“She's coming, she's coming!” said he;
Courage, boys! wait and see!
Freedom's ahead!”

And there Tom said his say,
And prophesied Tyranny's death;
And the tallow burnt all day,
And we stitched and stitched away.
In the thick smoke of our breath,
Wearily, wearily,
With hearts as heavy as lead ;-
But “Patience, she's coming!” said he;
“Courage, boys! wait and see!
Freedom's ahead!”

And at night, when we took here
The pause allowed to us,
The paper came with the beer,
And Tom read, sharp and clear,
The news out loud to us;
And then, in his witty way,
He threw the jest about, –
Th3 cutting things he'd say
Of the wealthy and gay!
How he turned them inside out!
And it made our breath more free
To hearken to what he said ;-
“She's coming, she's coming!” says he;
“Courage, boys! wait and see !
Freedom 's ahead!”
But grim Jack Hart, with a sneer,
Would mutter, “Master!
If Freedom means to appear,
I think she might step here
A little faster!”
Then it was fine to see Tom flame,
And argue and prove and preach,
Till Jack was silent for shame,
Or a fit of coughing came
O'sudden to spoil Tom's speech.
Ah! Tom had the eyes to see,
When Tyranny should be sped ;
She's coming, she's coming!” said he;
“Courage, boys! wait and see!
Freedom 's ahead!"

But Tom was little and weak;
The hard hours shook him;
Hollower grew his cheek,
And when he began to speak
The coughing took him.
Erelong the cheery sound
Of his chat among us ceased,
And we made a purse all round,
That he might not starve, at least;
His pain was sorry to see,
Yet there, on his poor sick-bed,
She's coming, in spite of me!
Courage, and wait !” cried he,
“ Freedom 's ahead!”
A little before he died,
To see his passion!
“ Bring me a paper!” he cried,
And then to study it tried
In his old sharp fashion;
And, with eyeballs glittering,
His look on me he bent,
And said that savage thing,
Of the lords of the Parliament.
Then, darkening, smiling on me,
"What matter if one be dead ?
She's coming, at least !” said he;
“Courage, boys! wait and see!

PYRAMUS AND THISBE.-John G. Saxe.
THIS
THIS tragical tale, which, they say, is a true one,
Is old, but the manner is wholly a new one.
One Ovid, a writer of some reputation,
Has told it before in a tedious narration ;
In a style, to be sure, of remarkable fulness,
But which nobody reads on account of its dulness.
Young Peter Pyramus—I call him Peter,
Not for the sake of the rhyme or metre,
But merely to make the name completer-
For Peter lived in the olden times,
And in one of the worst of Pagan climes
That flourish now in classical fame,
Long before
Either noble or boor
Had such a thing as a Christian name-
Young Peter then was a nice young beau
As any young lady would wish to know;
I
ween,
He was rather green,
That is to say, he was just eighteen,-
A trifle too short, and a shaving too lean,
In years,

But "a nice young man ” as ever was seen,

And fit to dance with a May-day queen!
Now Peter loved a beautiful girl
As ever insnared the heart of an earl,
In the magical trap of an auburn curl,-
A little Miss Thisbe who lived next door,
(They slept in fact on the very same floor,
With a wall between them, and nothing more,–
Those double dwellings were common of yore,)
And they loved each other, the legends say,
In that very beautiful, bountiful way,
That every young maid,
And every young blade,
Are wont to do before they grow staid,
And learn to love by the laws of trade.
But alack-a-day, for the girl and boy,
A little impediment checked their joy,
And gave them a while the deepest annoy.
For some good reason, which history cloaks,
The match did n't happen to please the old folks!
So Thisbe's father and Peter's mother
Began the young couple to worry and bother,
And tried their innocent passion to smother
By keeping the lovers from seeing each other!
But who ever heard
Of a marriage deterred,
Or even deferred,
By any contrivance so very absurd
As scolding the boy, and caging his bird ?-
Now Peter, who was n't discouraged at all
By obstacles such as the timid appall,
Contrived to discover a hole in the wall,
Which was n't so thick
But removing a brick
Made a passage—though rather provokingly small.
Through this little chink the lover could greet her,
And secrecy made their courting the sweeter,
While Peter kissed Thisbe, and Thisbe kissed Peter,-
For kisses, like folks with diminutive souls,
Will manage to creep through the smallest of holes :

'T was here that the lovers, intent upon love,
Laid a nice little plot
To meet at a spot
Near a mulberry-tree in a neighboring grove;
For the plan was all laid,
By the youth and the maid
(Whose hearts, it would seem, were uncommonly bold ones),
To run off and get married in spite of the old ones.
In the shadows of evening, as still as a mouse,
The beautiful maiden slipt out of the house,
The mulberry-tree impatient to find,
While Peter, the vigilant matrons to blind,
Strolled leisurely out some minutes behind.
While waiting alone by the trysting tree,
A terrible lion,
As e'er you set eye on,
Came roaring along quite horrid to see,
And caused the young maiden in terror to fee
(A lion's a creature whose regular trade is
Blood-and“ a terrible thing among ladies”),
And losing her veil as she ran from the wood,
The monster bedabbled it over with blood.
Now Peter arriving, and seeing the veil,
All covered o'er,
And reeking with gore,
Turned all of a sudden exceedingly pale,
And set himself down to weep and to wail, -
For soon as he saw the garment, poor Peter
Made up his mind in very short meter,
That Thisbe was dead, and the lion had eat her!
So breathing a prayer,
He determined to share
The fate of his darling, “the loved and the lost,"
And fell on his dagger, and gave up the ghost !
Now Thisbe returning, and viewing her beau,
Lying dead by the veil (which she happened to know),
She guessed, in a moment, the cause of his erring,
And seizing the knife
Which had taken his life,
In less than a jiffy was dead as a herring!

MORAL.
Young gentlemen !-pray recollect, if you please,
Not to make assignations near mulberry-trees;
Should your mistress be missing it shows a weak head,
To be stabbing yourself till you know she is dead.
Young ladies!-you should n't go strolling about
When your anxious mammas don't know you are out,
And remember that accidents often befall
From kissing young fellows through holes in the wall!
THE REVOLUTIONARY RISING.–T. B. Read.

UT the the ,
O'Far flashing on its wings of flame,
Swift as the boreal light which dies
At midnight through the startled skies.
And there was tumult in the air,
The fife's shrill note, the drum’s loud beat,
And through the wide land everywhere
The answering tread of hurrying feet;
While the first oath of Freedom's gun
Came on the blast from Lexington;
And Concord roused, no longer tame,
Forgot her old baptismal name,
Made bare her patriot arm of power,
And swelled the discord of the hour.
Within its shade of elm and oak
The church of Berkley Manor stood;
There Sunday found the rural folk,
And some esteemed of gentle blood.
In vain their feet with loitering tread
Passed ’mid the graves where rank is naught;
All could not read the lesson taught
In that republic of the dead.
How sweet the hour of Sabbath talk,
The vale with peace and sunshine full,
Where all the happy people walk,
Decked in their homespun flax and wool,

Where youth's gay hats with blossoms bloom;
And every maid, with simple art,
Wears on her breast, like her own heart,
A bud whose depths are all perfume;
While every garment's gentle stir
Is breathing rose and lavender.
The pastor came; his snowy locks
Hallowed his brow of thought and care;
And calmly, as shepherds lead their focks,
He led into the house of prayer.
Then soon he rose; the prayer was strong;
The psalm was warrior David's song;
The text, a few short words of might:
“The Lord of hosts shall arm the right!”
He spoke of wrongs too long endured,
Of sacred rights to be secured ;
Then from his patriot tongue of flame
The startling words for Freedom came.
The stirring sentences he spake
Compelled the heart to glow or quake,
And, rising on his theme's broad winy,
And grasping in his nervous hand
The imaginary battle-brand,
In face of death he dared to fling
Defiance to a tyrant-king.
Even as he spoke, his frame, renewed
In eloquence of attitude,
Rose, as it seemed, a shoulder higher;
Then swept his kindling glance of fire
From startled pew to breathless choir;
When suddenly his mantle wide
His hands impatient Aung aside,
And, lo! he met their wondering eyes
Complete in all a warrior's guise.
A moment there was awful pause-
When Berkley cried, “ Cease, traitor! cease;
God's temple is the house of peace!”
The other shouted, “Nay, not so,
When God is with our righteous cause;
His holiest places then are ours,

That frown upon the tyrant foe;
In this, the dawn of Freedom's day,
There is a time to fight and pray !”.
And now before the open door-
The warrior priest had ordered so-
The enlisting trumpet's sudden roar
Rang through the chapel, o'er and o'er,
Its long reverberating blow,
So loud and clear, it seemed the ear
Of dusty Death must wake and hear.
And there the startling drum and fife
Fired the living with fiercer life;
While overhead, with wild increase,
Forgetting its ancient toll of peace,
The great bell swung as ne'er before.
It seemed as it would never cease;
And every word its ardor Aung
From off its jubilant iron tongue
Was“ War! war! war!”
“Who dares ”—this was the patriot's cry,
As striding from the desk he came-
“Come out with me, in Freedon's name,
For her to live, for her to die?”
A hundred hands flung up reply,
A hundred voices answered, “I !”
THE RIDE OF JENNIE M'NEAL.— Will Carleton.

Well has his valorous deed been told;

Often it has been dwelt upon;
But why should men do all the deeds
On which the love of a patriot feeds?

On a spot as pretty as might be found

In a cottage, cozy, and all their own,
She and her mother lived alone.
Safe were the two, with their frugal store,
From all the many who passed their door;
For Jennie's mother was strange to fears,
And Jennie was large for fifteen years;
With vim her eyes were glistening,
Her hair was the hue of a blackbird's wing;
And while the friends who knew her well
The sweetness of her heart could tell,
A gun that hung on the kitchen wall
Looked solemnly quick to heed her call;
And they who were evil-minded knew
Her nerve was strong and her aim was true.
So all kind words and acts did deal
To generous, black-eyed Jennie M'Neal.
One night, when the sun had crept to bed,
And rain-clouds lingered overhead,
And sent their surly drops for proof
To drum a tune on the cottage roof,
Close after a knock at the outer door
There entered a dozen dragoons or more.
Their red coats, stained by the muddy road,
That they were British soldiers showed;
The captain his hostess bent to greet,
Saying, “ Madam, please give us a bit to eat;
We will pay you well, and, if may be,
This bright-eyed girl for pouring our tea;
Then we must dash ten miles ahead,
To catch a rebel colonel abed.
He is visiting home, as doth appear;
We will make his pleasure cost him dear.”
And they fell on the hasty supper with zeal,
Close-watched the while by Jennie M'Neal.
For the gray-haired colonel they hovered near,
Had been her true friend, kind and dear;
And oft, in her younger days, had he
Right proudly perched her upon his knee,
And told her stories many a one
Concerning the French war lately done.

And oft together the two friends were,
And many the arts he had taught to her;
She had hunted by his fatherly side,
He had shown her how to fence and ride;
And once had said, “The time may be,
Your skill and courage may stand by me.”
So sorrow for him she could but feel,
Brave, grateful-hearted Jennie M'Neal.
With never a thought or a moment more,
Bare-headed she slipped from the cottage door,
Ran out where the horses were left to feed,
Unhitched and mounted the captain's steed,
And down the hilly and rock-strown way
She urged the fiery horse of gray.
Around her slender and cloakless form
Pattered and moaned the ceaseless storm;
Secure and tight a gloveless hand
Grasped the reins with stern command;
And full and black her long hair streamed,
Whenever the ragged lightning gleamed,
And on she rushed for the colonel's weal,
Brave, lioness-hearted Jennie M'Neal.
Hark! from the hills, a moment mute,
Came a clatter of hoofs in hot pursuit;
And a cry from the foremost oper said,
“Halt! or your blood be on your head!”
She heeded it not, and not in vain
She lashed the horse with the bridle-rein.
So into the night the gray horse strode;
His shoes hewed fire from the rocky road:
And the high-born courage that never dies
Flashed from his rider's coal-black eyes.
The pebbles flew from the fearful race;
The rain-drops grasped at her glowing face.
“On, on, brave beast !” with loud appeal,
Cried eager, resolute Jennie M'Neal.
“Halt!” once more came the voice of dread;
“Halt! or your blood be on your head !”
Then, no one answering to the calls,
Sped after her a volley of balls.

They passed her in her rapid flight,
They screamed to her left, they screamed to her right;
But, rushing still o'er the slippery track,
She sent no token of answer back,
Except a silvery laughter-peal,
Brave, merry-hearted Jennie M'Neal.
So on she rushed, at her own good will,
Through wood and valley, o'er plain and hill;
The gray horse did his duty well,
Till all at once he stumbled and fell,
Himself escaping the nets of harm,
But flinging the girl with a broken arm.
Still undismayed by the numbing pain,
She clung to the horse's bridle-rein,
And gently bidding him to stand,
Petted him with her able hand;
Then sprung again to the saddle-bow,
And shouted, “One more trial now!”
As if ashamed of the heedless fall,
He gathered his strength once more for all,
And, galloping down a hill-side steep,
Gained on the troopers at every leap;
No more the high-bred steed did reel,
But ran his best for Jennie M’Neal.
They were a furlong behind or more,
When the girl burst through the colonel's door,
Her poor arm helpless hanging with pain,
And she all drabbled and drenched with rain,
But her cheeks as red as fire-brands are,
And her eyes as bright as a blazing star,
And shouted, “Quick! be quick, I say !
They come! they come! Away! away!”
Then sunk on the rude white floor of deal,
Poor, brave, exhausted Jennie M’Neal.
The startled colonel sprung, and pressed
The wife and children to his breast,
And turned away from his fireside bright,
And glided into the stormy night;
Then soon and safely made his way
To where the patriot army lay.

But first he bent in the dim fire-light,
And kissed the forehead broad and white,
And blessed the girl who had ridden so well
To keep him out of a prison cell.
The girl roused up at the martial din,
Just as the troopers came rushing in,
And laughed, e'en in the midst of a moan,
Saying, “Good sirs, your bird has flown.
'Tis I who have scared him from his nest;
So deal with me now as you think best.”
But the grand young captain bowed, and said,
“Never you hold a moment's dread.
Of womankind I must crown you queen;
So brave a girl I have never seen.
Wear this gold ring as your valor's due;
And when peace comes I will come for you."
But Jennie's face an arch smile wore,
As she said, “There's a lad in Putnam's corps,
Who told me the same long time ago;
You two would never agree, I know.
I promised my love to be true as steel,”
Said good, sure-hearted Jennie M'Neal.

Cap while the gentlemen give a trifle,
To aid a poor old patriot soldier!
March! Halt! Now show how the rebel shakes,
When he stands up to hear his sentence.
Now tell us how many drams it takes
To honor a jolly new acquaintance.
Five yelps,—that's five; he's mighty knowing!
The night's before us, fill the glasses !
Quick, Sir! I'm ill,—my brain is going !
Some brandy,—thank you,-there!-it passes !
Why not reform ? That's easily said ;
But I've gone through such wretched treatment,

Sometimes forgetting the taste of bread,
And scarce remembering what meat meant,
That my poor stomach's past reform;
And there are times when, mad with thinking,
I'd sell out heaven for something warm
To prop a horrible inward sinking.
Is there a way to forget to think?
At your age, Sir, home, fortune, friends,
A dear girl's love,-but I took to drink;-
The same old story; you know how it ends.
If you could have seen these classic features,-
You need n't laugh, Sir; they were not then
Such a burning libel on God's creatures :
I was one of your handsome men !
>
If you had seen her, so fair and young,
Whose head was happy on this breast !
If you could have heard the songs I sung
When the wine went round, you would n't have guessed
That ever I, Sir, should be straying
From door to door, with fiddle and dog,
Ragged and penniless, and playing
To you to-night for a glass of grog!
She's married since,
,-a parson's wife:
'Twas better for her that we should part,-
Better the soberest, prosiest life
Than a blasted home and a broken heart.
I have seen her? Once: I was weak and spent
On the dusty road, a carriage stopped:
But little she dreamed, as on she went,
Who kissed the coin that her fingers dropped !
You've set me talking, Sir; I'm sorry ;
It makes me wild to think of the change!
What do you care for a beggar's story?
Is it amusing? you find it strange ?
I had a mother so proud of me!
'T was well she died before- Do you know
If the happy spirits in heaven can see
The ruin and wretchedness here below?

Another glass, and strong, to deaden
This pain; then Roger and I will start.
I wonder has he such a lumpish, leaden,
Aching thing, in place of a heart ?
He is sad sometimes, and would weep, if he could,
No doubt, remembering things that were, -
A virtuous kennel, with plenty of food,
And himself a sober, respectable cur.
I'm better now; that glass was warming, –
You rascal! limber your lazy feet !
We must be fiddling and performing
For supper and bed, or starve on the street.
Not a very gay life to lead, you think?
But soon we shall go where lodgings are free,
And the sleepers need neither victuals nor drink;
The sooner, the better for Roger and me!
THE TEAR OF REPENTANCE.— Thomas Moore.
ONE
NE morn a Peri at the gate
Of Eden stood, disconsolate;
And as she listened to the springs
Of life within, like music flowing,
And caught the light upon her wings
Through the half-open portal glowing,
She wept to think her recreant race
Should e'er have lost that glorious place!
“How happy,” exclaimed this child of air,
“Are the holy spirits who wander there,
'Mid flowers that never shall fade or fall!
Though mine are the gardens of earth and sea,
One blossom of heaven outblooms them all!”
The glorious angel who was keeping
The gates of light, beheld her weeping;
And, as he nearer drew and listened,
A tear within his eyelids glistened.-
“Nymph of a fair but erring line!”
Gently he said, “one hope is thine.

'Tis written in the book of fate,
The Peri yet may be forgiven,
Who brings to this eternal gate
The gift that is most dear to Heaven !
Go, seek it, and redeem thy sin;
'Tis sweet to let the pardoned in!”
Rapidly as comets run
To the embraces of the sun,
Down the blue vault the Peri flies,
And, lighted earth ward by a glance
That just then broke from morning's eyes,
Hung hovering o'er our world's expanse.
Over the vale of Baalbec winging,
The Peri sees a child at play,
Among the rosy wild-flowers singing,
As rosy and as wild as they ;
Chasing with eager hands and eyes,
The beautiful blue damsel-flies
That fluttered round the jasmine stems,
Like winged flowers or flying gems:
And near the boy, who, tired with play,
Now nestling 'mid the roses lay,
She saw a wearied man dismount
From his hot steed, and on the brink
Of a small temple's rustic fount
Impatient fling him down to drink.
Then swift his haggard brow he turned
To the fair child, who fearless sat-
Though never yet hath day-beam burned
Upon a brow more fierce than that,
Sullenly fierce-a mixture dire,
Like thunder-clouds of gloom and fire,
In which the Peri's eye could read
Dark tales of many a ruthless deed.
Yet tranquil now that man of crime
(As if the balmy evening time
Softened his spirit) looked and lay,
Watching the rosy infant's play;
Though still, whene'er his eye by chance
Fell on the boy's, its lurid glance

Met that unclouded, joyous gaze,
As torches that have burnt all night
Encounter morning's glorious rays.
But hark! the vesper call to prayer,
As slow the orb of daylight sets,
Is rising sweetly on the air
From Syria's thousand minarets !
The boy has started from the bed
Of flowers, where he had laid his head,
And down upon the fragrant sod
Kneels, with his forehead to the south,
Lisping th' eternal name of God
From purity's own cherub mouth;
And looking, while his hands and eyes
Are lifted to the glowing skies,
Like a stray babe of paradise,
Just lighted on that flowery plain,
And seeking for its home again!
And how felt he, the wretched man
Reclining there—while memory ran
O’er many a year of guilt and strife
That marked the dark flood of his life,
Nor found one sunny resting-place,
Nor brought him back one branch of grace ?
“There was a time,” he said, in mild,
Heart-humbled tones, “thou blessed child !
When young, and haply pure as thou,
I looked and prayed like thee; but now
He hung his head; each nobler aim
And hope and feeling which had slept
From boyhood's hour, that instant came
Fresh o'er him, and he wept-he wept!
And now! behold him kneeling there,
By the child's side in humble prayer,
While the same sunbeam shines upon
The guilty and the guiltless one,
And hymns of joy proclaim through heaven
The triumph of a soul forgiven!
'T was when the golden orb had set,
While on their knees they lingered yet,

There fell a light more lovely far
Than ever came from sun or star-
Upon the tear that, warm and meek,
Dewed that repentant sinner's cheek:
To mortal eye this light might seem
A northern flash or meteor beam;
But well th' enraptured Peri knew
'T was a bright smile the angel threw
From heaven's gate, to hail that tear-
Her harbinger of glory near!
“Joy! joy !” she cried; "my task is done-
The gates are passed, and heaven is won!”

THE RAVEN.—Edgar A. Poe.
ONCE upon a midnight dreary, while I ponderd, weak and
weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore, -
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber-door.
“'Tis some visitor," I mutter'd, “ tapping at my chamber-door-
Only this, and nothing more.”
Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor,
Eagerly I wish'd the morrow: vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow,-sorrow for the lost Lenore,-
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore,–
Nameless here forevermore.
And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain,
Thrilld me-fill’d me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating,
''Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber-door,-
Some late visitor entreating entrance at ту
chamber-door;
That it is, and nothing more.”
Presently my soul grew stronger: hesitating then no longer,
“Sir," said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber-door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I open'd wide the door:
Darkness there, and nothing more.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, wondering,
fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream
before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whisper'd word,
“Lenore!”
This I whisper'd, and an echo murmur'd back the word,“ Lenore !”
Merely this, and nothing more.

Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping, something louder than before.
Surely,” said I,“ surely that is something at my window-lattice,
Let me see then what thereat is, and this mystery explore,-
Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery explore ;-
'Tis the wind, and nothing more.”
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and Autter,
In there stepp'd a stately raven of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopp'd or stay'd
he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perch'd above my chamber-door,-
Perch'd upon a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber-door-
Perched and sat, and nothing more.
66
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “ art sure
no craven;
Ghastly, grim, and ancient raven, wandering from the nightly
shore;
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian shore?”
Quoth the raven, “Nevermore!”
Much I marvell’d this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning-little relevancy bore;
For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Ever yet was bless'd with seeing bird above his chamber-door, -
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber-door,
With such name as “Nevermore!”
C
But the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.

Nothing further then he utter'd, -not a feather then he flutter'd, -
Till I scarcely more than mutter’d, “Other friends have flown be-
fore,-
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown before."
Then the bird said, “Nevermore !”
Startled at the stillness, broken by reply so aptly spoken,
“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store,
Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster
Follow'd fast and follow'd faster, till his songs one burden bore,-
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore,
Of-Never-nevermore !”
But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeld a cushion'd seat in front of bird, and bust, and
door.
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly; gaunt, and ominous bird of
yore
Meant in croaking “Nevermore!”
7
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl, whose fiery eyes now burn’d into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining, with the lamp-light gloating o'er,
She shall press—ah! nevermore!
Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen
censer

Swung by seraphim, whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.

hath sent thee
Respite-respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore !
Quaff, oh, quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore !"
Quoth the raven,
“Nevermore!”

Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest toss'd thee here
ashore,

Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted
On this home by Horror haunted-tell me truly I implore-
Is there-is there balm in Gilead ?-tell me—tell me, I implore?”

“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!-prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore,
Tell this soul, with sorrow laden, if, within the distant Aidenn,
It shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels name Lenore;
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore!"
Quoth the raven, “Nevermore!”
"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shriek'd up-
starting-
“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's Plutonian shore!
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken !-quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my
door!”
Quoth the raven, “Nevermore!”

And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas, just above my chamber-door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the
floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
Shall be lifted-nevermore!

“So I see,” replied Mr. Weller. “Not to any young 'ooman, I

Why, it's no use a sayin' it ain't,” replied Sam. “It's a walen-

“A what?” exclaimed Mr. Weller, apparently horror-stricken

“A walentine," replied Sam.

“Samivel, Samivel,” said Mr. Weller, in reproachful accents, “I

this here wery subject; arter actiwally seein’and bein' in the com-

moral lesson as no man could ever ha' forgotten to his dyin' day !
I did n't think you'd ha' done it, Sammy, I did n't think you'd
ha' done it."
“Wot's the matter now?” said Sam.
“Nev'r mind, Sammy,” replied Mr. Weller, “it'll be a wery
agonizing trial to me at my time o’ life, but I'm pretty tough,
that's vun consolation, as the wery old turkey remarked ven the
farmer said he was afeerd he should be obliged to kill him for the
London market.”
“Wot'll be a trial ? ” inquired Sam.
To see you married, Sammy ; to see you a deluded wictim, and
thinkin' in your innocence that it's all very capital,” replied Mr.
Weller. “It's a dreadful trial to a father's feelin's, that 'ere,
Sammy."
“Nonsense,” said Sam. “I ain't goin' to get married ; don't you
fret yourself about that. I know you ’re a judge o' these things;
order in your pipe, and I'll read you the letter,-there!”
Sam dipped his pen into the ink to be ready for any corrections,
and began with a very theatrical air,-
“ 'Lovely creetur'!'”
“ 'T ain't in poetry, is it?” interposed the father.
“No, no,” replied Sam.
* Wery glad to hear it,” said Mr. Weller. “Poetry's unnat'ral.
No man ever talked in poetry 'cept a beadle on boxin' day, or
Warren's blacking, or Rowland's oil, or some o' them low fellows.
Never let yourself down to talk poetry, my boy. Begin again,
Sammy."
“'Lovely creetur', i feel myself a dammed—”
“That ain't proper,” said Mr. Weller, taking his pipe from his
mouth.
“No, it ain't 'dammed,'” observed Sam, holding the letter up
to the light, “it's 'shamed,' there's a blot there; 'i feel myself
ashamed.'”
“Wery good,” said Mr. Weller. “Go on.”
“* Feel myself ashamed and completely cir—' I forgot wot this

attempts to remember.

“Why don't you look at it, then?" inquired Mr. Weller.
“So I am a lookin' at it,” replied Sam, “but there's another
blot: here's a'c,' and a ‘i,' and a 'd.'”
“Circumwented, p’rhaps,” suggested Mr. Weller.
No, it ain't that,” said Sam : “ circumscribed,' that's it.”
“That ain't as good a word as circumwented, Sammy,” said Mr.
Weller, gravely.
“Think not?” said Sam.
“Nothin' like it,” replied his father.
“But don't you think it means more?” inquired Sam.
Vell, p'rhaps it's a more tenderer word,” said Mr. Weller, after
a few moments' reflection. “Go on, Sammy.”
Feel myself ashamed and completely circumscribed in a dress-
in' of you, for you are a nice girl, and nothin' but it.'"
“That's a wery pretty sentiment,” said the elder Mr. Weller,
removing his pipe to make way for the remark.
“Yes, think it's rayther good,” observed Sam, highly flattered.
“Wot I like in that 'ere style of writin',” said the elder Mr.
Weller, “is, that there ain't no callin' names in it, -no Wenuses,
nor nothin' o'that kind; wot's the good o' callin' a young 'ooman
a Wenus or a angel, Sammy?”
“Ah! what indeed ?” replied Sam.
“You might just as well call her a griffin, or a unicorn, or a
king's arms at once, which is wery well known to be a col-lection
o' fabulous animals,” added Mr. Weller.
“Just as well,” replied Sam.
“Drive on, Sam,” said Mr. Weller,
Sam complied with the request, and proceeded as follows: his
father continuing to smoke with a mixed expression of wisdom
and complacency.
" • Afore i see you i thought all women was alike.""
“So they are,” observed the elder Mr. Weller, emphatically.
"But now,'” continued Sam, “now i find what a reg'lar soft-
headed, ink-red’lous turnip i must ha' been, for there ain't nobody
like you, though i like you better than nothin' at all. I thought
it best to make that rayther strong,” said Sam, looking up.
Mr. Weller nodded approvingly, and Sam resumed.

“I am afeerd that werges on the poetical, Sammy,” said Mr.
Weller, dubiously.
No, it don't,” replied Sam, reading on very quickly to avoid
contesting the point.
“ 'Except of me, Mary, my dear, as your walentine, and think
over what I've said. My dear Mary I will now conclude.' That's
all,” said Sam.
“ That’s rayther a sudden pull up, ain't it, Sammy?" inquired
Mr. Weller,
“Not a bit on it,” said Sam; "she 'll vish there wos more, and

“Won't do,” said Sam. “Never sign a walentine with your own

The werry thing,” said Sam, “I could end with a werse: what
do you think?"
“I don't like it, Sam,” rejoined Mr. Weller. “I never know'd
a respectable coachman as wrote poetry; 'cept one as made an
affectin' copy of werses the night afore he was hung for a highway
robbery, and he was only a Cambervell, so even that's no rule.”
But Sam was not to be dissuaded from the poetical idea that had
occurred to him, so he signed the letter,-

THE WONDERFUL “ONE-HOSS SHAY.”_0. W. Holmes.

It ran a hundred years to a day
And then, of a sudden, it—Ah, but stay,

I'll tell you what happened, without delay-
Scaring the parson into fits,
Frightening people out of their wits-
Have you ever heard of that, I say?
Seventeen hundred and fifty-five,
Georgius Secundus was then alive-
Snuffy old drone from the German hive.
That was the year when Lisbon town
Saw the earth open and gulp her down,
And Braddock's army was done so brown,
Left without a scalp to its crown.
It was on the terrible Earthquake-day
That the Deacon finished the one-hoss shay.
Now, in building of chaises, I tell you what,
There is always, somewhere, a weakest spot-
In hub, tire, felloe, in spring or thill,
In panel or crossbar, or floor or sill,
In screw, bolt, thoroughbrace-lurking still,
Find it somewhere you must and will —
Above or below, or within or without-
And that's the reason, beyond a doubt,
A chaise breaks down, but does n't wear out.
But the Deacon swore (as Deacons do,
With an “I dew yum” or an “I tell yeou”)-
He would build one shay to beat the taown
'N' the keounty 'n' all the kentry raoun';
It should be so built that it could n't break daown:-
“Fur,” said the Deacon, “it's mighty plain
Thut the weakes place mus' stan’ the strain,
'N' the way tfix it, uz I maintain,
Is only jest
To make that place uz strong uz the rest.”
>
So the Deacon inquired of the village folk
Where he could find the strongest oak,
That could n't be split, nor bent, nor broke-
That was for spokes, and floor, and sills;
He sent for lancewood, to make the thills;
The crossbars were ash, from the straightest trees;
The panels of white-wood, that cuts like cheese,

But lasts like iron for things like these;
The hubs from logs from the “Settler's ellum”—
Last of its timber—they could n't sell 'em-
Never an axe had seen their chips,
And the wedges flew from between their lips,
Their blunt ends frizzled like celery-tips;
Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw,
Spring, tire, axle, and linchpin too,
Steel of the finest, bright and blue;
Thoroughbrace bison-skin, thick and wide;
Boot, top, dasher, from tough old hide,
Found in the pit where the tanner died.
That was the way he “put her through.”
“There !” said the Deacon, “naow she'll dew!”
Do! I tell you, I rather guess
She was a wonder, and nothing less !
Colts grew horses, beards turned gray,
Deacon and deaconess dropped away,
Children and grandchildren—where were they?
But there stood the stout old one-hoss shay,
As fresh as on Lisbon Earthquake-day!
Eighteen hundred-it came, and found
The Deacon's masterpiece strong and sound.
Eighteen hundred increased by ten-
“Hahnsum kerridge” they called it then.
Eighteen hundred and twenty came-
Running as usual-much the same.
Thirty and forty at last arrive;
And then came fifty-and fifty-five.
Little of all we value here
Wakes on the morn of its hundredth year
Without both feeling and looking queer.
In fact, there's nothing that keeps its youth,
So far as I know, but a tree and truth.
(This is a moral that runs at large:
Take it.—You 're welcome.—No extra charge.)
First of November-the Earthquake-day.
There are traces of age in the one-hoss shay,

A general flavor of mild decay-
But nothing local, as one may say.
There could n't be for the Deacon's art
Had made it so like in every part
That there was n't a chance for one to start.
For the wheels were just as strong as the thills,
And the floor was just as strong as the sills,
And the panels just as strong as the floor,
And the whipple-tree neither less nor more,
And the back crossbar as strong as the fore,
And spring, and axle, and hub encore.
And yet, as a whole, it is past a doubt
In another hour it will be worn out!
First of November, 'Fifty-five!
This morning the parson takes a drive.
Now, small boys, get out of the way!
Here comes the wonderful one-hoss shay,
Drawn by a rat-tailed, ewe-necked bay.
“Huddup!” said the parson.-Off went they.
The parson was working his Sunday text-
Had got to fifthly, and stopped perplexed
At what the-Moses-was coming next.
All at once the horse stood still,
Close by the meet'n'-house on the hill.
-First a shiver, and then a thrill,
Then something decidedly like a spill-
And the parson was sitting upon a rock,
At half-past nine by the meet'n'-house clock-
Just the hour of the Earthquake-shock!
What do you think the parson found,
When he got up and stared around?
The poor old chaise in a heap or mound,
As if it had been to the mill and ground!
You see, of course, if you're not a dunce,
How it went to pieces all at once-
All at once, and nothing first-
Just as bubbles do when they burst.
End of the wonderful one-hoss shay.
Logic is Logic. That's all I say.

THE KEEPING OF THE BRIDGE.—T. B. Macaulay.
OUT spake the Consul roundly :
“The bridge must straight go down;
For since Janiculum is lost,
Naught else can save the town.”
Then out spake brave Horatius,
The captain of the gate:
“To every man upon this earth
Death cometh soon or late.
And how can man die better
Than facing fearful odds,
For the ashes of his fathers,
And the temples of his gods?
“Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul,
With all the speed you may ;
I, with two more to help me,
Will hold the foe in play.
In yon straight path a thousand
May well be stopped by three.
Now, who will stand on either hand,
And keep the bridge with me?”
Then out spake Spurius Lartius,-
A Ramnian proud was he:
“Lo, I will stand on thy right hand,
And keep the bridge with thee.”
And out spake strong Herminius,-
Of Titian blood was he:
“I will abide on thy left side,
And keep the bridge with thee.”
“Horatius,” quoth the Consul,
As thou say'st, so let it be.”
And straight against that great array
Forth went the dauntless three.
For Romans, in Rome's quarrel,
Spared neither land nor gold,
Nor son nor wife, nor limb nor life,
In the brave days of old.
The three stood calm and silent,
And looked upon the foes,

And a great shout of laughter
From all the vanguard rose.
But soon Etruria's noblest
Felt their hearts sink to see
On the earth the bloody corpses,
In the path the dauntless three!
Meanwhile the axe and lever
Have manfully been plied,
And now the bridge hangs tottering
Above the boiling tide.
“Come back, come back, Horatius!”
Loud cried the Fathers all;
Back, Lartius! back, Herminius!
Back, ere the ruin fall!”
1
Back darted Spurius Lartius;
Herminius darted back;
And, as they passed, beneath their feet
They felt the timbers crack.
But when they turned their faces,
And on the farther shore
Saw brave Horatius stand alone,
They would have crossed once more.
But, with a crash like thunder,
Fell every loosened beam,
And, like a dam, the mighty wreck
Lay right athwart the stream;
And a long shout of triumph
Rose from the walls of Rome,
As to the highest turret-tops
Was splashed the yellow foam.
And, like a horse unbroken,
When first he feels the rein,
The furious river struggled hard,
And tossed his tawny mane,
And burst the curb, and bounded,
Rejoicing to be free,
And battlement, and plank, and pier,
Whirled headlong to the sea.

Alone stood brave Horatius,
But constant still in mind;
Thrice thirty thousand foes before,
And the broad flood behind.
“Down with him!” cried false Sextus,
With a smile on his pale face.
“Now yield thee!” cried Lars Porsena,
“Now yield thee to our grace.”
Round turned he, as not deigning
Those craven ranks to see;
Naught spake he to Lars Porsena,
To Sextus naught spake he;
But he saw on Palatinus
The white porch of his home;
And he spake to the noble river
That rolls by the towers of Rome:
“O Tiber! Father Tiber!
To whom the Romans pray!
A Roman's life, a Roman's arms,
Take thou in charge this day!”
So he spake, and, speaking, sheathed
The good sword by his side,
And, with his harness on his back,
Plunged headlong in the tide.
No sound of joy or sorrow
Was heard from either bank;
But friends and foes, in dumb surprise,
With parted lips and straining eyes,
Stood gazing where he sank;
And when above the surges
They saw his crest appear,
All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,
And even the ranks of Tuscany
Could scarce forbear to cheer.
“Out on him!” quoth false Sextus;
“Will not the villain drown?
But for this stay, ere close of day
We should have sacked the town!”

“Heaven help him!” quoth Lars Porsena,
And bring him safe to shore;
For such a gallant feat of arms
Was never seen before.”
But fiercely ran the current,
Swollen high by months of rain;
And fast his blood was flowing;
And he was sore in pain,
And heavy with his armor,
And spent with changing blows:
And oft they thought him sinking,
But still again he rose.
And now the ground he touches,
Now on dry earth he stands;
Now round him throng the Fathers,
To press his gory hands;
And now, with shouts and clapping,
And noise of weeping loud,
He enters through the River-Gate,
Borne by the joyous crowd.
HOW HE SAVED ST. MICHAEL'S.-M. A. P. Stansbury.
SA , of
you beg for a story, my darling, my brown-eyed Leopold,
gold;
Then come, if you will, and listen-stand close beside my knee-
To a tale of the Southern city, proud Charleston by the sea.
On the roofs and the glittering turrets, that night, as the sun went
down,
The mellow glow of the twilight shone like a jewelled crown;
And, bathed in the living glory, as the people lifted their eyes,
They saw the pride of the city, the spire of St. Michael's, rise
:
High over the lesser steeples, tipped with a golden ball,
That hung like a radiant planet caught in its earthward fall:
First glimpse of home to the sailor who made the harbor-round,
And last slow-fading vision dear to the outward bound.

The gently gathering shadows shut out the waning light;
The children prayed at their bedsides, as you will pray to-night;
The noise of buyer and seller from the busy mart was gone;
And in dreams of a peaceful morrow the city slumbered on.
But another light than sunrise aroused the sleeping street;
For a cry was heard at midnight, and the rush of trampling feet;
Men stared in each other's faces through mingled fire and smoke,
While the frantic bells went clashing, clamorous stroke on stroke.
By the glare of her blazing roof-tree the houseless mother fled,
With the babe she pressed to her bosom shrieking in nameless
dread;
While the fire-king's wild battalions scaled wall and capstone
high,
And planted their flaring banners against an inky sky.
From the death that raged behind them, and the crash of ruin
loud,
To the great square of the city, were driven the surging crowd;
Where yet, firm in all the tumult, unscathed by the fiery flood,
With its heavenward-pointing finger, the Church of St. Michael's
stood.
But e'en as they gazed upon it there rose a sudden wail, -
A cry of horror, blended with the roaring of the gale,
On whose scorching wings up-driven, a single flaming brand
Aloft on the towering steeple clung like a bloody hand.
“Will it fade?” The whisper trembled from a thousand whiten-
ing lips;
Far out on the lurid harbor, they watched it from the ships,
A baleful gleam that brighter and ever brighter shone,
Like a flickering, trembling will-o'-wisp to a steady beacon grown.
a
“Uncounted gold shall be given to the man whose brave right
hand,
For the love of the perilled city, plucks down yon burning
brand!”
So cried the mayor of Charleston, that all the people heard ;
But they looked each one at his fellow, and no man spoke a word.
Who is it leans from the belfry, with face upturned to the sky,
Clings to a column, and measures the dizzy spire with his eye?

Will he dare it, the hero undaunted, that terrible sickening height?
Or will the hot blood of his courage freeze in his veins at the
sight?
But see! he has stepped on the railing; he climbs with his feet
and his hands,
And firm on a narrow projection, with the belfry beneath him,
he stands;
Now once, and once only, they cheer him,-a single, tempestuous
breath,-
And there falls on the multitude gazing a hush like the stillness
of death.
Slow, steadily mounting, unheeding aught save the goal of the
fire,
Still higher and higher, an atom, he moves on the face of the
spire.
He stops! Will he fall? Lol for answer, a gleam like a meteor's
track,
And, hurled on the stones of the pavement, the red brand lies
shattered and black.
a
Once more the shouts of the people have rent the quivering air:
At the church-door mayor and council wait with their feet on the
stair;
And the eager throng behind them press for a touch of his hand,
The unknown savior, whose daring could compass a deed so grand.
But why does a sudden tremor seize on them while they gaze ?
And what meaneth that stifled murmur of wonder and amaze?
He stood in the gate of the temple he had perilled his life to
save;
And the face of the hero, my children, was the sable face of a
slave!
With folded arms he was speaking, in tones that were clear, not
loud,
And his eyes, ablaze in their sockets, burnt into the eyes of the
crowd :-
“You may keep your gold: I scorn it! — but answer me, ye who
can,
If the deed I have done before you be not the deed of a man?”

He stepped but a short space backward; and from all the women
and men
There were only sobs for answer; and the mayor called for a pen,
And the great seal of the city, that he might read who ran:
And the slave who saved St. Michael's went out from its door, a
man.

A
SERIES OF TEXT-BOOKS
ON THE
ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
By JOHN S. HART, LL.D.,
Late Professor of Rhetoric and of the English Language in the
College of New Jersey.
6
The Series comprises the following volumes, vixho
Language Lessons for Beginners,
Elementary English Grammar,
English Grammar and Analysis,
First Lessons in Composition,
Composition and Rhetoric,
Hart's Composition and Rhetoric is more generally in
use throughout the country than any other work on the subject.
Prof. Moses Coit Tyler says of it:
“In the transition from grammar to what may be called the
mechanics of literary workmanship, we are obliged to insist upon
a particular text-book-Hart's 'Composition and Rhetoric'-
simply because that book is the only one as yet in the market
which deals so fully and so well with the topics which we desire
to emphasize."
Its Practical Character is one of its most valuable feat-
Rhetoric is an art as well as a science, and no text-book
for the class-room is of much value which is not well furnished
with “Examples for Practice.” In this respect, this book is far
ahead of any other work of the kind.
Its Adaptability to all grades of schools is another feature
of value. It is equally in place in the graded school, the acad-
emy, the female seminary, and in the higher institutions of
learning.
The Thousands of Schools of every grade, in all sections
of the country, in which this book is being used, not only with
satisfaction, but with enthusiasm, testify to its merit. Unless
peculiarly meritorious, no book could possibly attain the wide-
spread popularity which has been accorded to this manual.
