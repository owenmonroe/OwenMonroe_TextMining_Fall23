PREFACE.
I N issuing a new edition of this book I am hope-
1 ful that it may meet with the same measure
of success which was accorded the first edition when
it was placed before the public in 1897. The Press
unanimously adopted the tone of Sir Sidney, indeed,
which was nothing but “Praise ! Praise ! Praise !”
from almost every quarter of the globe. Com-
munications reflecting credit on my efforts to make
the art of elocution more evident to the ordinary
reader were received by me from all parts of the
kingdom; and, acting on several kindly suggestions,
I have tried to embody the principles of the art
with several short studies of recitals, set out in such
method that the merest tyro may, with study and
practice, grasp the essentials of the art of reciting.
As “Brevity is the soul of wit,” I come to that
point which should form the primary subject in the
education of a dramatic student-namely, elocution.
To many persons it is a dead art. Some fail to see
the practical good which results from its study;
while others are impressed with the idea that it is
too difficult to learn ; and thus, by the ineptitude

Its being
of the illogical, remain ignorant and prejudiced as to
its qualities.
For the information of those who have given a
passing thought to this art I have, in this Preface,
endeavoured to unveil a few of the subtleties which
lie hidden within it; and have attempted to show
the value of its being added to other subjects of
education. The Greeks and Romans attached such
vast importance to its value as an accomplishment
that they organised schools of instruction for the
purpose of systematically teaching it. Its import-
ance is now becoming so recognised that men
advanced in years undertake lessons for the purpose
of enabling them the more effectively to carry out
their duties in public or private life. As regards its
value as an educational influence, it is only necessary
to say that elocution is a mind-directed art. It opens
out to the mind the beauties of language; it compels
the student to think out for himself the meanings
of master minds; it teaches discrimination in what
to retain and what to reject; it imbues the mind
with a poetic influence; and what more, education-
ally, could be wished for than these powerful mental
exercises ?
In Parliament, the Church, the Bar, the Stage,
and even at the street corner, we see the necessity
of its cultivation. “The importance of elocution-
presupposes the importance of other things,” and
for men who are morally and intellectually qualified
to act as preachers, the importance of an effective

PREFACE.
delivery–which is the outcome of a knowledge of
elocution—can scarcely be overrated.
The late Professor Plumptre once remarked to
me some years ago while I was studying this art,
that if there were some ethereal way of communi-
cating with the mind, if the process of preaching
were designed to be mesmeric, and people were to
be put in a trance for a short space of time, instead
of being aroused, in order to instruct and impress
them, then might we dispense with elocution.
The rules of elocution are designed to correct the
bad habits of speech, gesture, and deportment; and
to make the voice, the countenance, and body well-
attuned instruments to respond actively to a mind
full of noble thoughts and powerful emotions. So
far I have endeavoured to place this subject in the
light of a high and pure pleasure, which should be
cultivated for the sake of the gratification which it
gives to others, and as an addition to our intellectual
attainments.
I cannot conclude without adverting to it in
another aspect. The constant practice of the vocal
organs cannot be pursued without the whole system
gaining in health. Sir Henry Holland states in a
work of his that more might be done in practice
towards the prevention of pulmonary disease, as
well as for the general improvement of health, by
expressly exercising the organs of respiration. “If
some small part of the time given to crowding facts
on the mind not yet prepared to receive or retain

them were employed in fashioning and improving
the organs of speech under good tuition, and with
suitable subjects for recitation, both mind and body
would often gain materially by the substitution.
We are told that the purport of elocution is to
“ hold the mirror up to nature," and that naturalness
is the touchstone of the actor's art and the keystone
of elocutionary power. Thus we easily understand
the power of the public performer whose every word
uttered has been so weighed and considered, and
delivered with such an appearance of nature, that
the hearer for the time being loses sight of the
individuality of the performer and seems to see the
character in actual form.
And now let me appeal to the reader who has not
yet included this art in his list of studies to do so
at once, for by its inclusion it will add to his intel-
lectual equipment.
My sincerest thanks are hereby tendered to Sir
A. Conan Doyle, Messrs. W. S. Gilbert, Rudyard
Kipling, Clement Scott, Dan Leno, Bart Kennedy,
S. J. Adair-Fitzgerald, and Mrs. Albert S. Bradshaw,
and other popular authors whose works are included
in my selections, for their kindness in allowing me
to use their several contributions.

INTRODUCTION.
L OW to say a thing—what may one say of
11 that? Speaking as an actor ; as one who lives,
to some extent, by his ability to say good things
well, I am naturally somewhat cautious before utter-
ing upon the matter. The old retort, always un-
answerable, always apt, of “ Physician, heal thyself,"
hovers round the effort. It is difficult enough to
speak other men's words, to express the thoughts of
other minds, but to discuss how it is done !
Still, no one who has suffered the anxiety of
attempting to realise some inaudible actor's inten-
tion will ever hesitate to assert that elocution is
one of the prime necessities of the stage. To fulfil
the meaning of the writer-how necessary to that is
the clear repetition of the author's language!
The first call on a public speaker is that he
should be audible; the second that he should be
intelligible; and elocution makes for this compound
righteousness. Even as musicians drag the absorb-
ing melody from the dead strings, so may a man
wrest the deep meaning out of the written matter ;
infusing into it, maybe, (as the musician into his

theme) something additional, graceful, from out of
his own personality. From which arises the interest
in “different readings,” “fresh impersonations,” and
the interpretative medium for these is elocution.
To the right understanding, then, of artistic effort,
elocution is thus seen to be an important necessary.
By its aid the prophet can stand in the valley and
call the dead bones to life. In it are sealed the
glamour and the spell of persuasion. But of one
thing we must beware. Elocution is a means no
end. It is a mechanism, not a vitality; a device for
interpreting, not a living interpreter. We must not
rest content in it. We must use it, admire it, delight
in it, perfect ourselves in it. But we must still
remember it is but a tool ready for the skilful
workman; and that speaker who fancies he has
mastered oratory when he has but mastered elocution
is in a parlous state truly. Substance is greater
than form, though form is needful, desirable; and
elocution serves the needs of form-not of substance.
Herein lies its danger. An unscrupulous orator
can often persuade to the untrue by reason of the
true man's halting diction. This is the very "bluff”
of oratory. We must be careful not to infect our-
selves with it.
But given elocution and the intention of sober
use, and you have a most likely orator. And the
glory of elocution rightly used is that it satisfies
him speaking, and pleasures him hearing ; that it
renders inspiration vocal, and opens the gate to the

poet's ecstasy; that by it man can confer with men,
and persuade them to his mind. The commonplace
may climb to pleasantness; the pleasant to inspira-
tion; the inspired to divinity by so free a way as
this. It is a way for the whole world. With
emphasis I would say to all that wish to excel in
any art where public utterance prevails, whatever
you have to say, say it at its very best! And the
art of thus saying things at their best, in their fullest
meaning, and most musical expression, is elocution
in the true sense of the word. And to one and all I
say, “ Be distinct! be distinct !! be distinct !!!”
One of our most celebrated dramatic critics recently
told me that he is a constant frequenter of the pit,
and that he has invariably been struck by the fact
that those playgoers who most do congregate in that
part of the theatre hear as a rule but a limited
number of the words spoken on the stage. This he
takes to be the reason why a drama of action rather
than of dialogue stands a better chance of success
with a large public. In justice to your author, to
your audience, to yourself—be distinct ! be distinct !!
be distinct !!!
To be distinct is the golden rule of expression,
and this can only come by observation. Practice,
perfect, observe the rules. Suit them to your gifts !
it is no dreary task. The glory of future interpreta-
tion will inspire you, and the delight of discovered
meanings. Learn to say good things well, and you
shall receive the attention of men! In the following

pages will be found Mr. Ross Ferguson's advice to
all who would so excel. I can only say that if his
sensible and clearly prescribed rules were practised
by the students of that art which I am proud to be
a learner in, half the disheartening work of stage
management would vanish for ever. One cannot do
better than follow him.

THE ART OF ELOCUTION
AND PUBLIC SPEAKING.
CHAPTER I.
PREFATORY.
W H EN the initiated reflect how much the Art
VV of Elocution has advanced in interest during
recent years, and how the study of it is being en-
couraged and cultivated, I hope I shall not appear
unduly assertive in insisting upon its importance and
utility. Composition speaks to the fancy; elocution
paints to the senses; consequently the representation
is more palpable. Music addresses the ear; so does
elocution, but the latter possesses sounds adapted
for convincing as well as for pleasing and emotional
effects; for the convincing tone of argument bears
down all hesitation, and compels assent. Painting
fascinates the eye with all that is graceful, majestic,
and expressive in feature and pose; but elocution
combines with these the variety and energy of life.
I do not wish to infer that elocution is superior in

dignity and purpose to these arts, for they possess
potent causes of exciting pleasure and imagination ;
but it possesses many of their properties in common,
and others in an almost superior degree, and so
should command further recognition and cultivation.
All men are not born orators, and he who would
shine forth in the land of “speech-making,” should
make it his study to become proficient in the art of
elocution. Demosthenes steadfastly devoted him.
self to the requirements of the art of speaking, so
that he might become an accomplished and powerful
speaker. We have it handed down from his time,
that he declaimed regularly on the seashore with
pebbles in his mouth, to correct an impediment and
to improve his articulation. He practised attitude
and gesture before a mirror; he trusted to Art as
recognised in those days, and was justly rewarded
by the most perfect success ever attained by a
disciple of oratory.
Shakespeare as an authority on the power of
elocution, and a keen observer of its advantages,
must be held in high estimation ; for what stronger
proof of his practical knowledge of the art do we
require than the instructions that he makes Hamlet
give to the players : "Speak the speech, I pray you,
trippingly on the tongue." His short career as an
actor had evidently opened his eyes to its true value.
“The voice of song is not sweeter than the voice of
eloquence,” and a correct and graceful mode of
speaking is so beneficial that no effort should be

spared to add it to other accomplishments. To
acquire a proper knowledge of this art, the student
must be prepared to go through a regular course of
study and exercises ; commencing with such as are
very easy, and proceeding by slow steps to such
as are more difficult. In the meantime attention
should be paid to prevailing defects, before any
attempt is made at anything of a high-class nature,
This, doubtless, will be disagreeable, and require
much patience, but it must be borne in mind that it
is only perseverance that will land the student at
the goal of success. It would be useless, in fact,
ridiculous, to attempt the reciting of sublime poetry
while there exists incompetency to do justice to
simple narrative.
To speak or recite effectively demands certain
qualifications, viz.: –
The mind must be cultivated to understand.
The feelings regulated to give expression.
The voice trained to give forth musical tones.
The style to be completely natural.
“ Elocution is a science as well as an art. As a
science it resolves speech into its elementary con-
stituents and examines the qualities of sound. As an
art it constitutes a knowledge as to the best modes
of appealing to the understanding and moving the
feelings of an audience." Books of taste will supply
food for reflection ; and reflection will enable you to
have a sequence of thoughts. Composition is the

means of enabling you to put those thoughts into
words; and elocution is the art of expressing those
words with power and expression. Many persons
make an effort to excuse themselves when asked to
read aloud a selection of prose or poetry. They are
sensible of their inability to read with sense and
judgment. They may be possessed of greater or
lesser capabilities, but they lack this one effective
accomplishment. It is no small wonder that the
ordinary individual fails for the want of knowing
how, while our ministers generally ignore the study of
elocution, thus causing no surprise at the number of
listeners who fall into the arms of Morpheus while the
preacher occupies the pulpit. The reader must have
noticed the difference between a good elocutionist
and the member of the Church. The voice of an
accomplished elocutionist is modulated according to
the sense of his subject, consequently all the musical
tones of his cultivated voice are called into play ;
while the other continues the dreary chant so peculiar
to his order. It is here necessary to advise the in-
tending student on one point for the express purpose
of preventing any dismal failure on his part. Re-
citing or speaking in public should not be under-
taken until the various branches of elocution have
been thoroughly mastered. The student must de-
bate within himself whether he is competent to
speak without ridicule being heaped on his head, or
whether he is endowed with the necessary ability
to successfully delineate the several characters and

emotions of his selections. If a satisfactory con-
clusion has been arrived at in the affirmative, then
settle down and commence to master, by memorising,
the words of the subject decided upon for public
effort. It must be read aloud in the student's own
sanctum so as to familiarise one's own voice; it must
be studied intently to obtain a good idea of the
sense; to picture vividly its dramatic or humorous
"points"; the several emotions; the words to be
selected for emphasis ; the parts for gesture; and a
general study of the whole matter to enable it to be
rendered in a graceful and natural manner.


## p. 20 (#26) ##############################################

CHAPTER II.
THE VOICE.
I HAVE thought it discreet to tersely place before
I my readers a few practical descriptions of the
various organs of respiration, voice, and speech. It
is compulsory to know something of the instrument
that we use so much, and know so little about.
The lungs are the reservoirs of inspired air. They
consist of five spongy elastic lobes, three on the right
side, and two on the left. The air is conveyed into
them from the windpipe by means of the bronchial
tubes, and thence carried by smaller ramifications,
disposed on all sides like the branches of trees, into
minute vesicles. In the respiration of speech, the
lungs must be inflated to a far greater extent than
that necessary for the purposes of existence. Ex-
pansion of the lungs chiefly depends on the action
of the thorax and the diaphragm. All action with
the lungs should proceed principally from the action
of the thorax, the diaphragm, and the abdominal
muscles.
The thorax, or sides of the breast, distend and
contract with the lungs. In respiration the lungs
are wholly passive; their size increasing in exact
proportion with the expansion of the chest.
20


## p. 21 (#27) ##############################################

THE VOICE.
21
The diaphragm is a large muscular substance
which forms the floor of the breast, and separates
it from the abdomen. In inspiration the diaphragm
descends, and so enlarges the capacity of the chest ;
in expiration it ascends, and, pressing on the lungs,
expels the inspired air.
The larynx arises from the windpipe and contains
the material organs of sound. In the male sex it is
generally prominent exteriorly, and commonly called
“Adam's apple.” It consists of five elastic cartilages,
the uppermost of which is termed the epiglottis.
The office of the epiglottis is to direct the expired
sound, and to open and shut like a valve the aperture
of the exterior glottis. This is the sonorous opening
between two cartilages of the larynx, and situated
above the vocal chords. It is provided with muscles
which enlarge or contract at pleasure. The glottis is
the organ of all vocal sound, and it should never be
strained ; like the lungs, it should be kept wholly
passive, especially when depth of tone is required.
The pharynx is a large dilatable bag situated be-
hind the palate, terminated in front by the mouth,
and above by the nasal passages. By distension and
contraction it is an agent of the sonorous and ex-
plosive sounds heard in the letters b, d, v, and c.
The nares, or nasal passages, are tubes which
conduct from the pharynx to the nostrils. They are.
closed by the soft palate, and only opened for the
articulations of m, n, ng, and French nasal sounds.
A voice of good quality and power is only obtained

22
by constant practice, and by attention being paid to-
intonation. Very few of our actors and speakers
possess voices of natural musical power; but those
who pay studious care to this defective department,
produce effects equal to those more naturally gifted.
For improving the sweetness and strengthening the
tones, begin with a moderate degree of loudness-
sufficient to fill a small-sized room—and gradually
increase in volume until the full extent of the power
of the voice is reached. When it is found that an
unpleasant feeling seizes the throat or chest, cease
increasing the power and dwell on the tone that is
most agreeable. Always bear in mind to begin
gently, so as to prepare the voice for the greater
effort. An idea of the acoustic properties of the
room or hall in which the practice takes place should
be gained, so that the ear can be trained quickly to
catch the returning sound. Some buildings are
more echoing than others, and in such the reciter or
speaker should make frequent and short pauses, and
should be very distinct in his utterance.
There are two kinds of voice used by actors and
elocutionists, and which are called the Oratund and
the Aspirated. The former is used for the expression
of sublime, grand, and deeply pathetic language;
while the other gives intensity to certain kinds of
passionate expression, such as surprise, wonder, hate,
horror, and scorn.
The low tones should be constantly exercised so
as to improve their sweetness and strength. This is

23
- to be acquired by reading or reciting passages of an
appropriate nature in a low, well-modulated, yet
strong key. Care should be taken that the glottis is
'not unduly exerted. The effort required in powerful
delivery should be thrown on the muscles of the
diaphragm, and not on the tender organs of the
throat. That well-known affection “Clergyman's
sore throat,” emanates from undue exertion of the
vocal chords; and it is well to bear in mind that
complete rest should be undertaken while the throat
is the least sore. Abstention from cold drinks is
necessary after the voice has been exerted : and on
leaving a warm room a silk muffler should be placed
well at the back of the neck to preserve that part
froin the cold. The mouth should be kept closed,
and the air allowed to pass through the nasal
passages to prevent the cold air reaching the larynx.
The nasal passages should be kept clear, as they
add greatly to the purity of tone. Should they
happen to be dry and sore, the application of cold
cream or vaseline will be found to be very beneficial.
By inhaling and exhaling the air at regular intervals,
or by taking advantage of what are termed rhetorical
pauses—used for dramatic effect—the wretched habits
of gasping and puffing will be avoided.
Vocal gymnastics should be cultivated for the
purpose of developing the flexibility of the muscles
which are employed in the production of the voice.
The muscles of the chest may be exercised in a
number of ways by the use of dumb-bells, movement

of the arms backward and forward, and rowing.
During practice and actual performance, the student
should maintain an erect and easy position with the
shoulders well thrown back.
VOICE AND EMOTION.
There are no means so powerful as the human
voice for arousing emotion. It has a magnetic power
over an audience, but that power will not be felt
unless it is tinged with true emotion. A reciter must
feel before he can succeed in gaining the sympathy
of his listeners. Though gesture may be the correct
expression of a feeling not actually felt, yet it will
not hold a large number of persons spell-bound, as
will the voice. Austin says "... emotion is the
very breath and life-blood of thought; it is dead
without it. The art of a fine actor culminates, not
in the rounded period, nor even in the loud roar and
violent gesture of excited passion, but in the breath-
less silence of intense feeling, as he stands apart and
allows the impotency of exhausted symbols—the
quivering lips and glazed eye-to express for him the
crisis of inarticulate emotion.”
The student should take examples from his own
life: the varied passions that he may have witnessed
and felt during his career, and so bring to bear. on
his efforts emotions stamped with the truth of life..
But they must be held well in check so that they do
not run away and compel him to forget his artistic

instinct and so overstep the bounds of nature. If
the student understands and feels, and, for the time
being, lives in every situation of the subject, he
cannot fail to impress his hearers : for there is a
subtle connection between the voice and the mind.
Emotional tones arise from the soul, and those who
possess soul and cultivate the tones will find a quick
and ready entry into the hearts, and an impulsive
appreciation at the hands, of an impressed audience.
“Nature's true knowledge is the only art,
The strong-felt passion bolts into his face ;
The mind untouched, what is it but grimace?
To this one standard make your just appeal,
There lies the golden secret-learn to feel.”

CHAPTER III.
ARTICULATION AND PRONUNCIATION.
ARTICULATION is the act of forming with
n the organs of speech the elements of vocal
language. It is defective when one or more elements
of a word are imperfectly formed. The aim of the
student should be to attain a perfectly correct enun-
ciation, which is the utterance and combination of
the elements of speech, and the pronunciation of
syllables and words. It is here shown that enuncia-
tion combines articulation and pronunciation. A
standard dictionary should be obtained which records
the correct pronunciation of each word; and much
will be gained by listening to those who represent
that cultivated class whose example sets the fashion
in speech to the rest of the world. Pedantry, or
affectation, should be avoided by not too closely
observing the rules of etymology and analogy.
Attention must be directed to the vowels, which
should be pronounced fully and clearly. A vowel
sound is produced in the larynx, and is emitted
through the mouth without coming in contact with
any of the articulative organs.

EXERCISES ON THE VOWELS.
31
A very common error in regard to the vowels is
not only frequent among the uneducated, but also
exists among those who should know better. They
continue to carelessly distort and corrupt some of
the most musical sounds in the English language.
Instances are many, but the few following selections
will suffice to put the student on his guard :-
headid instead of headed.
ketch instead of catch.
sich instead of such.
Even many public speakers fall into the careless
habit of omitting the aspirate, not only at the
commencement of a word where it is employed,
but in single and compound words as when, what,
whom, who, bareheaded, behold, behave, etc. With
few exceptions the letter h is always aspirated. To
enable readers to thoroughly understand the definition
of an aspirate, the following is appended for their
instruction. Hold the back of the hand before and
about three or four inches from the mouth, and re-
peat words such as those previously mentioned. If
successful the breath will be felt against the hand,
but not if the aspirate is omitted. The aspirate is a
light expulsion of breath and should not be too
vehement.
The article the is slurred when it precedes an
aspirate or consonant; but retains its full sound
before a vowel or non-aspirate. Those who feel

conscious of error in regard to this misplaced letter,
and who desire information of the exact pronuncia-
tion of the article, will do well to learn by heart the
following exercises :-
The hour, thě hind, thě house.
Thě horse, the inn, the honourable.
The art, thể heart, thể happiest.
The home, the honest, thể hindmost.
Up a high hill he heaved a heavy stone.
Handsome Harry of Highgate Hill.
Honest Henry Hamilton.
Behold thě horse's horny hoof.
Eating haricot beans.
He studied high art.
Another fault prominent among persons of affecta-
tion is the adoption of the sound of w in place of
the trilled consonant r. Very is by them pro-
nounced vewy; rather, wather; ring, wing; and
many other words are made to suffer through their
senseless vanity. The letter r is an articulative
sound of which there are two kinds. The first is
called the trilled, and is formed by the tip of the
tongue vibrating against the gums of the upper
teeth, while, at the same time, there is a very slight
expulsion of breath. The second is called the un-
trilled, or smooth r, and is formed with the tongue
turned towards the roof of the mouth.
When preceding a vowel the letter should be
trilled, as in roll, rush, rash, brush, crush; but when

33
it follows a vowel, as in air, fair, orb, urn, it should
be smooth.
Still more errors are observable in the conversation
of certain persons in the form of almost entire
omission of the dental consonant t in words ending
with ts. Example—insists is pronounced insis', con-
sists, consis', etc. The way to eradicate this evil, if
it exists in the habits of the student, is to pronounce
at first the words consist, insist, without the sibilant
(s), and then in the completed words adding it
quickly without a too hissing sound.
Another mistake requiring attention is the omission
of the sound of g in the words coming, going, doing,
pleading, causing them to be sounded as comin',
goin', doin', pleadin', and nothing as nothink. The
student should, while giving the vowel its full sound,
take care to give to the consonants a clear and sharp
pronunciation. It is the consonant sounds which
are mainly subservient to articulation; hence the
necessity to exercise the repetition of such sounds,
especially those that are found to be difficult to the
articulative organs. The sound of the consonant is
modified by the position of the tongue, palate, lips,
and teeth; and by the degree in which the air is
permitted to pass between them or through the nasal
passages in the act of articulation. It should be
thoroughly understood that distinctness of articula-
tion depends considerably upon the manner in which
the consonants are rendered. The element of
audibility is the pure, well-sustained vowel ; the

THE ART OF ELOCUTION.
element of distinctness is the firm, clearly articulated
consonant; and in reciting both elements should be
combined.
Where a word ends, and the next begins with the
same or allied consonant, a difficulty or carelessness
of utterance arises which can be remedied by the
student dwelling not too long on the final consonant,
and instantly giving a sharp, clear sound to the other
which begins the next word. The following exercises
are illustrations of the allied and coalescent sounds :
“A great terror often exists."
“(A great error often exists.)”
“A languid dame."
“(A languid aim.)”
“ He built him an ice house."
“(He built him a nice house.)”
"He could pain nobody.”
“(He could pay nobody.)”


## p. 35 (#41) ##############################################

CHAPTER V.
MODULATION.
THIS is one of the most important branches of
elocution. Nothing gives greater pleasure to
an audience than a well-regulated and expressive
modulation. It means the transition from one key
to another. This change is sometimes made to an
immediate key; and at other times an abrupt transi-
tion to a distant key is necessary to produce the
desired effect. It is generally attended with a change
of force or time, according to the emotions inspired
by the subject. It teaches the proper adaptation of
the tones of the voice to the character of the matter
delivered; and its office is to mark changes of senti-
ment, train of thought, and parenthetical clauses;
every change being accompanied by changes of tone
and time.
Nature has adapted a peculiar tone to every
passion and feeling that we at different times ex-
press; and the student to be successful in expressing
these feelings will have to devote considerable study
and practice towards that end, so that the voice will
readily accommodate itself to the sentiment desired.
35


## p. 36 (#42) ##############################################

36
THE ART OF ELOCUTION.
The speaking voice is capable of assuming three
keys, viz. :-the low, the high, and the middle.
THE LOW TONE
falls below the usual speaking key, and is used in
expressing fear, caution, sorrow, sadness, secrecy,
dejection, despair, and solemnity.
THE MIDDLE TONE
is that used in ordinary conversation and common
discourse, narrative, and reflection.
THE HIGH TONE
rises above the usual speaking voice, and expresses
rage, triumph, and other strong emotions.
In conjunction with modulation, and the three
kinds of voice described, are three inflections; the
rising, the falling, and the compound. The rising
inflection is generally used at that part of a sentence
which is intended to convey to the listener the know-
ledge that the sense is incomplete. The falling in-
flection shows that the sense is completed. The
compound or circumflexion is a combination of the
rising and falling inflections, and is used in expres-
sions of irony, contempt, reproach, sneering, and
marked antithesis.
EXERCISES ON THE INFLECTIONS.
· The rising inflections ('), are followed by the
falling (').

“Does he deserve famé or blame ?”
“Did he act properly or improperly ?"
“Should we say yes or nò ?"
“ Does he mean gesturé or jestèr?”.
“Does he read distinctly or indistinctly?”
The falling inflections followed by the rising :-
“He deserves blamè, not famé.”
“He acted properlý, not improperly.”
“We should say yès, not nó.".
“He means gesturè, not jestér.”
“He reads distinctly, not indistinctly.”

“I couldn't treat a dog ill.”
“Hath a dog money ? is it possible a cur can lend
three thousand ducats ?”
“They tell us to be moderate, but they, they are
to wallow in profusion.”
“Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud.”
The voice must not be allowed to fall at the end
of every line unless the sense of the sentence is
completed; neither allow it to rise to too high a
pitch when it ends with a note of interrogation.
Care should be taken to avoid the sing-song style
of repeating rhyme, and the jerky, broken form of
utterance.
"'Tis not enough the voice be sound and clear,
'Tis modulation that must charm the ear." .


## p. 38 (#44) ##############################################

CHAPTER VI.
TIME.
THIS is an element of importance in modulation,
1 and is also closely connected with expression,
as the rapidity or slowness of delivery must be in
accordance with the nature of the feeling expressed.
Rate of movement should be such as the sentiment
demands. It may be considered under three heads;
quick, moderate, and slow. Quick rate is used to
express joy, raillery, mirth, violent anger, and excited
conditions generally.
Moderate rate concerns narrative, description,
argument, and unimpassioned speech.
Slow rate expresses awe, dignity, deliberation,
grief, and solemn discourse.
A slow delivery—not according to personal de-
fects, but to elocutionary requirements—adds weight
to language, and affords great assistance to the voice
by the rests, or pauses, which it enables it to make.
It must not be too slow, or it will become wearisome
to the listener; neither must it be too quick, or
the audience will have but a confused idea of the
subject.


## p. 39 (#45) ##############################################

TIME.
• THE PAUSE.
No precise rules can be laid down for the manage-
ment of the pause in elocution. Its chief use is to
assist the student in ascertaining the grammatical
construction of a sentence; and the use of it depends
on the nature of the subject, and the judgment of
the reciter. A particular pause is required after, and
before, any word which it is intended to render
peculiarly emphatic. This is called the emphatic
pause, as, “O Death !—where is thy sting? O Grave
—where is thy victory?" Its common use is to allow
the reciter time to take breath, as well as to relieve
his auditors from a continuity of sound.
The grammatical pauses are those used in com-
position, such as the comma, semi-colon, colon, and
the period. The rule recommended by various
teachers to pupils to mentally count “one, two,
three and four,” to these respective marks of punc-
tuation, I do not entirely accord with ; for the reason
that a learner will cultivate a style of mechanical
counting, and forget altogether the natural demands
of his essays. The divisions of time are judged by
the various degrees of feeling; and the use of the
rhetorical pause must be left to the artistic percep-
tion of the elocutionist.


## p. 40 (#46) ##############################################

CHAPTER VII.
EMPHASIS.
D MPHASIS is that stress of the voice laid on a
L certain word or words to which a particular
meaning is attached. In animated conversation, a
speaker rarely fails to give the correct emphasis.
The reason for this correct emphasis being given by
a person who may be ignorant of the rules of elocu-
tion, is that he is imbued with the life of thought
and self-understanding, and feels the depth of his
subject.
The student should sacredly study the author's
meaning and endeavour to speak the language as if
it were his own. But he must be cautioned against
a too frequent use of emphasis, as its object is to
draw attention to some particular point of the
subject, by selecting the words which convey the
idea of the writer. The advice given to me some
years ago by the late Professor Plumptre, of King's
College, was to the effect that nouns and verbs
should be emphasised, and that adverbs should be
slurred.
There are two kinds of emphasis; emphasis of
sense, and emphasis of force. The first is that
40


## p. 41 (#47) ##############################################

EMPHASIS.
41
which indicates the meaning of the sentence, and
being transferred from word to word, has power to
change and vary the particular sense, thus :-
“Did you walk home to-day?".
"Did you walk home to-day?”
“Did you walk home to-day?”
“Did you walk home to-day?”.
Emphasis of force is used to add force to a
particular idea or expression; not because the sense
or meaning intended is necessary, but because the
force of one's own feeling dictates it.
Examples :-
“ Could you be so cruel? I am surprised !"
“Could you be so cruel? So very cruel.”
ACCENT.
This is a stress of voice laid on a syllable, or
syllables, of a word to distinguish it from the rest.
The only sure guide to it is reference to a good
dictionary.
Words varied by accent :
“Desert us not in the désert.”
“My increase serves but to increase your wealth.”
“ Did you abstract from my desk the abstract of
the speech I made ?"
The accent is sometimes carried from one syllable
to another to mark a contrast of meaning :-“For
this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this
mortal must put on immortality.”


## p. 42 (#48) ##############################################

42
THE ART OF ELOCUTION.
There is an accent which principally relates to the
reading of verse, and is called the accent of rhythm,
often observable in orations; particularly those of
Demosthenes and Cicero. It is laid upon mono-
syllables to assist in forming the rhythm of a sentence,
and is allied to emphasis in so far as it shifts in
accordance with the assumed importance of words;
but has no further relation. Primary and secondary
accents should be used with judgment, and particular
care taken to place the stress of voice on the chief
syllable.
PARENTHESIS.
This is an interruption of the sense of the main
sentence, and has its commencement and continu-
ance indicated by a change to a somewhat lower
tone of voice, and a quicker movement; and the
close of it is marked by a return to the same pitch
which immediately preceded the parenthesis.
Example—“Gentlemen, if I make out this case by
evidence-and if I do not forget everything you
have heard, and reproach me for daring to abuse
your honest feelings—I shall have established a claim
for damages that has no parallel.”—ERSKINE.


## p. 43 (#49) ##############################################

CHAPTER VIII.
GESTURE.
M O one will deny that graceful and appropriate
IV gesture on the part of the elocutionist adds to
the force of his delivery. It cannot be taught by
written instructions, so it will be advisable for the
student to obtain a few lessons from an experienced
instructor ; as by the personal attention bestowed
upon him he will gain more ease, grace, and force,
than he ever would by anything that was written
for his guidance. The following hints will not be
worthless if students will only study and practise
them with the smallest degree of intelligence.
The body should be kept erect, and the right foot
be in advance of the left, with the toes turned a
little outward, while the body should be sustained
by the left foot, or vice versa. The attitude of the
elocutionist should not be like that of the affected
dancing-master, which is adapted to springing agility
and conceited display. The sustaining foot should
be planted firmly; the leg braced, but not con-
tracted, and the knee straightened, while the other
foot and limb should press lightly and be relaxed-
43


## p. 44 (#50) ##############################################

44
THE ART OF ELOCUTION.
except in very energetic delivery, where both limbs
should be braced.
The trunk of the body should be well balanced,
and sustained erect upon the supporting limb, except
in such instances as require its inclination, as vene-
ration, supplication, etc.
The changes of the position of the feet should be
made with the utmost simplicity; while the head
should be held in an erect position, and its move-
ments directed by the character of the delivery.
The arm, the forearm, the hand and the fingers,
form-as Cicero calls it—"the weapon of the orator."
The centre of motion of this compound instrument
is the shoulder. The least motion is that made by
the upper part of the arm; and the greatest, that
made by the hand; consequently the gestures of the
latter are most effective. The stroke of the hand is
analogous to the emphasis of the voice; and they
should both fall at the same time on the accented
syllable of the emphatic word.
- In the simple and narrative parts of a subject,
there is little effort or variety of expression in the
voice. Under the same circumstances gesture should
be quiet and simple; but in the more impassioned
parts, both should be equally exerted.
Gesture in many instances imitates the inflections
of the voice. When it rises, the gesture naturally
ascends; and when the voice makes the falling
inflection, or lowers its pitch, the gesture follows it
by a corresponding descent.


## p. 45 (#51) ##############################################

GESTURE.
45
But after all, personal instruction and observation
are the best guides; and if the student possesses
sufficient intelligence, and is actuated by the feelings
of his conception, he will very rarely err.


## p. 46 (#52) ##############################################

CHAPTER IX.
THE COUNTENANCE.
THE importance of facial expression must not
T be overlooked. It tells the emotions of the
mind and what the speaker feels; and should he
betray no feeling in his face, it is evident there is
none in his heart. It is impossible to lay down rules
as to how one should look to represent every senti-
ment; and it must be left to the pupil who possesses
sensitiveness in respect to dramatic effect to instruct
himself. The following definitions of the passions
may probably assist those who care to study them.
THE PASSIONS.
Fear causes the body to shrink back, the eyes to
open to their full extent, the breathing shortens, the
mouth half opens, the face becomes pale, the limbs
tremble, the voice spasmodically affected, and the į
hands, with fingers slightly bent, brought almost
level with the shoulders.
Anger is a passion excited by injury committed
either on ourselves or others, with a desire to
retaliate. The limbs quiver, the eyebrows are knit,
the eyes flash with light, the nostrils are distended,
46


## p. 47 (#53) ##############################################

THE COUNTENANCE.
47
the breathing slightly labours, while the hands are
clenched and held almost to the waist.
Revenge finds utterance in loud and quick tones
when violent, but in low and slow tones when it is
deliberate. It causes the eye to flash, and the body
to slightly lean forward, while the breast heaves, and
the hands are clenched.
Pity is a compound of love and grief, and the
emotions are expressed in slow and plaintive utter-
ances.
Grief is distress of mind, caused by misfortune,
injury, loss, or other cause of suffering. When
carried to excess it is expressed in loud tones, while
the features are at times distorted.
Joy shows itself by rising a degree above cheerful-
ness—the quick-glancing eye, the glowing smile, the
energy of gesture, all show its characteristics.
Courage is marked by a loud and lively utterance,
the tone is clear and unhesitating, the countenance
bright and fearless, the head held erect, and the hand
raised as if in defiance of threatening danger.
Jealousy clouds its forehead, and the eyes gleam
with a fierce light from beneath the knit brows, while
the nostrils distend, and the corners of the mouth
are drawn down.
Remorse requires a low pitch of voice and subdued
utterance; in its outward expression the face wears
a look of dejection, and the voice is mingled with
sighs.
Scorn finds expression in loud and slow tones; the

THE ART OF ELOCUTION.
words on which emphasis is laid being drawn out as
if the tongue were loth to part with them.
The knowledge and accomplishment of the fore-
going are left to the student's study and practice.
“A single look more marks the eternal woe,
Than all the windings of the lengthened oh!
Up to the face the quick sensation flies,
And darts its meaning from the speaking eyes.
Love, transport, madness, anger, scorn, despair,
All the passions, all the soul is there.”
All the intelligence of the student must be called
into play while studying, and during the rendering
of a piece. The feeling, or that which is felt, must
be resolved into ideas, thoughts, and images. The
greater the intelligence employed in thinking out the
various parts, so much the greater chance of success
is there when those matured ideas are communicated
to an audience.
Let the student imbue himself with an earnest
resolve to think and to do; for earnestness is most
essential in the character of a reciter.


## p. 49 (#55) ##############################################

CHAPTER X.
PUBLIC SPEAKING.
THE power of the public speaker is indisputable.
T The truth of this is verified almost hourly—at
the street corner, on the common, in the park, and
in the Houses of Parliament, the subtle magnetism
of the man of eloquence is readily felt by attentive
listeners and enthusiastic applauders. The power of
engaging attention and creating enthusiasm lies in
the logical display of the technicalities of rhetoric.
The gifted speaker naturally effects his aim by his
inward knowledge and the use of it; and by repeated
exploits in the arena of speech he gains that power
over the minds of his fellow-beings that is denied to
many in other branches of art. No power is so
great or so well worth possessing as that which
exercises sole control over the minds of others.
To influence their minds, to lead their wills cap-
tive, and to guide their thoughts, are the aspirations
of a speaker who is possessed of nobleness of mind,
and when he achieves any of these his success is
assured.
Eloquence is the reigning power of the world.
The orator has been the presiding genius over every

great movement. It is he who has kindled genuine
enthusiasm, determined the abolition of abuses, and,
unfortunately, roused the demon of strife~the man
of deeds is of importance, but the man of words is of
far greater consequence. But for him the man of
deeds would never have exerted himself; would never
even have thought of exerting himself. The much-
quoted aphorism “Speech is silvern and silence
golden” does not apply here. In some cases indi-
vidually it is true enough, but in how many cases
is it proved that speech is strength and silence weak-
ness ? Hand-in-hand with power goes fame, and to
become famous in their own spheres is the desire of
all earnest thinking men. In a measure fame is the
reward of the public speaker-and power and fame
are the inducements to the study of public speaking.
When eloquence is mentioned to the ordinary indi-
vidual he is apt to ignore the importance of the
remark, or else in his rough, untutored nature, he
conceives it to be a certain trick of speech : “Give
me sense,” says he, “and keep your eloquence for
the devil!” Well, probably some of us will require
the sacred spirit of oratory to keep us beyond the
clutches of His Satanic Majesty!
Certainly to be truly eloquent is to speak to the
purpose, and whenever a man speaks or writes he is
supposed to have some end in view; to inform, to
amuse, or to persuade his fellow-creatures; and he
who succeeds in accomplishing his object is the most
eloquent. Eloquence is the outcome of natural

ability; and nature teaches every man to be eloquent
when he is much in earnest.
The aspirant to public honours must possess
naturally several qualifications, or he can never hope
to attain any degree of eminence. Abbé Bautain, in
his work “Extempore Speaking,” lays it down as a
first necessary qualification that a speaker should
have a “lively sensibility,” by which is meant a
capacity for being readily impressed by every circum-
stance and feeling. But all men are not alike. “One
speaker," adds Bautain, “is more sensitive to set
forth ideas, their connections, and their gradations."
He discerns perfectly the congruity, the difference,
the contrast of thoughts, and thus he will deliver.
them suddenly with much facility, delicacy, subtilty,
and will therefore enunciate it gracefully and clearly.
Such a one is made to teach and instruct.
Another has a greater enjoyment of everything
relating to soft or strong emotions. He will cause
the fibres of the heart to vibrate. Such a one will
be an orator rather than a teacher, and will be better
able to persuade by emotion than to convince by
reason.
A third delights by images and pictures. He will
speak to the imagination of his hearers rather than
to their hearts; he will affect but little, and instruct
still less; but he will be able to amuse and interest.
In these different instances we see that sensibility
is vividly excited either by ideas, by feelings, or by
images: and it is evident that he who would ex-

temporise a discourse in one of these three methods
must begin by feeling vividly the subject of which he
has to speak.
Common sense must be predominant in all that
the speaker utters. To him it is of vital importance,
prompting him as it does, as to the ideas that should
be brought forward, what words to be used, and what
figures and illustrations are in good taste. Earnest-
ness, as in the case of an actor, is an essential feature.
The merest semblance of it is often more of assist-
ance to his cause than the most mighty argument;
as sometimes the emotions of an audience can be
reached when their intellects cannot. This brings to
the surface an anecdote of the Church and Stage
series. Betterton, an actor, was asked by the then
Bishop of London, how it was actors could move
whole audiences to tears while all the time they
knew it was only acting: he replied, “ My lord, it
is because we are in earnest. You deliver truth as if
it were a fiction; we deliver fiction like truth!”
The imagination must be cultivated so that it will
enable the speaker to express himself readily when a
new thought arises; in fact, to put the picture into
words without hesitation.
In conjunction with imagination is what M. Bau-
tain describes as “Expansiveness of Character”;
and he explains it as follows: “When we perceive,
or think we perceive, a truth, the mind partakes of
its expansive force, and experiences the desire of
announcing to others what it knows itself, and of

making them see what it sees. ... A keen and
intelligent mind, which seeks truth, seizes it quickly,
and conceives it clearly, is more eager than another
to communicate what it knows; and if, along with
this, such a mind loves glory, it will be impelled the
more towards public speaking, and more capable of
exercising the power of eloquence.”
To become successful the speaker must lay in a
good stock of general knowledge; and he must be
prepared to talk well on any subject. He can never
hope to dilate well and earnestly on given topics
unless he has made himself master of them; and he
must have more than a slight acquaintance with the
world, and be able to read with critical eye the
innermost parts of human nature. He must become
familiar with general literature and study the elegance
and eloquence of our greatest writers. The verses
of the most musical poets should be committed to
memory and recited and analysed during moments
of leisure, as it is a most agreeable and profitable
practice. This memorising of poetry brings with it
a knowledge of the harmony of language, and a
closer relationship with the intellects of the world.
Logic must of necessity form one of the principal
studies of the speaker, for though he may naturally
possess it, yet it must be cultivated to the utmost. “I
would,” says a writer on the subject, “have persons
who are intended for public speaking follow a course
of logic rather practical than theoretic, in which the
mind should be vigorously trained to the division and

combination of ideas upon interesting and instructive
topics. These exercises should be written or oral.
Sometimes it should be a dissertation on a point of
literature, morals, or history, and a habit should be
acquired of composing with order and method, by
pointing out, in proportion as the student proceeded,
the several parts of the discourse, the steps of
development, and the means of proof—in a word,
whatever serves to treat a subject suitably. ...
I am convinced that young men who thus occupied
themselves during a year or two in turning over and
handling a variety of subjects, in stirring up a
multiplicity of ideas, and who should, with a view to
this, write and speak a great deal, always with order,
with method, and under good guidance, would
become able thinkers, and, if endowed with high
intelligence, would become men mighty in word or
in deed, or in both together, according to their
capacity, character, and nature.”
Upon the matter of meditation, which is one of
the secrets of power, Mr. Gladstone wrote the follow-
ing to a correspondent: “Speaking from my own
experience, I think that the public men of England
are beyond all others engrossed by the multitudes of
cares and subjects of thought belonging to a diversi-
fied empire, and therefore are probably less than
others qualified either to impart to others the best
methods of preparing public discourses, or to consider
and adopt them for themselves. Supposing, however,
I were to make the attempt, I should certainly found

myself on a double basis, compounded as follows:
First, of a wide and general education, which, I
think, gives a suppleness and readiness, as well
as a firmness of tissue, to the mind, not easily
obtained without this form of discipline; and,
secondly, of the habit of constant and searching reflec-
tion on the subject of any proposed discourse. Such
reflection will naturally clothe itself in words, and of
the phrases it supplies many will spontaneously rise
to the lips.”
The aspirant should accustom himself to convey-
ing his sentences to paper, so as to relieve himself
of any style of slovenliness. Sentences he would
readily utter with his tongue he would hesitate to
put on paper with his pen. This exercise must not
be taken up by fits and starts, but resolutely per-
severed with. When about to engage in publicly
ventilating his views on any given subject, he should
begin by thinking the matter over in his mind;
collecting his ideas; forming a plan for himself ;
setting it down in writing; and finally consulting
authorities to see how they have dealt with it. But
this transferring of thoughts to paper does not mean
that to write well one must first know how to speak.
In point of fact many of our most able writers are
very commonplace when taking the rôle of public
. speaker. The reason suggested for their failure as
speakers is that their imagination becomes blurred
through allowing the mind to become too excited in
the presence of others; or too much reserve.


## p. 56 (#62) ##############################################

56
THE ART OF ELOCUTION.
The chief point in a discourse is unity of design.
Everything should revolve round the idea of the
discourse; there should be some definite point to be
arrived at, and every word uttered should lead the
listener nearer to it. If there should be any appear-
ance of slovenliness in the arrangement of the argu-
ment, it will become incoherent, and, consequently,
all point will be lost. Addison says: “Irregularity
and want of method are only supportable in men of
great learning or genius, who are often too full to be
exact; and, therefore, choose to throw down their
pearls in heaps before their readers, rather than be at
the pains of stringing them.”
When a discourse has been planned it will be
found more often than not, that upon analysis of its
parts, different thoughts will arise out of each head,
so that it must be the method of the speaker to
arrange his ideas under each heading, and present
the most logical to his hearers.
The style of language to be adopted should be in
keeping with his own character and that of his
audience. He must not "talk like a book," because
the difference between writing and speaking is very
wide. Books are built up with precision, correct-
ness, repetitions avoided, and language completely
polished; while speaking is less fettered by rule,
giving more scope for an easy, copious style. Pro-
fessor Masson ably draws the distinction between the
styles requisite for writing and speaking, and herein
I summarise his remarks on the subject. “Conversa-

57
tion,” he says, “is one thing, public speaking another,
and writing a third. When a man talks with his
friend, he is led on but by a few trains of association,
and finds a straggling style natural for his purpose ;
when he speaks in public, the wheels of thought glow,
the associative processes by which he advances be-
come more complex, and hence the role, cadence,
the precipitous burst; and lastly, when he writes,
still other conditions of thought come into action,
and there arises the elaborate sentence, winding like
a rivulet through the meadow of his subject. A man,
too, in a state of excitement talks in vivid language,
and even sets his words to a rough natural music, his
voice swelling or trembling with its burden, though
falling short of song. But in the literary repetition
of a scene, nature suggests a new set of properties,
answering to the entire difference between the mind
in the primary and the mind in the secondary
attitude ; and a literal report would be found to be
as much out of place as a literal copy in painting.
A fault among some speakers is the use of words
far above the comprehension of their audiences.
This is not true eloquence. No language is better
understood by the masses than that which contains
the greater amount of Saxon. Archbishop Whately
remarks that, “The vulgar require a perspicuous,
but by no means a dry and unadorned style ; on the
contrary, they have a taste rather for the tawdry
and bombastic." Care must be taken not to make
the sentences too long; or, if they are made long,

let them be of the plainest language so that the
sense can be readily grasped.
Avoid any expression that is considered vulgar
and unsuitable to the dignity of the subject; for the
speaker must remember that he aims not for the
amusement of his hearers, but for their conviction
or persuasion.
Finally, the attention of the would-be speaker is
called to an important factor in his adopted study,
and that is elocution. There is no branch of study
requiring more anxious devotion, and at which he
should work more diligently. The time devoted to
this twin-art will reap its own reward, for, to quote
Quintilian, “A very indifferent speech, well delivered,
will have a greater effect than the best, if destitute
of that advantage."

The student must obtain a thorough insight to the
characters of this little piece. They are not many, and
that is the reason I have selected it for exercise. It gives
scope for a little “character” effort, viz :—in delineating
the judge, the mother, and the son. It is important that
the apparently opposing traits of the judge be well studied,
as the conflicting emotions which they naturally give rise to,
require to be given with a due regard to their significance.
The son is not absolutely hard-hearted or he would not
have turned on those in court in the manner that he did.

consonants. Relentless, not relentliss. 2. Slightly quicker,
lighter tone. 3. Slower, and sympathetically descriptive.

THE BALLAD OF THE CLAMPHERDOWN.
By RUDYARD KIPLING.
Reprinted from "Barrack Room Ballads,” by kind permission of the
Author and Messrs. Methuen and Co.
It was our war-ship Clampherdown
Would sweep the Channel clean,
Wherefore she kept her hatches close,
When the merry Channel chops arose,
To save the bleached marine.
She had one bow-gun of a hundred ton,
And a great stern-gun beside;
They dipped their noses deep in the sea,
They racked their stays and stanchions free
In the wash of the wind-whipped tide.
It was our war-ship Clampherdown
Fell in with a cruiser light
That carried the dainty Hotchkiss gun
And a pair of heels wherewith to run
From the grip of a close-fought fight.
She opened fire at seven miles-
As ye shoot at a bobbing cork-
And once she fired, and twice she fired,
Till the bow-gun drooped like a lily tired
That lolls upon the stalk.

“Captain, the bow-gun melts apace,
The deck-beams break below;
'Twere well to rest for an hour or twain,
And botch the shattered plates again.”
And he answered, “Make it so.”
She opened fire within a mile-
As ye shoot at a flying duck-
And the great stern-gun shot fair and true,
With the heave of the ship to the stainless blue,
And the great stern-turret struck.
“Captain, the turret fills with steam,
The feed-pipes burst below;
You can hear the hiss of the helpless ram,
You can hear the twisted runners jam.”
And he answered, “ Turn and go.”
It was our war-ship Clampherdown,
And grimly did she roll:
Swung round to take the cruiser's fire
As the white whale faces the thresher's ire
When they war by the frozen Pole.
“Captain, the shells are falling fast,
And faster still fall we;
And it is not meet for English stock
To bide in the heart of an eight-day clock
The death they cannot see.”

“ Lie down, lie down, my bold A.B.,
We drift upon her beam ;
We dare not ram, for she can run;
And dare ye fire another gun,
And die in the peeling steam?”
It was our war-ship Clampherdown
That carried an armour-belt ;
But fifty feet at stern and bow
Lay bare as the paunch of the purser's sow
To the hail of the Nordenfeldt.
“Captain, they hack us through and through
The chilled steel bolts are swift.
We have emptied the bunkers in open sea;
Their shrapnel bursts where our coal should be.”
And he answered, “Let her drift.”
It was our war-ship Clampherdown
Swung round upon the tide ;
Her two guns glared south and north,
And the block and the bubbling steam ran forth,
And she ground the cruiser's side.
"Captain,” they cry, "the fight is done;
They bid you send your sword.”
And he answered, “Grapple her stern and bow.
They have asked for the steel; they shall have it
now.
Out cutlasses and board!”

From conning tower to hold.
They fought as they fought in Nelson's fleet;
They were stripped to the waist, they were bare to

As it was in the days of old.
It was the sinking Clampherdown
Heaved up her battered side,
And carried a million pounds in steel
To the cod and the corpse-fed conger-eel
And the scour of the Channel tide.
It was the crew of the Clampherdown
Stood out to sweep the sea
On a cruiser won from an ancient foe,
As it was in the days of long ago,
And as it still shall be.

“THE ANSWER.”
By RUDYARD KIPLING.
Reprinted from “ The Seven Seas,” by kind permission of the
Author and Messrs. Methuen and Co.
A ROSE, in tatters on the garden path
Cried out to God and murmured 'gainst His wrath,
Because a sudden wind at twilight's hush
Had snapped her stem alone of all the bush.
And God, who hears both sun-dried dust and sun,
Had pity, whispering to that luckless one:
“Sister, in that thou sayest We did not well-
What voices heardst thou when thy petals fell?"
And the Rose answered, “In that evil hour
A voice said, 'Father, wherefore falls the flower ?
For lo, the very gossamers are still.'
And a voice answered, “Son, by Allah's will.'”
Then, softly as a rain-mist on the sward,
Came to the Rose the answer of the Lord :
“Sister, before We smote the dark in twain,
Ere yet the stars saw one another plain,
Time, tide, and space, We bound unto the task,
That thou shouldst fall, and such an one should ask.”
Whereat the withered flower, all content,
Died as they die whose days are innocent;
While he who questioned why the flower fell
Caught hold of God and saved his soul from hell.

CORPORAL DICK'S PROMOTION.
SIR ARTHUR CONAN DOYLE.
(By permission of Messrs. Smith, Elder and Co.)
THE Eastern day was well-nigh o'er
When, parched with thirst and travel sore,
Two of McPherson's flanking corps
Across the desert were tramping.
They had wandered off from the beaten track,
And now were wearily harking back,
Ever starting round for the signal jack
That marked their comrades camping.
The one was Corporal Robert Dick,
Bearded and burly, short and thick,
Rough of speech and in temper quick,
A hard-faced old rapscallion.
The other, fresh from the barrack square,
Was a raw recruit, smooth-cheeked and fair,
Half-grown, half-drilled, with the weedy air
Of a draft from the home battalion.
Weary and parched and hunger-torn,
They had wandered on from early morn,

And the young boy-soldier limped forlorn,
Now stumbling and now falling.
Around the orange sand-curves lay,
Flanked with boulders, black or grey,
Death-silent, save that far away
A kite was shrilly calling.
A kite ? Was that a kite? The yell
That shrilly rose and faintly fell ?
No kite's, and yet the kite knows well
The long-drawn wild halloo.
And right athwart the evening sky
The yellow sand-spray spurtled high,
And shrill and shriller swelled the cry
Of “ Allah! Allahu !”
The Corporal peered at the crimson West,
Hid his pipe in his khaki vest,
Growled an oath and onward pressed,
Still glancing over his shoulder.
“ Bedouins, mate!” he curtly said ;
“We'll find some work for steal and lead,
And maybe sleep in a sandy bed
Before we're one hour older.
“But just one flutter before we're done:
Stiffen your lip and stand, my son;
We'll take this bloomin' circus on.

Dogged and grim they stood their ground,
And their breech-blocks snapped with a crisp clean
sound
As the rifles sprang to the “ready.”

The Corporal sprang to the dead man's place;
One prick with the steel, one thrust with the heel,
And where was the man to outride him?
A grip of his knees, a toss of his rein,
He was settling her down to her gallop again
When he stopped, for he heard just one faltering
word
From the young recruit beside him.

But it found the heart of the Corporal;

CORPORAL DICK'S PROMOTION.
75
Off with you! No palaver! Go!
I'll bide be'ind and run this show,
• Promotion has been cursèd slow,
And this is my chance to win it.”
Into the saddle he thrust him quick,
Spurred the black mare with the bayonet prick,
Watched her gallop with plunge and with kick
Away o'er the desert careering.
Then he turned with a softened face,
And loosened the strap of his cartridge-case;
While his thoughts flew back to the dear old place
In the sunny Hampshire clearing.
The young boy-private, glancing back,
Saw the Bedouins' wild attack,
And heard the sharp Martini crack.
But as he gazed, already
The fierce fanatic Arab band
Were closing in on every hand,
Until one tawny swirl of sand
Concealed them in its eddy.
A squadron of British Horse that night,
Galloping hard in the shadowy night,
Came on the scene of that last stern fight,
And found the Corporal lying
Silent and grim on the trampled sand,
His rifle grasped in his stiffened hand,
With the warrior pride of one who dies
'Mid a ring of the dead and dying.

And still when twilight shadows fall,
After the evening bugle call,
In bivouac or in barrack-hall,
His comrades speak of the Corporal,
His death and his devotion.
And there are some who like to say,
That perhaps a hidden meaning lay
In the words he spoke, and that the day
When his rough bold spirit passed away
Was the day that he won promotion.

THE NEW VICTORIA CROSS!
SIX POPULAR RECITALS OF
“ENGLAND'S HEROES TOILING DAY BY DAY.”
BY CLEMENT SCOTT.
(By the kind permission of the Author.)
THE success of these clever, pithy recitals would be
considerably enhanced if appropriate music accom-
panied the reciter. They are founded on facts of
everyday life, and as they appeal to all hearts, they
could form an interesting part of any programme.
Mr. Scott says in his Note: “In humbly and re-
spectfully suggesting the gracious institution of a
new 'Cross for Valour' as a reward for the many
heroes in civilian life who daily risk their lives in
the noble and unselfish execution of their duty, it
has not been forgotten that already certain prizes
and decorations exist to meet these very cases.
“The Albert Medal, occasionally granted by the
Board of Trade for very exceptional deeds of per-
sonal courage; the Royal Humane Society's Medal
for saving life; and the medals granted respectively
by the National Lifeboat Institution for seamen, and
the London County Council for firemen, are prized,
and justly prized, by their recipients; but, after all,

a medal is not a cross, nor has it that priceless value
that is attached to the most enviable decoration ever
pinned on the breast of a soldier or a sailor. What
medal, prize, ribbon, or decoration in the world can
be compared to the Iron Cross of Germany, or to
the Victoria Cross of England ?
“For the heroes in the civilian ranks we plead the
best reward for valour—a Cross from the Crown !”
PROLOGUE
There are men in our dear old England with pluck
of the soldier brave ;
There are boys who toil in their ships at sea who
never have ruled the wave.
It isn't alone in the Services that the merits of
England lie;
So I sing, in the name of the men who live, to the
boys who can daily die.
I sing to the lads in the coal-dark mine, whose life is
an hourly grave,
Who shut their ears to the women's tears on the
chance of a “pal” to save.
I sing to the tramp of the men in blue, who waken
when London sleeps,
Who brave the cowardly burglar's shot, and wait
where the suicide creeps.

I sing to the bravest men on earth, so cool when the
crowds are wild,
Who follow the “Fire" through the shrieking
streets and die for a helpless child.
I sing to the men who, in storm and shine, are firm
at the engine's head,
Who drive to doom should the weary sleep, and
charge through the dastard's lead.
And last, here's the gallant lifeboat men! I'll give as
a parting toast,
Who are ready to die for the men who drown—the
pride of our English coast !
Chorus-
These are the men who can do or die,
These are the boys who save-
Heroes some on our dear old land,
Some on its circling wave!
Thinking how little of life and love-
Nothing of profit or loss.
Ask of our Queen! She will grant it, lads-
A new Victoria Cross!
THE MINER'S DRAMA.
Have ye heard the news, Mary? Dont'ee look so

Johnnie's going down, lass-Johnnie's volunteered !
Down into yon pit's mouth, maybe to his doom,
Sworn to die or save a pal in the miner's tomb.

“ETIQUETTE.”
By W. S. GILBERT.
LBERT.
THE Ballyshannon founded off the coast of Cariboo,
And down in fathoms many went the captain and
the crew ;
Down went the owners-greedy men whom hope of
gain allured.
Oh! dry the starting tear, for they were heavily
insured.
Besides the captain and the mate, the owners and
the crew,
The passengers were also drowned excepting only
two-
Young Peter Gray, who tasted teas for Baker, Croop,
and Co.,
And Somers who from Eastern shores imported
indigo.
These passengers, by reason of their clinging to a
mast,
Upon a desert island were eventually cast.
They hunted for their meals as Alexander Selkirk
used,
But they couldn't chat together—they had not been
introduced


## p. 86 (#92) ##############################################

86 . THE ART OF ELOCUTION.
For Peter Gray, and Somers too, though certainly in
trade,
Were properly particular about the friends they
made;
And somehow thus they settled it without a word
of mouth-
That Gray should take the northern half, while
Somers took the south.
On Peter's portion oysters grew-a delicacy rare,
But oysters were a delicacy Peter couldn't bear.
On Somers' side was turtle, on the shingle lying
thick,
Which Somers couldn't eat, because it always made
him sick.
Gray gnashed his teeth with envy as he saw a mighty
store
Of turtle unmolested on his fellow-creature's shore ;
The oysters at his feet aside impatiently he shoved,
For turtle and his mother were the only things he
loved.
And Somers sighed in sorrow as he settled in the
south,
For the thought of Peter's oysters brought the water
to his mouth;
He longed to lay him down on the shelly bed and
stuff,
He had often eaten oysters, but had never had
enough.

How they wished an introduction to each other
they had had
When on board the Ballyshannon. And it drove
them nearly mad
To think how very friendly to each other they might
get
If it wasn't for the arbitrary rule of etiquette.
One day, when out hunting for the mus rediculus,
Gray overheard his fellow-man soliloquising thus :
"I wonder how the playmates of my youth are
getting on-
M'Connell, S. B. Walters, Paddy Byles, and Robin-
son?”
These simple words made Peter as delighted as
could be,
Old chums at the Charterhouse were Robinson and
he.
He walked straight up to Somers, then he turned
extremely red,
Hesitated, hummed and hawed a bit, then cleared his
throat, and said :
“ I beg your pardon-pray forgive me if I seem too
bold,
But you breathed a name I new familiarly of old;
You spoke aloud of Robinson, I happened to be by.
You know him ?,” “Yes, extremely well.” “ Allow
me, so do I.”

THE ART OF ELOCUTION.
It was enough; they felt they could more pleasantly
get on,
For (ah, the magic of the fact !) they each knew
Robinson.
And Mr. Somers' turtle was at Peter's service quite,
And Mr. Somers punished Peter's oyster-beds all
night.
They soon became like brothers from community of
wrongs;
They wrote each other little odes and sang each
other songs;
They told each other anecdotes disparaging their
wives;
On several occasions, too, they saved each other's
lives.
They felt quite melancholy when they parted for the
night,
And got up in the morning soon as ever it was light;
Each other's pleasant company they reckoned so
upon,
And all because it happened that they both knew
Robinson.
They lived for many years on that inhospitable shore,
And day by day they learned to love each other
more and more.
At last, to their astonishment, on getting up one
day.
They saw a frigate anchored in the offing of the bay.

To Peter an idea occurred. “Suppose we cross the
main ?
So good an opportunity may not be found again."
And Somers thought a minute, then ejaculated
“Done!
I wonder how my business in the City's getting on?”
“But stay," said Mr. Peter ; "when in England, as
you know,
I earned a living tasting teas for Baker, Croop and
Co.,
I may be superseded—my employers think me dead.”
:* Then come with me,” said Somers, “and taste
indigo instead."
But all their plans were scattered in a moment when
they found
The vessel was a convict ship from Portland, outward
bound;
When a boat came off to fetch them, though they
felt it very kind,
To go on board they firmly but respectfully de-
clined.
As both the happy settlers roared with laughter at
the joke,
They recognised a gentlemanly fellow pulling stroke;
'Twas Robinson–a convict, in an unbecoming frock,
Condemned to seven years for misappropriating
stock.

They laughed no more, for Somers thought he had
been rather rash
In knowing one whose friend had misappropriated
cash;
And Peter thought a foolish tack he must have gone
upon
In making the acquaintance of a friend of Robinson.
At first they didn't quarrel very openly, I've heard;
They nodded when they met, and now and then
exchanged a word:
The word grew rare, and rarer still the nodding of
the head,
And when they meet each other now they cut each
other dead.
To allocate the island they agreed by word of
mouth,
And Peter takes the north again, and Somers takes
the south; :
And Peter has the oysters, which he hates, in layers
thick,
And Somers has the turtle-turtle always makes him
sick!

WHO WINS THE BRUSH?
A HUNTSMAN'S YARN.
THE night is still young, all the whisky's not gone,
Sit ye down, man; come! don't run away,
An' i'll tell ye the tale of a run we once had
Forty-five years ago to a day.
Fair colleens were few at the Eggleton meets,
But if they had numbered ten score
They'd not have included a sweeter young lass
Than fair Mistress Kathleen O'More.
Och! she was a darlin', the pride of our hearts,
All men, young and old, were her slaves ;
If we had been dead, why, the sound of her voice
Would have brought us post haste from our graves.
Sure never was maiden so bothered, I'll swear,
With offers of hand, heart and name ;
She had 'em by scores, an' the worst of it was
She treated 'em all just the same.
She was kind to all wooers, and no man could say,
She liked him the worst or the best,
Till the day of this run that I'll tell ye about,
When Miss Katie her lovers did test.
At breakfast that morning Miss Kathleen came in
(Her home was the scene of the meet),

Bewitchin' as Venus the sweet creature looked
From her hair to the soles of her feet.
“Now listen, my friends, I have made up my mind,
To-day shall decide whom I'll wed,
For I'll marry the hunter who brings me the brush
When the hounds roll the fox over dead.”
When she finished, the cheerin' it near split the walls,
Table thumpin's near smashed all the delf.
An’sly Father Connell inquired with a grin,
“S'pose, Miss Kathleen, I bring it meself ? .”
Then to horse and away, not a moment to spare.
Hark forrard! Away! Tally-ho!
Sly Reynard breaks cover, and off in pursuit
Pell-mell, hell-for-leather, we go.
Young Mickey O'Connor he led for three fields,
But at last came to grief at a wall;
Then bold Captain Blake shot at once to the front,
But the fox showed clean heels to 'em all.
Holy Patrick! What riding ! ould Ireland ne'er saw
Such a maddenin', punishin'chase,
Though every man-Jack had have broken his neck
He'd not have dropped back in the race.
Squire Tommy O'Neil broke his arm at a gate-
Begorra! we thought 'twas his neck
Till he roared out, “ Ye divels! get on, I'm all right,”
And then, by good luck, came a check.
The rest it was short, for the hounds found at once,
Helter-skelter, again off we went;
The captain soon stuck in a neat little bog,
An' down came Sir Timothy Trent.

The fox was a game 'un, he ran like the wind,
Straight ahead, not a turn or a twist;
There were six of us close to the tails of the hounds,
When says one to me, “Barney, lad, whisht!
There's ten golden guineas I'll give ye this night
If ye'll keep a still tongue in your head.
There's a short cut I'm taking, but don't say a word,
If ye do—well! ye'll wish ye were dead.”
So Arthur O'Donnell slipped off at a gate,
And rides straight for O’Callaghan's bog ;
But the other bold suitors they saw him slip off,
And they shouts out “Ha! ha! the sly dog ;
· He knows a near cut-well, we'll take it as well,”
And galloped like mad in his track.
Mr. Joyce's mare slipped coming down from a leap,
And lay still, for she'd broken her back;
O'Donnell rode slowly, he knew the ground well,
But the others did not, and rode fast.
In a minute they'd caught him, and left him behind,
And they grinned as they all thundered past;
But begorra! they found he laughs best who laughs
last,
An' they'd mighty small cause for their mirth.
By good luck one got through, but the others stuck
fast,
Safe held in the bog to the saddle-girth.
“Ye villain,” they groaned, as O'Donnell rode past,
“Will ye leave us here till we are dead?”
“Nay, keep up your hearts, I will help dig ye out
When I've cut off the fox brush,” he said.

Hark forrard ! Hark forrard! He's off in pursuit,
His rival's but one field ahead ;
An' he yells out “Hurroo !” as the spurs he drives
home
In the sides of his bay thoroughbred.
The stranger looks back as he hears the wild yell,
And urges his horse at a wall;
But the poor beast is weary, his chest strikes the top,
And he comes down a bone-cracking fall.
The rider springs up, ere the saddle he gains
O'Donnell goes by like a flash;
Och! murder! what luck, there's a pool t'other side,
And in it he lands with a splash.
Both riders recover, they race neck and neck,
Stride for stride, down the side of the hill ;
For 'neath them they see the hounds close to the fox:
Now which will be first at the kill ?
Poor Reynard is spent, and he knows his end's come,
But as sure as he lives he'll die game;
He turns with a snarl, there's a yelp; but the end
In a short time the deep barks proclaim.
Mistress Kate was beside me when I neared the kill,
But she stopped me some ten yards away;
And we watched the two riders spring down from
their steeds,
And headlong dash into the fray.
The stranger stoops down and gets hold of the fox,
And drags it away from the pack;
When ould Bran, the sly crathure, falls into his legs,
And he tumbles full length on his back.

Ere he rises the body's snatched out of his hand,

A LITTLE MUSIC.
By DAN LENO.
I AM to a great extent a self-educated man, and I
have tackled nearly all the arts and sciences in a
sixpenny sort of way.
But in the whole course of my studies I never
had such an exciting time as when I tried to obtain
complete mastery of the bagpipes in seven lessons
without a master. I was not particularly fond of
the instrument, and I think I can understand why
it is rarely played at symphony concerts. But I had
an absorbing curiosity to find out whether I could
produce a pathetic effect by squealing the “Maiden's
Prayer” on it. I thought it would be the most touch-
ing musical performance ever known. My landlady at
that time was a well-nourished female, but she had
no ear; she had to listen through her nose, and that,
of course, gave her a prejudice against classical
music.
My first attempt was startling. I had shut the
door and taken a large mouthful of the pipes, and
after blowing away until my teeth nearly dropped
out, I managed to fill the bag or cistern with several
gallons of south-west wind.


## p. 97 (#103) #############################################

A LITTLE MUSIC.
97
Nothing happened for a few minutes; but just as
I was panting and sighing before starting again, the
instrument seemed to wake up suddenly to a sense
of its surroundings, and started screaming and wail-
ing and spitting. It sounded like thirty cats with
their tails in a mangle.
I dropped the thing in terror, and rushed from the
room.
On the landing I met my landlady, who took me
tenderly in her arms, and kissing me softly on the
forehead, asked me where the pain was, and told me
her husband used to suffer in the same way, but she
didn't think he ever had it as bad as I had.
The young man who lived above me was a power-
ful and generally ill-natured fellow; but on this
occasion he took it very gently, and I was greatly
relieved when he sent word down to ask if Mr. Leno
would kindly leave off singing, as he wanted to go to
sleep.
On the occasion of my second lesson, I began
to practise in my bedroom before breakfast, and I
saw through the window a dear old heavy-weight
friend of mine coming along to invite himself to
breakfast.
“Hello, old man!” said the hearty guest, "up
already? More study? Never mind a chair; I'll sit
on the washstand.”
That wasn't what I wanted, so I immediately
flooded the washstand by upsetting some water.
“Well, then, I'll sit on the bed,” he cried.

He sat on the bed-flopped down on it in his jolly
way.
My bagpipes rose nobly to the occasion. As soon
as my friend's trunk came in contact with the bed,
there was an outburst of blood-curdling groans and
shrieks from under the clothes. It was a really
frightful noise that made even my heart stand
still.
My friend leaped so high that he bumped his head
against the ceiling. His hair stood on end, his teeth
rattled, his knees knocked together. “Good God,
man!” he chattered, “I must have ki-ki-killed
the child !”
Suddenly he seemed to recover the use of his
limbs; he opened the door and dashed wildly into
the street.
I shouted out to him through the window. I said,
“It's no use running away; we must face this catas-
trophe and decide what to do. Come up at once.
If people see you like that they'll begin to suspect
something."
So he came back trembling, and I began seriously
to discuss with him the advisability of hiding the
body under the floor, and then emigrating to Vene-
zuela.
His face was buried in his hands, and he seemed
dazed with the thought that his career was blighted.
Then he rose up with calm resolution on his
countenance. He approached the bed and gently
touched the cover.

THE BELL.
By Bart KENNEDY.
It boomed forth its mighty tones in the same solemn
way, neither heeding nor caring, but booming on, on,
marking the hour and the number thereof. Boom!
Boom! - Its tones were rolling out over the dark,
sullen waters. Out over the mighty, mighty town,
where reigned destruction and lust for blood. Out
over and around the Houses wherein for centuries
wise men and fools had sat together and made laws.
Out over and around the old Abbey, where lay, in
their last sleep, great men.
Boom! A great and wondrous bell. It was as if
the soul, the genius, of the old town arose and cried
out stupendously. And doom spoke not in the tone
of this bell, though doom was upon the town.
Neither spoke within it warning, nor menace, nor
regret, nor, indeed, aught that was human of meaning.
It boomed forth now even as it boomed when the
town was gay-a weird, awesome tone that meant
movement-marching. That that bides not. That
that recks not. That meant the whirl of stars, of
suns, of worlds. The fall of leaves. The move of
seas, the crumble of atoms.
That meant Time.

THE BELL.

It hung aloft in a great square tower that stood as
a huge sentinel, at once on guard and deeply sleeping.
And from this tower rang the full golden chimes that
marked the divisions of the hour. And the meaning
that was in them was strange and deep and solemn,
like unto the meaning that was in the tone of their
master—the great Bell.
*

Night came, and fire burst out in the town. And
the sky was made red even as if a great sea of blood
had suddenly filled it. Here was eating, destroying
flame. Ravishing, frightful flame, that seized and
shrivelled. All-embracing flame. Boom! The great
tone was rolling forth. Rolling out over the flaming,
rending, crushing chaos. The world town was sink-
ing as sank the world-towns of the long, long ago.
The palace was falling, wherein kings and queens
had sat in pomp and magnificence. The glorious
old Abbey was aflame and tottering. Now its roof
had crashed down upon the tombs where lay, in their
last sleep, great men. Away off in the distance was

from its foundation. Smoke was arising from the
ruins of the money-house, wherefrom the loathsome
power of gold had dominated the world. Boom!
It was the death-knell of the plague-spot that in the
end had destroyed this nation. It marked the down-
fall of a brave and glorious race that had been

“Let us Aling the nitros against the tower, and
stay for ever the clangour of this bell,” cried a
voice.
"No," commanded a firm, vibrant voice. “Let
the old bell toll on. Let the tower stand. Every-
thing else I will destroy before the day breaks. But
the bell shall stay."
“And why?"
“Because I will it. I am the master absolutely,
even as this old bell is the master of all the other
bells. Let none seek to question me. The world as
yet needs masters, and this bell shall toll on as a
sign that this is so. It was I who conceived this
plan of extermination. I who found means to carry
it out. Where would have been the legions of mal-
contents but for me? I am absolute.
“For I am a Northman. I am of the bold white
race that ever moves on. I am as this bell-strong
and steady, and sure of stroke. I have loosed the
powers called evil. What the end, or the movement
will now be, I know not. I came into the world to
destroy. If I am evil, the time called for an evil
man.”
“What is your will now?"

“I destroy !” broke forth the voice again, “and for
what end? I sought and discovered this mighty
agent of destruction, and for what end? I am evil,
and for what end? My wish is to free slaves. But
none may free slaves but slaves. Then why do
I destroy? Then-
“Ah! the chimes! Soon the old bell will toll
again. I have always loved it. Often I have stood
and drunk in its tones. I have looked to the clear

dark old river yonder as it runs out to meet the sea,
and the voice of this bell. It tells of that that was
before the beginning. Of that that shall be after the
end. Live on, old "! Live when I am gone."
And now great rushing names were bursting from
all parts of the town at once. And there were
thunders and shocks. Everything was falling.
“All hail to thee, Destruction !” cried the firm
voice. "I greet thee! I pledge to thee in the chaos
of this mighty town. Hail! Toll forth, old bell !
Toll forth, old comrade! Thee I spare- I love thee!
For thou art strong and mighty, even as I. Toll
forth over the ruin of all—for now my work is done!”
Boom! The great bell broke forth, marking the hour

COMEDIAN v. TWO PLUMBERS.
BY DAN LENO.
THE bath was no use to me, and as it was in a roomy
room I thought I would have it shifted (the bath, not
the room), and make it into a nursery for the children
(the room, not the bath).
Accordingly, I pulled myself together one morn-
ing, and took a deep breath and walked into a
plumber's shop to implore his assistance, and about
nine o'clock the next morning he sent me two
pantomimists, who could have earned nearly as much
money at the halls as they did by plumbing. One
was a very tall man with whiskers growing over his
face like creepers, and just cut off to leave room for
his eyes, like windows. The other was a small men's
size, and he had no whiskers, but he had put on an
apron that was about as big as a tablecloth, suitable
for a picnic for thirty squatters.
It was crinkled up round his neck like the old-
fashioned ruff that Queen Elizabeth had to take off
before Shakespeare could kiss her when he went
courting, then it was folded half a dozen times round
his waist-well, the place where his waist was before
it got mislaid.
Well, to go on with the story, they began their
work of destruction as soon as they entered the

house. The long tubular man butted the hall lamp
like a wild goat on stilts and smashed it to powder,
and the little globular man trod on his apron three
times going upstairs, fell on his face, and stained the
carpet with his bleeding nose-all on purpose, I
know, because it was a dirty apron, and he must
have had a lot of practice in managing it.
When they reached the bath-room they sat down
and looked at the bath as if they had never seen one
before, and as if they were waiting to see it perform.
Then the short one got up and stroked and patted
it with his hands, as if he was telling it to be a
good bath.
“Oh!” I said, “ don't be afraid ; it isn't savage."
He turned round and murmured something with a
sigh. Then he sat down. They had some more low
conversation and lit their pipes. Without coming to
any unanimous decision they went away, saying that
they were going to fetch their tools and would be
back in half an hour. They returned five hours
later with enough tools to build a row of houses
with, and as the procession went upstairs again they
let a hammer fly out of one of the baskets, which
nearly brained me as I came behind them. They
laughed genially, while I rubbed my head. When
we got into the room they put down the baskets and
took up art criticism. It appeared that one had
declared the figures in a certain picture to be
angels, while the other was confident that they were
ostriches. Would you believe it? The picture in

dispute was a little pathetic effort of my own, en-
titled, “Heavenwards."
After that they came back from art to science, and
slowly emptied their baskets of all sorts of fearful
and wonderful implements and materials, which were
strewn all over the floor. There was a long piece of
wire, the use of which I did not understand until I
saw Whiskers cleaning his pipe with it. And Apron
showed me a lantern, which, by some pumping
arrangement, shot out a large flame about a foot
long, and enabled Whiskers to get his pipe well
alight without striking a lot of matches.
Apron was very pleased with his lantern, and kept
pumping it with an expression on his face that
might have indicated that he had conquered Europe.
At last he put it on the floor with the flame flaring
away, and went to his basket to find a lead pencil.
He brought this back to sharpen with a hatchet,
and while he was doing this set his apron on fire
with the lantern. Whiskers made a heroic rescue
of him. Seizing the apron he swung the globular
man round the room, but burnt his fingers, and
suddenly dropped his colleague, who fell on the back
of his head, and stayed there for a few moments'
rest and quiet. The long man went back to his
work. He had ceased to be a knockabout, and had
become a musical clown, and he was hitting the
bath with a hammer to try and make it sing "The
Village Blacksmith.”
Meanwhile Apron put some lead in a spoon and

COMEDIAN v. TWO PLUMBERS. 107
proceeded to melt it by means of the lantern. I
thought perhaps he was going to put a plug in the
back of his head where he fell, because I could not
see any other possible use for melted lead in that
scene. When it was nicely simmering he put the
spoon on the floor, and took the lantern into a
corner where it would be away from the sweep of
his apron. The tall man tried to reach a chisel with
his right hand without relinquishing his hold on the
bath, and losing his balance he kicked the molten
lead all over the oil-cloth, setting it on fire in several
spots. They both laughed and apologised, and
said accidents would happen.
Then they threw a pail of water over the burning
oil-cloth, and the water flowed under the door and
downstairs, and when I looked on the landing I saw
the baby sitting in it, crying. I picked the damp
baby up and took it to a place of safety, as far from
the plumbers as possible, and when I came back
I found, to my great satisfaction, that the tall man
had smashed his thumb with the musical hammer,
and the little man had fallen off a pair of steps into
the bath.
I asked them as calmly as I could whether they
had come there to commit suicide or to burn me out
of house and home, and they looked displeased.
To console themselves they sat down and had some
bread and cheese and beer, and as they didn't invite
me to join them I went away for an hour, after
and which I returned and found them both fast asleep.

"Well,” I said to myself, “I think too much of
this is enough,” so I woke Whiskers with a pin and
Apron with the lantern, and they sat up and started
a long conversation about some dogs, which lasted
until it was time for them to go home, when they got
up as if they had earned a good rest and asked me
for some beer money, promising to come early next
morning.
I ought to mention that they took the bath with
them and only let it fall downstairs twice, breaking
the umbrella-stand in the hall, and making an
infernal noise.
Now-and here comes the most thrilling part
of my tale—it happened that in the ceiling over the
bath there was a large “rose" for a cold shower,
which could be turned on by pulling a chain. Well,
these clever men took the chain away and left the
tap turned on, or made some mistake of the kind. I
was sleeping in the room underneath the bath-room,
and early next morning I was roused by drops of
water falling on the bed, and looking up I saw that
the ceiling was completely saturated. I rushed
upstairs in my pyjamas and found a beautiful water-
fall coming from the shower-bath arrangement. What
was to be done? If it ran much longer I should
have the whole family afloat in tubs and wash-bowls.
I got a bucket and put it under the shower, and when
that was full I put down another and hurried down-
stairs to empty the first. Before I could get back
the second one was running over, and I played this

game until nine o'clock, when the pantomimists re-
turned.
How they laughed! I said, “There's water enough
in the house already. What is there to laugh at ?".
Then they told me how it had all come about. It
seems that they had forgotten to lift the cistern ball
or something of that kind—I was too mad to listen
to them.
Since then I have become an enthusiastic anti-
plumbist. I have no objection to plumbers in the
abstract, but I don't like them in my house.

MR. BARKER'S PICTURE.
By Max ADELER.
“YOUR charge against Mr. Barker, the artist here,”
said the magistrate, “is assault and battery, I be-
lieve?”
“Yes, sir."
“And your name is— "
“Potts! I am art critic of the Weekly Spy."
“State your case.”
“I called at Mr. Barker's studio upon his invita-
tion to see his great picture, just finished, of 'George
Washington cutting down the cherry-tree with his
hatchet.' Mr. Barker was expecting to sell it to
Congress for fifty thousand dollars. He asked me
what I thought of it, and after I had pointed out his
mistake in making the handle of the hatchet twice
as thick as the tree, and in turning the head of the
hatchet around, so that George was cutting the tree
down with the hammer end, I asked him why he
foreshortened George's leg so as to make it look as if
his left foot was upon the mountain on the other side
of the river.”
“Did Mr. Barker take it kindly?" asked the
justice.
"Well, he looked a little glum-that's all. And

in the tree, and why he painted the guinea-pig with
horns, he said that it was not a guinea-pig, but a
cow; and that it was not in the tree, but in the
background. Then I said that, if I had been painting ·
George Washington, I should not have given him
the complexion of a salmon-brick, I should not have
given him two thumbs on each hand, and I should
have tried not to slue his right eye around so that
he could see around the back of his head to his
left ear. And Barker said, “Oh, wouldn't you?'
Sarcastic, your honour. And I said, “No I wouldn't';
and I wouldn't have painted oak-leaves on a cherry-
tree; and I wouldn't have left the spectator in
doubt as to whether the figure off by the woods
was a factory chimney, or a steamboat, or George
Washington's father taking a smoke.”
“Which was it?" asked the magistrate.
"I don't know. Nobody will ever know. So
Barker asked me what I'd advise him to do. And I
told him I thought his best chance was to abandon
the Washington idea, and to fix the thing up somehow
to represent 'The Boy who stood on the Burning
Deck. I told him he might paint the grass red to
represent the flames, and daub over the tree so's it
would look like the mast, and pull George's foot to
this side of the river so's it would rest somewhere on
the burning deck, and maybe he might reconstruct
the factory chimney, or whatever it was, and make it
the captain, while he could arrange the guinea-pig to
do for the captain's dog."

“Did he agree?"
“He said the idea didn't strike him. So then I
suggested that he might turn it into Columbus dis-
covering America. Let George stand for Columbus,
and the tree be turned into a native, and the hatchet
made to answer for a flag, while the mountain in the
background would answer for the rolling billows of
the ocean. He said he'd be hanged if it should. So
I mentioned that it might perhaps pass for the
execution of Mary Queen of Scots. Put George in
black for the headsman, bend over the tree and put
a frock on it for Mary, let the hatchet stand, and
work in the guinea-pig and the factory chimney as
mourners. Just as I had got the words out of my
mouth, Barker knocked me clean through the picture.
My head tore out Washington's near leg, and my
right foot carried away about four miles of the river.
We had it over and over on the floor for a while, and
finally Barker whipped. I am going to take the law
of him in the interests of justice and high art.”
So Barker was bound over, and Mr. Potts went
down to the office of the Spy to write up his
criticism.

ONLY A PIN.
ONLY a pin, yet it calmly lay
On the tufted floor in the light of day;
And it shone serenely fair and bright,
Reflecting back the noonday light.
Only a boy, yet he saw that pin,
And his face assumed a fiendish grin;
He stooped for a while, with look intent,
Till he and the pin alike were bent.
Only a chair, but upon its seat
A well-bent pin found safe retreat;
Nor had the keenest eye discerned
That heavenward its point was turned.
Only a man, but he chanced to drop
Upon that chair ; when, fizzy-bang-pop!
He leaped like a cork from out a bottle,
And opened wide his valve de throttle.
Only a yell, though an honest one,
It lacked the element of fun;
And boy and man, and pin and chair,
In wild confusion mingled there.

OUR NEW MINISTER.
WHEN the servant girl went to work for the family
in Congress Street, the lady of the house sat down
and told her that agents, book-pedlars, hat-rack men,
picture-sellers, ash-buyers, rag-men, and all that class
of people, must be met at the front door and coldly
repulsed ; and Sarah said she'd repulse them if she
had to break every broomstick in Detroit.
And she did. She threw the door open wide,
bluffed right up at 'em, and when she got through
talking, the cheekiest agent was only too glad to
leave. It got so after a while that pedlars marked
that house, and the door-bell never rang except for
company.
The other day, as the girl of the house was wiping
off the spoons, the bell rang. She hastened to the
door, expecting to see a lady, but her eyes encountered
a slim man, dressed in black and wearing a white
necktie. He was the new minister, and was going
round to get acquainted with the members of his
flock; but Sarah wasn't expected to know this.
“Ah-um-is-Mrs.-ah!”

better go before I call the dog."

and handbills and circulars. Come, I can't stand
here all day."

asked, as he backed off.

FATHER O'HIGGINS OUTDONE.
EARLY one fine morning, as Terence O'Fleary was
hard at work in his potato-garden, he was accosted
by his gossip, Mick Casey, who he perceived had his
Sunday clothes on.
“God's bud! Terry, man, what would you be
afther doing there wid them praties, an' Phelim

along, ma bochel ! sure the praties will wait?”
“Och! no," says Terry,“ I must dig on this ridge

fession to Father O'Higgins, who holds a stashin
beyont there at his own house."
“Bother take the stashin!” says Mick, “sure that
’ud wait too." But Terence was not to be persuaded.
Away went Mick to the berrin’; and Terence,
having finished “wid the praties," as he said, went
down to Father O'Higgins, where he was shown into
the kitchen, to wait his turn for confession. He had
not been long standing there, before the kitchen fire,
when his attention was attracted by a nice piece of
bacon, which hung in the chimney-corner. Terry
looked at it again and again, and wished the childer
“had it at home wid the praties."
“Murther alive!” says he, “will I take it? Sure

the priest can spare it, an' it would be a rare thrate
to Judy an' the gorsoons at home, to say nothin' iv
meself, who hasn't tasted the likes this many's the
day.” Terry looked at it again, and then turned
away, saying—“I won't take it—why wou'd I, an' it
not mine, but the priest's ? an' I'd have the sin iv it,
sure! I won't take it,” replied he, “an' it's nothin'
but the Ould Boy himself that's temptin' me! But
sure it's no harm to feel it, anyway," said he, taking
it into his hand, and looking earnestly at it; “Och !
it's a beauty; and why wouldn't I carry it home to
Judy and the childer ? An’ sure it won't be a sin
afther I confesses it !”
Well, into his great-coat pocket he thrust it: and
he had scarcely done so, when the maid came in and
told him that it was his turn for confession.
“Murther alive! I'm kilt and ruin'd, horse and
foot! now, joy, Terry; what'll I do in this quandary,
at all, at all? By gannies! I must thry an' make
the best of it, anyhow," says he to himself, and in
he went.
He knelt to the priest, told his sins, and was about
to receive absolution, when all at once he seemed to
recollect himself, and cried out-
“Och! stop-stop, Father O'Higgins, dear! for
goodness sake, stop! I have one great big sin to
tell yit; only, sir, I'm frightened to tell id, in the
regard of niver havin' done the like afore, sir, niver!"

to me.”

into his pocket.
“Give it to me!” said Father O'Higgins; “no,
certainly not; give it back to the owner of it.”
"Why, then, your Riverence, sir, I offered it to
him, and he wouldn't take id.”
“Oh! he wouldn't, wouldn't he?” said the priest ;
"then take it home, and eat it yourself, with the

“Thank your Riverence kindly," says Terence,
"an' I'll do that same immediately, plaize God; but

CONCERNING CHAMBERMAIDS.
By Mark Twain.
AGAINST all chambermaids, of whatsoever age or
nationality, I launch the curse of bachelordom!
Because :
They always put the pillows at the opposite end
of the bed from the gas-burner, so that while you
read and smoke before sleeping (as is the ancient
and honoured custom of bachelors) you have to hold
your book aloft, in an uncomfortable position, to keep
the light from dazzling your eyes.
When they find the pillows removed to the other
end of the bed in the morning they receive not the
suggestion in a friendly spirit; but, glorying in their
absolute sovereignty, and unpitying your helpless-
ness, they make the bed just as it was originally,
and gloat in secret over the pang their tyranny will
cause you.
Always after that, when they find you have trans-
posed the pillows, they undo your work, and thus
defy and seek to embitter the life that God has
given you.
If they cannot get the light in an inconvenient
position any other way, they move the bed.
If you pull your trunk out six inches from the

wall, so that the lid will stay up when you open it,
they always shove that trunk back again. They do
it on purpose.
If you want the spittoon in a certain spot, where
it will be handy, they don't, and so they move it.
They always put your other boots into inaccessible
places. They chiefly enjoy depositing them as far
under the bed as the wall will permit. It is because
this compels you to get down in an undignified atti-
tude and make wild sweeps for them in the dark with
the boot-jack, and swear.
They always put the match-box in some other
place. They hunt up a new place for it every day,
and put up a bottle, or other perishable glass thing,
where the box stood before. This is to cause you
to break that glass thing, groping in the dark, and
get yourself into trouble.
They are for ever and ever moving the furniture.
When you come in, in the night, you can calculate
on finding the bureau where the wardrobe was in
the morning. And when you go out in the morning,
if you leave the slop-bucket at the door and the
rocking-chair by the window, when you come in at
midnight, or thereabouts, you fall over that rocking-
chair, and you will proceed toward the window and
sit down in that slop-tub. This will disgust you.
They like that.
No matter where you put anything, they are not
going to let it stay there. They will take it and
move it the first chance they get. It is their nature.

THE ART OF ELOCUTION.
And, besides, it gives them pleasure to be mean and
contrary this way. They would die if they couldn't
be villains.
They always save up all the old scraps of printed
rubbish you throw on the floor and stack them up
carefully on the table, and start the fire with your
valuable manuscripts. If there is any one particular
old scrap that you are more down on than any other,
and which you are gradually wearing your life out
trying to get rid of, you may take all the pains you
possibly can in that direction, but it won't be of any
use, because they will always fetch that old scrap
back and put it in the same old place again every
time. It does them good.
And they use up more hair-oil than any six men.
If charged with purloining the same, they lie about
it. What do they care about a hereafter? Abso-
lutely nothing.
If you leave the key in the door for convenience
sake, they will carry it down to the office and give it
to the clerk. They do this under the vile pretence
of trying to protect your property from thieves; but
actually they do it because they want to make you
tramp back downstairs after it when you come home
tired, or put you to the trouble of sending a waiter
for it, which waiter will expect you to pay him
something. In which case I suppose the degraded
creatures divide.
They keep always trying to make your bed before
you get up, thus destroying your rest and inflicting

agony upon you; but after you get up, they don't
come any more till next day.
They do all the mean things they can think of,
and they do them just out of pure cussedness, and
nothing else.
Chambermaids are dead to every human instinct.
I have cursed them in behalf of outraged bachelor-
dom. They deserve it. If I can get a bill through
the Legislature abolishing chambermaids, I mean to
do it.

We were just settling down when he arrived, and
the very first night his servant came and knocked at

At last the troubles culminated one cold February
evening, and that trouble cost me fifty pounds, and
made Vidler my sworn enemy for life.
Binny and I were just having a quiet chat in the
sitting-room, and all was cosy, when suddenly I
sniffed. Then Binny sniffed. Then we both sniffed
together.
"What a smell of soot !” I exclaimed.

“It's that odious old Vidler's chimney smoking,"
said Binny. “Oh, Charlie, do let's move, they are
such disagreeable people. The old woman actually
made faces at me to-day as I sat by the window.”
At this moment there was a knock at the door, and
“Our Emma" appeared. Cook always calls her
“Our Emma," to distinguish her, I suppose, from the
next-door servant, whose name is Jane.
“Well, Emma?”
"Oh, if you please, mum, will you come down,
please?”
“ Is anything the matter?"
“No, mum, there's nothink the matter ; but I
made up a good fire, as you told me, in the dining-
room, and it will keep on a-roaring so."
“Why, you've set the chimney on fire!” I shouted.
“Well, sir, that's what cook says; but I don't think
it is.”
I ran downstairs to find that not only was the fire
roaring away, but great pats of burning soot were
tumbling down the chimney. I seized the salt-cellars
and emptied them on the fire. That seemed no
good; so calling to the maids to bring a couple of
pails, I had them filled and carried upstairs, climbed
the ladder, and got on the roof. “It will make a
horrible mess," I thought, as I looked at the smoke
pouring up from the long narrow stack. “But better
dirty a fender,” I continued aloud, “than pay five
pounds for a fire-engine.”
As I spoke I raised the pail of water and poured

it down the smoking chimney. Then I took a full
can from Emma, whose head appeared upon the
scene.
“No fire-engines to-night,” I chuckled ; and as a
rumbling, gurgling noise came up the chimney, I
poured down the second pailful and descended.
“How is the dining-room, Binny?" I asked, when
I got down.
"It's left off roaring, dear,” she replied; and on
going in, to my surprise I found the fire burning
brightly, while the roaring noise had ceased, and all
was beautiful and clean.
“Why, my dear Binny!” I exclaimed ; and then
the roaring noise began again-not in the chimney
this time, but at the front door, which somebody
seemed determined to batter down.
"I'll go, Emma," I said ; "it's the engine.” Going
to the door then I opened it cautiously, but only to
be driven in and followed by a hideous little object in
the shape of Vidler-round, fierce, blackened with
soot, drenched with water, and foaming at the mouth.
I was not afraid of him but of the dirt, as he chased
me into the dining-room, where I kept him at bay
with the legs of a chair.
“You atrocious scoundrel !” he panted, from the
midst of his strangely blackened face, as he tore with
sooty hand at his wet black shirt-front and white
kerseymere waistcoat. “You villain, this is one of
your cursed practical jokes; but I'll have an action-
I'll have an action!”

"Perhaps, sir, as plaintiff, you will explain upon
what grounds," I said blandly.
"Grounds, sir ! grounds! you smooth-tongued, in-
sulting blackguard! Why, sir, five minutes ago I was
standing, as is my wont, reading my paper and warm-
ing my back, when an avalanche, a cataract-a dirty
abominable fall of Niagara, sir, came rushing down
my chimney, sir, deluging me, my Turkey carpet and
my hearthrug, and putting out my fire. As soon as
I could recover from my astonishment, sir, I thrust
my head up the chimney, sir, and roared out to you
to cease, when, sir, a second avalanche came down,
and-and-hang it all, sir, just look at me!”
I did look, and he certainly was a guy.
“Now, sir, what does this mean?"
“Mean, sir," I replied, “well, I'm afraid I poured
the water down the wrong chimney."

THE FARMER'S BLUNDER.
WHILE on a visit to a relation in the celebrated city
of York I became acquainted with an honest farmer
in the neighbourhood, who, having resided there
from a youth, was respected, and admitted into the
society of most of the country gentlemen. He
was a constant visitor at the house of my uncle,
and his conversation, teeming with merry stories
which serve to delight the ear at the expense of
our sides, told in his simple, unadorned manner,
could not but render his society agreeable to me.
Honest old Farmer Burton had an only son, who
had reached the age of forty without entering into
the matrimonial state; he was, in fact, as true a
picture of a country bumpkin as ever graced a dung-
fork! One day, our discourse happening to turn
upon the said bumpkin, I expressed my surprise
that he should never have had the good fortune to
get married.
"Why," said the farmer, “it be not the fau't o' his
face, I reckon ; for he be as pratty a lad as here and
there be one ; ees, an' he ha' had his chances, by my
feekins! and had he been 'as cute as mysen, he
mought ha' had a buxom lass with no little stock
o' money either.” This excited my curiosity, and
I requested the farmer to acquaint me with the

particulars, which he did as follows: “You mun
know that my son used to work wi' me in the field;
that is, he drived plough, sowed and reaped, and all
other cultural works loike; and a steady, hard-work-
ing lad he wur too; till all on a sudden he becomed
lazy loike, and wouldn't work at all. So I couldn't
tell what to make on't; if I snubbed un 'twur all the

“Why, I dosen't know disactly; he, he, he! but

thy sex; thy eyes of diamond light have pierced my
heart's core; thy cheeks are carnation red, thy lips
like coral, thy alabaster skin! thy teeth, good lack !
and graceful mien, have scorched and burned up all
the particles of my heart! deign then to dispense
thy passions to me alone, thy faithful swain, who is
this moment ready to espouse thee, thou irresistible
and adorable woman.”
"Well,” said I, “and did he say so?”.
“Why no," said the farmer; "a sad blunder he
made on it, all thro' his being no scholard; and lost
both his sweetheart Molly and her money into the
bargain.
"When he got to Molly Grundy's, he dropt on
both his knees, scratch'd his head, and thus began :-
“Oh! Molly Grundy, feather ha' sent I here to
dress ye, Oh! thou most unbearable of my sex! Thy
eyes damn'd light and pierced my heart sore !—thy
cheeks are dangnation red !-thy lips like mackerel !
--thy plaster skin, thy teeth so black ! and hateful and
mean! have scorched and burnt up all the articles
of my heart; feign then to expend thy passion on me
alone, thy hateful swine, who is this moment ready
to expose thee, thou detestable and deplorable 'ooman!'
“Molly Grundy no sooner heard his speech than
she took up a long hair broom, wopped poor Robin
out of the house, and he has never been able to get
a wife, or had courage enough to make love to
another woman since.”

HER GLOVE.
A ROMANCE
By S. J. ADAIR Fitz-GERALD.
Ye Lover hath Returned from seeing his Sweete-Hearte Home after ye
Balle, and he gropeth about in his Syttinge Room for ye Matches.
He Soliloquises.
Now that's odd! I could have sworn I placed my
matches here;
That Mrs. Brown's been pilfering again I greatly fear.
Perhaps I have one in my vest, but I must quickly
see,
Or else against the furniture I'll bark my shin or
knee!
Why, what's this? A glove, I swear, just peeping by
my tie,
Her glove! she must have placed it there when we
said “Good-bye."
He Rapturises.
Her tiny glove, I do declare
It even yet is warm!
I think I feel her fingers there-
At least, I feel their form.

And when she kissed “Good-bye” to-night
How sweet, how sweet she looked !
Her eyes they danced with Love's delight-
Well, well, it's clear I'm booked !
Her glove! sweet glove! the glove I love !
I'll wear it next my heart;
And when I'm dead they'll see the glove
From which I'd never part !
I kiss the palm and think it hers,
I'll kiss the fingers too;
How great's my love! it beats and whirrs-
Alas ! how small's my screw!
The buttons are to me fine pearls,
I kiss them o'er and o'er ;
O sweetest, dearest, best of girls,
I'll love thee evermore !
The moon is up-an omen clear,
No need for matches now;
For we're a match, I and my dear-
I s'pose her pa will row !
But let me kiss it once again
Ere to the light I go;
It is so rich, this lover's pain,
I seem to feel Love's glow!
Now come, wee glove, into the light,
Before the moon has flown,
And on thee all my Love I'll plight-
Why, dash it, it's my own!

THE SNEEZING MAN.
BY WARD M. FLORENCE.
KIND friends, your attention I ask,
Though I'm almost ashamed to be seen
By a crowd of such wise-looking heads,
For fear of your calling me “green”;
As stern fate has so harshly ordained
That whenever my wish is to please
All the ladies who gaze upon me
I'm sure to burst out in a SNEEZE. (Sneeze.)
My cradle was rocked by a nurse
Whose sneezing was worse than my own,
And had it not been as it was,
This curse I would never have known;
I believe in my soul to this day
That she brought it from over the seas,
Where people take pleasure, they say,
In a loud-sounding, horrible sneeze. (Sneeze.)
When boyhood broke forth in its prime
With school-games, all happy and gay,
I had to stand by and look on,
Without ever daring to play ;

But all of the rest of the boys
Would kiss the bright girls at their ease,
And leave me a-standing just so,
To comfort myself with—a sneeze. (Sneeze.)
This trouble still followed me on
Till I grew up a good-looking man,
And had money and lands of my own,
And horses—a beautiful span;
But whenever a-courting I'd go
My hopes would give way by degrees,
For all that I ever could do
Was to sit in the corner and-sneeze. (Sneeze.)
One eve I was taking a drive
With a lady whose beauty was rare,
And I managed to ask her at last
What she thought of the cool evening (sneeze) air;
She said, “'Tis delightfully grand,
There is such a ponderous breeze".
As I turned aside with my nose
To indulge in a horrible sneeze. (Sneeze.)
I then became bold after this,
And thought of the life I had led ;
Its loneliness seemed so forlorn
That I asked this young damsel to wed;
And while my heart throbbed for reply
Came on this infernal disease,
And ere she could answer my words
The hills had re-echoed a sneeze. (Sneeze.)

She said, “I should like to be yours,
And live far away in the vale ;
But the hair might be blown off my head,
As your sneezing doth make such a gale.”
I whispered no further of love,
But drove her straight home as you please,
And just as I turned from the door
I wished her “good-night”-with a sneeze. (Sneeze.)
Now, friends, I would pray you be warned
At the fate of a poor fellow-man,
And leave off this taking of snuff
Just as soon as you possibly can;
And when, in this battle of life,
You're desirous of raising a breeze,
Don't blow on your nose like a horn,
And startle the world with a "SNEEZE.”

HOW TOM SAVED THE TRAIN.
By GEORGE BIRDSEYE.
AROUND the stove at the village inn
The usual company were seated,
To drink and smoke and chaff and grin
At tales too long to be repeated.
A moment Silence held her reign,
And then a voice her realms invaded :
“Tom, tell us how you saved the train !”
Tom was not loath to be persuaded.
But first a horn of applejack
He put away preparatory;
Then 'gainst the wall he braced his back,
And thus began his startling story:
“Upon the track, and on the ties,
One clear night I was homeward hieing,
When, 'cross the rails, before my eyes,
I saw, O heavens! a great beam lying.
" It shone, a ghastly body there;
All ways at once my feelings drifted.
Although it seemed so light, I swear
I hadn't then the power to lift it.

HOW TOM SAVED THE TRAIN. 137
“A sudden rumble and a roar
Struck frightfully upon my hearing ;
Louder and louder than before-
I knew the night express was nearing.
“With helplessness I weaker grew,
And, fainting, on my knees was falling.
What should I do--what could I do-
To avert disaster so appalling ?
“On me it came! As in a dream
I thought I saw the dead and dying.
I sprang between the track and beam-
And on, unharmed, the train went flying !”.
A moment's hush. You might have heard
The dew drop. One said: “I can't see, sir,
Just how that blamed old beam was stirred.”
"I didn't touch it; it touched me, sir.”
“But,” he persisted, “ tell this much;
I want the answer that I go for :
You couldn't lift, you didn't touch,
Pray how, then, did the train get over ?”
Said Tom, as toward the door he went :
“Why, don't you see? Now don't get mad, O!
It was a moonbeam that I meant;
I sprang between and left my shadow !”

A CATASTROPHE.
By PELEG ARKWRIGHT.
No human being
Who saw that sight
But felt a shudder
Of pale affright.
He sat in a window
Three stories high,
A little baby
With no one nigh.
A stranger saw him,
And stopped to stare,
A crowd soon gathered
To watch him there.
A gleam-a flutter !
In airy fight
Came past the window
A butterfly bright.
From fields of clover
And perfumed air,
Wayfaring insect,
What brought you there?

The baby saw it,
And eagerly
Reached out to catch it,
Crowing with glee.
With fat pink fingers
Reached out—and fell !
The awful horror,
No tongue can tell.
Poor little baby,
So sweet and bright!
Pale faces quivered,
And lips grew white;
Weak women fainted,
Strong men grew weak,
Up rose one woman's
Heart-piercing shriek.
Hurrah for the awning
Upon the fly!
It caught the youngster
And tossed him high.
The bounce prodigious
Made baby scowl ;
He caught his breath, sir,
And set up a howl.
All blessed the awning
That had no flaw;
But a madder baby
You never saw.

TOM AND NED.
DEAR Ned, no doubt you'll be surprised
When you receive and read this letter !
I've railed against the marriage state-
But then, you see, I knew no better,
I met a lovely girl out here;
Her manner is—well, very winning;
We're soon to be-well, things to clear,
I'll tell you all from the beginning.
I went to ask her out to ride
Last Wednesday—it was perfect weather ;
She said she couldn't possibiy:
The servants had gone off together-
(Hibernians always rush away,
At cousins' funerals to be looking)-
Pies must be made, and she must stay,
She said, to do that branch of cooking.
“Oh, let me help you,” then I cried;
“I'll be a cooker, too; how jolly!”
She laughed and answered, with a smile :
“ All right, but you'll repent your folly ;

And good hard work you'll have to grapple,
So sit down there and don't you stir,
But take this knife and pare that apple.”
She rolled her sleeves above her arm-
That lovely arm, so plump and rounded ;
Outside, the morning sun shone bright,
Inside, the dough she deftly pounded;
Her little fingers sprinkled flour
And rolled the pie-crust up in masses :
I passed a most delightful hour
'Mid butter, sugar, and molasses.
With deep reflection her sweet eyes
Gazed on each pot and pan and kettle ;
She sliced the apples, filled her pies,
And then the upper crust she'd settle.
Her rippling waves of golden hair
In one great coil were slightly twisted;
But locks would break out, here and there,
And curl about where'er they listed.
And then her sleeve came down, and I
Fastened it up-her hands were doughy;
Oh, it did take the longest time-
Her arm, Ned, was so fair and snowy;
She blushed, and trembled, and looked shy,
Her arch lips looked so red that I-
Somehow that made me all the bolder :
Well, found her head upon my shoulder.

MY MOTHER-IN-LAW.
By Hugh HOWARD.
I HAVE dropped from the ranks of respectable men,
I have ceased to be counted with those
Who even attempt to perform, now and then,
What their best inclinations propose,
I have bowed all my manhood contemptibly low;
I'm a lamb in an eagle's fierce claw;
I am sunk in the depths of dejection, for oh!
I have married my mother-in-law !
She is nearly six feet in her stature superb,
She is stout in proportion besides,
And her temper no earthly coercion can curb;
All restraint it at once overrides.
From the moment I wedded sweet Mary, indeed,
With increasing depression I saw
That till death interfered I should be but a reed
In the hands of my mother-in-law.
She assumes all control of my household affairs;
She discharges my servants at will;
She congeals me to stone by her Gorgon-like stares;
She revises my grocery bill !

ART OF ELOCUTION.
She involves me in quarrels by doubting my facts,
Till the statements I meekly withdraw;
And my children, to me disrespectful, are wax
In the hands of my mother-in-law.
And alas ! she considers dear Mary was born
But to breathe by her special decree,
And be dosed with all phases of physic forlorn,
From blue pill to chamomile tea!
She deprives her of sweets and ordains wheaten grits;
She subjects her to steaks nearly raw;
And in equal degree her digestion and wits
Are destroyed by my mother-in-law.
For myself, she asserts, if I stay out till ten,
That I've decency grossly defied,
And recalls her late spouse as a model of-men-
Is it strange the unhappy wretch died ?
Poor Prometheus once, as old chronicles tell,
An insatiate vulture did gnaw;
Yet I fancy that bird was a mere bagatelle
When compared with my mother-in-law.
But of course, as you're doubtless aware, I'm a fool
To submit to her sway as I do;
I should certainly end her detestable rule
By a bold and inflexible coup !
So I've half a mind some day to pour down my throat
Many drinks that shall conquer my awe,
And afford me Dutch courage to take off my coat
And to wallop my mother-in-law !

HE NEVER TOLD A LIE.
I saw him standing in the crowd --
A comely youth, and fair !
There was a brightness in his eye,
A glory in his hair!
I saw his comrades gaze on him-
His comrades, standing by;
I heard them whisper each to each,
“He never told a lie!”
I looked in wonder on that boy,
As he stood there, so young ;
To think that never an untruth
Was uttered by his tongue.
I thought of all the boys I'd known-
Myself among the fry—
And knew of none that one could say :
“He never told a lie !"
I gazed upon that youth with awe
That did enchain me long ;
I had not seen a boy before
So perfect and so strong.

For boys to answer right:
“How did you tear those pantaloons ?”
“My son! what caused the fight?”
“Who left the gate ajar last night?”
“Who bit the pumpkin-pie?"
What boy could answer all of these,
And never tell a lie?
I proudly took him by the hand,
My words with praise were rife;
I blessed that boy who never told
A falsehood in his life ;
I told him I was proud of him.
A fellow standing by
Informed me that that boy was dumb
Who never told a lie !

THE OLD HUNDRED:

HALF a bar, half a bar,
Half a bar onward !
Into an awful ditch.
Choir and precentor hitch,
Into a mess of pitch,
They led the Old Hundred.
Trebles to right of them,
Tenors to left of them,
Basses in front of them
Bellowed and thundered.
Oh ! that precentor's look,
When the sopranos took
Their own time and hook
From the Old Hundred.
Screeched all the trebles here,
Boggled the tenors there,
Raising the parson's hair,
While his mind wandered :
Theirs not to reason why
This psalm was pitched too high ;
Theirs but to gasp and cry
Out the Old Hundred.

Stormed they with shout and yell,
Not wise they sang, nor well,

While all the church wondered.
Dire the precentor's glare,
Flashed his pitchfork in air,
Sounding fresh keys to bear
Out the Old Hundred.
Swiftly he turned his back,
Reached he his hat from rack,
Then from the screaming pack
Himself he sundered.
Tenors to right of him,
Trebles to left of him,
Discords behind him
Bellowed and thundered.
Oh, the wild howls they wrought;
Right to the end they fought !
Some tune they sang, but not,
Not the Old Hundred.

THAT WAS ALL.
He put his arm around me,
He squeezed me once or twice;
I didn't say a word, you know,
Because it was so nice.
'Twas evening, by the seaside ;
The music, low and sweet,
Came trembling like the moonshine
In shadows at our feet.
He held his arm around me,
I stood so close to him
His moustache touched my forehead,
· And all the world was dim.
Ah, that ecstatic pressure,
That touch of heart to heart:
The sweetest thing in Nature,
The tenderest in Art.
No whispered words were spoken,
We thought not of the time;
We needed no expression
For rapture so sublime.
What's that? Was he proposing?
I wouldn't marry Paul.
Of course he wasn't. Both of us
Were waltzing : that was all,

THE SHERIFF'S MISTAKE.
(Adapted from Max ADELER.)
THE Sheriff of our State has a singular capacity
for perpetrating dreadful blunders. Over in the
town of Nockamixon one of the churches last year
called a clergyman named the Rev. Joseph Striker.
In the same place, by a most unfortunate coincidence,
resides also a prize-fighter named Joseph Striker, and
rumours were afloat a few weeks ago that the latter
Joseph was about to engage in a contest with a New
Jersey pugilist for the championship. Our Sheriff
considered it his duty to warn Joseph against the
infraction of the laws, and so he determined to call
upon the professor of the art of self-defence. Un-
happily, in inquiring the way to the pugilist's house,
somebody misunderstood the Sheriff, and sent him
to the residence of the Rev. Joseph Striker, of whom
he had never heard. When Mr. Striker entered the
room in answer to the summons, the Sheriff said to
him familiarly, “Hello, Joe! How are you?"
Mr. Striker was amazed at this address, but he
politely said “Good morning.”
“ Joe,” said the Sheriff (throwing his leg lazily
over the arm of the chair), “ I came round here to

see you about that 'mill' with Harry Dingus that
they're all talking about. I want you to understand
that it can't come off anywheres around here. You
know very well it's against the law, and I ain't
agoing to have it.”
“Mill! Mill, sir ? What on earth do you mean?
I do not own any mill, sir ; against the law! I do
not understand you, sir.”
“Now, see here, Joe,” said the Sheriff, biting off a
piece of tobacco and looking very wise, “that won't
go down with me. It's pretty thin, you know. I
know well enough that you've put up a thousand
dollars on that little affair, and that you've got the
whole thing fixed, with Bill Martin for referee. I
know you're going down to Pea Patch Island to
have it out, and I'm not going to allow it. I'll
arrest you as sure as a gun if you try it on, now
mind me.”
“Really, sir, there must be some mistake about "
“Oh, no, there isn't ; your name's Joe Striker,
isn't it?"
“My name is Joseph Striker, certainly."
“I knew it,” said the Sheriff, spitting on the
carpet, “and you see I've got this thing dead to
rights. It shan't come off; and I'm doing you a
favour in blocking the game, because Harry'd curl
you all up in any way if I let you meet him. I
know he's the best man, and you'd just lose your
money and get bunged besides; so you take my
advice now, and get. You'll be sorry if you don't.”

“I do not know what you are referring to. Your
remarks are incomprehensible, but your tone very
offensive; and if you have any business with me,
I'd thank you to state it at once.”
"Joe, you play it pretty well. Anybody'd think
you was as innocent as a lamb. But it won't work,
Joseph-it won't work, I tell you; I've got a duty to
perform, and I'm going to do it; and I pledge you
my word, if you and Dingus don't knock off now,
I'll arrest you and send you up for ten years, as sure
as death. I'm in earnest about it.”
“What on earth do you mean, sir ?”.
“Oh, don't you go to putting on any airs about it.
Don't you try any strutting before me, or I'll put
you under bail this very minute. Let's see, how
long were you in jail last time? Two years, wasn't
it? Well, you go fighting with Dingus and you'll
get ten years, sure!”
“You are certainly crazy- "
“I don't see what you want to stay at that business
for, anyhow. Here you are, in a snug home, where
you might live in peace and keep respectable. But
no, you must associate yourself with low characters,
and go to stripping yourself naked and jumping
into a ring to get your nose blooded and your head
swelled, and your body hammered to a jelly; and
all for what? Why, for a championship! It's
ridiculous. What good will it do you if you're
champion ? Why don't you try to be honest and
decent, and let prize-fighting alone ?"

“This is the most extraordinary conversation I
ever listened to. You evidently take me for a— "
"I take you for Joe Striker; and if you keep on
I'll take you to jail. Now, you tell me who's got
those stakes and who's your trainer, and I'll put an
end to the whole thing."
“You seem to imagine that I'm a pugilist. Let
me inform you, sir, that I am a clergyman.”
.“ Joe, it's too bad for you to lie that way—too
bad, indeed!”
“But I am a clergyman, sir-pastor of the church
of St. Sepulchre. Look! here is a letter in my
pocket addressed to me.”
“You don't really mean— to say-that-that-
you're a preacher named-Joe-Joseph Striker ?”.
“Certainly I am. Come upstairs and I'll show
you a barrel-full of my sermons."
“Well, if this don't beat Nebuchadnezzar ! this is

What an ass I've made of myself! I don't know
how to apologise; but if you want to kick me down
the front steps, just kick away. I'll bear it like an

Then the Sheriff retired unkicked, and Mr. Striker
went upstairs to finish his Sunday sermon.

A “BLACK” STORY.
DURING a temporary lull in business two bootblacks
-one black and the other white-were standing at
the corner of a street doing nothing, and doing it
very well, when the white bootblack proposed that
he should black the boots of the black bootblack.
Of course, the black bootblack was perfectly will-
ing to have his boots blacked by the white bootblack,
so the white bootblack set to work to black the boots
of the black bootblack.
Now when the white bootblack had blacked one
of the boots of the black bootblack until it shone in
a manner which would have done credit to any boot-
black, this white bootblack, who agreed to black the
boots of the black bootblack, declined to black the
other boot of the black bootblack unless he should
add ten cents to the amount that the white bootblack
had made in blacking other men's boots during the
day. This the black bootblack declined to do, saying
that it was plenty good enough for a black bootblack
to have one boot blacked, and didn't care a hang
whether the white bootblack blacked the other boot
or not. This roused the passion of the white boot-
black, and he proceeded to vent his ire by stamping
upon the blacked boot of the black bootblack. This

roused the passion of the black bootblack, and he
proceeded to vent his ire by blacking the face of the
white bootblack with the boot that the white boot-
black had blacked. A fight ensued, and the Society
of Bootblacks, afterwards convened, characterised the
conduct of the black and white bootblacks as one of
the blackest affairs in the pages of the bootblack
history.

HOME, SWEET HOME!
(From the "Detroit Free Press.”)
The household goods of a ruined millionaire were
being sold at auction, and a fashionable assembly
of bidders were present. The auctioneer came to a
handsome grand square piano, and as he opened it,
he observed that the maker's catalogue price for the
instrument was fourteen hundred dollars. Then he
invited anyone present to try the instrument, so that
all might hear its tone.
“Please come forward and play something, some-
one-anyone,” he urged, noticing nobody seemed
inclined to accept the invitation.
At this second call there was a stir near the door,
and then a man advanced -a man who seemed
strangely out of place among the elegantly-attired
people assembled in that grand parlour. It was a
ragged, soiled tramp, on whose face hardship and
dissipation had left their imprints.
A murmur of astonishment and disgust ran round
the room. How came such a creature there? What
right had he in that room with decent people? How
did he gain admittance ?
The faultlessly-attired men fell back as the tramp
approached, and the women drew aside their skirts,
as if the touch of such a being were contamination.

laised.
Some looked around for the auctioneer's assistants,
and one man half lifted his cane as if to strike the
vagabond.
“Put him out.”
The words were uttered by more than one pair
of lips.
Heedless of the looks or words of those around,
the tramp walked-or rather staggered—toward the
piano. His step was that of a drunken man, but
his cheeks were sunken and pallid, as if hunger
gnawed at his vitals, and his eyes gleamed with
a wild unnatural light-a light that caused the
auctioneer to shiver and fall back with a hand half
upraised.
Without a word the vagrant seated himself at the
piano, and his fingers touched the ivory keys. For
a moment he seemed to hesitate, his fingers wander-
ing aimlessly, yet producing a few soft and harmonious
notes. Then, of a sudden, a burst of melody came
from the piano-a flood of music that thrilled the
souls of all who heard. It was Beethoven's grandest
march, and it was rendered by a master musician.
Never before in that magnificent parlour was such
music heard. Could it be the ragged tramp who
was playing?
Amazed, stricken dumb and motionless by what
they saw and heard, the people who had gathered
there stared and listened, holding their breath while
their ears drank in the soul-intoxicating strains
conjured from the faultless instrument by the wizard
musician in rags. The march ended, but the flood of

music still poured from the piano. Beethoven, Mozart,
Wagner, Liszt-the strange man knew them all, and
their best work he rendered with a master's touch.
“Wonderful! Amazing!”
The enthralled listeners looked into each other's
faces, and whispered the words
.“Who is he?”
No one could answer, but one thought he must be
some great musician masquerading.
Listen! He is improvising now. How sweet his
strain! Soft and low, yet full of joy and sunshine,
it flows on and on like a laughing, dancing brook.
Slowly a touch of sadness creeps into the melody.
It is like the gentle fall of summer rain on a new-
made grave-it is like the faintly-heard sobbing of a
mother as she bends above the dead face of her first-
born. It moves the heart of many a woman as she
listens, and more than one pair of eyes are dim with
unbidden tears.
At length comes the sweetest, saddest, grandest
tune ever composed—“Home, Sweet Home.” All
else is forgotten now. One of the women is sobbing
softly in the depths of her handkerchief. Softer and
softer, slower and slower, the strain is sinking-dying.
(It is like the last effort of a soul passing from earth.
Finally it ceases, and then the tramp musician sinks
forward on the instrument and remains motionless.
A sigh runs round the room. The auctioneer touches
the tramp on the shoulder. The vagabond does not
stir. They lift the nerveless body and look into his
face. He has gone home.

AN ORIENTAL LEGEND,
By Ross DEFORRIS.
FORRIS.
A KING grown old in glory and renown
Of goodly deeds, a wholesome reign to crown,
Feeling the years turn white upon his head,
Thought of his end, and to himself he said :
“Three sons I have, strong types of sturdy youth,
Bred in all honour, manliness and truth;
Honest and brave are they, I know it well,
But traits there are in all that none may tell.
I'll test them, therefore, for I fain would know
Which one shall rule the best when I shall go.”
Thereon he sent a slave to call his sons
Into his presence. Strong and manly ones
They surely were, to glad a father's sight,
And mind him of his springtime's virile might.
To whom the king : “My sons, the time draws near
When I, thy sire, shall be no longer here,
And I would know which of you I may trust
To wield the sceptre when my hands are dust;
And to that end I make thee this request,
Which of my three sons loves his father best?”

Then spake the eldest : “ Sire, my love for thee
Is deeper, broader, greater than the sea,
Vast as it is, that wets thy kingdom's shore.
Such is my love for thee, my sire, and more.”
The second then : “My father and my king,
There is not any yet created thing
In the whole universe, below, above,
To mark the scope and measure of my love."
The youngest simply said, “I cannot tell
Thee more than this, I love my father well.”
The king dismissed them with a tender word,
And sate and pondered well that he had heard ;
Then called his Minister and to him spake :
“My lord, a pilgrimage I fain would make
To far-famed Mecca. That I may atone
For sins unpardoned, I will go alone,
Barefooted and bareheaded ; and if I
By Allah shall be called upon to die
While on this pilgrimage, 'tis my command,
That my three sons together rule the land.”
A year went by, and yellow were the leaves,
The ripened grain was gathered into sheaves,
And all made ready for the harvest sport,
When through the kingdom-city, camp, and court,
Seaport and hamlet—the sad news was sped,
That the wise ruler and just king was dead.
Loved as a monarch tender, brave and true,
His people mourned him deeply as his due.
His sons were told the words the king had said,
And reigned together in their father's stead.

The calendar had marked another year,
And on the drooping stalk the full-grown ear
Through golden husk and silken tassel showed,
When wearily along the dusty road
A beggar slowly moved towards the town,
Which reached at last, outside the gate sate down,
And rested. Suddenly his thoughts were bent
Upon a man near by with garments rent,
Who sighed, and wept, and beat upon his breast,
And ever made this moan, “I loved him best.”
“Friend,” said the beggar, “ tell, if I may know,
What is the cause and secret of thy woe;
Allah hath certain cure for every ill ;
Thine may He soften!” For a moment still
The other sate; then, with fresh tears, he said :
“Great is my loss. I mourn the king that's dead.
Ah! never more shall men see such a one:
My father he: I was his oldest son.”
And then he beat once more upon his breast,
And rent his clothes, and cried, “ I loved him best.”
The beggar sighed. “Such love must Allah prize.
Thy brothers ? Mourn they also in this wise ? "
“Not so," the mourner said. “To me in age
The nearest quickly did his grief assuage:
With horses and hounds his hours are spent in sport,
To the great shame and sorrow of the Court.
The youngest bears the pains and cares of State,
Works out our father's plans; to low and great
Meteth out justice with impartial hand,
And is beloved and honoured in the land.”

The beggar left the son on grief intent,
And straightway to the Court his footsteps bent,

Cried, in a voice that made the arches ring,
“Hear ye, my people! As I am your king,

Go to my youngest son, and him alone!
Son of my soul, I fold thee to my breast,
Who doth his father's work loves him the best.”

Which on the silence fell, i
Ringing a joyful pæan?—'Tis Damian's marriage bell !
No, no! the tone has changed ; 'tis Damian's funeral
knell !
Who says 'twas by the hand of Damian's wife he died
Speaks what is false, for Damian slew himself
When to his wife he lied.
Sometimes I think that weeks and months
Or even years have sped ;
Sometimes I think it was but yestereve
I saw him in this very room,
A low and base-born creature by his side;

I saw him place within her hand—my gold-
The cursèd golden coins
Which raised him to a princely rank-
The gold which purchased costly baubles
To string about her neck, and dazzle him
With myriad, glittering, mocking eyes.
He was so wondrous fair to look upon-
How could I dream the beauteous casket
Encased so black a heart ?
His stature was of regal grace and dignity-
A form whose symmetry was so divine,
Apollo might have envied :
With brow and chin, which, in their classic outline,
Marked perfection's marble gods,
Created and defined by master hands of art :
His hair, a silken waving mass,
Was flecked with tints of Nature's gold ;
And eyes of sapphire blue,
That brimmed with tears of sympathy,
Or beamed with liquid glow of beatific life!
But all his beauty, charm, and grace,
Were marred by that one fatal stream
Of pauper's blood that tarnished in his veins
And blazoned forth his gutter birth-
The scum and offal of a city's populace.
And I had dared to thrust
This ill-starred weed—this parasite of royal blood,
Into the sacred precincts of a royal court !

With silvery hair, and eyes
That feasted on me as I passed.

But step inside and take a seat, sir, such a one as you

Switchmen's huts are rather roughish, not the
daintiest of places;
Kind of lonesome little homesteads where it's seldom

Venture in, sir; still you're welcome. Well, it
happened in this way:
Engineer aboard the“ Dolphin,” working on the night
relay,
I was scheduled on the west-bound limited and fast
express;
Held a record I was proud of. “Always up to time,”
unless
Such a thing as breakdowns stopped us. To continue
on that night,
Up to time we sped along well, everything was
running light;
On the single track we'd travelled maybe thirty miles

Rails are spread; I seized the lever, shut off steam

Groaned to God for wife and children, steeled my
heart, awaited death.
On we tore with thund'rous clatter; Bill, the fireman,
then jumped ;
Still I held on, duty bade me on her side the
“Dolphin ” dumped.
Over rolled she down th' embankment; ne'er can I
forget the sight
As I crawled out scalded, bleeding, saw the wreck,
the frenzied fright.
Quick as flash it dawned upon me that the east-
bound train was due,
Snatching lantern from the “Dolphin” o'er the track I
madly flew
Till my strength gave out; exhausted down I sank
upon the track,
With my left arm dangling limply in an agonizing
wrack.
Seconds seemed as long-drawn hours while I quivered
in my pain,
Staring into utter darkness, waiting for that east-
bound train.
While I stanched that helpless left arm, fainter
growing from my wound,
Fainter, fainter life seemed ebbing--then I heard the

Flesh and blood are only human; nature was
succumbing, when
Rushed the burning, searing thought, as I cried out
in hoarse affright:
“Red for dạnger.” is the signal, my white light

Weakly tottering to my feet, again I fell ere I could
wave
E’en my white light; seemed that nothing, nothing
could that east-bound save.
Then in numbed despair as I lay, nearer, nearer came
she speeding;
Flashed the thought of bandaged kerchief, white
ere I had stanched my bleeding.
“Crimson dyed it must be,” cried I, as I tore it off
my wound;
Mad with terror, quick I threw it o'er my white
light, then I swooned.
Nothing further I remembered, but they told me
afterward
When they saw the white light flash red 'twas too
late by some two yards,
For they found me lying senseless underneath the
east-bound train,
Just outside the track I'd scrambled as I fainted in
my pain,
With my maimed arm lying helpless, crushed and
mangled on the rail.

A LONG, bare ward in the hospital ;
A dying girl in the narrow bed ;
A nurse, whose footsteps lightly fall,
Soothing softly that restless head.
Slain by the man she learned to love,
Beaten, murdered, and flung away;
None beheld it but God above
And she who bore it. And there she lay.
“A little drink of water, dear?”
Slowly the white lips gasp and sip.
“Let me turn you over, so you can hear,
While I let the ice on your temple drip.”
A look of terror disturbs her face ;
Firm and silent those pale lips close;
A stranger stands in the nurse's place:
“Tell us who hurt you, for no one knows.”
A
A glitter of joy is in her eye;
Faintly she whispers : “Nobody did.”
And one tear christens the loving lie
From the heart in that wounded bosom hid.

“Nobody did it!” she says again ;
“Nobody hurt me!” Her eyes grow dim;
But in that spasm of mortal pain
She says to herself: “ I've saved you, Jim !"
Day by day, as the end draws near,
To gentle question or stern demand,
Only that one response they hear,
Though she lift to Heaven her wasted hand.
“Nobody hurt me!” They see her die,
The same word still on her latest breath;
With a tranquil smile she tells her lie,
And glad goes down to the gates of death.
Beaten, murdered, but faithful still,
Loving above all wrong and woe,
If she has gone to a world of ill,
Where, O saint, shall we others go ?
Even, I think, that evil man
Has hope of a better life in him,
When she so loved him her last words ran :
“Nobody hurt me! I've saved you, Jim !”

AN EPISODE IN THE LIFE OF AN
ACTOR,
By Roy LESLIE.
SAY, “pards," did you see the ticket of my coat that
I pawned at Lipman's last spring?
I'll have to “shoot” this summer-suit 'til the birds
shall once more sing.
'Twas pretty cold last night, pards, when we came
home from the show ;
There's many an actor in the town who had no
place to go.
I don't pity a bit the single men, but those in
married life;
'Tis hard for “ Pompey” to go home with nothing for
· his wife;
His little darling may be sick, and no fire in the
room;
But he cheers himself by thinking that a date he
may get soon.
The morning sun has just arose, the air is clear and
cold,
And the actor goes forth into the street with step
that's fearless, bold,

“And see if Billy, who keeps bar at Henck's, has
a letter on the shelf ;
I expect one to-day from B. C. Hart, to lead in
The Bloodless Stain.
A postal-card? Thank you, Billy. "No opening-

His poor heart sank within his breast when he read
that postal-card,
And he thought of the hungry ones at home-indeed,
it seemed too hard !
There was a time, in days now past, when of "dates."
there was no end,
And he prayed within his very soul that Providence
might send
Some news whereby he could get work, his family
alone to save,
For he fancied that in the far-away he saw a pauper's
grave.
He walked down Vine Street “all broke up”-a
ship thrown off its keel-
Trusting some pard to meet, and raise a stamp to
buy the morning meal.
“My wife and child they both must eat, although I
should go without.”
“Good morning, Frank. Why, what's the matter ?
You're not looking half so stout."
“Good morning, Jim. How do you do?" and the poor

For here was a man he took out of “the hole” in
his palmy days gone by.
Dame Fortune had smiled upon his friend, and he
told his wants with pain;
“I'll see you in an hour," he replied, but he never
saw him again.
Helplessly crushed, he .wandered on till he reached
his barren home
A little room up in an attic. He found his child
alone.
Its ma had just gone out, she said, to pawn her
wedding ring-
The last thing of value that they owned was sold for
bread to bring.
The careworn mother soon returned with a little
store of food :
“Cheer up, dear husband, trust in God, and shake
off this gloomy mood.”
She tried to rouse his saddened heart, in which
anguish sore held reign;
But the same illusion would spring up: "No opening
-write again!”
Another day had passed and gone, and they trusted
all to fate;
A knock! “A letter, husband dear.” “Name your
terms and date !”
Snatched at last from starvation's door, he kissed his
only love;
They knelt and gave their gracious thanks to the
God who dwells above.

EUGENE ARAM'S DEFENCE.
(Adapted from the novel by LORD Lytton.)
“My lord, I know not whether it is of right, or through
some indulgence of your lordship, that I am allowed
the liberty at this bar to attempt a defence, incapable
and uninstructed as I am to speak. Since, while I
see so many eyes upon me fixed with attention and
filled with I know not what expectancy, I labour, not
with guilt, my lord, but with perplexity. For, being
wholly unacquainted with law, and the customs of
the bar, I fear I shall be so little capable of speaking
with propriety, that it might reasonably be expected
to exceed my hope, should I be able to speak at all.
“I have heard, my lord, the indictment read,
wherein I find myself charged with the highest of
human crimes.
"My lord, the tenor of my life contradicts this
indictment. Who can look back over what is known
of my former years, and charge me with one vice-
one offence? No! I concerted not schemes of
fraud – projected no violence - injured no man's
property or person. My days were honestly laborious
-my nights intensely studious. This egotism is not
presumptuous—is not unreasonable. What man,

after a temperate use of life, a series of thinking and
acting regularly, without one single deviation from a
sober and even tenor of conduct, ever plunged into
the depth of crime precipitately, and at once? Man-
kind are not instantaneously corrupted. Villainy
is always progressive. We decline from right-not
suddenly, but step after step.
"If my life in general contradicts the indictment,
my health, at that time in particular, contradicts it
more. A little time before, I had been confined to
my bed—I had suffered under a long and severe
disorder. The distemper left me but slowly, and in
part. So far from being well at the time I am
charged with this fact, I never, to this day, perfectly
recovered. Could a person in this condition execute
violence against another ?—-I, with no inducement to
engage—no ability to accomplish-no weapon where-
with to perpetrate such a fact ;-without interest,
without power, without motives, without means !
“My lord, Clarke disappeared; true: but is that a
proof of his death? The fallibility of all conclusions
of such a sort, from such a circumstance, is too
obvious to require instances. One instance is before
you: this very castle affords it.
"In June, 1757, William Thompson, amidst all
the vigilance of this place, in open daylight, and
double-ironed, made his escape ;—notwithstanding
all advertisements, all search, he was never seen or
heard of since. If this man escaped unseen, through
all these difficulties, how easy for Clarke, whom no

difficulties opposed! Yet what would be thought of
a prosecution commenced against anyone seen last
with Thompson ?
“These bones are discovered! Where? Of all
places in the world, can we think of any one, except,
indeed, the churchyard ?
“Is, then, the invention of those bones forgotten
or industriously concealed, that the discovery of
these in question may appear the more extraordinary?
Every place conceals such remains. In fields—in hills
-in highway sides-on wastes-on commons, lie
frequent and unsuspected bones. And mark-no
example, perhaps, occurs of more than one skeleton
being found in one cell. Here you find but one,
agreeable to the peculiarity of every known cell in
Britain. Had two skeletons been discovered, then
alone might the fact have seemed suspicious and
uncommon. What! Have we forgotten how diffi-
cult, as in the case of Perkin Warbec, and Lambert
Symnell, it has been sometimes to identify the
living; and shall we now assign personality to
bones—bones which may belong to either sex? How
know you that this is the skeleton of a man? But
even another skeleton was discovered by some
labourer ? Was not that skeleton averred to be
Clarke's, full as confidently as this ?
“My lord, my lord-must some of the living be
made answerable for all the bones that earth has
concealed and chance exposed? The skull that has
been produced has been declared fractured. But

THE ART OF ELOCUTION. .
who can surely tell whether it was the cause or the
consequence of death? Let it be considered how
easily the fracture on the skull produced is accounted
for. At the dissolution of religious houses, the
ravages of the times affected both the living and
the dead. In search after imaginary treasures, coffins
were broken, graves and vaults dug open, monuments
ransacked, shrines demolished; Parliament itself was
called in to restrain these violations. Can you, then,
with so many probable circumstances, choose the one
least probable? Can you impute to the living what
zeal in its fury may have done; what nature may
have taken off and piety interred; or what war alone
may have destroyed, alone deposited ?
“And now, glance over the circumstantial evi-
dence-how weak-how frail! I almost scorn to
allude to it. I will not condescend to dwell upon
it. The witness of one man--arraigned himself!
Is there no chance, that, to save his own life, he
might conspire against mine ? — no chance that
he might have committed this murder, if murder
hath indeed been done? that conscience betrayed
to his first exclamation ? that craft suggested his
throwing that guilt on me, to the knowledge of
which he had unwittingly confessed ? He declares
that he saw me strike Clarke—that he saw him
fall; yet he utters no cry, no reproof. He calls for
no aid ; he returns quietly home; he declares that
he knows not what became of the body, yet he
tells where the body is laid. He declares that he

whom I lodged deposes that Houseman and I

evidence is this ? and from whom does it come?
ask yourselves. As for the rest of the evidence,
what does it amount to? The watchman sees
Houseman leave my house at night. What more
probable—but what less connected with the murder,
real or supposed, of Clarke? Some pieces of clothing
are found buried in my garden ; but how can it be
shown that they belonged to Clarke? Who can
swear to—who can prove anything so vague? And
if found there, even if belonging to Clarke, what
proof that they were there deposited by me? How
likely that the real criminal may, in the dead of
night, have preferred any spot rather than that round
his own home to conceal the evidence of his crime?
“How impotent such evidence as this ! and how
poor, how precarious, even the strongest of mere
circumstantial evidence invariably is ! Let it rise to
probability, to the strongest degree of probability;
it is but probability still.
“And now, my lord, having endeavoured to show
that the whole of this charge is altogether repugnant
to every part of my life; that it is inconsistent with
my condition of health about that time; that no
rational inference of the death of a person can be
drawn from his disappearance; that hermitages were
the constant repositories of the bones of the recluse;
that the proofs of these are well authenticated; that

the revolution in religion, or the fortunes of war,
have mangled or buried the dead ; that the strongest
circumstantial evidence is often lamentably fallacious;
that in my case, that evidence, so far from being
strong, is weak, disconnected, contradictory,—what
remains ? A conclusion, perhaps, no less reasonably
than impatiently wished for. I, at last, after nearly
a year's confinement, equal to either fortune, intrust
myself to the candour, the justice, the humanity of
your lordship, and to yours, my countrymen, gentle-
men of the jury."

GUILD'S SIGNAL.*
By BRET HARTE.
Two low whistles, quaint and clear,
That was the signal the engineer-
That was the signal that Guild, 'tis said-
Gave to his wife at Providence,
As through the sleeping town, and thence
Out in the night,
On to the light,
Down past the farms, lying white, he sped !
As a husband's greeting, scant, no doubt,
Yet to the woman looking out,
Watching and waiting, no serenade,
Love song, or midnight roundelay,
Said what that whistle seemed to say:
“To my trust true,
So love to you!
Working or waiting, good-night!" it said.
* William Guild was engineer of the train which plunged into
Meadow Brook, on the line of the Stonington and Providence Rail-
road. It was his custom, as often as he passed his home, to whistle
an “All's well” to his wife. He was found, after the disaster, dead,
with his hand on the throttle-valve of his engine. .

Brisk young bagmen, tourists fine,
Old commuters along the line,
Brakemen and porters glanced ahead,
Smiled as the signal, sharp, intense,
Pierced through the shadows of Providence:
“Nothing amiss-
Nothing !-it is
Only Guild calling his wife,” they said.
Summer and winter the old refrain
Rang o'er the billows of ripening grain,
Pierced through the budding boughs o’erhead,
Flew down the track where the red leaves burned
Like living coals from the engine spurned;
Sang as it flew :
“ To our trust true,
First of all, duty. Good-night!” it said.
And then one night it was heard no more
From Stonington over Rhode Island shore,
And the folk in Providence smiled and said,
As they turned in their beds, “The engineer
Has once forgotten his midnight cheer."
One only knew,
To his trust true,
Guild lay under his engine dead.

DOWN AT HEEL.
By S. J. ADAIR FITZ-GERALD.
HE ambles o'er the weary pave
With sloven gait and aspect grave,
A great mistake;
His coat is shabby, and his hat
Is shapeless grown, and creased and flat,
Once wideawake!
Along the Strand you may him meet.
But mostly in the Street of Fleet
You'll see him steal.
He has no hope except to die,
And yet to live he still must try,
Poor Down at Heel!
Perchance, in days that are no more,
He struggled in the rush and roar
For Fame and place.
Maybe his dream was just as great
As those who've conquered Fortune, Fate
And won the race.
He wrote with just as light a heart
Of Wine and Revel, joy and smart,
Of Love and fears ;

His muse was buoyant, gay and free,
Or touching in a minor key-
The key of tears !
His hope was once as brave as most
Who start to pass the winning-post
. That so few gain ;
For he had youth and talent, too,
And very like a maid to woo,
To woo in vain.
And in the early days he strove
To win the bays and eke to rove
Parnassus round.
For he aspired to golden heights,
To follow Fancy in her flights,
With wings unbound !
And now, alas! How sad the tale,
To strive and strive and only fail
And fall to earth.
To plod, and wonder every day
What next will be—if earn he may
A dinner's worth.
How sunk he so ? A man of brain-
A victim of Mischance's chain
That demons link?
The Bottle ? Passions? Who can tell ?
Maybe that Circumstances fell
Have made him sink!

In Grub Street failures oft occur,
Still failures once successes were
When Life was young;
And singers with a blither note
Have 'missed the tide and lost Fame's vote,
And died unsung.
But he and all must feel the same
As those who play and win the game
Of pitch-and-toss.
And now how sad must be his lot,
A comedy with tragic plot-
A life all loss.
The world but own the favoured few,
Who rise and safe the mill pass through,
If false or leal !
It matters not, if you would rise,
You with the wise must aye despise
Poor Down at Heel.
Poor Down at Heel! The words so cold
Tell tales that never will be told,
For Doom's the seal.
Alas! so many lives are so,
All worn and torn and cursed with woe,
And Down at Heel.

THE WARDER'S STORY.
• By MRS. ALBERT S. BRADSHAW.
Do you mind stepping inside, Sir,
And writing your name in the book ?
I'll just get the keys from the lodge, Sir,
And perhaps you'll be taking a look-
At the photos, up in the case,
You'll find 'em a queer-looking lot.
There's young 'uns and old ’unsall sorts,
That, once seen, are not easy forgot.
“The little chap-up in the corner ?”
Why, Sir, his was a very sad case;
He's neither a convict or thief, Sir,
And the gaol weren't for him the right place.
His life and his story's soon told, Sir;
He was one of those children whose fate
Was but to be cast on the world,
Homeless, and orphaned-at eight.
He'd stand at the theatres with papers,
Or sometimes with matches he'd ply;
But there were others, bigger and stronger,
And most people passed him by.

They never saw his white wan face,
Or his timid outstretched hand-
What counts such a feeble unit
In the thronging busy Strand ?
There was Royalty at the Opera
One snowy winter's night,
But thousands waited about the doors,
On chance of seeing them alight.
Carriages dashed up one by one
In a never-ending stream;
Bearing ladies, in satins and silks,
Who with jewels were all agleam.
In vain the Guardian of the Peace
Cried “Stand back! Move on! Make way!”
The mob closed in, eager to gaze
On the world they saw not every day.
When suddenly within their midst,
Like a roll of thunder ran
A sound that echoed from lip to lip,
And dispersed them to a man.
The hand of the thief had left its mark
On the brow of a lady fair,
In snatching a priceless brilliant
From the coils of her golden hair.
The hue-and-cry had not yet paled
When a little form was espied,
Crouched in a niche of the portico,
Shivering—and terrified !

Within his grimy palm it lay-

Speechless from fright, he shook his head;
Tears welled in his eyes and down his cheeks.
“He's fed me—when I've been starving,
If you nab Jim—why, then, I never speaks!”
“You'd better tell that story to the Beak,”
The stolid minion of the law replied,
As onward through the streets they marched,
With an angry curious crowd beside.
“Stubborn, as well as artful, eh?
But we've a remedy will make him speak;
A month's hard labour, and the birch, twelve strokes!"
Convicted ! he staggered, faint and weak.
Quivering in every limb he lay;
His starved frail body, bruised and sore;
Between his gasping breaths he prayed-
“ Lord! Save poor Jim from stealing any more !”

And the Warder's eyes grew dim.

THE FOOL'S PRAYER.
The royal feast was done; the king
Sought some new sport to banish care,
And to his jester cried, “Sir Fool,
Kneel down for us and make a prayer !”
The jester doffed his cap and bells,
And stood the mocking court before ;
They could not see the bitter smile
Behind the painted grin he wore.
He bowed his head and bent his knee
Upon the monarch's silken stool;
His pleading voice arose : "O Lord,
Be merciful to me, a fool!
“No pity, Lord, could change the heart
From red with wrong to white as wool ;
The rod must heal the sin ; but, Lord,
Be merciful to me, a fool !

Of truth and light, O Lord, we stay;
'Tis by our follies that so long
We hold the earth from Heaven away.

Among the heart-strings of a friend.

We know how sharp it pierced and stung;
The word we had not sense to stay-
Who knows how grandly it had rung?
“Our faults no tenderness should ask,
The chastening stripes must cleanse them all;
But for our blunders -oh, in shame
Before the eyes of Heaven we fall.
“Earth bears no blossoms for mistakes,
Men crown the knave, and scourge the tool
That did his will; but thou, O Lord,

The king, and sought his garden cool,
And walked apart, and murmured low,

IN speaking of a person's faults,
Please don't forget your own-
Remember those with homes of glass
Should seldom throw a stone.
· If we have nothing else to do
But talk of those who sin,
'Tis better we commence at home,
And from that point begin.
We have no right to judge a man
Until he's fairly tried; ,
Should we not like his company,
We know the world is wide.
Some may have faults—and who has not?-
The old as well as young ;
Perhaps we may, for aught we know,
Have fifty to their one.
I'll tell you of a better plan,
And find it works full well-
To try my own defects to cure
Before of others tell;
And though I sometimes hope to be
No worse than some I know,
My own shortcomings bid me let
The faults of others go.

beyond all hurt or harm-beyond your help; for the
time when your kind words or kind actions could
have done me good is gone wi' the scent o' last year's
beans or clover on the air !
Gentle folks! I've lived mony a year in this place.
You may see the cottage from the sunk fence over
yonder. I've seen the ladies draw it in their books a
hundred times. It looks well in a pictur, I've heard
say; but there arn't weather in pictures, and maybe
it's fitter for that than for a place to live in. Well,
I lived there. How hard-how bitter hard I lived
there, I won't say. Any day in the year and every
day, you can judge for your own selves. 'Tis harder
than you think for, gentle folks, to grow up decent-
commonly decent-in such a place. That I growed
up a man and not a brute says something for me as
I was then-as I am now there's nothing can be said

when we are lying in our cradles; gi' us better food
when we are working for our lives; gi' us kinder laws
to bring us back when we are a going wrong, and don't
set jail, jail, jail afore us everywhere we turn. There
ain't a condescension you can show the labourer then
that he won't take as ready and as grateful as a man
can be, for he has a patient, peaceful, and a willing
heart. But you must put his rightful spirit in him
first, for whether he's a wreck or ruin such as me, or
is like one of them that stand here now, his spirit is
divided from you at this time. Bring it back, gentle
folks, bring it back. Bring it back afore the day
comes when even his Bible changes in his altered
mind, and the words seem to read, as they have
sometimes read in my own eyes in jail : “Whither
thou goest I can not go; where thou lodgest I do not
lodge; thy people are not my people, nor thy God
my God.”

LARIAT BILL.
“WELL, stranger, 'twas somewhere in '69
I was running the 'Frisco fast express;
An' from Murder Creek to Blasted Pine
Were nigh on to eighteen mile, I guess.
The road were a down-grade all the way,
An' we pulled out of Murder a little late;
So I opened the throttle wide that day,
An' a mile a minute were 'bout our gait.
“My fireman's name was Lariat Bill,
A quiet man with an easy way,
Who could rope a steer with a cowboy's skill,
Which he'd learned in Texas, I've heard him say.
The coil were strong as tempered steel,
An' it went like a bolt from a crossbow flung,
An' arter Bill changed from saddle to wheel,
Just over his head in the cab it hung.
“Well, as I was sayin', we fairly flew
As we struck the curve at Buffalo Spring,
An' I give her full steam an' put her through,
An' the engine rocked like a livin' thing;
When all of a sudden I got a scare-
For thar on the track were a little child !
An' right in the path of the engine there,
She held out her little hands and smiled!

"I jerked the lever an' whistled for brakes,
The wheels threw sparks like a shower of gold;
But I knew the trouble a down-grade makes,
An' set my teeth, an' my flesh grew cold.
Then Lariat Bill yanked his long lasso,
An' out in front of the engine crept,
He balanced a moment before he threw,
Then out in the air his lariat swept !”.
He paused. There were tears in his honest eyes.
The stranger listened with bated breath-
" I know the rest of the tale,” he cries;
“He snatched the child from the jaws of death!
'Twas the deed of a hero—from heroes bred-
Whose praises the very angels sing.”
The engineer shook his grizzled head
And growled : “He didn't do no sich thing.
“ He aimed for the stump of a big pine tree,
An' the lariat caught with a double hitch,
An' in less'n a second the train an' we
Were yanked off the track an' inter the ditch !
'Twas an awful smash, an' it laid me out;
I ain't forgot it, an'never shall-
Were the passengers hurt? Lemme see-
Yes, it killed about forty—but saved the gal!

A STORY OF FOLKESTONE.
Twas on the pier at Folkestone, as I stood one
autumn morn,
A stranger strode toward me, and his lip was curled
in scorn;
His hair was waving wildly in the fresh September
wind;
His manner showed distinctly he had something on
his mind.
“Oh, say, art thou an Englishman ?” he cried, and
seized my wrist,
And glared at me so fiercely that I begged of him to
desist.
“If, as a son of Albion, thou lovest thy country's
fame,
Come see a sight to make thy cheek flush up with
· honest shame.”
He led me to the harbour side, where lay a stately
... boat,
And pointed to the passengers the while he cleared
his throat;
The vessel's deck was loaded with a motley human
freight,
And still poured in by twos and threes the many
who were late.

A land where food and fuel don't continually rise,
A land where after midnight's hour your thirst you

ASLEEP AT THE SWITCH.
BY FRANK GASSAWAY.
The first thing that I remember was Carlo tugging
away,
With the sleeve of my coat fast in his teeth, pulling
as much as to say:
“Come, master, awake, and tend to the switch, lives
now depend upon you;
Think of the souls in the coming train and the graves
you're sending them to;
Think of the mother and babe at her breast, think of
the father and son ;
Think of the lover and loved one, too, think of them
doomed every one
To fall, as it were, by your very hand, into yon
fathomless ditch,
Murdered by one who should guard them from harm,
who now lies asleep at the switch.”
I sprang up amazed, scarce knew where I stood, sleep
had o’ermastered me so;
I could hear the wind hollowly howling and the deep
river dashing below,
I could hear the forest leaves rustling as the trees by
the tempest were fanned.
But what was that noise at a distance? That-I
could not understand !

ASLEEP AT THE SWITCH.

I heard it at first indistinctly, like the rolling of some
muffled drum,
Then nearer and nearer it came to me, and made my
very ears hum.
What is this light that surrounds me and seems to
set fire to my brain ?
What whistle's that yelling so shrilly! Oh, God!
I know now—it's the train !
We often stand facing some danger, and seem to take
root to the place;
So I stood with this demon before me, its heated
breath scorching my face :
Its headlight made day of the darkness, and glared
like the eyes of some witch;
The train was almost upon me before I remembered
the switch.
I sprang to it, seizing it wildly, the train dashing fast
down the track-
The switch resisted my efforts, some devil seemed
holding it back.
On, on came the fiery-eyed monster and shot by my
face like a flash;
I swooned to the earth the next moment, and knew
nothing after the crash.
How long I laid there unconscious were impossible
for me to tell.
My stupor was almost a heaven, my waking almost a
hell-
For I then heard the piteous moaning and shrieking
of husbands and wives,
And I thought of the day we all shrink from, when
I must account for their lives.

THE ART OF ELOCUTION.
Mothers rushed like maniacs, their eyes staring madly
and wild ;
Fathers, losing their courage, gave way to their grief
like a child;
Children searching for parents, I noticed, as by me
they sped,
And lips that could form naught but“ Mamma” were
calling for one perhaps dead.
My mind was made up in a second—the river should
hide me away,
When, under the still burning rafters, I suddenly
noticed there lay
A little white hand—she who owned it was doubtless
an object of love
To one whom her loss would drive frantic, though
she guarded him now from above.
I tenderly lifted the rafters and quietly laid them one
side;
How little she thought of her journey when she left
for this last fatal ride.
I lifted the last log from off her, and while searching
for some spark of life
Turned her little face up in the starlight, and recog-
nised-Maggie, my wife !
Oh, Lord! Thy scourge is a hard one-at a blow
Thou hast shattered my pride ;
My life will be one endless night-time with Maggie
away from my side.
How often we've sat down and pictured the scenes
in our long, happy life;
How I'd strive through all of my lifetime to build up
a home for my wife ;

How people would envy us always in our cosy and
neat little nest,
When I would do all the labour and Maggie should
all the day rest;
How one of God's blessings might cheer us, when
some day I p'r’aps should be rich;
But all of my dreams have been shattered while I
lay there asleep at the switch.
I fancied I stood on my trial, the jury and judge
I could see,
And every eye in the court-room was steadfastly
fixed upon me,
And fingers were pointed in scorn, till I felt my face
blushing red,
And the next thing I heard were the words “ Hung
by the neck until dead !”.
Then I felt myself pulled once again, and my hand
caught tight hold of a dress,
And I heard “What's the matter, dear Jim ? You've
had a bad nightmare, I guess.”
And there stood Maggie, my wife, with never a scar
from the ditch;
I'd been taking a nap in my bed, and had not been
asleep at the switch !

CRIPPLE BEN.
By GEORGE L. Catlin.
Down in a street by the river's side,
Where ebbs and flows the hurrying tide
Of city life, in a squalid den,
Hungry and poor, dwelt “Cripple Ben.”
So they called him; no other name
He e'er had boasted since first he came,
Unknown, unnoticed, his care to hide
In that wretched home by the river's side.
Ragged, one-legged, deformed was he;
His age not over twenty-and-three.
All day long on his crutch he'd go
Through the streets with a painful gait and slow,
Vending matches, and pins, and soap,
Ever cheery and full of hope,
Never complaining, never sad,
With an eye so bright, and a face so glad,
In spite of his cares, that folks would pause
In passing to buy from his little stores;
And children would see his cheery smile
Reflected back in their own the while,
And even the rough, blunt sailor-men
Had always a word for “Cripple Ben.”

CRIPPLE BEN.

Yet oft on the pier where the great ships lay
He'd sit and rest on a summer's day,
And peering over the moss-grown brink
On the seething tide below, would think
And wonder if in yon current there
He could bury for ever his weight of care.
“Nobody cares for me," he'd say ;
" I'm weary of toiling every day.
By night a hard and narrow bed,
By day a beggarly crust of bread.
Why not finish it all? And then
Nobody'll miss poor Cripple Ben.”
Yet something within him said: "Live on;
Though thy heart be lonely, thy features wan,
Even for thee it rests in store
To do some good ere thy life is o’er.”
So, then, with a sigh of silent pain,
He'd hobble away on his crutch again,
And take up his burden of life once more,
Bravely and patiently as before.
One day last June, in an eager hunt
For a friend's place down by the river front,
I suddenly heard a piercing cry-
A cry of grief from the pier hard by :
And half a hundred hurrying feet
Were speeding across the rough-paved street.
I joined the crowd. At the pier-head, lo!
A woman, wringing her hands in woe,
Screamed, “Oh! my child!” while men did shout,
And out in the current, out, far out,

A baby form. “A boat! a boat!”
We shouted. Then stalwart arms and brave
Pulled hurriedly forth, two lives to save.
'Twas not in vain, for, quicker than thought,
Those dripping two to the pier they brought.
“The child's alive!” they cried with zest,
And the babe was clasped to its mother's breast.
But what of him—the other one-
With his face upturned to the noonday sun!
Lifeless they lifted him up, and then
A bystander said : “Why, it's Cripple Ben!"

But Sheela, she was timid; and Torwald, he was

His hair was clouds of midnight-hers like the

Yet she clung to him and went with him all through
the winter's cold-
Sheela ! Sheela! Bewitched for evermore.
The wind swept bleak o'er Norroway-o'er Norroway's

Lo! the fiend-child of Torwald mocked the very

Lest the ghoulish monsters of the deep should claim

Sheela! Sheela! Lost, lost for evermore!
Now, by the coast of Norroway, Great Torwald rides

And, save by Torwald, tenantless, the vessel breasts

So right unto the Judgment Day he still must ride

O’er savage seas and oceans, till the Doom-tide he

THE PARLOUR BILLIARDS.

The other evening Mr. Pottle came home with a
large box under his arm.
“What have you got there?” asked his wife in
pleasant expectation.
“What d'ye think?" replied Mr. Pottle; “but
before you start to guess I can tell you a few things
that it isn't. It isn't a step-ladder, or a grand piano,
or a dog-cart, or a drawing-room carpet.”
· "I know," she said triumphantly; "it's a magic-
lantern for the Sunday-school children.”
"No, it is not a magic-lantern for the school
children, nor is it a Christmas tree for the deserving
poor. It is not even a parcel of books for the Dogs'
Home. Try again.”
"I shall never guess," said his wife despairingly,
“unless—unless it's a musical-box."
“A what?” cried Mr. Pottle. “D'you think I'm
going skipping round on my hind-legs while you
churn 'The Blue Danube' out of a rheumatic, weak-

careful not to make any breaks. You're out when
you make a break, aren't you?”
“That is a point that the rules don't mention,"
said Mr. Pottle ; "it's one of their mistakes. Now
let's clear the table and begin."
"I thought you could play it on the floor," said his
wife, as she carefully removed everything from the
table except a flower-vase in the middle.
"What do you leave that there for?” asked her
husband; “think we're going to play a new variation
of cork pool? Help me to screw these things on,
will you !"
“What are these holes for?” said Mrs. Pottle. “I
suppose when the ball goes in there you're out,
aren't you?"
"Why will you keep on arguing?” replied her
husband. “Do you think the game of billiards is to
strike the ball as hard as you can, and then run
round the table until it stops ?”
"No," said Mrs. Pottle; "that's cricket, anybody
knows that. But what's the difference between
Rugby billiards and Association ? Isn't one spot
barred or something ?".
Mr. Pottle sat down and buried his face in his hands.
“Look here,” he said, when he partially recovered,
“you write your questions down, so that I can have
time to think them out. I wasn't prepared for such
a display of intricate knowledge of British sports
and pastimes.”
Then he took up a cue, and placed the balls for an
easy shot.

-"Now watch me,” he said. “I strike this white
ball to hit the red and then go in the pocket, and
that counts three.”
Unfortunately nothing of the kind occurred. “Of
course,” explained Mr. Pottle, “if this had been
real billiards "
"Let me try," said his wife eagerly, as with the
side of her cue she scooped a red ball into a pocket.
“ It cannoned, it did, it did !” she cried, dancing
with delight. “ I've won.”
“We haven't started yet,” said her husband. “I
was only showing you how to play."
“Oh, yes, you say that because you're beaten,"
replied Mrs. Pottle. “You men think that women
can do nothing. Now this time I'll give you a start,
as I'm a better player. You shall have the red ball,
and I'll have the white ones, and we'll see who can
poke them in the holes quickest. Now-one-two-
when I say three- "
“One moment," said Mr. Pottle earnestly. "I
think it would be much more exciting if we put the
balls on the floor and played hop-scotch with them.
About billiards you've convinced me I know nothing;
but I flatter myself I can play hop-scotch."
"Oh, yes," replied Mrs. Pottle; "you're only
sneering now because I beat you. I shall just have
some practice by myself. Is there a lady champion ?
I'm sure I could beat her with practice. I seem to
have a natural gift for the game, don't I ?”
And Mr. Pottle laughed.

THORL, THE BOXER.
By BART KENNEDY.
A GREAT hush swept through the amphitheatre as
Thorl, the boxer, entered the arena. Then came
applause, sweeping and sudden as rush of whirlwind
-applause from thousands, and cries and shouts,
and fierce, hard laughs; for the sight of this terrible
gladiator had forced to a still higher intenseness the
wolfish instinct of these people, who on this day had
come to see blood-spilling and killing—these people
of the mighty, world-conquering Rome. How they
exulted as beasts tore men, and men slew beasts !
And they had acquired an admiration for this boxer
because of the many men he had killed with a single
blow from his cestus—that crushing blow! - But
Thorl knew that if a stronger boxer than himself
vanquished him and killed him, he would be no more
thought of than yonder lion, which lay, afar across
the arena, dead-aye, dead from a gladius-thrust
delivered by his comrade Lataro, who himself had
perished beneath the awful rend and stroke of the
lion ere it expired.
And Thorl answered the applause with a scowl.
The Romans admired defiance. Truly was this
boxer a fine human brute, full of fibre and fight!

- The cestus which Thorl used in the delivery of
his blow was a half glove, made out of a thick, strong
leather. From it protruded a row of sharp iron
spikes. It was fashioned so as to just cover the
boxer's knuckles.
And now they were cheering him. Bah! He
wished that he could put forth his whole power, his
whole life, into one last blow that would strike them
all dead-all, from Emperor to slave. He was weary
of the fighting and the blood-shedding. He longed
for peace, for rest. To-day death would be to this
gladiator a welcome guest.
And now he remembered the restful smile that
stole over the faces of the men he had killed in
combat. And the remembrance brought to him
a peace.
“Morituri, Cæsar, te salutamis.”
Thorl was saluting the Emperor after the fashion
of the gladiators. His powerful voice swelled through
the amphitheatre. It seemed to awaken echoes from
the lips of the dead men, and in it was a weird,
mocking ring. The spectators were startled.
He stood with right hand uplifted. He was great
of stature, and his face was grandly bold. He had
come from out the land of the far North, and, with
his long fair hair and blue eyes, he looked as a
glorious Norse fighting god who had sprung suddenly
to the life, full-powered and ready for the battle.
Again was heard a salutation to the Emperor. It ·

For a moment Thorl had felt a reluctance as to
hting with hiin. But this was useless to think of,

would be death to refuse. He was forced to fight.
Nay, not forced, he thought fiercely. He was willing

COURAGE.
By MRS. ALBERT S. BRADSHAW.
DING-DONG! ding-dong! ding-dong!
The School bell's brazen tongue
Rang out its notes of freedom
On the odorous summer air,
And with a swift response,
The open doors flung open wide
To let the human current pass between;
While, from a hundred lusty throats,
The air was rent with cries and shouts,
And sounds of scampering feet
Resounded, where before had silence been.
But suddenly the hum of merriment
Was broken by discordant jeers ;
The group soon swelled into a crowd
Around the object of their crits and sneers:
“Here's a fine fellow who admits
He cannot kick a ball,
Or wield a bat, or run a mile,
Unless he faint or fall!”
“He'd spoil his soft white hands," said one,
“Or perhaps his golden curls."
“They addressed him to the wrong house :
He wants the school for girls.”

COURAGE.

“ Did you say his name was Lily ?”
And the air with laughter rang.
“Dear little, fair little, sweet little Lily”
They danced around and sang.
Tall, slim and pale, within their midst he stood,
Smarting beneath their cruel caustic tone,
And when he raised his voice in self-defence
They turned and left him standing-quite alone!
Ding-dong! ding-dong! ding-dong!
With rapid, eager strokes
The School bell pealed upon the midnight air,
And soon there mingled with its clang
Loud cries for help and shrieks of mad despair,
The purple sky was lit
With lurid shafts of blazing light,
While scorching, leaping tongues of flame
Disclosed the harrowing, hideous sight-
A surging, seething mass, maddened by fear
And wild desire for life,
Fighting against each other-
Comrades and brothers falling in the strife.
“Make for the ladders! Quick! there's help below!”
A clear young voice rang out in shrill command.
“This way, boys! Courage ! the youngsters first!”
And in obedience to that guiding hand
Confusion ceased—the goal of safety reached.

THE ART OF ELOCUTION.
While cheers proclaimed the work of rescue o'er
The leaping flames crackled and hissed afresh,
Then grew to a tempestuous roar.
And in the midst of wreathing flame appeared
A slender form they watched with bated breath,
Who, with a burden clasped about his neck,
Fought bravely on, though face to face with death.
Safe! Safe at last! and saved—the fair young life
For which the brave boy gladly risked his own.
Scorched were the golden curls and soft white hands,
No longer was hè left to stand-alone!
Hip-hip hooray! hip-hip hooray! hooray!
Louder and louder grew the lusty cheers;
For when an English schoolboy's honour's roused
Frankly he'll own his faults, in spite of fears.
Long will his valour live in every heart;
Not only in the football team or cricket ground,
Not only in the giant frame or stalwart form,
They'd learned true hearts and courage might be
- found!
