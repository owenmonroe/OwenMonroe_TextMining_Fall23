PREFACE. 
 
 The need of better readers and speakers was never more 
 argent than now. Deficiency in expressive reading and 
 effective speaking has been observed and deplored for years. 
 Within the last score of years, schools of oratory, elocntion, 
 Delsarte, physical and vocal culture, and many institations 
 of less pretentious title have demonstrated the assertion 
 'that, ■ ' Crood reading is attainable b^ the masses. " 
 
 The day will never come when the memorizing and recit- 
 ing of poems and choice prose efforts by our best writers and 
 greatest orators will cease to be popular with our American 
 youth. It is a part of our inheritance to preserve the utter- 
 ances of the men and women who have, by their voice and 
 pen, done much to advance the spirit of truth, heroism and 
 patriotism — the chief characteristic of our American man- 
 hood and womanhood. This book, therefore, is presented to 
 the public in obedience to that trite commercial maxim, 
 "The demand will summon the supply," 
 
 The art of oratory is best acquired by the committing and 
 delivery of approved examples of speeches and poems ; hence 
 the aspirant for great oratorical skill should count no labor 
 lost that requires much study and practice of what othert 
 have written or delivered. Webster, Clay, Calhoun, Patrick 
 Henry, Burke, Phillips, Benton, Fox, Bryan and Sheridan, 
 as well as the great orators of antiquity — Demosthenes, 
 Cicero and Marc Antony, owed their wonderful elocutionary

 powers to this practice, and he who would emulate their sue- 
 tess must be willing to pay the price thereof. 
 
 It is believed that not only teachers and pupils, but 
 those young men and women who have gone out into the 
 work-a-day world to battle with life's fitful currents, will 
 welcome a book that gives in a comprehensive and attractive 
 form, so large a collection of excellent selections, many of 
 which have never before appeared in print, while others are 
 used by permission of publisher or author — all being suitable 
 for delivery on all occasions. In addition to the half thou- 
 sand or more choice readings, there is a brief, though prao 
 tical treatise on the Science and Art of Elocution, Oratory and 
 Rational Reading and Speaking, the essential features of 
 which are based upon the more exhaustive authoritative 
 works of the late Professor Isaac Hinton Brown — Common 
 School Elocution and Oratory and Rational Elocution and 
 Reading. Due acknowledgement is hereby made for matter 
 extracted from these books and from lectures delivered by 
 Prof. Brown before his classes in the University of Missouri. 
 
 To present the Science of Human Expression and Rat- 
 ional Reading and Speaking in a manner so simple, so con- 
 cise and so reasonable that no student with average zeal, 
 ability and native wit, would experience difficulty in compre- 
 hending and applying all fundamental principles, has been the 
 aim of the authors. While an effort has been made to render 
 the exposition free from technical and professional theories, 
 ev^ry principle announced and enforced has been drawn from 
 nature by the scientific researches of the foremost teachers 
 and writers of Delsarte, Elocution, Vocal and Physical 
 Culture of Europe and America. 
 
 The prominence given to the subject of Respiration is 
 justified in the recognition of its three-fold relation to Elocu- 
 tion and Delsarte: First, energy and ease of expression are 
 largely dependent upon a proper control of the respiratory

 organs; secondly, the correct training of these organs in 
 early life and their judicious exercise at all times, conduce 
 to greater vigor of mind and body than is otherwise possible; 
 and thirdly, the natural system of breathing during vocali- 
 zation, reinforced by the teachings of science, has been 
 found an almost absolute protection against all forms of 
 lung and throat diseases. Consumption has been held to be 
 incurable, but there are innumerable cases on record where a 
 permanent cure has been effected by the judicious exercise 
 of the vocal organs with accompanying gymnastic exercise, 
 Delsarte and gesture. — 0. W. B.

INTRODUCTION. 
 
 THE POWER OF SPEECH. 
 
 As an apostle of what has been facetiously termed a 
 tost art, .the author may be pardoned for advancing tha 
 claims of cultivated speech to a more general recognition 
 among our people. That the people in general are defi- 
 cient in their powers of vocal expression is an unpleasant com- 
 ment upon our system of education ; but if we attribute the 
 vocal deficiency of the masses to the confessedly meager 
 vocal drill in our common schools, how shall we account for 
 the delinquency of many of our literary people whose vocal 
 accomplishments are barely sufficient to render them intelli- 
 gently entertaining upon such familiar topics as the current 
 events 7 How many of this latter class can you name, of 
 whom it may be said their words issue from their lips with 
 that easy flowing and delightful continuity which implies 
 not only a profusion and activity of thought, but a power 
 and vigor of expression which rouses the listless ear and 
 leads the sluggish and perhaps unwilling fancy through the 
 realms of mental wonderland ? 
 
 Of all the recognized professions none requires in its 
 perfection so many and varied accomplishments as that of 
 oratory. The public lecturer who leads the van in the 
 EQaxch of science for the improvement of society, the states- 
 is

 man who guards the nation's rights and shapes his country's 
 destiny, the man of God who seeks to purify the human 
 lieart and save a fallen race — all must wield the wonderous 
 power of speech. 
 
 The power to charm the heart and steal away the senses ; 
 to divert the mind from its own divisings and hold an audi- 
 ence in breathless spell as the orator paints the rosy 
 tints of heavenly longings, or leads the imagination down 
 through the labyrinths of wonderland, or depicts with light- 
 ning tongue and thunder tones the horrors of the doomed, 
 comes not by natare, but by work, work, work. Whether 
 this so-called gift be assisted by early efforts, as in the case 
 of a Demosthenes declaiming over the sea-beat cliffs of At- 
 tica, or the harangues of a youthful Clay before a group of 
 oxen, perfection in speech is attained only by frequent and 
 long continued practice, based upon accurate observation and 
 zealous study. The art of conveying thought in an easy, 
 graceful and forceful manner should be held chiefest above 
 all other accomplishments. The complete mastery of the 
 principles of speech therefore, enables one not only to express 
 his thoughts clearly and easily, but to so vivify and illuminate 
 those thoughts that his hearers see, hear and feel the un- 
 questioned truth of his argument. 
 
 The gift of reason to the human race derives its value 
 from the gift of speech; but the speech of nature is so tram- 
 meled by habit and corrupted by association, that the prompt- 
 ings of our God-nature, as revealed in speech are practically 
 ignored. If we go to nature and endeavor to apply her 
 teachings to our expressions, we readily see that what we 
 call < ' second nature " is simply habit — correctly or incorrect- 
 ly formed. We should therefore cultivate pleasant tones 
 and correct and distinct articulation. 
 
 It is a duty imposed at birth to make the best use of 
 every talent of which we are possessed; it is equally a duty

 to make ouiaelTes as agreeable in oar intercourse with our 
 fellow creatures as our opportunities may permit. Polite- 
 ness, coupled with an attractiveness of manner, is the pass- 
 port which admits us to the. favorable attention of our 
 fellow men; but something more than suavity and outward 
 polish is required to command the consideration and contin- 
 ued high respect of the world. The hermit, withdrawing to 
 his forest cabin or mountain cavern, may with impunity 
 lapse into uncouth barbarism and give expression to his 
 aches and pains in rasping pectoral grunts, since no other 
 being is to be attracted or delighted by his words and man- 
 ners ; but woe to him who seeks amid the social hive for 
 human sympathy if he ignores his tones and speech. 
 
 With simply an allusion to those unconscious and silent 
 impressions we make upon others, through the agency of 
 learning, wisdom, valor, beauty or physical strength, and 
 for which we are not always directly responsible, let us 
 speak of the active, intelligent and volitional manifestation 
 of speech — articulate speech, the preeminent characteristic 
 of the God-imaged rational man — the creative gift in para- 
 dise, through which the creature first learned to praise his 
 Maker, the deliverer of his imprisoned soul, whereby we 
 trace our origin to one common fatherhood. Though this 
 gift be oft abused, who would wish the power of speech 
 abridged ? Who would willingly forego the social chat, the 
 sweet commune of kindred spirits, the words of cheer, of love, 
 of hope, and all that makes life dear to faithful hearts? 'Tis the 
 loved one's speech that falls upon our infant ears from lipe 
 that press our own in ectasy of mother-love ? In time the 
 same fond lips prepare our own to frame the sweet " Mam- 
 ma, " and later on as we cast adrift from youths' maternal 
 moorings, the charm of words from other lips than those we 
 loved erstwhile, now steals upon our senses and holds us will- 
 ing captives at the shrine of love's first offering. What

 rapture fills the soul at sound of those fond words which 
 breathe the innocence of paradise, the sanctity of Hpaven ! 
 
 The absence of that elegant court culture in Dr. Frs^nk- 
 lin, regarded as indispensable to a minister, at the court of 
 kings was entirely forgotten, while the ear reveled in the 
 seductive tones of a voice attuned to reach the hearts of those 
 who had favors to bestow. The magical power of Henry 
 Clay's voice, cultivated by years of patient study and intel- 
 ligent practice, was little less potent than the logic of the 
 arguments in persuasion or conviction. The orator, whether 
 in legislative halls, on the rostrum, or in the pulpit, must 
 look well to his tones and speech if he would emulate the 
 success of those masters whose individuality has left behind 
 them imperishable fame. 
 
 The conditions of success in the finished orator lie as much 
 in the management of the voice and method of delivery as 
 in the sentiments uttered, for our tones and manners leave 
 their impress upon those with whom we mingle long after the 
 words we utter have been forgotten and we have passed to 
 the shadowy realms of the echoless shore.

 AND MODEL ELOCUTIONIST. 
 
 Elocution is the art of conveying thought, sentiment 
 and emotion in the most natural and effective manner. 
 
 Its Purpose — The complete mastery of its principles 
 enables the speaker not only to express his thoughts clearly 
 and easily, but to so vivify and illuminate those thoughts 
 that his hearers see, hear and fed the unquestioned truth 
 of his statements. 
 
 Correct elecutionary training has for its further object the 
 complete subordination of the physical being to the service 
 of the mind and spirit, thought being the product of the 
 inner spiritual ^Ja. and speech and gesture its natural outlet 
 through the exterior, or physical man. 
 
 Its Value — Its study and systematic practice, based 
 upon principles of nature, make the voice clear, strong, flex- 
 ible and melodious, and give to the body and limbs a pliancy, 
 vigor and harmony of motion that render the position and 
 action of the speaker or reader at once graceful, natural and 
 impressive. 
 
 How Acquired — The greatest excellence in Elocution is 
 attained by study, practice, observation and criticism. The

 READING. 
 
 Reading, says Professor Brown, is the most important 
 branch taught in our schools. It is the key to nearly all the 
 other subjects with which the student and future citizen has 
 to deal. His success in mastering the concomitant branches 
 and, indeed, nearly every art, science and avocation, depends 
 upon the skill he secures at an early age in interpreting, 
 assimilating and retaining the thoughts of others, as pre- 
 sented upon the written or printed page. 
 
 The ability to apprehend the wit, the fun, the hidden 
 wisdom beneath the author's words, to grasp the central 
 thought, to group the lights and shades which modify or 
 ornament the worded picture, with the quickness of intu- 
 ition, must all be acquired in early life. But to scan the 
 prmted page in silence and note in mental concepts the 
 author's woven thoughts is not all there is of reading; nor 
 can the skill by which the thoughts are grasped be attained 
 alone by silent reading. Months and years must he given to 
 the vocal utterances of written sentences, under the guid- 
 ance of the skillful teachers, before the child can adapt the 
 written words to his untrained comprehension. Silent and 
 audible reading are mutually dependent; the highest excel- 
 lence in either is acquired largely through the practice of the 
 other. 
 
 RESPIRATION. 
 
 Eespieation or breathing is the act of taking air into 
 the lungs and expelling it from them. As an art, respira- 
 tion involves processes whose mastery by the student is of 
 paramount importance: Inspieation, Expikation and 
 Management. 
 
 Few persons realize how great is the influence of respira- 
 ation upon the growing life of a human being. Notwith- 
 standing the teachings of our t«xt books and the warnings

 of popular writers and lecturers, many parents and even 
 teachers remain indifferent to the pernicious habits of breath- 
 ing acquired by children during school life. 
 
 Vigor of mind and body is dependent so largely upon a 
 copious supply of pure air inhaled with reference to time 
 and manner, that no system of education can be successfully 
 carried out unless provision is made for the most complete 
 respiration of the lungs. 
 
 It is a fact well established in pathology that functional

 of the body. The properly trained singer and speaker are 
 rarely hoarse. Exemption from throat and lung troubles 
 among professional orators and singers is due to the skillful 
 use of eTcry organ involved in respiration, speech and song. 
 The public speaker or singer who excuses his performance 
 by confessing hoarseness thereby acknowledges his ignorance 
 and violation of one of nature's simplest laws. 
 
 If the teacher or student be disposed to ignore the 
 hygienic value of correct breathing, he is reminded that the 
 highest form of human utterance, whether aspirated or 
 vocalized in speech, or intonated in measured harmony, is 
 based upon the most intelligent command and use of the 
 respiratory apparatus. The stuttering, gasping, incoherent, 
 flighty, jerky or impetuous speech one sometimes hears 
 from a novice in the art of public speaking or singing, is 
 not traceable alone to. inexperience, but, in most cases, to 
 nervous embarrassment caused by imperfect respiration. 
 
 \t may be further stated that a larger part of the train- 
 ing course prescribed for orators and singers in professional 
 schools is devoted to securing command over the breath in 
 speech and song; and that the heart-reaching, soul-stirring 
 rendition of those sublime passages which have in ages past 
 moved the stoic to action and the sage to tears, can be re- 
 produced only, after all other conditions are presented, by 
 that perfect adaption of breath to the moulding of words 
 that live, and bum and glow — melting the heart to tears, 
 filling the ear with rapture and illuminating the soul with 
 celestial light, until the very air seems filled with seraphic 
 melodies of intelligences divine. 
 
 Every muscle of the waist, chest, ribs, axilla, back and 
 loins must be brought into action, and trained by intelligent 
 and persistent practice to perform its function. It will take 
 several months — even years, with older students— to accus- 
 tom all the muscles to act automatically and effectively.

 and attention will pay. It will pay in an increased bril- 
 liancy of intellect, happiness of temper and buoyancy of 
 spirit. It is the deep, full, vigorous breathers that possess 
 the most vigorous hearts, minds and bodies. 
 
 METHODS OF BREATHING. 
 
 While the ordinary methods of breathing are suflacientfor 
 the individual of vigorous outdoor pursuits, they ore not 
 sufficient for the scholar and man of thought engaged in

 sedentary pursuits. With these the stimuliiM generated by 
 bodily action is wanting to induce the deep inspirations 
 peculiar to the active man of outdoor life. The thinker 
 within his closet, the artist at his easel, the artisan at hia 
 table and the pupil at his desk, require a constant reinforce- 
 ment of mental energy. Much more than any of these does 
 the orator, lecturer and public reader demand the recupera- 
 tive agency of a perfect respiration. The requirement can 
 be filled only by the inhalation of the abundance of the 
 vitalizing oxygen contained in pure air, and art must be 
 called in to properly supply and distribute the regenerative 
 fluid. 
 
 GESTURE. 
 
 Gesture includes all positions and motions of the head, 
 face and limbs, employed to enforce or illustrate an idea, 
 emotion, or passion. 
 
 Its Importance — Gesture is the visible language of the 
 inner life. It portrays to the eye the workings of the mind, 
 the affections of the heart, and the varying passions and 
 emotions of the soul. It is as intelligible to the savage as 
 to the most enlightened. Entire plays are presented in pan- 
 tomime and are understood by observers as well as by the 
 players themselves. It gives to the eye what the ear often 
 fails to receive, and thus attracts and holds the attention 
 much more effectually than do words alone. 
 
 He who would successfully appeal to all the senses of 
 his audience — hold the eye, the heart, the soul ; summon 
 the approving smile, the sympathetic tear, the rapturous 
 applause ; sway the multitudes, lull them into complacency, 
 or move them to immediate action — must cultivate and skill- 
 fully employ this universal language of nature.

 KINDS OF GESTURE. 
 
 All gestures may be classed as Emphatic, infiltrative 
 and Locative. 
 
 Emphatic Gesture intensifies assertions by the applica- 
 tion of greater force to emphatic words ; as, "I will force 
 bim to the deed. " 
 
 Illustrative Gesture shows the manner, means, 
 degree, appearance, or effect ; as, " Ye gods, withhold your 
 wrath." 
 
 Locative Gesture designates the position, direction or 
 place ; as, " Look not in the past for hope. "

 REQUISITES OF GESTURE. 
 
 The requisites of gesture are Grace, Variety, Simplicity, 
 Boldness, Energy, Precision, Emphasis and Propriety. 
 These must be in harmony with the accompansring vocal 
 expressions. 
 
 INITIAL MOVEMENTS. 
 
 The entrance or first appearance of the speaker before 
 the audience is a critical moment. Impressions are then 
 made which often affect his entire subsequent performance. 
 
 The Walk — The walk is the mirror of character. 
 Through it the artist reads the very thoughts the performer 
 would conceal, and though we can change our walk only as 
 we change the temperament that walk portrays, we can by 
 practice secure a style of motion that will occasion no 
 unfavorable comment. 
 
 Directions — Stand erect ; summon the most animated 
 thoughts; assume "active chest"; imagine yourself drawn 
 forward by a force acting about the waist ; preserve a per- 
 fect poise — the head well balanced, the chin neither pro- 
 jected nor retracted. 
 
 Lift one thigh forward, the lower leg and foot hanging 
 loosely and straighten the knee, as the foot is planted as near- 
 ly flat as the high heel will permit. Follow with the other 
 limb in the same manner, observing that the chest is full, 
 the unseen power acting at the waist and the knee straight- 
 ening as the foot strikes the floor. 
 
 The Bow — Standing in the First Position (see Positions), 
 after a momentary look into the eyes of the audience, bring 
 the right foot back so as to assume Second Position, bend 
 the body and head slightly and directly forward. In the 
 retiring bow, as the body bends forward bring the right toe 
 to the heel of the left foot, the right knee bent and pressed 
 firmly against the back of the left knee. Step to the left 
 with the left foot and retire.

 'Attitudes — The disposition of the entire figure, when 
 at rest, is important, and should receive careful attention. 
 Every posture assumed by the speaker is significant. These 
 should be easy, graceful and flexible, but, above all, they 
 must be in harmony with the prevailing sentiment. 
 
 Head, Bodt, Hands and Feet — Stand erect, chest full, 
 head evenly poised, the arms hanging easily at the sides, or 
 one'>arm at the waist; weight at first supported mainly on 
 both feet, one of which should be a little in advance of the 
 other. Keep the knees well stiffened, and be prepared to 
 make .changes naturally and gracefully.

 THE FOUR POSITIONS, 
 
 I. Unemotional — First Position — -Support the weight 
 of the body mainly on the left foot. Advance the right foot 
 obliquely at an angle of eighty degree9 and in such a posi- 
 tion that the right heel is from two to/our inches in front of 
 hollow of the left foot. 
 
 Second Position — Support the weight of the body main- 
 ly on the right foot. Advance the left foot obliquely at an 
 angle of eighty degrees, and in such a position that the left 
 heel ia from two to four inches in front of the hollow of the 
 right foot. 
 
 II. Emotional — Third Position. — From either the 
 first or second position move the right foot obliquely for- 
 ward a short step, the feet remaining at the same angle. 
 Support the body on the right foot and turn the left so that 
 the feet form an obtuse angle; raise the left heel slightly, 
 and balance the body, which is thrown a little forward, with 
 the inside ball of the left foot. 
 
 FoiriiTH Position. — From either the first or second posi- 
 tion, move the left foot obliquely forward a short step, the 
 feet remaining at the same angle. Support the body on the 
 left foot and turn the right so that the feet form an obtuse 
 angle; raise the right heel slightly and balance the body, 
 which is thrown a little forward, with the inside ball of the 
 right foot. , 
 
 Changes of Position. — In the delivery of unemotional 
 thought there should be few changes, and all movements 
 shotild be performed within a limited space. In the ex- 
 pression of emotional thought and heated passion, changes 
 of position and greater freedom of movement are permis- 
 sible; yet even here, the speaker mustjconfine himself within 
 the bounds of propriety. The impetuous, headlong and 
 boisterous plunges up and down the platform suggest noL 
 strength and vigorous emotion under the control of a power-

 Position op ths Head. — The head is presumed to 
 guide the motions of the body, and should be so held as to 
 command the respect of au audience. 
 
 Its various positions foreshadow the thought before it is 
 expressed. An erect position of the head suggests confidence, 
 dignity and honor; thrown back, humor, pride or vanity; 
 inclined forward, humility and grief ; inclined aside, languor: 
 while a tossing motion implies contempt and anger.

 POSITION OF THE HANDS. 
 
 The various positions assumed by the hands are highly 
 significant, and should be thoughtfully studied. 
 
 In repose the hands should be a model of grace; the 
 forefinger should be gently extended, the thumb extended 
 and nearly parallel with the first finger, the second finger 
 slightly curved, the third finger, forming a semi-circle. 
 Study the attitudes of statuary and adapt your positions to 
 those models that are regarded as specimens of the highest 
 art. 
 
 The hand is said to be supine when open, fingers relaxed 
 and palm upward, indicating entreaty, appeal, light, joyous 
 emotions and general description. 
 
 It is prone when open, fingers extended and palm down- 
 ward; used in denial, degradation and concealment. 
 
 It is vertical when open, fingers extended and palm out- 
 ward; \xseA m repelling, disgust, abhorrence, warding off and 
 defining a limit. 
 
 It is clenched when tightly closed; used in anger, defi- 
 ance and threatening. 
 
 It is pointing when loosely closed, forefinger and thumb 
 uppermost and extended; used in pointing sjidi. designating. 
 
 It is clasped, applied, folded, crossed, enumerating, 
 touching, when used in description and designation. 
 
 DIRECTION OF MOVEMENT. 
 
 Before attempting any of the following exercises in ges- 
 ture with the hands, the pupil should become familiar with 
 the various terms used in indicating direction and the sig- 
 nificance of such direction:

 IWXTENDED — Indicating vastness in space, time^ quantity 
 or idea. Gestures made direct from the speaker's side are 
 termed "extended."

 initenesa. Gestures made between the " front " and

 Backwaed — Expressive of remoteness of time or space. 
 Gestures back of the ' ' extended " are called ' ' backward. " 
 
 Descending! — Expressing determination or emphasis. 
 Gestures made below the horizontal line of the chest are 
 called "descending." 
 
 Horizontal. — Pertaining to the intellect. Gestures 
 made by extending the hand and arm in a line horizontal to 
 the chest (whether front, oblique, to the side or backward) 
 are called "horizontal." 
 
 Ascending. — Alluding to the ideal or imagination. 
 Gestures made above the horizontal are termed "ascend- 
 ing." 
 
 Ictus of Gesture. — The ictus of gesture is applied to 
 the accented syllable of the word with which it Is used. 
 
 Both Hands. — Both hands are often used, making the 
 same motions, to give greater breadth of thought, broader 
 expanse, and more intensity of motion . 
 
 Arm Motions. — To secure facility and [grace of gesture, 
 a short preliminary exercise, employing both arms simul- 
 taneously, is of great advantage. Every exercise in gesture 
 should be preceded by several whole arm movement combi- 
 nations, the nature of which will be suggested after the fol- 
 lowing description of an exercise the author has used most 
 advantageously with students.

 sides. Raise both the arms, bringing the Hands toward each 
 other in front, near the body and slightly turning them so 
 that the forefingers just touch by the time the hands meet 
 at the waist; continue raising the hands, fingers relaxed and 
 slightly curved, palms gradually turning inward, until the 
 chin is reached, when the fingers gradually extend. From 
 this point the hands separate, the whole arms sweep through 
 a graceful curve downward and backward through the hori- 
 zontal, oblique and extended directions; the palms afc first 
 upward, gradually turn inward, then downward, whea the

 arms curve and the hands are brought again together at the 
 waist as when raised from the sides in the initial motion. 
 This movement is to be repeated many times until familiar, 
 after which others can be developed from it, which will be 
 of great service in imparting ease and grace to gesture. 
 
 MODE OF GESTURE. 
 
 The grace of gesture is expressed in the compound curve, 
 sometimes called " Hogarth's line of beauty. " The motion 
 of the arm originates in the shoulder, is then transmitted to 
 the arm, and forearm, whence the hand and the fingers re- 
 ceive the impulse and both gradually curving as the arm is 
 raised until the chest (on the side opposite the arm employed) 
 is reached, when the arms, hands and fingers unbend and reach 
 full extension at the ictus. 
 
 The curve of arm gesture, expressive of pleasing, tran- 
 quil and serious thought, and employed in narration , descrip- 
 tion and argument, is beautifully illustrated in the varied 
 motions that may be described with a flexible willow twig. 
 
 The direction of motion in the gesture of violent passion 
 and uncontrollable excitement, whether occasioned by anger, 
 fright or joy, is best illustrated in the angular flash of the 
 falling thunderbolt 
 
 From these illustrations the learner will readily infer the 
 the character of gesture required when he has determined 
 the sentiment contained in the composition. 
 
 FACIAL EXPRESSION. 
 
 Facial Ezpbession is the adaptation of the counte- 
 nance to the sentiment to be expressed. 
 
 Of the face Quintilian has said: " The face is the dom- 
 inant power of expression. With this we supplicate ; with 
 this we threaten: with this we soothe; with this we mourn; 
 with this we rejoice; with this we triumph; with this w«

 The effect of the vocal delivery is so much heightened 
 by a sympathetic expression of the face, that the student of 
 elocution, whether preparing for the stage, rostrum, bar, 
 or pulpit, should on no account neglect this important aid 
 to Mb delivery. 
 
 While much preliminary training in this department of 
 expression la necessary, in its application the student must

 first feel the sentiment to be uttered, then the appropriate 
 facial expression will follow. Beware of useless facial con- 
 tortions'; they are not only inappropriate, they are disfigur- 
 ing and repulsive. 
 
 EXPRESSION OF THE EYES. 
 
 The eye is the most expressive of all the features. It is 
 here the mysterious workings of the mind are imaged forth 
 in unmistakable language before the tongue moves in obedi- 
 ence to the will. 
 
 From it the soul looks forth and communes with kindred 
 spirits. The expectant child reads in its mother's eye the 
 answer to its wish. The stiicken heart, unable to bear the 
 burden, sends forth its mute appeals for human sympathy 
 through eyes that tell the inward sorrow. 
 
 But while philosophers and poets have combined in 
 praise of the wondrous beauty, variety and expressiveness 
 of the eye, to the orator, it has peculiar interest which he 
 cannot ignore. It is not simply a means of expression, but 
 to the speaker it is an instrument of control second to no 
 other agency of oratorical power. The speaker who looks 
 directly into the eyes of his audience holds them beyond 
 their power of escape. Every person present feels the mag- 
 netic influence of the speaker and fancies himself the partic- 
 ular person addressed. 
 
 The failure to use this wonderful power explains why 
 
 so many desultory speakers and manuscript readers do not 
 
 secure attention and move tlieir audiences to thought and 
 
 action. If you must use a manuscript, acquire the habit of 
 
 looking away from it at times and into the eyes of your 
 
 hearers.

 Be definite and decided in your action. Decision of 
 gestnre is more important than grace ; combine the two. 
 
 In shifting from one foot to the other avoid dropping 
 either hip or shoulder. 
 
 Though appropriate gesture is pleasing to the eye and 
 greatly assists the hearer in comprehending the thought, the 
 pupil is reminded that too little gesture is better than acou- 
 tinnona or even frequent sawing of the air. 
 
 During the action of gesture the arm should be kept 
 moving all the time — rarely stationary for a single instant

 When reading, attempt no gesture unless you can look 
 from your book or manuscript and preclude the gesture with 
 your eyes. 
 
 The ictus of the gesture should be on the emphatic 
 word, and the hand performing the gesture should return to 
 the side or proceed with another gesture. 
 
 Keep your face full or three-quarters full toward your 
 audience, unless personation should require it otherwise. 
 
 In personating two characters^ have one speak to the 
 right and the other to the left. Explanations require a full 
 face to the audience. 
 
 Use curved lines in gesture in all cases except those 
 portraying sudden and impressioned emotions. 
 
 As a general rule in single gesture, use the right arm, 
 with the right foot advanced in preference to the left. The 
 left, however, is often conveniently used in the mimicry of 
 awkward characters. 
 
 Do not permit the love of dress display to mar the effect 
 of your delivery by making you appear ridiculous. Taste in 
 dress is little less important than appropriate language and 
 delivery. 
 
 Let your changes in gesture accord with the language. 
 The more rapid the thought and violent the emotion, the 
 more sudden the transitions. Calm, dignified and reflective 
 thought requires slow, measured, graceful changes. 
 
 When the change of thought requires a change of posi- 
 tion, make such change while speaking, not before nor after; 
 that is, move as you enter upon the new thought. 
 
 Gesture should not accompany the description of the act, 
 but the act itself; as, "But Dooglas round him drew his 
 cloak," etc., receives no gesture; wait till tho words accom- 
 panying the action are spokea. 
 
 Observe the attitudes and pastures of great orators, 
 actors and successful lecturera.

 PRONUNCIATION. 
 
 Pronunciation from pro, forth, ■nuncio, I annonnce, is 
 the act of vocal and articulate utterance of words according 
 to prevailing usage. 
 
 The pronunciation of the English language is not uni- 
 form in time or place. The usage of the twentieth century 
 is not that of the nineteenth. The general style of the 
 bustling metropolis differs from the leisurely uttered words 
 of the field and hamlet. The accent Bast is in contrast to 
 that of the West as marked as the dialect of the South dif- 
 fers from other sections. So, too, the followers of car-

 tain occupations manifest their calling by peculiarities of 
 ucctint and enanciation. The stress and tones of the sea- 
 faring man vary in a marked degree from those of the camp 
 and court. Again, the usage of the mountains is not that 
 of the plains and valleys; and the contrast between the artic- 
 ulation and accent one hears on the coast and in the inte- 
 rior is equally marked. 
 
 Changes in pronimciation, due to changes in the manner 
 of living, social and political conditions, advance of com- 
 merce and caprice of fashion are constantly going on — ^in 
 some sections more rapidly than in others. While some 
 communities, influenced by the busy activities around them, 
 accept almost every new style of utterance, others, more 
 isolated, and, therefore, more- tenacious of early acquire- 
 ments, resist all innovations, and cling to those familiar 
 sounds to which they have been accustomed. Thus differ- 
 ences in pronunciation originate and continue in the same 
 country. 
 
 Notwithstanding these differences in local usage, there 
 is a standard of pronunciation to which the critical scholai-a 
 of all sections conform. Among literary people of tlie 
 United States this standard is recognized in the latest edi- 
 tions of Webster's International and the Century diction- 
 aries. Professor Brown, whose works on Elocution have 
 long been regarded as the most authoritative, especially on 
 Kespiration, Articulation and Pronunciation, recognized but 
 one standard authority 'on pronunciation, viz., Webster's 
 International Dictionary. 
 
 The "Principles of Pronunciation " contained in the lat- 
 ter work, should be carefully studied by all who aspire to* 
 accuracy in spoken English. A mispronounced word, or 
 even an unusual authorized pronunciation coming from the 
 pulpit, stage or rostrum, distracts the hearer's attention, 
 mars the beauty of diction, and compromises the speaker's

 culture in the estimation of liis audience even more than the 
 absence of an eloquent delivery. 
 
 Pronunciation comprises articulation, syllabication and 
 accent. A skillful articulation is acquired by first securing 
 the correct sounds of the vocal elements, and then by per- 
 sistent practice, making them so familiar to the tongue and 
 ear that every combination, however diflacult, can be sounded 
 instantly and correctly. 
 
 ARTICULATION. 
 
 Aeticulation is the process of forming and combining 
 the elementary sounds of language. 
 


## p. (#51) #################################################

 The importance of this subject entitles it to rank second 
 only to respiration as a requisite to the greatest excellence 
 in the art of elocution and extemporaneous speaking. With- 
 out this element, cultivated to the highest perfection, all 
 other elements of vocal culture fail to form the accomplished 
 reader or speaker. 
 
 Not by the English speaking orator alone, is articulation 
 deemed of great importance. French and German teachers 
 and statesmen give much attention to the subject. Says 
 Legouvfe: "Articulation and articulation alone, gives clear- 
 ness, energy, passion and force. Such is its power that it 
 can even overcome deficiency of voice in the presence of a 
 large audience. There have been actors of the foremost 
 rank who had scarcely any voice. Potier had no voice. 
 Monvel, the famous Monvel, not only had no voice, he had 
 no teeth ! and yet no one ever lost a word that fell from hia 
 lips; and never was there a more delightful, more moving 
 artist than he, thanks to his perfect articulation. " 
 
 That articulation shall secure the greatest benefit to the 
 speaker two conditions must be observed: 
 
 First — It must be correct. 
 
 Second — It must be distinct. 
 
 The first of these implies that the student shall acquaint 
 himself with the powers and applications of all the elemen- 
 tary constituents of the language, in order that he may know 
 the exact element required for each oral combination. The 
 second condition demands that he shall so completely master 
 the vocal utterance of every element that no mistake can 
 possibly arise as to what particular sound is uttered. 
 
 Correctness of articulation is acquired by frequent refer- 
 ence to the standard dictionaries, supplemented by immedi- 
 ate and intelligent practice. Here it should be observed 
 that a distinct articulation without being correct is like legi- 
 ble writing containing many mispelled words; while it is

 Diatinctnesa of articulation is secured, first, by frequent 
 practice upon the exercises prepared for drill, and afterwards 
 by constant attention to every word and sentence uttered, 
 until the habit of con-ect and decided articulation is fixed 
 beyond the necessity of attention. Faulty articulation often 
 arises from an inability to control the speech organs. The 
 remedy is daily practice upon the elementary sounds and 
 syllables. 
 
 As to what constitute* a ^'Just articulation" nothing

 better can be sidd than the oft-quoted words of Austin: 
 ' ' The words are not hurried over, nor precipitated syllable 
 over syllable; nor, as it were, melted together into a mass 
 of confusion; they are neither abridged nor prolonged; nor 
 swallowed, nor forced, and, if I may so express myself, 
 shot from mouth to mouth; they are not trailed nor drawled, 
 nor let slip out carelessly, so as to drop unfinished. They 
 are deliyeied out from the lips as beautiful coins newly 
 issued from the mint, deeply and accurately impressed, per- 
 f ecUy finished, neatly struck by the proper oi^ans, distinct, 
 sharp, in due succession, and of due weight. " 
 
 As the impassioned style of oratory peculiar to the old 
 Greeks and Bomans is giving way to the more intellectual 
 and argumentative form of delivery, teachers of the present 
 are giving more attention to ease and precision of speech 
 than did their predecessors. Upon this point Professor 
 Eossell says: " The appropriate style of modem eloquence 
 is that of intellectual, more than impassioned expression; 
 and enunciation being of all the functions of the voice, 
 that which is most important to the conveyance of thought 
 and meaning, it justly requires, in the course of education, 
 more attention and practice than any other branch of elo- 
 cution. " 
 
 EXERCISES IN ARTICULATION. 
 
 Indistinct and faulty articulation frequently results from 
 an imperfect command of the brain over the muscles 
 involved in speech ; hence one of the greatest benefits to be 
 derived from the persistent practice upon difiScult combina- 
 tions is to establish that intimate connection between the 
 mental powers and the physical organs which will permit no 
 uncert^n utterance. 
 
 Let the student acquire the power of concentrating his 
 attention upon what he is saying, and the difiSculties of artic- 
 ulation Yrill speedily disappear. Bepeat each sentence once

 MODULATION. 
 
 Modulation is the ready and perfect adaptation of the 
 appropriate elements of speech to the sentiment designed to 
 be conveyed. Voice is vocalized breath and as such its for- 
 mation depends upon the method of exhalation employed 
 in phonation and speech. 
 
 As there are three methods of forcing the air from the

 lungs, termed effusive, expulsive and explosive, bo there are 
 thi-ee modes of utterance derived from the manner of 
 expiration. 
 
 The characteristic too of the Effusive utterance is that 
 of tranquillity, pathos, grandeur and devotion. 
 
 The Expulnve utterance ranges in use from ordinary 
 description and narration to the highest forms of argumenta- 
 tive discourse. 
 
 The Explosive utterance is employed in the expression 
 of sudden anger, terror, ectasy and command. 
 
 No one mode of utterance is likely to be appropriate to 
 an entire composition. The Effusive is rarely found in 
 more than two or three consecutive words. The Expulsive 
 is more common than the others, being employed in the 
 greater part of every conversation. 
 
 5UDES. 
 
 Slides, sometimes termed inflections, are concrete chang- 
 es of pitch, either upward ( /) or downward (\ ) on a single 
 element or word. They vary in extent of elevation or 
 depression according to the nature of the sentiment. 
 
 The purpose of slides is to convey more accurately those 
 delicate shades of meaning found in abstract reasoning, 
 unemotional description and narration, to give clearness to 
 contrasted ideas and vigor to expressions of earnestness, 
 emotion and passion. 
 
 No marked degree of excellence in expressive reading may 
 be expected until the student has given much time to the 
 practice and intelligent study of the principles governing 
 voice slides. 
 
 UPWARD SLIDE. 
 
 The Upward Slide is an elevation of the voice through 
 the concrete change of pitch, the degree of elevation depend- 
 inij upon the intensity of the thought or emotion. It is em- 
 


## p. (#57) #################################################

AND MODEL ELOCUTIONIST. £5 
 
 ployed apon the accented syllables of those words used 
 singly, in phrases or in sentences denoting indifference, un- 
 certainty, incompleteness, daubt, contingency, negation, direct 
 intet rogation, tenderness, pathos, surprise, wonder, anticipa- 
 tion, 
 
 DOWNWARD SLIDE. 
 
 The Downward Slide is a downward movement of the 
 voice through concrete change of pitch, the degree of de- 
 pression depending upon the completeness, exactness, or 
 definiteness of the thought in the speaker's mind. It is em- 
 ployed upon those syllables used singly, in phrases or in 
 sentences denoting completeness, determination, certainty, 
 command, passion, positive, and decisive declaration. 
 
 WAVES. 
 
 The wave (3) sometimes termed circumflex from the 
 twisting or crooked motion of the tone in passing over the 
 vowels, is a compound movement of voice on a single sylla- 
 ble, word or sentence. 
 
 The Upward Wave, expressive of eompUtenets, is the 
 union of the Upward and downward Slides; as, ah. The 
 Downward Wave expresses the incompleteness; as, ah. 
 
 The Upward Single Equal Wave expresses astonishment, 
 admiration. 
 
 The Downward Single Equal Wave expresses scorn, con- 
 tempt, ridicule, mockery, sneer. 
 
 The Wave of the Second, employed with a subdued force 
 and low pitch, is used to express dignified admiration, 
 mild contrast, gentle yet all-pervading emotions of reverence 
 and awe, sentiments of beauty, sublimity, grandeur, devotion 
 and adoration. 
 
 The Wave of the Third is the characteristic wave of 
 playful unt, humor, good natured raillery, mirth, jest, 
 


## p. (#58) #################################################

S6 THE yIMERlCMN STAR SPEAKER 
 
 drollery, insinuation, double meaning, mimicry and strong 
 
 contrast. 
 
 PAUSES. 
 
 Pauses are temporary suspensions of speech between 
 ■words, phrases and clauses, conveying first, the sentimental, 
 second the Emotional, and third the Rhythmical. 
 
 EMPHASIS, 
 
 Emphasis is that peculiar utterance of words, phrases and 
 clauses which renders them especially prominent or signifi- 
 cant. Emphasis is effected by a change of quality, force, 
 stress, pitch, slides, waves, movement or quantity, or by 
 lengthening the pauses. Usually two or more of these ele- 
 ments are employed to produce the required emphasis. 
 
 SLUR. 
 
 Slur is a smooth, rapid, subdued movement of voice over 
 certain words, phrases and clauses of less importance than 
 others with which they stand associated. It is applied to 
 passages expressing contrast, repetition, explanation, modi- 
 fications, of persons, things, time, place, cause, manner and 
 degree and all parenthetical expression. 
 
 QUALITY OF VOICE. 
 
 There are eight qualities of voice commonly recognized 
 by the best readers: Pure Tone, Plaintive, Guttural, Natal, 
 Orotund, Pectoral, Aspirate and Falsetto. 
 
 PiTEE Tone is a clear, pure, smooth, round, musical 
 tone, the reverberations being confined wholly within the 
 mouth. It is used in the expression of pathos, tenderness, 
 in solemn, serious, tranquil narrative, didactic and descriptive 
 thought, in calling and in joyous and mirthful emotions. 
 
 The Orotund quality is the Pure Tone deepened and 
 intensified to its utmost magnitp.de, with the resonance m 
 


## p. (#59) #################################################

/IND MODEL ELOCUTIONIST. 67 
 
 the chest. It is employed in the expression of emotions of 
 grandeur, sublimit^/, reverence, adoration, devotion, awe. 
 
 The Plaintive quality sometimes termed the semi-tone, 
 or oral, is that quality of voice whose tones, sliding through 
 a semi-tone or minor third, are uttered in a feeble, trem- 
 bling tone, with the resonance in the forward part of the 
 mouth. It is used to express tenderness, sympathy, pathos, 
 sadness, acute pain, feebleness of old age, grief, entreaty, 
 complaint, exhaustion, languor and affectation. 
 
 The Pectoral quality is a rough, harsh, hollow tone, 
 with the resonance in the chest, and is used to express 
 dread, sorrow, gloom, despair, grief, deep solemnity mingled 
 with awe, remorse, horror, settled hatred, malice. 
 
 The Guttural quality (from guttur, throat), is a rough, 
 harsh, grating, rasping, discordant sound produced by a 
 rigid compression of the muscles of the neck and a partial 
 closing of the throat above the glottis, with the resonance 
 in the throat. The quality resembles the growling utter- 
 ances of the lower animals. It is used to express intense 
 anger, hatred, contempt, scorn, disgust, loathing, malice and 
 detestation. 
 
 The Aspirate quality is articulated breath and ranges 
 from a mere whisper to the least audible tone of the Plain- 
 tive, Pectoral and Guttural qualities. It is used to express 
 secrecy, surprise, impatience, fear, caution, remorse, awe, 
 dread, anger, rage, terror, horror, and expiring life. 
 
 The Nasal quality (from nasus, the nose), is a harsh, 
 thin twangy tone, with the resonance in the nose. It is 
 used in the mimicry of nasal speakers and in the personation 
 of those suffering from colds and is made by prolonging the 
 syllable ong. 
 
 The Falsetto quality (ixovufalsus, false), is a screechy, 
 high, shrill tone, pitched above the natural, .with the reso- 
 nance in the head. The Falsetto begins where the pure tone 
 


## p. (#60) #################################################

58 THE /IMERICAN ST/IR SPEAKER 
 
 breaks, or outruns its compass. It ia illustrated hy the 
 sharp, shrill shriek of the owl. Like the Nasal, it is used 
 m mimicry, to denote excitement, irritability, scolding, 
 invective, mockery, sudden fright, cmger, pain, terror and 
 irritable old age. 
 
 FORCE. 
 
 Force is the degree of energy, depending upon the inten- 
 sity of feeling with which speech is delivered, and is 
 divided into three classes. Subdued, Moderate and Full, 
 while each may still further be divided into three degrees. 
 
 Subdued Force is used to express tenderness, pathos, 
 sadness, seriousness, solemnity, reverence, awe, melancholy 
 and tranquillity. 
 
 Moderate Force is employed in the expression of nar- 
 rative, descriptive and didactic thought, and may be used to 
 express the milder forms of solemnity, sublimity, grandeur 
 and devotion and in introductions to orations. 
 
 Full Force is eniployed in the expression of strong 
 emotion, a,9 joy, gladness, courage, boldness, defiance, anger, 
 profound sublimity, and grandeur, and is the delivery of 
 political, senatorial and judicial speeclies of an exalted 
 oratorical character. 
 
 STRESS. 
 
 Stress is the application of Force to some particular 
 part of a word or syllable. There are six divisions of Stress : 
 Radical Medium Fmal 
 
 Compound Thorough Intermittent. 
 
 PITCH, 
 
 Pitch is the degree of elevation or depression of sound 
 above or below the keynote, and is divided into High, Mid- 
 dle and Low. 
 


## p. (#61) #################################################

^ND MODEL ELOCUTIONIST. 59 
 
 nOVEMENT. 
 
 Movement is the degree of rapidity or slowness with 
 which words are uttered in continuous discourse, and is 
 divided into rapid, moderate and slow, with further subdi- 
 visions of very rapid and very slow. 
 
 MELODY. 
 
 Melody (Gr. sweet song) is a. succession of pleasing 
 tones having but a limited compass above or below the ini- 
 tial note, with prevailing pitch above the natural. It is one 
 of the most valuable elements the speaker may employ iu 
 attracting and retaining the attention of an audience. The 
 element is employed in those rhythmical compositions, 
 whether prose or poetry, expressing riatJios, tranquil plea»- 
 ure und peaceful repose. 
 
 ORIGINAL DISCOURSE. 
 
 Thus far the student has been instructed in the manner 
 only of expressing the thoughts of others. While the ability 
 to comprehend instantly and render effectively an author's 
 thoughts, as outlined upon the printed page, is an accomplish- 
 ment of great value to all, such an attainment is not sufficient 
 for the broad and general culture required by our times and 
 institutions. 
 
 The responsibilities thrust upon us by the republican 
 form of government under which we live, perpetuated in its 
 purity and efficiency by the logic of a Choate, the wisdom 
 of a Webster and the eloquence of a Clay, demand attain- 
 ments of a higher order than mere skill in the pathetic, for- 
 cible or eloquent repetition of some popular compositions. 
 
 The citizen who would form at least a unit in the repub- 
 lic must be competent to wield the pen, and, when called 
 


## p. (#62) #################################################

eO THE /IMERICj4N ST/ili SPEAKER 
 
 npon, be prepared to address his countrymen intelligently 
 upon the questions of the day. His duty to himself and 
 country demand that, whether he write or speak, his perfor- 
 mance should be creditable and effective. 
 
 A ready, vigorous pen and speech, like reading and dec- 
 lamation, comes from instruction, practice and criticism. 
 
 EXTEnPORANEOUS SPEECH. 
 
 The greatest excellence to which the student, ambitious 
 of oratorical fame, may aspire, is comprised in the ability to 
 speak fluently, logically and effectively, upon any subject, at 
 any time, without previous preparation. 
 
 This accomplishment may be termed "thinking on one's 
 fe^it. " It is not the result of any spontaneous development. 
 It X)mes from study, practice, work. 
 
 The power to charm the heart and steal away the senses, 
 to divert the mind from its own devisings, and hold an audi- 
 ence in breathless spell, as the orator paints the rosy tints 
 of heavenly longings, or leads the imagination down through 
 the labyrinths of wonderland, or depicts with lightning 
 tongue and thunder tones the horrors of the doomed, comes 
 not by nature, but by work — ^work — work. 
 
 Whether this so-called gift be assisted by the early efforts 
 of a Demosthenes declaiming over the sea-beat cliffs of Attica 
 or the harangues of a youthful Clay before a group of oxen, 
 perfection in delivery is attained only by frequent and long- 
 continued practice, based upon accurate observation and 
 zealous study. 
 
 THE TWO FORMS OF EXTEHPORANEOUS SPEECH. 
 
 1. CONVERSATION. 2. PUBLIC SPEAKING, 
 
 Conversation is the general and familiar interchange of 
 sentiments. 
 
 No form of social Intercourse furnishes so much human- 
 


## p. (#63) #################################################

^ND MODEL ELOCUTIONIST. 81 
 
 jzing enjoyment as pleasing and entertaining conversation. 
 Notwithstanding the pleasure it affords, few people, even 
 among the educated classes, are capable of entertaining a 
 company by continuous intelligent discourse. 
 
 The student is here reminded that unconnected remarks, 
 followed by ambiguous or meaningless monosyllabic rejoind- 
 ers interspersed with nauseating repetition of such expletives 
 as "Yes, indeed," "You don't say so," "You bet," etc., do 
 not constitute elevating discourse. 
 
 Conversation is an art, and as such it is capable of culti- 
 vation to approximate perfection. Success in the higher forms 
 of speech depends upon the conversational skill of the aspirant 
 for oratorical honors. 
 
 GENERAL RULES FOR CONVERSATION. 
 
 {Bead the Introduction to this book.) 
 
 Breathe without gasping or attracting attention. 
 
 Articulate distinctly, but do not impress your hearers 
 with the idea that you are going through an exercise in vocal 
 gymnastics. 
 
 Be natural; remember it is yourself you are impersonat- 
 ing, and you will be judged accordingly. 
 
 In general, use a full, pure tone, moderate force, rad- 
 ical stress, middle pitch, and moderate movement. In those 
 parts of your conversation requiring peculiar description and 
 personation, use the appropriate elements. 
 
 Enter into the spirit of the subject with all your mind. 
 Cultivate the habit of listening to others. This is at least 
 polite. Attention to what others say is the relay from 
 which you are enabled to continue your part of the conver- 
 sation intelligibly and agreeably to the other members of 
 your company. 
 
 Avoid pedantry, affectation, and all mannerisms calcu- 
 lated to detract from the general topic of conversation. 
 
 Conceive, summon, and express your best thoughts. 
 


## p. (#64) #################################################

68 THE AMERICAN STAR SPEAKER 
 
 Employ the simplest, purest and most expressive lan- 
 guage at your command. 
 
 Avoid unpleasant personalities particularly with refer- 
 ence to those who are absent 
 
 Avoid topics of little general interest to your listeners . 
 
 However familiar to the company the condition of the 
 weather and streets may be, their prolonged discussion is 
 not BufiBciently important to justify more than a passing

 Indulge sparingly in raillery and cutting repartee. A

 QGNECIAL. RULES FOR PUBLIC SPEAKING. 
 
 Public extemporaneous speaking is the delivery of senti- 
 ment without previous written preparation. 
 
 The speaker employs the same elements as in conversa- 
 tion, but upon an enlarged scale. To these he may, as 
 occasion requires, add depth and fullness to his quality, 
 producing the grand tones of the Orotund; he may increase 
 his force, raise his pitch, and indulge in a greater variety of 
 stress, movement, and pauses than in ordinary conversation. 
 In addition to these departures he may Energize and embel- 
 lish his delivery by gesture and facial expression; and, 
 generally, he may play upon the accidental elements in 
 arousing the emotions of an audience more than would be 
 proper in the most animated conversation. 
 
 Of all professions recognized by civilized man, probably 
 none requires in its perfection so many and varied accom- 
 plishments as that of oratory. The public lecturer who leads 
 the van in the march of science for the improvement of 
 society, the statesman, who guards the nation's rights and 
 shapes his country's destiny, the man of God, who seeks to 
 purify the human heart and save a fallen race — all must 
 wield the wondrous power of speech.

 How far the orators of the past have possessed this com- 
 prehensive art of arts is largely answered in the social, gov- 
 emmentAl, and religious freedom of modern times. 
 
 GENERAL REQUISITES. 
 
 The orator should have a liberal education: 
 
 He should be actuated by the noblest impulses. 
 
 He should be endowed with the highest attributes of 
 humanity. 
 
 Every physical organ should be subordinate to the will. 
 
 The summation of all these qualifications, Cicero tells 
 us, marks the perfect man. 
 
 He should possess the most extended information upon 
 all subjects. To this end he should have frequent practice 
 in readmg, conversation, speaking and writing. 
 
 SPECIFIC RULES FOR EXTEMPORANEOUS SPBAKINa. 
 
 Have something to say worth hearing. 
 
 Believe and feel intensely all you say. 
 
 Be wide awake and thoroughly in earnest. 
 
 Merge yourself into the thoughts you are littering. 
 
 Look into the eyes of your hearers, not over their heads. 
 
 Know more of the subject than do any of your auditors. 
 
 Beyonrself; you cannot personate another with your ideas. 
 
 Endeavor to hold your hearers that they may not wander 
 from the subject. 
 
 Avoid all forms of slang; no speaker ever exhausted the 
 English language. 
 
 If you have five or ten minutes for preparation, think of 
 the proposition only. 
 
 Cultivate facility and elegance of expression by using 
 good language at all times. 
 
 Never lose control of your thoughts, your breath, your 
 speech or your temper. 
 


## p. (#66) #################################################

64 THE /IMERIC/IN STAR SPEAKER 
 
 Maintain a constant reserve; the orator mast appear 
 greater than his theme or his effort. 
 
 Think only of what you are going to say; your grammar, 
 rhetoric and elocution will suggest the manner. 
 
 Keep the voice and speech organs moist, not hy drink, 
 but by chewing a bit of paper just before using the voice. 
 
 Have a complete mastery of all the elements of elocu- 
 tion; thus your body and limbs are made Bubjective to the 
 mental powers. 
 
 Hold yourself flexibly erect with an active chest. The 
 weight should be supported mainly on the balls of the feet, 
 not the heels. 
 
 Command a faultless articulation, an accurate pronunci- 
 ation and an absolute control of the essential elements of 
 vocal expression. 
 
 Carefully study the speeches of eminent orators known 
 to be extemporaneous; consider the time, place and circum- 
 stances of their delivery. 
 
 Study the models furnished by Demosthenes, Cicero, 
 Fox, Sheridan, Burke, Webster and Clay, and modern ora- 
 tors of recognized ability. 
 
 In passing from one sentiment or emotion to another, 
 strive to feel the emotion before attempting its utterance ; 
 words without feeling awake no responsive chord among 
 your hearers. 
 
 Avoid great force in the beginning by studied distinct- 
 ness and deliberate movement. Your audience must be led 
 by measured tones of persuasion gradually up to the more 
 Intensified forms of expression. 
 
 Commit and frequently recite aloud a few excellent pas- 
 sages abounding in decided sentiment, absorbing emotion 
 and vehement passion. The possession of the words gives 
 the mind opportunity to dwell upon the thoughts, and thus 
 their frequent conception and utterance trains the nerves),

 muscles and vocal organs to command the required expres- 
 sion at will. Stop the moment yov, are done. 
 
 SPEAKING FROM NOTES. 
 
 When the speaker has sufQcient time to collect and arrange 
 his thoughts he shonld endeavor to think of all he wishes to 
 say upon the subject, and write the beads of his thoughts as 
 they occur, and afterward arrange them in the most appro- 
 priate order. 
 
 In general, the imost pleasing and entertaining matter 
 should appear first. The auditors are never so critical as 
 whei. the speaker steps upon the platform. An unfavor- 
 able impression once made is too difficult to overcome to 
 justify the speaker's giving it an occasion. 
 
 The closing thoughts should possess merit and original, 
 ity, and should be spoken with such sincerity, vigor and 
 eloquence that an andience shall respect at least the advo- 
 cate, if not the sentiment he utters. 
 
 Do not be tedious. Do not labor to exhaust your theme. 
 When you can no longer talk without stopping to think what 
 next to say, you are done and should stop at once. 
 
 (Bead "The Power of Speech" on page 18.) 
 
 METHOD OF CRITICISM. 
 
 The following plan of estimating the merits of a speaker's 
 performance, introduced into a number of literary societies 
 by the late Professor I. H. Brown, is recommended. It will 
 prove valuable to critics of literary societies. The table 
 should be prepared on printed sheets and the name of the 
 performer written in the blank, with the proper answer 
 placed after each question. This sheet, so prepared by the 
 critic and given to the performer, would aflford the latter 
 much greater benefit than is conferred by the usual imper. 
 feet system of criticisms.

 AN AMERICAN EXILE. 
 
 In Norfolk Bay, long years ago, where waved 
 
 The nation's flag from mizzen gaff 
 
 Of frigate, sloop and other war-like craft, 
 
 A group of naval officers, assembled 
 
 On the flag-ship's quarter-deck, discussed 
 
 With earnestness the act by which the State 
 
 Of South Carolina anntdled 
 
 The tariff laws of Congress. 
 
 The President's prompt act, 
 
 Despatching Scott to Charlestown, ordering 
 
 The execution of the laws by force. 
 
 Had thrilled the nerves of those who bore 
 
 Their country's arms. 
 
 The naval service boasted many men 
 
 Who traced through veins as chivalrous as their sires 
 
 The blood of Sumter, Pickens, Hayne, 
 
 And other revolutionary patriots;

 And, conscious of a lineage illustrious 
 From those who gave the grand Republic birth, 
 Their minds were often filled with politics 
 Of State; and thus the acts of courts 
 And legislatures oft became their theme 
 In time of peace as much as warlike deeds 
 Of Neptune. 
 
 One of these, in this debate 
 A handsome, sun-bronzed officer of most 
 Commanding mien, became conspicuous 
 In warm approval of his State's rash act 
 And censure strong of President 
 And Congress. While his flashing eye betrayed 
 The fierce emotions of his soul, his voice 
 Rang fearful maledictions: "Curse the cotmtry 
 Whose flag from yonder mizzen floats; the men 
 Be ciu^ed, who in the name of government 
 Ignore the rights my native State has held supreme." 
 
 Then drawing forth his rapier 
 
 As if in frenzied rage: "My sword's my own. 
 
 My heart is loyal to my native State; 
 
 And here I swear, this blade shall ne'er be drawn 
 
 But in defense of rights this tyrant thing 
 
 Called government, usurps, and those its threats 
 
 Would terrify. Its flag be trailed in dust; 
 
 The fate of Carthage be its cursed doom; 
 
 The memory of its present acts, with those 
 
 Who give them shape, go down in blood and shame.'* 
 
 Such direful imprecations shocked the ears

 Of those who heard ; and ere the speechless group 
 Recovered from their blank amaze, a young 
 Lieutenant felled the speaker senseless to 
 The deck; then, quick before the officer 
 Commanding, preferred the charge of treason. 
 
 Court-martial trials are speedy in results ; 
 The sentence, novel in its terms; was heard 
 With unfeigned haughtiness and scorn by him 
 Whom it deprived of country: 
 
 "The prisoner, hence, for life, shall be consigned 
 
 To vessels cruising in a foreign sea; 
 
 No tongue to him shall speak his country's name. 
 
 Nor talk to him of aught save daily wants ; 
 
 And ever to his sight that country's flag 
 
 Shall be a token that its power lives 
 
 To carry out this sentence." 
 
 In far off seas, away from kindred hearts 
 
 And native home, the years passed slowly on; 
 
 But pride and stubborn will did not desert 
 
 This strange, misguided man; his fate he seemed 
 
 To cherish for the cause he still believed 
 
 Would tritmiph in the end. 
 
 Yet to and fro his narrow bounds he paced. 
 
 Alone amid a frigate's crew, of whom 
 
 Not one could speak to him a friendly word. 
 
 Nor tall him of that wondrous growth and fame 
 
 The land he cursed attained aflaong

 The nations of the earth. No cheering word 
 
 His yearning heart in time could e'er expect 
 
 From stricken mother, weeping wife, and babes 
 
 By him made worse than orphans, who might blush 
 
 To call him father. Still, above, around, 
 
 In sportive play, the flag he madly cursed, as star 
 
 By star was added to its field of blue, 
 
 In gorgeous folds waved kindly o'er his head^ 
 
 As if forgiving his ingratitude. 
 
 And now, as other years rolled sadly by. 
 And he was passed from ship to ship, as each 
 In turn went home, the lines of griefs and frosts 
 Of age bore silent evidence of slow decay. 
 In time hi? face was marked with pensive cast, 
 A harbinger of sad, repentant thought. 
 A sailor, unperceived took note of him. 
 And oft observed him watch the waving flag 
 With strange emotion. And once his lips 
 Were seen to move: "Thou ever-present curse, 
 Reminding me of what I am, of what 
 I've lost. Thou Nemesis of nature's wrongs! 
 For that I've sinned against my birth, my soul's 
 Remorse affirms. How long e'er nature's laws. 
 More kind than human heart, will free my eyes 
 Prom thee, thou vengeful witness of my shame? 
 I'd tear thee from thy staff, — but when I think 
 Of all the tears thou'st witnessed in these eyes, 
 At first my curses, then my prayers to God, 
 Of secret thoughts conceived within thy sight.

 From out thy field a single star — and yet — and yet — 
 O soul, when will thy mad resentment cease? 
 
 Full thirty years had passed since sound 
 Of friendly voice had filled his ear, and now 
 He paced another deck than one designed 
 For heavy armament, — a merchant craft. 
 Commissioned while the nation's ships of war 
 Were called for duty home to try the cause 
 For which this poor, deluded exile gave 
 His manhood and his life. 
 
 Near set of sun 
 The cry of "sail" was heard, and then. 
 Against his will, they hurried him below. 
 The startling call to quarters reached his ear, 
 And e'er the roll of drum and boatswain's whistle {iied 
 
 away 
 There came a distant "boom" that roused a hope 
 He yearned to realize. A moment more, 
 A deaf'ning sound, that shook the very keel 
 Awoke his heart with joy. He knew and hailed 
 The truth. The land, — his land was now at war. 
 The foe — his name, it mattered not to him — 
 Had struck the challenge blow and filled his soul 
 With fire. 
 
 O love of Cotintry! Thou art lasting as 
 The faith of childhood. Thou art stronger than 
 The love of life, — the fear of death! 
 This exiled penitent, this prodigal 
 Without a home would prove himself a man !

 He cried for help to free him from his bonds; 
 "Ahoy there! Men on deck! For love of God 
 Let me not perish in this cell. Unbar the door, 
 Take off these chains, and arm me for the fi§;ht! 
 Oh give me air and light beneath the flag; 
 My blood will wash away my curse!" But all 
 Was vain.

 A tearing shot that ploughed through siae 
 And prison bulkhead walls, made clear 
 A passage wide enough through which 
 He sought his wild desire. 
 
 But e'er he reached the deck, the foe had lashed 
 His ship beside, and countless fierce wild men 
 Were leaping down among the feeble crew, 
 Who battled hard, but vain, against such odds. 
 
 He saw the flag the enemy displayed, 
 
 A flag unknown, unseen by him before, 
 
 Though strangely like the one he cursed, — now loved 
 
 So much, — would die in its defense. 
 
 He wrenched a cutlass from a dying hand. 
 
 And hewed his way among the privateers. 
 
 Where'er he struck, the way was cleared of men 
 
 Like wheat before the blade. His strange demean 
 
 And antique garb amazed the foe, imtil 
 
 It seemed he'd drive the boarders to their ship. 
 
 At last, his wounds o'ercame his madd'ning strength 
 
 And sinking to his knee, was soon disarmed. 
 
 But spared the miird'rous stroke by one who knew 
 
 His name and story from a child.

 SHERIDAN'S RIDE. 
 
 Up from the south at break of day. 
 Bringing to Winchester fresh dismay, 
 The affrighted air with a shudder bore. 
 Like a herald in haste to the chieftain's door, 
 The terrible grumble and rumble and roar, 
 Telling the battle was on once more, 
 And Sheridan twenty miles away. 
 
 And wider still those billows of war, 
 Thundered along the horizon's bar; 
 And louder yet into Winchester rolled 
 The roar of that red sea imcontrolled. 
 Making the blood of the listener cold 
 As he thought, of the stake in that fiery fray, 
 With Sheridan twenty miles away. 
 
 But there is a road from Winchester town, 
 
 A good, broad highway, leading down; 
 
 And there through the flash of the morning light, 
 
 A steed as black as the steeds of night, 
 
 Was seen to pass as with eagle flight. 
 
 As if he knew the terrible need. 
 
 He stretched away with the utmost speed; 
 
 Hills rose and fell, — but his heart was gay. 
 
 With Sheridan fifteen miles away.

 Still sprung from those swift hoofs, thundering South 
 The dust, Uke smoke, from the cannon's mouth; 
 Or the trail of a comet, sweeping faster and faster, 
 Foreboding to traitors the doom of disaster. 
 The heart of the steed and the heart of the master, 
 Were beating, like prisoners assaulting their walls, 
 Impatient to be where the battle-field calls: 
 Every nerve of the charger was strained to full play, 
 With Sheridan only ten miles away. 
 
 Under his spuming feet the road 
 
 Like an arrowy Alpine river flowed, 
 
 And the landscape sped away behind, 
 
 Like an ocean flying before the wind: 
 
 And the steed, like a bark fed with furnace ire, 
 
 Swept on, with his wild eyes full of fire ; 
 
 But lo ! he is nearing his heart's desire. 
 
 He is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray, 
 
 With Sheridan only five miles away. 
 
 The first that the general saw were the groups 
 Of stragglers, and then the retreating troops; 
 What was done, — what to do, — a glance told him both, 
 And striking his spurs with a terrible oath, 
 He dashed down the line 'mid a storm of huzzas. 
 And the wave of retreat checked its course there 
 
 because 
 The sight of the master compelled it to pause. 
 With foam and with dust the black charger was gray ; 
 By the flash of his eye and his nostril's play. 
 He seemed to the whole great army to say, 
 "I have brought you Sheridan all the way 
 From Winchester town, to save the day!"

 FOREST HYMN.

 To hew the shaft, and lay the architrave, 
 
 And spread the roof above them, — ere he framed

 The sound of anthems, — in the darkling wood, 
 
 Amid the cool and silence, he knelt down 
 
 And offered to the Mightiest solemn thanks 
 
 And suipplication. Let me, then, at least, 
 
 Here, in the shadow of this aged wood, 
 
 Offer one hymn — thrice happy, if it find 
 
 Acceptance in his ear. 
 
 Father, thy hand 
 Hath reared these venerable columns; Thou 
 Didst weave this verdant roof. Thou didst look down 
 Upon the naked earth, and, forthwith, rose 
 All these fair ranks of trees. They in Thy sun 
 Budded, and shook their green leaves in Thy breeze.

 THB INCHCAPE ROCK. 
 
 No atir in the air, no stir in the sea^ — 
 The ship was as still as she could be; 
 Her sails from heaven reached no motion; 
 Her keel was steady in the ocean. 
 
 Without either sign or soimd of their shock, 
 The waves flowed over the Inchcape rock; 
 So little they rose, so little they fell, 
 They did not move the Inchcape bell. 
 
 The holy Abbot of Aberbrothock 
 Had placed that bell on the Inchcape rock; 
 On a buoy in the storm it floated and swvmg 
 And over the waves its warning rung. 
 
 When the rock was hid by the surges' swell, 
 The mariners heard the warning bell ; 
 And then they knew the perilous rock. 
 And blessed the Abbot of Aberbrothock. 
 
 The sun in heaven was shining gay, — 
 And tilings were joyful on that day ; 
 The sea-birds screamed as they wheeled around, 
 ■ And there was joyance in their sound. 
 
 The buoy of the Inchcape bell was seen, 
 A darker speck on the ocean green; 
 Sir Ralph, the rover, walked his deck, 
 And he fixed his eye on the darker speck. 
 
 He felt the cheering power of spring, — 
 It made him whistle it made him sing;

 His heart was mirthful to excess ; 
 But the rover's mirth was wickedness. 
 
 His eye was on the bell and float:

 And row me to the Inchcape rock, 
 
 And I'll plague the priest of Aberbrothock." 
 
 The boat is lowered, the boatmen row. 
 And to the Inchcape rock they go; 
 Sir Ralph bent over from the boat. 
 And cut the warning bell from the float. 
 
 Down sank the bell with a gurgling sound; 
 The bubbles rose, and burst around. 
 Quoth Sir Ralph, "The next who comes to the rock 
 "Will not bless the Abbot of Aberbrothock." 
 
 Sir Ralph, the rover, sailed away, — 
 He scoured the seas for many a day; 
 And now, grown rich with plundered store. 
 He steers his course to Scotland's shore. 
 
 So thick a haze o'erspreads the sky, 
 They cannot see the sun on high; 
 The wind hath blown a gale all day; 
 At evening it hath died away. 
 
 On the deck the rover takes his stand ; 
 So dark it is they see no land. 
 Quoth Sir Ralph, "It will be lighter soon, 
 For there is the dawn of the rising moon." 
 
 Canst hear," said one, "the breakers roar? 
 For yonder, methinks, should be the shore.

 Like the starlight or the moonlight

 Thus dissuading spake Nekomis, 
 And my Hiawatha answered 
 Only this: "Dear old Nokomis, 
 Very pleasant is the firelight. 
 But I like the starlight better. 
 Better do I like the moonlight!" 
 
 Gravely then said old Nokomis: 
 "Bring not here an idle maiden, 
 Bring not here a useless woman, 
 Hands, unskillful, feet unwilling, 
 Bring a wife with nimble fingers, 
 Heart and hand that move together. 
 Feet that run on willing errands!"

 Still dissuading said Nokomis: 
 "Bring not to my lodge a stranger 
 From the land of the Dacotahs! 
 Very fierce are the Dacotahs; 
 Often is there war between us; 
 There are feuds yot unforgotten, 
 Wounds that ache and still may openl" 
 
 Laughing, answered Hiawatha: 
 "For that reason, if no other, 
 Would I wed the fair Dacotah, 
 That our tribes might be united, 
 That old feuds might be forgotten. 
 And old wounds be healed forever!" 
 
 Thus departed Hiawatha 
 To the land of the Dacotahs, 
 To the land of handsome women; 
 Striding over moor and meadow. 
 Through interminable forests, 
 Through xminterrupted silence, 
 
 With his moccasins of magic, 
 At each stride a mile he measured; 
 Yet the way seemed long before him, 
 And his heart outrun his footsteps. 
 And he journeyed without resting. 
 Till he heard the cataract's laughter, 
 Heard the Falls of Minnehaha 
 Calling to him through the silence. 
 "Pleasant is the sound!" he murmured 
 "Pleasant is the voice that calls me!" 
 
 On the outskirts of the forest, 
 'Twixt the shadow and the sunshine,

 Herds of fallow deer were feeding, 
 But they saw not Hiawatha; 
 To his bow he whispered, "Fail not." 
 To his arrow whispered, "Swerve not." 
 Sent it singing on its errand, 
 To the red heart of the roebuck; 
 Threw the deer across his shoulder. 
 And sped forward without pausing. 
 
 At the doorway of his wigwam 
 Sat the ancient Arrow-maker, 
 In the land of the Dacotahs, 
 Making arrow-heads of jasper, — 
 Arrow-heads of chalcedony.- 
 At his side, in all her beauty. 
 Sat the lovely Minnehaha, 
 Sat his daughter. Laughing Water, 
 Plaiting mats of flags and rushes; 
 Of the past the old man's thoughts were 
 And the maiden's of the future. 
 
 He was thinking, as he sat there, 
 Of the days when with such arrows 
 He had struck the deer and bison, 
 On the Muskoday, the meadow; 
 Shot the wild goose, flying southward, 
 On the wing, the clamorous Wawa; 
 Thinking of the great war-parties, 
 How they came to buy his arrows. 
 Could not fight without his arrows. 
 Ah, no more such noble warriors 
 Could be found on earth as they were. 
 Now the men were like the women. 
 Only used th°.ir tongues for weapons!

 She was thinking of a hunter, 
 From another tribe and country, 
 Young and tall and very handsome, 
 Who one morning, in the Springtime, 
 Came to buy her father's arrows, 
 Sat and rested in the wigwam, 
 Lingered long about the doorway, 
 Looking back as he departed. 
 She had heard her father praise him. 
 Praise his courage and his wisdom; 
 Would he come again for arrows, 
 To the Falls of Minnehaha? 
 On the mat her hands lay idle, 
 And her eyes were very dreamy. 
 
 Through their thoughts they heard a footstep, 
 Heard a rustling in the branches. 
 And with glowing cheek and forehead, 
 With the deer upon his shoidders. 
 Suddenly from out the woodlands 
 Hiawatha stood before them. 
 
 Straight the ancient Arrow-maker 
 Looked up gravely from his labor. 
 Laid aside the unfinished arrow, 
 Bade him enter at the doorway. 
 Saying, as he rose to meet him, 
 "Hiawatha, you are welcome!" 
 
 At the feet of Laughing Water 
 Hiawatha laid his burden. 
 Threw the red deer from his shoulders; 
 And the maiden looked up at him, 
 Looked up from her mat of rushes,

 Said with gentle look and accent, 
 "You are welcome, Hiawatha!" 
 
 Very spacious was the wigwam, 
 Made of deerskin dressed and whitened, 
 With the Gods of the Dacotahs 
 Drawn and painted on its curtains. 
 And so tall the doorway, hardly 
 Hiawatha stooped to enter, 
 Hardly touched his eagle-feathers 
 As he entered at the doorway. 
 
 Then uprose the Laughing Water, 
 From the ground fair Minnehaha 
 Laid aside her mat unfinished 
 Brought forth food and set before them, 
 Water brought them from the brooklet, 
 Gave them food ih earthen vessels, 
 Gave them drink in bowls of bass-wood, 
 Listened while the guest was speaking, 
 Listened while her father answered. 
 But not once her lips she opened, 
 Not a single word she uttered 
 
 Yes, as in a dream she listened 
 To the words of Hiawatha, 
 As he talked of old Nokomis, 
 Who had nursed him in his childhood, 
 As he told of his companions, 
 Chibiabas, the musician. 
 And the very strong man, Kwasind, 
 And of happiness and plenty 
 In the land of the Ojibways 
 In the pleasant land and peaceful.

 "After many 3'^ears of warfare, 
 Many years of strife and bloodshed, 
 There is peace between the Ojibways 
 And the tribe of the Dacotahs." 
 Thus continued Hiawatha, 
 And then added, speaking slowly, 
 
 "That this peace may last forever. 
 And our hands be clasped more closely, 
 And our hearts be more united. 
 Give me as my wife this maiden, 
 Minnehaha, Laughing Water, 
 Loveliest of Dacotah women!" 
 
 And the ancient Arrow-maker 
 Paused a moment ere he answered. 
 Smoked a little while in silence, 
 Looked at Hiawatha proudly. 
 Fondly looked at Laughing Water, 
 And made answer very gravely. 
 
 "Yes, if Minnehaha wishes; 
 Let your heart speak, Minnehaha!" 
 
 And the lovely Laughing Water, 
 Seemed more lovely, as she stood there, 
 Neither willing nor -r&lu'ctant. 
 As she wen>to Hiawatha, 
 Softly took the seat beside him, 
 While she said, and blushed to say it,

 Of the ancient Arrow-maker,

 From the wigwam he departed, 
 Leading with him Laughing Water; 
 Hand in hand they went together, 
 Through the woodland and the meadow. 
 Left the old man standing lonely 
 At the doorway of his wigwam. 
 Heard the Falls of Minnehaha 
 Calling to them from afar off, 
 "Fare thee well, Minnehaha!" 
 
 And the ancient Arrow-maker 
 Turned again unto his labor. 
 Sat down by his stmny doorway. 
 Murmuring to himself, and saying; 
 "Thus it is our daughters leave us. 
 Those we love, and those who love us! 
 Just when they have learned to help us, 
 When we are old and lean upon them, 
 Comes a youth with flaunting feathers, 
 With his flute of reeds, a stranger 
 Wanders piping through the village, 
 Beckons to the fairest maiden, 
 And she follows where he leads her, 
 Leaving all things for the stranger!" 
 
 Pleasant was the journey homeward. 
 Through interminable forests. 
 Over meadow, over mountain, 
 Over river, hill, and hollow. 
 Short it seemed to Hiawatha, 
 Though they journeyed very slowly 
 Though his pace he checked and slackened 
 To the steps of Laughing Water.

 Over wide and rushing rivers 
 In his arms he bore the maiden; 
 Light he thought her as a feather, 
 As the plume upon his headgear; 
 Cleared the tangled pathway for her; 
 Bent aside the swaying branches, 
 Made at night a lodge of branches, 
 And a bed with boughs of hemlock, 
 And a fire before the doorway 
 With the dry cones of the pine tree. 
 
 All the traveling winds went with them, 
 O'er the meadow, through the forest ; 
 All the stars of night looked at them, 
 Watched with sleepless eyes their slumber; 
 From his ambush in the oak-tree 
 Peeped the squirrel, Adjidaumo, 
 Watched with eager eyes the lovers; 
 And the rabbit, the Wabasso, 
 Scampered from the path before them, 
 Peering, peeping from his burrow, 
 Sat erect upon his haunches, 
 Watched with curious eyes the lovers. 
 
 Pleasant was the journey homeward! 
 
 And the birds sang loud and sweetly 
 
 Songs of happiness and heart's-ease 
 
 Sang the blue-bird, the Owaissa, 
 "Happy are you, Hiawatha, 
 
 Having such a wife to love you!" 
 
 Sang the robin, the Opechee, 
 "Happy are you. Laughing Water, 
 
 Having such a noble husband!"

 Looked upon them through the branches, 
 Saying to them, "0 my children,

 Life is checkered shade and sunshine; 
 Rule by love, O Hiawatha!" 
 
 From the sky the moon looked at them. 
 Filled the lodge with mystic splendors. 
 Whispered to them, "0 my children,

 LITTLE MATTIE. 
 I. 
 Dead! Thirteen a month ago! 
 
 Short and narrow her life's walk; 
 Lover's love she could not know 
 
 Even by a dream or talk: 
 Too young to be glad of youth. 
 
 Missing honor, labor, rest. 
 And the warmth of a babe's mouth 
 
 At the blossom of her breast. 
 Must you pity her for this 
 And for all the loss it is, 
 You, her mother, with wet face, 
 Having had all in your case? 
 
 II. 
 Just so young but yesternight, 
 
 Now she is as old as death. 
 Meek, obedient in your sight. 
 
 Gentle to a beck or breath 
 Only on last Monday! Yours, 
 
 Answering you like silver bells 
 Slightly touched! An hour matures: 
 
 You can teach her nothing else.

 Into saying a word more, 
 
 "Yes," or "No," or such a thing: 
 Though you call and beg and wreak 
 Half your soul out in a shriek, 
 She will lie there in defatdt 
 And most innocent revolt.

 As she took it; room to play 
 (Though one's hair might get uncurled

 The hills and water o'er, 
 When a band of exiles moored their bark 
 
 On the wild New England shore.

 They, the true-hearted came ; 
 Not with the roll of the stirring drums, 
 
 And the trumpet that sings of fame ; 
 
 Not as the flying come,

 They shook the depths of the desert gloom 
 
 With their h}rmns of lofty cheer.

 To the anthem of the free.

 From his nest by the white wave's foam ; 
 And the rocking pines of the forest roared —

 Amidst that pilgrim band : 
 Why had they come to wither there,

 THE MILKMAID'S SONG. 
 
 Turn, turn, for my cheeks they burn. 
 
 Turn by the dale, my Harry ! 
 
 Fill pail, fill pail, 
 
 He has turned by the dale. 
 
 And there by the stile waits Harry. 
 
 Fill, fill, 
 
 Fillpail, fill, 
 
 For there by the stile waits Harry ! 
 
 The world may go round, the world may stand still 
 
 But I can milk and marry, 
 
 Fillpail, 
 
 I can milk and marry. 
 
 Wheugh, wheugh! 
 
 Oh, if we two 
 
 Stood down there now by the water, 
 
 I know who'd carry me over the ford 
 
 As brave as a soldier, as proud as a lord. 
 
 Though I don't live over the water.

 world have you ever a lover? 
 
 1 could not see a leaf on the tree, 
 
 And now I could count them, one ,two, three, 
 
 Count them over and over, 
 
 Leaf from leaf like lips apart, 
 
 Like lips apart for a lover. 
 
 And the hillside beats with my beating heart, 
 
 And the apple-tree blushes all over, 
 
 And the May bough touched me and made me start, 
 
 And the wind breathes warm like a lover. 
 
 Pull, pull, and the pail is full, 
 
 And milking's done and over. 
 
 Who wotdd not sit here under the tree? 
 
 What a fair, fair thing's a green field to see ! 
 
 Brim, brim to the rim, ah me ! 
 
 I have set my pail on the daisies ! 
 
 It seems so light, — can the sun be set? 
 
 The dews must be heavy, my cheeks are wet. 
 
 I could cry to have hurt the daisies! 
 
 Harry is near, Harry is near. 
 
 My heart's as sick as if he were here. 
 
 My lips are burning, my cheeks are wet, 
 
 He hasn't uttered a word as yet. 
 
 But the air's astir with his praises.

 The air's astir with your praises. 
 
 He has scaled the rock by the pixy's stone, 
 
 He's among the king- cups — ^he picks me one,

 Between the dark and the daylight 
 When the night is beginning to lower. 
 
 Comes a pause in the day's occupations.

 The patter of little feet ; 
 The sound of a door that is opened, 
 
 And voices soft and sweet.

 From my study I see in the laiilplight. 
 Descending the broad hall stair. 
 
 Grave Alice, and laughing Allegra, 
 And Edith with golden hair. 
 
 A whisper, and then a silence. 
 
 Yet I know by their merry eyes 
 They are plotting and planning together. 
 To take me by surprise. 
 
 A sudden rush from the stairway; 
 
 A sudden raid from thej|hall; 
 By three doors left unguarded 
 
 They enter my castle-wall. 
 
 They climb up into my turret. 
 
 O'er the arms and back of my chair; 
 
 If I try to escape, they surrotmd me; 
 They seem to be eversrwhere. 
 
 They almost devour me with kisses, 
 Their arms about me entwine, 
 
 Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen, 
 In his Mouse-Tower on the Rhine. 
 
 Do you think, O blue-eyed banditti, 
 Because you have scaled the wall, 
 
 Such an old mustache as I am 
 Is not a match for you all? 
 
 I have you fast in my fortress, 
 And will not let you depart. 
 
 But put you into the dungeon, 
 In the round-tower of my heart.

 COME INTO THE GARDEN, MAUD. 
 
 Come into the garden, Maud, 
 
 For the black bat, night, has flown ! 
 
 Come into the garden, Maud, 
 I am here at the gate alone ; 
 
 And the woodbine spices are wafted abroad. 
 And the musk of the roses blown. 
 
 For a breeze of morning moves, 
 And the planet of love is on high, 
 
 Beginning to faint in the light that she loves. 
 On a bed of daffodil sky, 
 
 To fiiint in the light of the sim that she loves, 
 To faint in its light, and to die. 
 
 All night have the roses heard 
 
 The flute, violin, bassoon; 
 All night has the casement jessamine stirred 
 
 To the dancers dancing in tune, — 
 Till a silence fell with the waking bird. 
 
 And a hush with the setting moon. 
 
 I said to the lily, "There is but one 
 
 With whom she has heart to be gay. 
 When will the dancers leave her alone ? 
 She is weary of dance and play."

 Now half to the setting moon are gone, 
 
 And half to the rising day ; 
 Low on the sand and loud on the stone, 
 
 The last wheel echoes away. 
 
 I said to the rose, "The brief night goes 
 
 In babble and revel and wine. 
 O young lord-lover, what sights are those 
 
 For one that will never be thine ? 
 But mine, but mine," so I sware to the rose, 
 
 "For ever and ever mine!" 
 
 And the soul of the rose went into my blood , 
 
 As the music clashed in the hall ; 
 And long by the garden lake I stood. 
 
 For I heard your rivulet fall 
 From the lake to the meadow and on to the wood, 
 
 Our wood, that is dearer than all. 
 
 From the meadow your walks have left so sweet 
 That, whenever a March-wind sighs, 
 
 He sets the jewel-print of your feet 
 In violets blue as your eyes. 
 
 To the woody hollows in which we meet, 
 And the valleys of Paradise. 
 
 The slender acacia would not shake 
 
 One long milk-bloom on the tree ; 
 The white lake-blossom fell into the lake, 
 
 As the pimpernel dozed on the lea ; 
 But the rose was awake all night for your sake, 
 
 Knowing your promise to me ; 
 The lilies and roses were all awake. 
 They sighed for the dawn and thee.

 Queen rose of the rosebud garden of girls, 
 
 Come hither! the dances are done; 
 In gloss of satin and glimmer of pearls, 
 
 Queen lily and rose in one ; 
 Shine out, little head, sunning over with curls, 
 
 To the flowers, and be their sun. 
 
 There has fallen a splendid tear 
 
 From the passion-flower at the gate. 
 She is coming, my dove, my dear; 
 
 She is coming, my life, my fate ! 
 The red rose cries, "She is near, she is near;" 
 
 And the white rose weeps, "She is late ;" 
 The lark-spur listens, "I hear, I hear;" 
 
 And the lily whispers, "I wait." 
 
 She is coming, my own, my sweet ! 
 
 Were it ever so airy a tread, 
 My heart would hear her and beat. 
 
 Were it earth in an earthy bed; 
 My duSt would hear her and beat, 
 
 Had I lain for a century dead; 
 Would start and tremble under her feet, 
 
 And blossom in purple and red.

 I heed not those who pine for force 
 
 A ghost of time to raise, 
 As if they thus could check the course 
 
 Of these appointed days. 
 
 Still is it true, and over-tnie, 
 
 That I delight to close 
 This book of life self- wise and new, 
 
 And let my thoughts repose 
 On all that humble happiness 
 
 The world has since foregone — 
 The daylight of contentedness 
 
 That on those faces shown! 
 
 With rights, though not too closely scanned. 
 
 Enjoyed, as far as known — 
 With will, by no reverse unmanned — 
 
 With pulse of even tone — 
 They from to-day and from to-night 
 
 Expected nothing more 
 Than yesterday and yesternight 
 
 Had proffered them before. 
 
 A man's best things are nearest him. 
 
 Lie close about his feet, 
 It is the distant and the dim 
 
 That we are sick to greet: 
 For flowejrs that grow our hands beneath 
 
 We struggle and aspire — 
 Our hearts must die, except they breathe 
 
 The air of fresh desire.

 MAUD MULLER. 
 
 Maud Muller, on a simuner's day, 
 
 Raked the meadows sweet with hay. 
 
 Beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth 
 
 Of simple beauty and rustic health. 
 
 Singing, she wrought, and her merry glee 
 
 The mock-bird echoed from his tree. 
 
 But when she glanced to the far-off town, 
 
 White from its hill-slope looking down, 
 
 The sweet song died and a vague unrest 
 
 And a nameless longing filled her breast — 
 
 A Tiish, she had hardly dared to own. 
 
 For something better than she had known. 
 
 The judge rode slowly down the lane. 
 
 Smoothing his horse's chestnut mane. 
 
 He drew his bridle in the shade 
 
 Of the apple-trees, to greet the maid, 
 
 And asked a draught from the spring that flowed 
 
 Through the meadow across the road. 
 
 She stooped where the cool spring bubbled up, 
 
 And filled for him her small tin cup, 
 
 And blushed as she gave it, looking down 
 
 On her feet so bare, and her tattered gown. 
 
 Then said the judge, "a sweeter draught 
 
 From a fairer hand was never quaffed." 
 
 He spoke of the grass and flowers and trees, 
 
 Of the singing birds and the humming bees ; 
 
 Then talked of the haying and wondered whether, 
 
 The cloud in the west would bring foul weather. 
 
 And Maud forgot her briar torn gown. 
 
 And her graceful ankles, bare and brown,

 And listened, while a pleased surprise 
 Looked from her long-lashed hazel eyes. 
 At last, like one who for delay- 
 Seeks a vain excuse, he rode away. 
 Maud MuUer looked, and sighed: "Ah me 
 That I the Judge's bride might be! 
 He would dress me up in silks so fine, 
 And praise and toast me at his wine. 
 My father should wear a broadcloth coat ; 
 My brother should sail a painted boat ; 
 I'd dress my mother so grand and gay, 
 And the baby should have a new toy each day. 
 And I'd feed the hungry and clothe the ooor. 
 And all should bless me who left our door." 
 The Judge looked back as he climbed the hill, 
 And saw Maud MuUer standing still. 
 "A form more fair, a face more sweet, 
 Ne'er hath it been my lot to meet; 
 And her modest and graceful air 
 Shows her wise and good as she is fair. 
 Would she were mine, and I to-day, 
 Like her, a harvester of hay; 
 No doubtful balance of rights and wrongs, 
 Nor weary lawyers with endless tongues, 
 But low of cattle and song of birds. 
 And health and quiet and loving words." 
 But he thought of his sisters proud and cold. 
 And his mother, vain of her rank and gold. 
 So, closing his heart, the Judge rode on, 
 And Maud was left in the field alone. 
 But the lawyers smiled that afternoon. 
 When he hummed in court an old love-tune ; 
 And the young girl mused beside the well,

 Till the rain on the iiiiraked clover fell. 
 He wedded a wife of richest dower, 
 Who lived for fashion as he for power. 
 Yet oft, in his marble hearth's bright glow, 
 He watched a picture come and go : 
 And sweet Maud MuUer's hazel eyes 
 Looked out in their innocent surprise. 
 Oft when the wine in his glass was red, 
 He longed for the wayside rill instead. 
 And closed his eyes on his garnished rooms. 
 To dream of meadows and clover blooms. 
 And the proud man sighed with a secret pain 
 "Ah, that I was free again! 
 Free as when I rode that day. 
 Where the bare-foot maiden raked her hay." 
 She wedded a man unlearned and poor, 
 And many children played round her door; 
 But care and sorrow and childbirth pain 
 Left their traces on heart and brain. 
 And oft, when the summer sun shone hot 
 On the new-mown hay in the meadow lot, 
 And she heard the little spring-brook fall 
 Over the road-side, through the wall. 
 In the shade of the apple tree again 
 She saw a rider draw his rein. 
 And gazing down with tender grace. 
 She felt his pleased eyes read her face. 
 Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls 
 Stretched away into stately halls ; 
 The weary wheel to a spinnet turned. 
 The tallow candle an astral burned. 
 And for him who sat by the chimney log.

 THE BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE. 
 
 Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note, 
 As his corse to the ramparts we hurried; 
 
 Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot 
 O'er the grave where our hero we buried. 
 
 We buried him darkly; at dead of night; 
 
 The sods with our bayonets turning, 
 By the struggling moonbeams' misty light. 
 
 And the lantern dimly burning. 
 
 No useless cofiEin enclosed his breast. 
 
 Nor in sheet nor in shroud we wound him; 
 
 But he lay like a warrior taking his rest. 
 With his martial cloak around him. 
 
 Few and short were the prayers we said, 
 And we spoke not a word of sorrow; 
 
 But we steadfastly gazed on the face of the dead, 
 And we bitterly thought of the morrow. 
 
 We thought — as we hollowed his narrow bed. 
 And smoothed down his lonely pillow — 
 How the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head. 
 And we far away on the billow! 
 
 Lightly they'll talk of the spirit that's gone, 
 And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him; 
 
 But little he'll reck, if they let him sleep on 
 In the grave where a Briton has laid him.

 But half of our heavy task was done, 
 When the clock tolled the hour for retiring, 
 
 And we heard the distant and random g\m, 
 That the foe was suddenly firing. 
 
 Slowly and sadly we laid him down. 
 
 From the field of his fame fresh and gory. 
 
 We carved not a line, we raised not a stone, 
 But left him — alone with his glory!

 THE MAY QUEEN. 
 
 PART FIRST. 
 
 You must wake and call me early, call me early, mother 
 
 dear; 
 To-morrow'U be the happiest time of all the glad new 
 
 year; 
 Of all the glad new year, mother, the maddest, merriest 
 
 day; 
 For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen 
 o' the May. 
 
 I sleep so soimd all night, mother, that I shall never 
 wake, 
 
 If you do not call me loud when the day begins to break; 
 
 But I must gather knots of flowers, and buds and gar- 
 lands gay. 
 
 For I'm to be Qumo o' th© May, mother, I'm to be Qajeen 
 o' the May.

 Little Effie shall go with me tomorrow to the green, 
 And you'll be there too, mother, to see me made the 
 
 Queen; 
 For the shepherd lads on every side'U come from far 
 
 away, 
 And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen 
 
 o' the May. 
 
 All the valley, mother, '11 be fresh, and green and still, 
 And the cow-slip and the crowfoot are over all the hill. 
 And the rivulet in the flowery dale'll merrily glance and 
 
 play, 
 For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen 
 
 o' the May. 
 
 So you must wake and call me early, call me early, mother

 To-morrow'll be the happiest time of all the glad new

 If you're waking, call me early, call me early, mother dear, 
 For I would see the sun rise upon the glad new year ; 
 It is the last new year that I shall ever see ; 
 Then you may lay me low i' the mold, and think no more 
 of me. 
 
 To-night I saw the sun set ; he set and left behind 
 The good old year, the dear old time, and all my peace

 And the new year's coming up, mother, but I shall never 
 
 see 
 The blossom on the blackthorn, the leaf upon the tree. 
 There's not a flower on all the hills; the frost is on the 
 
 pane; 
 I only wish to live till the snow-drops come again; 
 I wish the snow would melt, and the sun come out on 
 
 high; 
 I long to see a flower so before the day I die. 
 
 The building rook'U caw from the windy, tall elm tree, 
 
 And the tufted plover pipe along the fallow lea, 
 
 And the swallow'U come back again with summer o'er 
 
 the wave. 
 But I shall lie alone, mother, within the moldering grave. 
 
 When the flowers come again, mother, beneath the wan- 
 ing light. 
 
 You'll never see me more in the long, gray fields at night ; 
 
 When from the dry, dark wold the summer airs blow 
 cool, 
 
 On the oat-grass and the sword-grass and the bulrush 
 in the pool. 
 
 You'll bury me, my mother, just beneath the hawthorn 
 
 shade. 
 And you'll come sometimes and see me where I am lowly 
 
 laid. 
 I shall not forget you mother; I shall hear you when 
 
 you pass 
 With your feet above my head in the long and pleasant

 Though you'll not see me, mother, I shall look upon

 Though I cannot speak a word, I shall hearken what you 
 
 say. 
 And be often, often with you when you think I'm far 
 
 away. 
 
 Good night, good night; when I have said good night 
 
 ^ forevermore, 
 And you see me carried out from the threshold of the 
 
 door, 
 Don't let Effie come to see me till my grave be growing 
 
 green; 
 Shell be a better child to you than ever I have been. 
 
 Good night, sweet mother; call me before the day is

 All night I lie awake, but I fall asleep at morn; 
 But I would see the sun rise upon the glad New Year; 
 So, if you're waking, call me, call me early, mother dear. 
 
 PART THIRD — CONCLUSION. 
 
 I thought to pass away before, and yet alive I am; 
 And in the fields all round I hear the bleating of the lamb. 
 How sadly, I remember, rose the morning of the year; 
 To die before the snow-drop came, and now the violet's 
 here. 
 
 O, sweet is the new violet, that comes beneath the skies. 
 And sweeter is the young lamb's voice to me that cannot 
 
 rise; 
 And sweet is all the land about, and all the flowers that 
 
 blow; 
 And sweeter far is death than life to me, that long to go.

 I did not hear tlie dog howl, mother, or hear the death- 
 watch beat; 
 
 There came a sweeter token when the night and morning 
 meet; 
 
 But sit beside my bed, mother^ and put your hand in 
 mine. 
 
 And Effie on the other side, and I will tell the sign. 
 
 All in the wild March morning I heard the angels call; 
 It was when the moon was setting, and the dark was over 
 
 all; 
 The trees began to whisper, and the wind began to roll, 
 And in the wild March morning I heard them call my 
 
 soul. 
 
 For lying broad awake, I thought of you and Effie dear; 
 I saw you sitting in the house, and I no longer here ; 
 With all my strength I prayed for both, and so I felt 
 
 resigned, 
 And up the valley came a swell of music on the wind. 
 
 I thought that it was fancy, and I listened in my bed. 
 And then did something speak to me — I know not what 
 
 was said; 
 For great delight and shuddering took hold of all my 
 
 mind, 
 And up the valley came again the music of the wind. 
 
 But you were sleeping and I said, "It's not for them; it's 
 mine." 
 
 And if it comes three times, I thought, I'd take it for a 
 sign. 
 
 And once again it came, and dose beside the window- 
 bars, 
 
 Then seemed to go right up to Heaven, and <fie among the 
 
 stars.

 So now I think my time is near. I trust it is. I know 
 The blessed music went that way my soul will love to go. 
 And for myself, indeed, I care not if I go to-day; 
 But, EfEie, you must comfort her when I am passed away. 
 
 O, look! the sun begins to rise, the heavens are in a glow; 
 He shines upon a hundred fields, and all of them I know; 
 And there I move no longer now, and there his light may 
 
 shine, 
 With flowers in the valley, for other hands than mine. 
 
 Oh, sweet and strange it seems to me, that e'er this day 
 
 is done, 
 The voice that now is speaking may be beyond the sua — 
 Forever and forever with those just sotils and true: 
 And what is life that we should moan.? Why make we 
 
 such ado? 
 
 Forever and forever, all in a blessed home, 
 And there to wait a little while till you and EfKe come — 
 To lie within the light of God as I lie upon your breast, 
 And the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are 
 at rest.

 Whose sole contentment is to watch and love ;

 Its own despair with words of faith and hope. 
 Life has naught else that may supply its place. 
 Void is ambition, cold is vanity.

 I wonder if ever a song was sung.

 Till the cold stone echoed his inmost thought ? 
 Or if ever a painter, with light and shade. 
 
 The dream of his inmost soul betrayed?

 Thy step — the wild deer's rustling feet 
 Within thy woods are not more fleet ; 
 
 Thy hopefid eye 
 Is bright as thine own sunny sky. 
 
 Ay, let them rail, those haughty ones, 
 While safe thou dwellest with thy sons. 
 They do not know how loved thou art, 
 How many a fond and fearless heart 
 
 Would rise to throw 
 Its life between thee and the foe. 
 
 They know not, in their hate and pride. 
 What virtues with thy children bide, — 
 How true, how good, thy graceful maids 
 Make bright, like flowers, the valley shades; 
 
 What generous men 
 Spring, like thine oaks, by hill and glen; 
 
 What cordial welcomes greet the guest 
 By thine lone rivers of the west ; 
 How faith is kept and truth revered, 
 And man is loved and God is feared, 
 
 In woodland homes, 
 And where the ocean border foams. 
 
 There's freedom at thy gates, and rest 
 For earth's downtrodden and opprest. 
 A shelter for the himted head, 
 For the starved laborer toil and bread. 
 
 Power, at thy bounds, 
 Stops, and calls back his baffled hoimds. 
 
 O fair yotmg mother! on thy brow 
 Shall sit a nobler grace than now.

 TO lANTHE, SLEEPING; 
 
 How wonderful is Death! 
 
 Death and his brother Sleep! 
 One, pale as yonder waning moon, 
 
 "With lips of lurid blue; 
 
 The other, rosy as the mom 
 When throned on ocean's wave. 
 
 It blushes o'er the world; 
 Yet both so passing wonderful! 
 
 Hath then the gloomy Power 
 Whose reign is in the tainted sepulchres 
 
 Seized on her sinless soul? 
 
 Must then that peerless form 
 Which love and admiration cannot view 
 Without a beating heart, those azure veins 
 Which steal like streams along a field of snow, 
 That lovely outline which is fair 
 
 As breathing marble, perish? 
 
 Must putrefaction's breath 
 L,eave nothing of this heavenly sight 
 
 But loathsomeness and ruin? 
 
 Spare nothing but a gloomy theme. 
 On which the lightest heart might moralize? 
 
 Or is it only a sweet slumber 
 
 Stealing o'er sensation. 
 Which the breath of roseate morning 
 
 Chaseth into darkness? 
 
 Will lanthe wake again. 
 
 And give that faithful bosom joy, 
 Whose sleepless spirit waits to catch 
 Light, life and rapture from her smile?

 That might have soothed a tiger's rage. 
 Or thawed the cold heart of a conqueror.

 And on their lids ,whose texture fine 
 Scarce hides the dark blue orbs beneath,

 Her golden tresses shade 
 
 The bosom's stainless pride. 
 Curling like tendrils of the parasite

 Watching her sleep with looks of speechless love 
 And the bright-beaming stars

 I see the lights of the village 
 
 Gleam through the rain and the mist, 
 And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me, 
 
 That my soul cannot resist — 
 
 A feeling of sadness and longing, 
 
 That is not akin to pain, 
 And resembles sorrow only 
 
 As the mist resembles rain. 
 
 Come read to me some poem, 
 
 Some simple and heartfelt lay, 
 That shall soothe this restless feeling, 
 
 And banish the thoughts of day. 
 
 Not from the grand old masters. 
 
 Not from the bards sublime. 
 Whose distant footsteps echo 
 
 Through the corridors of time; — 
 
 For, like strains of martial music. 
 
 Their mighty thoughts suggest 
 Life's endless toil and endeavor, 
 
 And to-night I long for rest. 
 
 Read from some humbler poet. 
 Whose songs gushed from his heart, 
 
 As showers from the clouds of summer. 
 Or tears from the eyelids start ; — 
 
 Who through long days of labor. 
 
 And nights devoid of ease. 
 Still heard in his soul the music 
 
 Of wonderful melodies.

 And lend to the rhyme of the poet

 And the cares that infest the day, 
 
 Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs,

 And her day come at last — 
 The Movastar was a better boat, 
 
 But the Belle, she wouldn't be passed, 
 And so she came tearin' along that night, 
 
 The oldest craft on the line. 
 With a nigger squat on her safety-valve, 
 
 And her furnace crammed, rosin and pine. 
 
 The fire bust out as she cleared the bar. 
 
 And burnt a hole in the night. 
 And quick as a flash she tiuned, and made

 There was runnin' and cursin', but Jim yelledout 
 
 Over all the infernal roar, 
 "I'll hold her nozzle agin the bank

 And every loved spot which my infancy knew; —

 The bridge, and the rock where the cataract fell ; 
 The cot of my father, the dairy-house nigh it, 
 
 And e'en the rude bucket that hung in the well. 
 The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket, 
 The moss-covered bucket which hung in the well. 
 
 That moss-covered vessel I hail as a treasure, , 
 For often at noon when returned from the field, 
 
 I found it the source of an exquisite pleasure, 
 The purest and sweetest that nature can yield.

 How ardent I seized it, with hands that were glowing! 
 
 And quick to the white-pebbled bottom it fell ; 
 Then soon with the emblem of truth overflowing, 
 
 And dripping with coolness, it rose from the well; 
 The old oaken bucket, the iron-bound bucket,

 How sweet from the green mossy brim to receive it. 
 
 As, poised on the curb, it inclined to my lips ! 
 Not a full blushing goblet could tempt me to leave it 
 
 Though filled with the nectar that Jupiter sips. 
 And, now, far removed from the loved situation, 
 
 The tear of regret will intrusively swell. 
 As fancy reverts to my father's plantation. 
 
 And sighs for the bucket which hangs in the well ;

 And, as his legs were off, of course

 The undiscovered country, from whose boiime 
 
 No traveler returns, puzzles the will. 
 
 And makes us rather bear those ills we have, 
 
 Than fly to others that we know not of? 
 
 Thus conscience does make cowards of us all ; 
 
 And thus the native hue of resolution 
 
 Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought 
 
 And enterprises of great pith and moment,

 THE DYING SAVIOR. 
 
 O, sacred Head, now wounded. 
 
 With grief and shame weighed down. 
 Now scornfully surrounded 
 
 With thorns. Thy only crown ; 
 O sacred head, what glory. 
 
 What bliss till now was Thine! 
 Yet, though despised and gory, 
 
 I joy to call Thee mine. 
 
 O noblest brow and dearest, 
 
 In other days the world 
 All feared when Thou appearedst; 
 
 What shame on Thee is hurled! 
 How art Thou pale with anguish, 
 
 With sore abuse and scorn ! 
 How does that visage lang\ajsh. 
 
 Which once was bright as morn !

 What language shall I borrow, 
 
 To thank Thee, dearest Friend, 
 For this Thy dying sorrow, 
 
 Thy pity without end! 
 0, make me Thine forever, 
 
 And shoidd I fainting be, 
 Lord, let me never, never, 
 
 Outlive my love to Thee. 
 
 If I, a wretch, should leave Thee, 
 
 O Jesus, leave not me ! 
 In faith may I receive Thee, 
 
 When death shall set me free. 
 When strength and comfort languish, 
 
 And I must hence depart, 
 Release me then from anguish, 
 
 By Thine ovra wounded heart. 
 
 Be near when I am dying, 
 
 0, show Thy cross to me! 
 And for my succor flying, 
 
 Come, Lord, to set me free. 
 These eyes new faith receiving. 
 
 From Jesus shall not move ; 
 For he who dies believing 
 
 Dies safely — ^through Thy love.

 And the muscles of his brawny arms 
 
 Are strong as iron bands. 
 His hair is crisp, and black and long; 
 
 His face is like the tan; 
 His brow is wet with honest sweat, 
 
 He earns whate'er he can, 
 And looks the whole world in the face. 
 
 For he owes not any man. 
 
 Week in, week out, from mom till night, 
 
 You can hear his bellows blow; 
 You can hear him swing his heavy sledge, 
 
 With measured beat and slow, 
 Like a sexton ringing the village bell, 
 
 When the evening sun is low. 
 And children coming home from school 
 
 Look in at the open door — 
 They love to see the flaming forge 
 
 And hear the bellows roar. 
 And catch the sparks that fly 
 
 Like chaff from the threshing floor. 
 
 He goes on Sunday to the church. 
 
 And sits amongst his boys; 
 He hears the parson pray and preach; 
 
 He hears his daughter's voice 
 Singing in the village choir 
 
 And it makes his heart rejoice; 
 It sounds to him like her mother's voice 
 
 Singing in paradise, 
 He needs must think of her once more. 
 
 How in the grave she lies, 
 And with his hard, rough hand he wipes 
 
 A tear from out his eyes.

 Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing, 
 
 Onward through life he goes; 
 Each morning sees some task begin, 
 
 Each evening sees its close; 
 Something attempted, something done, 
 
 Has earned a night's repose. 
 Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend 
 
 For the lesson thou hast taught ;

 Thus on the sounding anvil shaped

 ENTERTAINING HER BIG SISTER'S BEAU. 
 
 "My sister'U be down in a minute, and says you're to 
 wait if you please, 
 
 And says I might stay till she came if I'd promise her 
 never to tease. 
 
 Nor speak till you spoke to me first. But that's non- 
 sense, for how would you know 
 
 What she told me to say if I didn't? Don't you really 
 and truly think so? 
 
 "And then you'd feel strange here all alone! And you 
 
 wouldn't know, just where to sit ; 
 For that chair isn't strong on its legs, and we never use 
 
 it a bit. 
 We keep it to match with the sofa. But Jack says it 
 
 would be like you 
 
 To flop yourself right down upon it and knock out 
 the very last screw.

 "How does the water 
 Come down at Lodore*?"

 Thus, once on a time;

 And then came another, 
 To second and third

 Comes down at Lodore, 
 With its rush and roar;

 Through moss and through brake,

 For a while till it sleeps 
 
 In its own little lake. 
 And thence at departing, 
 Awakening and starting, 
 It runs through the reeds. 
 
 And away it proceeds, 
 Through meadow and glade, 
 
 In sun and in shade. 
 And through the wood-shelter, 
 Among crags in its flurry, 
 
 Helter-skelter, 
 
 Hurry-skurry, 
 
 Here it comes sparkling. 
 And there it lies darkUng; 
 Now smoking and frothing 
 
 Its tumult and wrath in,

 On which it is bent.

 THE OLD ARM CHAIR. 
 
 I love it, I love it, and who shall dare 
 
 To chide me for loving the old arm chair? 
 
 I've treasur'd it long as a holy prize, 
 
 I've bedew'd it with tears, and embalm'd it with sighs, 
 
 'Tis bound by a thousand bands to my heart ; 
 
 Not a tie will break, not a link will start, 
 
 Would you learn the spell? — a mother sat there. 
 
 And a sacred thing is that old arm chair. 
 
 In childhood's home, I lingered near 
 
 The hallow'd seat with list'ning ear; 
 
 And gentle words would mother give, 
 
 To fit me to die, and teach me to live. 
 
 She told me shame wotild never betide. 
 
 With truth for my creed and God for my guide ; 
 
 She taught me to lisp my earliest prayer 
 
 As I knelt beside that old arm chair. 
 
 I sat and watched her many a day. 
 
 When her eyes grew dim, and her locks were gray.

 I learned how much the heart can bear, 
 When I saw her die in the old arm chair. 
 
 'Tis past ; 'tis past ; but I gaze on it now 
 With quivering breath and throbbing brow, 
 'Twas there she nursed me, 'twas there she died,

 When the drum beat at dead of night, 
 Commanding fires of death to light 
 The darkness of her scenery. 
 
 By torch and trumpet fast arrayed, 
 Each horseman drew his. battle-blade, 
 And furious every charger neighed, 
 To join the dreadful revelry.

 Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak

 Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound 
 
 Save his own dashings — yet — the dead are there ; 
 
 And millions in those solitudes, since first

 In silence from the living, and no friend 
 Take note of thy departure? All that breathe 
 Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh 
 When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care 
 Plod on, and each one as before will chase 
 His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave 
 Their mirth and their employments, and shall come 
 And make their bed with thee. As the long train 
 Of ages glide away, the sons of men.

 CURFEW MUST NOT RING TO-NIGHT. 
 
 England's sun was slowly setting o'er the hills so far 
 
 away, 
 Filling all the land with beauty at the close of one sad 
 
 day;. 
 And the last rays kiss'd the forehead of a m4n and 
 
 maiden fair, 
 He with step so slow and weakened, she with sunny, 
 
 floating hair, 
 He with sad, bowed head, and thoughtful, she with lips 
 
 so cold and white. 
 Struggling to keep back the murmur, "Curfew must 
 
 not ring to-night." 
 "Sexton," Bessie's white lips faltered, pointing to the 
 
 prison old. 
 With its walls so dark and gloomy — walls so dark and 
 
 damp and cold — 
 "I've a lover in that prison, doom'd this very night to die 
 At the ringing of the Curfew, and no earthly help is nigh. 
 Cromwell will not come till sunset," and her face grew 
 
 strangely white. 
 As she spoke in husky whispers, "Curfew must not 
 
 ring to-night." 
 "Bessie," calmly spoke the sexton — every word pierced 
 
 her young heart 
 Like a thousand gleaming arrows, like a deadly poisoned 
 
 dart — 
 "Long, long years I've rung the curfew from that gloomy 
 
 shadowed tower. 
 Every evening, just at sunset, it has told the twilight 
 
 hour;

 Wild her eyes and pale her features, stem and white 
 
 her thoughtful brow. 
 And within her heart's deep center, Bessie made a solemn 
 
 vow; 
 She had listened while the judges read, without a tear 
 
 or sigh, , 
 
 "At the ringing of the Curfew — Basil Underwood must 
 
 die." 
 And her breath came fast and faster, and her eyes grew 
 
 large and bright — 
 One low murmur, scarcely spoken — "Curfew must not 
 
 ring to-night !" 
 She with light step bounded forward, sprang within the 
 
 old church door. 
 Left the old man coming slowly paths he'd trod so oft 
 
 before. 
 Not one moment paused the maiden, but with cheek 
 
 and brow aglow. 
 Staggered up the gloomy tower, where the bell swung 
 
 to and fro ; 
 Then she climbed the slimy ladder, dark, without one 
 
 ray of light. 
 Upward still, her pale lips saying: "Curfew shall not 
 
 ring to-night." 
 She has reached the -topmost ladder, o'er her hangs the 
 
 great dark bell, 
 
 And the awful gloom beneath her, like the pathway down 
 to hell; 
 
 See the ponderous tongue is swinging, 'tis the hour of 
 Curfew now,

 And the sight has chilled her bosom, stopped her breath 
 
 and paled her brow. 
 Shall she let it ring? No, never! her eyes flash with 
 
 sudden light, 
 And she springs and grasps it firmly — "Curfew shall not 
 
 ringto-iught!" 
 Out she swung, far out, the city seemed a tiny speck 
 
 below; 
 There, 'twixt heaven and earth suspended, as the bell 
 
 swung to and fro ; 
 And the half-deaf sexton ringing (years he had not 
 
 heard the bell). 
 And he thought the twilight Curfew rang yoxmg Basil's 
 
 funeral knell; 
 Still the maiden clinging firmly, cheek and brow so 
 
 pale and white. 
 Stilled her frightened heart's wild beating — "Curfew 
 
 shall not ring to-night." 
 It was o'er — ^the bell ceased swaying, and the maiden 
 
 stepped once more 
 Firmly on the damp old ladder, where for hundred 
 
 years before 
 Human foot had not been planted; and what she this 
 
 night had done 
 Should be told in long years after — as the rays of setting 
 
 sun 
 Light the sky with yellow beauty, aged sires with 
 
 heads of white 
 Tell their children why the Curfew did not ring that one 
 
 sad night. 
 O'er the distant hills came Cromwell; Bessie saw him, 
 
 and her brow, 
 Lately white with sickening terror, glows with sudden 
 
 beauty now;

 Ring in the thousand years of peace ! 
 
 Ring in the valiant man and free, 
 The larger heart, the kindlier hand; 
 Ring out the darkness of the land — 
 
 Ring in the Christ that is to be !

 MY MOTHER'S PICTURE. 
 
 O that those lips had language ! Life has passed 
 With me but roughly since I saw thee last ; 
 Those lips are thine, — thy own sweet smile I see. 
 The same that oft in childhood solaced me ; 
 Voice only fails, else how distinct they say, 
 "Grieve not, my child; chase all thy fears away!" 
 The meek intelligence of those dear eyes 
 (Blest be the art that can immortalize. 
 The art that baffles time's tyrannic claim 
 To quench it!) here shines on me still the same.

 Faithful remembrancer of one so dear! 
 
 welcome guest, though unexpected here! 
 Who bid'st me honor with an artless song, 
 Affectionate, a mother lost so long. 
 
 1 will obey, — not willingly alone, 
 
 But gladly, as the precept were her own; 
 And, while that face renews my filial grief, 
 Fancy shall weave a charm for my relief, — 
 Shall steep me in Elysian reverie, 
 A momentray dream that thou art she. 
 
 My mother! when I learned that thou wast dead. 
 Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed? 
 Hovered thy spirit o'er thy sorrowing son, — 
 Wretch, even then, life's journey just begun? 
 Perhaps thou gavest me, though unfelt, a kiss; 
 Perhaps a tear, if souls can weep in bliss — 
 Ah, that maternal smile! it answers — Yes. 
 I beard the bell toll on thy burial day; 
 I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away ; 
 And turning from my nursery window, drew 
 A long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu! 
 But was it such? — It was. — Where thou art gone 
 Adieus and farewells are a sound unknown; 
 May I but meet thee' on that peaceful shore. 
 The parting word shall pass my lips no more. 
 Thy maidens, grieved themselves at my concern. 
 Oft gave me promise of thy quick return ; 
 What ardently I wished I long believed. 
 And disappointed still, was still deceived, — 
 By expectation every day beguiled. 
 Dupe of tomorrow even from a child. 
 Thus many a sad to-morrow came and went. 
 Till, all my stock of infant sorrow spent.

 I learned at last submission to my lot; 
 But, though I less deplored thee, ne'er forgot. 
 
 Where once we dwelt our name is heard no more, 
 Children not thine have trod my nursery floor; 
 And where the gardener Robin, day by day. 
 Drew me to school along the public way, — 
 Delighted with my bauble coach, and wrapped 
 In scarlet mantle warm and velvet cap, — 
 'Tis now become a history little known. 
 That once we called the pastoral house our own. 
 Short lived possession! but the record fair 
 That memory keeps of all thy kindness there 
 Still outlives many a storm that has effaced 
 A thousand other themes, less deeply traced: 
 Thy nightly visits to my chamber made. 
 That thou mightst know me safe and warmly laid; 
 Thy morning bounties ere I left my home, — 
 The biscuit, or confectionery plum; 
 The fragrant waters on my cheeks bestowed 
 By thy own hand, till fresh they shone and glowed, 
 All this, and, more endearing still than all, 
 Thy constant flow of love, that knew no fall, — 
 Ne'er roughened by those cataracts and breaks 
 That humor interposed too often makes; 
 All this, still legible in memory's page, 
 And still to be so to my latest age. 
 Adds joy to duty, makes me glad to pay 
 Such honors to thee as my numbers may, — 
 Perhaps a frail memorial, but sincere, — 
 Not scorned in heaven, though little noticed here. 
 
 Could time, his flight reversed, restore the hours 
 When, playing with thy vesture's tissued flowers — 
 The violet, the pink, the jessamine —

 I pricked them into paper with a pin, 
 
 (And thou wast happier than myself the while — 
 
 Wouldst softly speak, and stroke my head and smile)- 
 
 Could those few pleasant days again appear, 
 
 Might one wish bring them, would I wish them here? 
 
 I would not trust my heart, — the dear delight 
 
 Seems so to be desired, perhaps I might. 
 
 But no, — what here we call our life is such, 
 
 So little to be loved, and thou so much, 
 
 That I should ill requite thee to constrain 
 
 Thy unbound spirit into bonds again. 
 
 Thou, as a gallant bark, from Albion's coast 
 (The storms all weathered and the ocean crossed), 
 Shoots into port at some well-havened isle. 
 Where spices breathe and brighter seasons smile; 
 There sits quiescent on the floods, that show 
 Her beauteous form reflected clear below 
 While airs impregnated with incense play 
 Around her, fanning light her streamers gay, 
 So thou , with sails how swift ! hast reached the shore 
 "Where tempests never beat nor billows roar;" 
 And thy loved consort on the dangerous tide 
 Of life long since has anchored by thy side. 
 But me, scarce hoping to attain that rest. 
 Always from port withheld, always distressed. 
 Me howling blasts drive devious, tempest-tossed, 
 Sails ripped, seams opening wide, and compass lost; 
 And day by day some current's thwarting force 
 Sets me more distant from a prosperous course. 
 Yet O, the thought that thou art safe, and he! — 
 That thought is joy, arrive what may to me, 
 My boast is not that I deduce my birth.

 From loins enthroned, and rulers of the earth; 
 But higher far my proud pretensions rise, — 
 The son of parents passed into the skies. 
 And now, farewell! — ^Time, unrevoked, has run 
 His wonted course ; yet what I wished is done. 
 By contemplation's help, not sought in vain, 
 I seem to have lived my childhood o'er again, — 
 To have renewed the joys that once were mine, 
 Without the sin of violating thine; 
 And, while the wings of fancy still are free, 
 And I can view this mimic show of thee, 
 Time has but half succeeded in his theft, — 
 Thyself removed, thy power to soothe me left.

 CARDINAL WOLSEY'S FAREWELL TO POWER. 
 
 Farewell, a long farewell to all my greatness ! 
 This is the state of man : To-day he puts forth 
 The tender leaves of hopes, to-morrow blossoms. 
 And bears his blushing honors thick upon him ; 
 The third day comes a frost, a killing frost. 
 And, — ^when he thinks, good easy man, full surely 
 His greatness is a-ripening, — nips his root. 
 And then he falls as I do. I have ventured. 
 Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders, 
 This many summers in a sea of glory, 
 But far beyond my depth; my high-blown pride 
 At length broke under me ; and now has left me. 
 Weary, and old with service, to the mercy 
 Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me, 
 Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye ;

 I feel my heart new opened: 0, how wretched 
 Is that poor man who hangs on princes' favors ! 
 There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to, 
 That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin, 
 More pangs and fears than wars or women have ; 
 And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer 
 Never to hope again.

 There are in this rude, stunning tide 
 
 Of human care and crime. 
 With whom the melodies abide

 Who carry music in their heart.

 Plying their daily toil with busier feet, 
 Because their secret souls a holy strain repeat.

 Beautiful Evelyn Hope is dead! 
 
 Sit and watch by her side an hour.

 Beginning to die, too, in the glass. 
 
 Little has yet been changed, I think; 
 The shutters are shut — ^no light may pass. 
 
 Save two long rays through the hinge's chink.

 Sixteen years old when she died! 
 
 Perhaps she had scarcely heard my name — 
 It was not her time to love; beside, 
 
 Her life had many a hope and aim, 
 Duties enough and little cares, 
 
 And now was quiet, now astir — 
 Till God's hand beckoned unawares. 
 
 And the sweet white brow is all of her. 
 Is it too late, then, Eveljm Hope? 
 
 What! your soul was pure and true; 
 The good stars met in your horoscope, 
 
 Made you of spirit, fire, and dew; 
 And just because I was thrice as old. 
 
 And our paths in the world diverged so wide, 
 Each was naught to each, must I be told? 
 
 We were fellow- mortals — ^naught beside? 
 No, indeed! for God above 
 
 Is great to grant, as mighty to make, 
 And creates the love to reward the love; 
 
 I claim you still, for my own love's sake! 
 Delayed, it may be, for more lives yet, 
 
 Through worlds I shall traverse not a few; 
 Much is to learn, and much to forget. 
 
 Ere the time be come for taking you. 
 But the time will come — at last it will — 
 
 When, Eveljm Hope, what meant, I shall say. 
 In the lower earth — ^in the years long still — 
 
 That body and soul so pure and gay; 
 Why your hair was amber I shall divine, 
 
 And your mouth of your own geranium's red — 
 And what you would do with me, in fine. 
 
 In the new life come in the old one's stead

 I have lived, I shall say, so much since then. 
 
 Given up myself so many times, 
 Gained me the gains of various men, 
 
 Ransacked the ages, spoiled the climes; 
 Yet one thing — one — in my soul's full scope, 
 
 Either I missed or itself missed me — 
 And I want and find you, Evelyn Hope ! 
 
 What is the issue ? let us see ! 
 
 I loved you, Evelyn, all the while; 
 
 My heart seemed full as it could hold — 
 There was place and to spare for the frank young 
 smile, 
 And the red young mouth, and the hair's yoimg 
 gold. 
 So, hush! I will give you this leaf to keep; 
 
 See, I shut it inside the sweet, cold hand. 
 There, that is our secret! go to sleep: 
 
 You will wake, and remember, and understand.

 PHILLIDA AND CORYDON. 
 
 In the merry month of May, 
 In a morn by break of day, 
 With a troop of damsels playing 
 Forth I rode, forsooth, a-Maying, 
 When anon by a woodside, 
 Where as May was in his pride, 
 I espied, all alone, 
 Phillida and Corydon. 
 
 Much ado there was, God wot! 
 
 He would love and she would not ; 
 
 She said, ""Never man was true;" 
 
 He says, "None was false to you." 
 
 He said he had loved her long; 
 
 She says, "Love should have no wrong." 
 
 Corydon would kiss her then : 
 She says, "Maids must kiss no men 
 Till they do for good and all." 
 Then she made the shepherd call 
 All the heavens to witness. Truth 
 Never loved a truer youth. 
 
 Thus, with many a pretty oath, 
 Yea and nay, and faitjj and troth, — 
 Such as silly shephetds use 
 When they will not love abuse, — 
 Love, which had been long deluded. 
 Was with kisses sweet concluded; 
 And Phillida, with garlands gay. 
 Was made the lady of the May,

 THE COTTER'S SATURDAY NIGHT. 
 
 INSCRIBED TO ROBERT AIKEN, ESQ. 
 
 *'Let not Ambition mock their useful toilp 
 Their homely joys» and destiny obscure; 
 
 Nor Grandeur hear, with a disdainful smile. 
 The short but simple .annals of the poor." — Gray. 
 
 My loved, my honored, much respected friend. 
 No mercenary bard his homage pays; 
 With honest pride I scorn each selfish end, 
 My dearest meed a friend's esteem and praise; 
 To you I sing, in simple Scottish lays, 
 The lowly train in life's sequestered scene; 
 The native feelings strong, the guileless ways; 
 What Aiken in a cottage would have been; 
 Ah! though his worth unknown, far happier there I ween. 
 
 November chill blaws loud wi' angry sugh; 
 The short'ning winter day is near a close; 
 The miry beasts retreating frae the pleugh. 
 The black'ning trains o' craws to their repose; 
 The toil-worn cotter frae' his labor goes, — 
 This night his weekly moil is at an end, — 
 Collects his spades, his mattocks, and his hoes, 
 Hoping the morn in ease and rest to spend. 
 And weary ,o'er the moor, his course doeshomewardbend. 
 
 At length his lonely cot appears in view, 
 Beneath the shelter of an aged tree; 
 Th' expectant wee things, toddlin, stacher through 
 To meet their dad wi' flichterin noise and glee.

 In youthful bloom, love sparklin in her e'e, 
 Comes hame, perhaps, to show a braw-new gbwn, 
 Or deposit her sair-won penny fee. 
 To help her parents dear, if they in hardship be. 
 
 Wi' joy unfeigned, brothers and sisters meet. 
 An' each for other's weelfare kindly spiers; 
 The social hours, swift- winged, unnoticed fleet; 
 Each tells the unco's that he sees or hears;/ 
 The parent's partial eye their hopeful years; 
 Anticipation forward points the view;

 Gars auld claes look amaist as weel's the new;

 But hark! a rap comes gently to the door; 
 Jenny, wha kens the meaning o' the same, 
 Tells how a neebor lad came o'er the moor 
 To do some errands, and convoy her hame. 
 The wily mother sees the conscious flame 
 Sparkle in Jenny's e'e and flush her cheek; 
 With heart-struck, anxious care inquires his name. 
 While Jenny hafflins is afraid to speak; 
 Weel pleased the mother hears it's nae wild, worthless 
 rake. 
 
 Wi' kindly welcome Jenny brings him ben; 
 A strappan youth; he takes the mother's eye; 
 Blithe Jenny sees the visit's no ill ta'en; 
 The father cracks of horses, pleughs, and kye. 
 The youngster's artless heart o'erflows wi' joy. 
 But blate and laithfu', scarce can weel behave; 
 The mother, wi' a woman's wiles, can spy 
 What makes the youth sae bashfu' an sae grave; 
 Weel pleased to think her bairn's respected like the lave. 
 
 O happy love! where love like this is found! 
 
 O heartfelt raptures! bliss beyond compare! 
 
 I've paced much this weary, mortal round, 
 
 And sage experience bids me this declare — 
 "If Heaven a draught of heavenly pleasure spare 
 
 One cordial in this melancholy vale, 
 'Tis when a youthful, loving, modest pair 
 
 In other's arms breathe out the tender tale. 
 Beneath the milk-white thorn that scents the evening 
 gale." 
 
 Is there, in human form, that bears a heart, 
 A wretch, a villian, lost to love and truth, 
 That can, with studied, sly, ensnaring art, 
 Betray sweet Jenny's unsuspecting youth?

 Curse on his perjured arts; dissembling, smooth, 
 All honor, virtue, conscience, all exiled; 
 Is there no pity, no relenting ruth, 
 Points to the parents fondling o'er their child. 
 Then paints the ruined maid, and the distraction wild? 
 
 But now the supper crowns their simple board, 
 The halesome parritch, chief o' Scotia's food; 
 The soupe their only Hawkie does afford; 
 That yont the hallan snugly chows her cood, 
 The dame brings forth in complimental mood, 
 To grace the lad, her weel-hained kebbuck, fell, 
 An' aft he's prest, an' aft he ca's it guid; 
 The frugal wifie, garrulous, will tell, 
 How 'twas a towmond auld, sin' lint was i' the bell. 
 
 The cheerfu' supper done, wi' serious face, 
 They, round the ingle, form a circle wide; 
 The sire turns o'er, wi' patriarchal grace, 
 The big ha' Bible, ance his father's pride; 
 His bonnet rev'rently is laid aside, 
 His lyart haffets wearing thin and bare; 
 Those strains that once did sweet in Zion glide, 
 He wales a portion with judicious care; 
 And,"Let us worship God", he says with solemn aiiii 
 
 They chant their artless notes in simple guise : 
 They tune their hearts, by far the noblest aim. 
 Perhaps Dundee's wild, warbling measures rise, 
 Or plaintive Martyrs, worthy of the name; 
 Or noble Elgin beats the heavenward flame. 
 The sweetest far of Scotia's holy lays, 
 Compared with these Italian trills are tame; 
 The tickled ears no heartfelt raptures raise, 
 Nae unison hae they with our Creator's praise.

 The priest-like father reads the sacred page, 
 How Abram was the friend of God on high; 
 Or Moses bade eternal warfare wage 
 With Amalek's ungracious progeny; 
 Or how the royal bard did groaning lie 
 Beneath the strokes of Heaven's avenging ire; 
 Or Job's pathetic plaint and wailing cry; 
 Or rapt Isaiah's wild, seraphic fire; 
 Or other holy seers that tune the sacred lyre. 
 
 Perhaps the Christian volume is the theme, 
 How guiltless blood for guilty man was shed; 
 How He, who bore in heaven the second name, 
 Had not on earth whereon to lay His head. 
 How His first followers and servants sped; 
 The precepts sage they wrote to many a land; 
 How he who lone in Patmos banished, 
 Saw in the sun a mighty angel stand, 
 And heard great Bab'lon's doom pronounced by Heaven's 
 command. 
 
 Then kneeling down, to Heaven's eternal King, 
 The saint, the father, and the husband prays: 
 Hope "springs exulting on triumphant wing," 
 That thus they all shall meet in future days, 
 There ever bask in uncreated rays, 
 No more to sigh, or shed the bitter tear. 
 Together hymning their Creator's praise.

 While circling time moves round" in an eternal sphere.

 Devotion's every grace, except the heart! 
 The power, incensed, the pageant will desert, 
 The pompous strain, the sacerdotal stole; 
 But haply, in some cottage far apart, 
 May hear, well pleased, the language of the soul. 
 And in His book of life the inmates poor enroll. 
 
 Then homeward all take off their several way; 
 The youngling cottagers retire to rest; 
 The parent-pair their secret homage pay. 
 And proffer up to Heaven the warm request 
 That He, who stills the raven's clamorous nest. 
 And decks the lily fair in flowery pride, 
 Would, in the way His wisdom sees the best. 
 For them and for their little ones provide; 
 But chiefly in their hearts with grace divine preside. 
 
 From scenes like these old Scotia's grandeur springs, 
 That makes her loved at home, revered abroad; 
 Princes and lords are but the breath of kings; 
 "An honest man's the noblest work of God;" 
 And certes, in fair Virtue's heavenly road. 
 The cottage leaves the palace far behind. 
 What is a lordling's pomp ? a cumbrous load. 
 Disguising oft the wretch of human kind, 
 Studied in arts of hell, in wickedness refined. 
 
 O Scotia, my dear, my native soil. 
 
 For whom my warmest wish to Heaven is sent, 
 
 Long may thy hardy sons of rustic toil 
 
 Be blessed with health, and peace, and sweet content; 
 
 And O, may Heaven their simple lives prevent 
 
 From luxury's contagion, weak and vile; 
 
 Then, howe'er crowns and coronets be rent.

 "And fashion is queen; and it's mighty queer 
 To see how, sometimes, while the man

 Enough you would think for a score of wives. 
 To keep them in luxury all their lives.

 Fashioned so slenderly, 
 Young, and so fair! 
 
 Look at her garments 
 Clinging like cerements ; 
 
 Whilst the wave constantly 
 Drips from her clothing; 
 
 Take her up instantly, 
 Loving, not loathing, — 
 
 Touch her not scornfully, 
 Think of her mournfully, 
 
 Gently and humanly. 
 Not of the stains of her; 
 All that remains of her 
 
 Now, is pure womanly. 
 
 Make no deep scrutiny 
 Into her mutiny, 
 
 Rash and undutiful; 
 Past all dishonor, 
 Death has left on her 
 
 Only the beautiful. 
 
 Still for all slips of hers, 
 
 One of Eve's family — 
 Wipe those poor lips of hers 
 
 Oozing so clammily. 
 Loop up her tresses 
 
 Escaped from the comb 
 Her fair auburn tresses ; 
 Whilst wonderment guesses. 
 
 Where was her home ?

 Who was her father? 
 
 Who was her mother? 
 Had she a sister? 
 
 Had she a brother? 
 Or was there a dearer one . 
 Still, and a nearer one 
 
 Yet, than all other? 
 
 Alas! for the rarity 
 Of Christian charity 
 
 Under the sun! 
 O! it was pitiftd, 
 Near a whole city full, 
 
 Home she had none. 
 
 Sisterly, brotherly. 
 Fatherly, motherly, 
 
 Feelings had changed; 
 Love, by harsh evidence. 
 Thrown from its eminence, 
 Even God's providence 
 
 Seeming estranged. 
 
 Where the lamps quiver 
 So far in the river. 
 
 With many a light 
 From window and casement, 
 From garret to basement. 
 She stood, with amazement, 
 
 Houseless by night. 
 
 The bleak wind of March 
 
 Made her tremble and shiver; 
 
 But not the dark arch. 
 Or the black flowing river;

 Ere her limbs frigidly 
 Stiffen too rigidly. 
 
 Decently, kindly 
 Smooth and compose them; 
 And her eyes, close them, 
 
 Staring so blindly! 
 Dreadfully staring. 
 
 Through muddy impurity, 
 As when with the daring 
 Last look of despairing. 
 
 Fixed on futurity.

 THE STORMY PETREL. 
 
 A thousand miles from land are we. 
 
 Tossing about on the stormy sea, — 
 
 From billow to bounding billow cast. 
 
 Like fleecy snow on the stormy blast. 
 
 The sails are scattered abroad like weeds; 
 
 The strong masts shake like quivering reeds; 
 
 The mighty cables and iron chains. 
 
 The hull, which all earthly strength disdains, — 
 
 They strain and they crack; and hearts like stone 
 
 Their natural, hard, proud strength disown. 
 
 Up and down! — up and down! 
 
 From the base of the wave to the billow's crown, 
 
 And amidst the flashing and feathery foam 
 
 The stormy petrel finds a home, — 
 
 A home, if such a place may be 
 
 For her who lives on the wide, wide sea,

 On the craggy ice, in the frozen air, 
 
 And only seeketh her rocky lair 
 
 To warm her young, and to teach them to spring 
 
 At once o'er the waves on their stormy wing! 
 
 O'er the deep! — o'er the deep! 
 
 Where the whale and the shark and the swordfish 
 
 sleep, — 
 Outflying the blast and the driving rain. 
 The petrel telleth her tale — in vain; 
 For the mariner curseth the warning bird 
 Which bringeth him news of the storm unheard! 
 Ah! thus does the prophet of good or ill 
 Meet hate from the creatures he serveth still ; 
 Yet he never falters, — so, petrel, spring 
 Once more o'er the waves on thy stormy wing!

 That was the grandest funeral 
 
 That ever passed on earth; 
 But no man heard the tramping, 
 
 Or saw the train go forth; 
 Noiselessly as the daylight 
 
 Comes when the night is done, 
 And the crimson streak on ocean's cheek 
 
 Grows into the great sun. 
 Noiselessly as the springtime 
 
 Her crown of verdure weaves. 
 And all the trees en all the hills 
 
 Open their thousand leaves, — 
 So, without sound of music, 
 
 Or voice of them that wept. 
 Silently down from the mountain crown 
 
 The great procession swept. 
 Perchance the bald old eagle 
 
 On gray Beth-peor's height. 
 Out of his rocky eyrie 
 
 Looked on the wondrous sight; 
 Perchance the lion, stalking. 
 
 Still shuns the hallowed spot ; 
 For beast and bird have seen and heard 
 
 That which man knoweth not. 
 Lo! when the warrior dieth, 
 
 His comrades in the war. 
 With arms reversed and muffled drum 
 
 Follow the funeral car. 
 They show the banners taken, 
 
 And tell his battles won, 
 And after him lead his masterless steed, 
 
 While peals the minute gun.

 Amid the noblest of the land 
 
 Men lay the sage to rest, 
 And give the bard an honored place 
 
 With costly marble dressed, 
 In the great minster transept, 
 
 Where lights like glories fall, 
 And the choir sings, and the organ rings 
 
 Along the emblazoned wall. 
 This was the bravest warrior 
 
 That ever buckled sword; 
 This the most gifted poet 
 
 That ever breathed a word; 
 And never earth's philosopher 
 
 Traced, with his golden pen. 
 On the deathless page truths half so sage 
 
 As he wrote down for men. 
 And had he not high honor? 
 
 The hill-side for his pall. 
 To lie in state while angels wait, 
 
 With stars for tapers tall; 
 And the dark rock pines, like tossing plumes. 
 
 Over his bier to wave; 
 And God's own hand, in that lonely land, 
 
 To lay him in the grave, — 
 In that deep grave without a name, 
 
 Whence his uncoffined clay 
 Shall break again, — O wondrous thought! 
 
 Before the judgment day; 
 And stand with glory wrapped around, 
 
 On the hills he never trod, 
 And speak of the strife that won our life 
 , With the incarnate Son of God.

 THE CHRISM AND CROWN OF LOVE. 
 
 First time he kissed me, he but only kissed 
 The fingers of this hand wherewith I write. 
 And ever since it grew more clean and white, 
 Slow to write — greetings; quick with its "Oh, list," 
 When the angels speak. A ring of amethyst 
 I could not wear here plainer to my sight 
 Than that first kiss. The second passed in height i 
 The first, and sought the forehead, and, half missed 
 Half falling on the hair. O, beyond meed! 
 That was the chrism of love, with love's own crown. 
 With sanctifying sweetness did precede. 
 The third upon my lips was folded down 
 In perfect purple state! since when, indeed, 
 I have been proud and said, "My Lovte, my own."

 THOSE EVENING BELLS. 
 
 Those evening bells! those evening bells! 
 How many a tale their music tells, 
 Of youth, and home, and that sweet time 
 When last I heard their soothing chime. 
 
 Those joyous hours are passed away; 
 And many a heart that then was gay 
 Within the tomb now darkly dwells, 
 And hears no more those evening bells. 
 
 And so 'twill be when I am gone; 
 That tuneful peal will still ring on, 
 While other bards shall walk these dells. 
 And sing your praise, sweet evening bells!

 Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our

 I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight, 
 Then shortened each stirrup and set the pique right, 
 Rebuckled the check-strap, chained slacker the bit, 
 Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.

 At Boom a great yellow star came out to see;

 And against him the cattle stood black every one, 
 To stare through the mist at us galloping past ;

 The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray; 
 
 And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent

 For my voice and the other pricked out on his track; 
 And one eye's black intelligence, — ever that glance 
 O'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance;

 Of the news which alone covdd save Aix from her fate. 
 With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim 
 And with circles of red for his eye-sockets' rim. 
 
 Then I cast loose my buff-coat, each holster let fall. 
 Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all, 
 Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear, 
 Called my Roland his pet-name, my horse without 
 
 peer — 
 Clapped my hands, laughed and sung, any noise, bad

 Till at length into Aix, Roland galloped and stood.

 HELVELLYN. 
 
 [In the spring of 1805, a young gentleman of talents, and of a 
 most amiable disposition, perished by losing his way on the 
 mountain Helveliyn. His remains were not discovered till three 
 months afterward when they were found guarded by a faithful 
 terrier, his constant attendant dtiring frequent solitary rambles 
 through the wilds of Cumberland and Westmoreland.! 
 
 I climbed the dark brow of the mighty Helveliyn, 
 Lakes and mountains beneath me gleamed misty and 
 wide; 
 All was still, save, by fits, when the eagle was yelling. 
 
 And starting around me the echoes replied. 
 On the right, Striden Edge round the Red Tarn was 
 
 bending. 
 And Catchedicam its left verge was defending, 
 One huge nameless rock in the front was ascending. 
 When I marked the sad spot where the wanderer died.

 Like the corpse of an outcast abandoned to weather, 
 
 Till the mountain winds wasted the tenantless clay; 
 Nor yet quite deserted, though lonely extended, 
 For, faithful in death, his mute favorite attended. 
 The much-loved remains of her master defended, 
 
 And chased the hill-fox and the raven away. 
 
 How long didst thou think that his silence was slumber? 
 
 When the wind waved his garment, how oft didst thou 
 start? 
 How many long days and long nights didst thou number 
 
 Ere he faded before thee, the friend of thy heart? 
 And, 0, was it meet that — no requiem read o'er him, 
 No mother to weep, and no friend to deplore him. 
 And thou little guardian, alone stretched before him — 
 
 Unhonored the Pilgrim from life should depart? 
 
 When a prince to the fate of the peasant has yielded, 
 The tapestry waves dark round the dim-lighted hall. 
 
 With 'scutheons of silver the coffin is shielded. 
 And pages stand mute by the canopied pall: 
 
 Through the courts, at deep midnight, the torches are 
 gleaming; 
 
 In the proudly arched chapel the banners are beaming; 
 
 Far adown the long aisle sacred music is streaming, 
 Lamenting a chief of the people People should fall. 
 
 But meeter for thee, gentle lover of nature, 
 
 Tq lay down thy head like the meek mountain lamb, 
 When, wildered, he drops from some cliff huge in stature. 
 And draws his last sob by the side of his dam.

 And more stately thy couch by this desert lake lying, 
 Thy obsequies gung by the gray plover flying.

 SONG OF SPRING. 
 
 Laud the first spring daisies; 
 Chant aloud their praises; 
 Send the children up 
 To the high hill's top; 
 Tax not the strength of their young hands 
 To increase your lands. 
 Gather the primroses, 
 Make handfuls into posies; 
 
 Take them to the little girls who are at work in mills ; 
 Pluck the violets blue, — 
 Ah, pluck not a few! 
 
 Knowest thou what good thoughts from Heaven the 
 violet instills? 
 
 Give the children holidays 
 
 (And let these be jolly days). 
 
 Grant freedom to the children in this joyous spring: 
 
 Better men, hereafter, 
 
 Shall we have, for laughter 
 
 Freely shouted to the woods, till all the echoes ring. 
 
 Send the children up 
 
 To the high hill's top. 
 
 Or deep into the wood's recesses, 
 
 To woo spring's caresses.

 THE ONE-HOSS SHAY. 
 
 OR. THE deacon's MASTERPIECE. 
 A LOGICAL STORY. 
 
 Have you heard of the wonderful one-hoss shay 
 That was built in such a logical way. 
 It ran a hundred years to a day. 
 And then of a sudden, it — ah, but stay, 
 I'll tell you what happened without delay, 
 Scaring the parson into fits. 
 Frightening people out of their wits, — 
 Have you ever heard of that, I say?

 Seventeen hundred and fifty-five, 
 
 Georgiiis Secundus was then aUve, — 
 
 Snuffy old drone from the Gterman hive. 
 
 That was the year when Lisbon-town 
 
 Saw the earth open p,nd gulp her down, 
 
 And Braddock's 9,miy was done so brown. 
 
 Left without a scalp to its crown. 
 
 It was on the terrible earthquake day ; 
 
 That the Deacon finished the one-hoss shay. 
 
 Now in building of chaises, I tell you what, 
 There is always somewhere a weakest spot — 
 In hub, tire, felloe, in spring or thrill, 
 In panel, or crossbar, or floor, or sill, 
 In screw, bolt, thorough-brace, — ^lurldng still, 
 Find it somewhere you must and will, — 
 Above or below, or within or without, — 
 And that's the reason, beyond a doubt, 
 A chaise breaks down but doesn't wear out. 
 
 But the Deacon swore (as Deacon's do, 
 With an "I dew vtim, or an "I tell yeou,") 
 He would build one shay to beat the taown 
 'N' the keounty 'n' all the kentry raoun' ; 
 It should be so built that it couldn't break daown: 
 "Fur," said the Deacon, " 't's mighty plain 
 That the weakes' place mus' stan' the strain: 
 'N' the way t' fix it, uz, I maintain. 
 
 Is only jest 
 T' make that place uz strong uz the rest." 
 
 So the Deacon inquired of the village folk 
 
 "Where he could find the strongest oak, 
 
 That couldn't be split, nor bent, nor broke. —

 That -R'as for spokes, and floor and sills; 
 
 He sent for lancewood to make the thills; 
 
 The crossbars were ash, from the straightest trees; 
 
 The panels of whitewood, that cuts like cheese, 
 
 But lasts like iron for things like these ; 
 
 The hubs of logs from the "Settler's ellum," — 
 
 Last of its timber, — ^they couldn't sell 'em. 
 
 Never an ax had seen their chips. 
 
 And the wedges flew from between their lips, 
 
 Their blimt ends frizzled like celery-tips; 
 
 Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw, 
 
 Spring, tire, axle and linchpin too, 
 
 Steel of the finest, bright and blue; 
 
 Thoroughbrace, bison-skin, thick and wide; 
 
 Boot, top, dasher, from tough old hide 
 
 Found in the pit when the tanner died. 
 
 That was the day he "put her through." — 
 
 "There!" said the Deacon, "naow she'll dew!" 
 
 Do! I tell you, I rather guess 
 She was a wonder, and nothing less! 
 Colts grew horses, beards turned gray, 
 Deacon and deaconess dropped away, 
 Children and grandchildren, — where were they? 
 But there stood the stout old one-hoss shay 
 As fresh as on Lisbon-earthquake day! 
 
 Eighteen hundred; — it came and found 
 The Deacon's masterpiece strong and sound. 
 Eighteen hundred increased by ten; — 
 "Hahnsum kerridge" they called it then. 
 Eighteen hundred and twenty came ; — 
 Running as usual; much the same.

 We have worked and saved all winter— been hungry

 But we hid this much from father under the old door-

 Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to 
 
 borrow 
 From my books surcease of sorrow, sorrow for the lost 
 Lenore, 
 For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels 
 named Lenore, 
 
 Nameless here forevermore. 
 
 And the silken, sad, uncertain rustUng of each purple 
 curtain 
 Thrilled me, filled me, with fantastic terrors never felt 
 before ; 
 Sb that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood 
 
 repeating, 
 " 'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber 
 
 door. 
 Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber 
 door; 
 
 This it is, and nothing more." 
 
 Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no 
 longer, 
 "Sir," said I, "or madam, truly your forgiveness I 
 implore; 
 But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came 
 rapping, 
 And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my cham- 
 ber door, 
 That I scarce was sure I heard you." Here I opened 
 wide the door; — 
 
 Darkness there, and nothing more.

 Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, 
 wondering, fearing. 
 Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to 
 dream before; 
 But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no 
 token, 
 And the only word there spoken was the whispered 
 word, "Lenore;" 
 This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the 
 word, "Lenore." 
 
 Merely this, and nothing more. 
 
 Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me 
 burning, 
 
 Soon again I heard a tapping, something louder than 
 before. 
 "Surely," said I, "surely, that is something at my win- 
 dow lattice ; 
 
 Let me see then, what thereat is, and this mystery 
 explore ; 
 
 Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery 
 explore ; 
 'Tis the wind and 'nothing more." 
 
 Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt 
 and flutter, 
 In there stepped a stately raven, of the saintly days of 
 yore. 
 Not the least obeisance made he ; not a minute stopped 
 or staid he ; 
 But with mien of lord or lad}^, perched above my 
 
 chamber door, 
 Perched upon a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber 
 door; 
 
 Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

 Then this ebon bird beguiling my sad fancy into smil- 
 ing, 
 By the grave and stem decorum of the countenance it 
 wore, 
 "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, 
 " art sure no craven, 
 Ghastly, grim, and ancient raven, wandering from the 
 
 Nightly shore, 
 Tell me whiat thy lordly name is on the Night's Pluto- 
 nian shore." 
 Quoth the raven, " Nevermore." 
 
 Much I marvieled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so 
 plainly, 
 Though its answer little meaning, little relevancy bore; 
 For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being 
 Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his cham- 
 ber door, 
 Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his cham- 
 ber door, 
 
 "With such name as "Evermore."' 
 
 But the raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke 
 
 only 
 That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did 
 
 outpour. 
 Nothing further then he uttered; not a feather then he 
 fluttered; 
 Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends 
 
 have flown before; 
 On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes havs 
 flown before; 
 
 Then the bird said, "Nevermore."

 Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken, 
 
 "Doubtless," said I, "what it mutters is its only stock

 Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful 
 
 disaster 
 
 Followed fast and followed faster, till his songs one 
 
 burden bore, 
 Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden 
 bore, 
 
 Of 'Never — nevermore.' " 
 
 But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling, 
 Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and 
 bust and door; 
 Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to link- 
 ing 
 Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of 
 yore, 
 What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous 
 bird of yore 
 
 Meant in croaking, "Nevermore." 
 
 This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing 
 To the fowl, whose fiery eyes now burned into my 
 bosom's core; 
 This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease re- 
 clining 
 On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight 
 gloated o'er, 
 But whose velvet violet lining with the lamplight gloat-

 She shall pres«, ah, nevermore.

 I make a sudden sally 
 And sparkle out among the ferns.

 In little sharps and trebles ^

 Far on the left, unseen the while, 
 Stanley broke Lennox and Argyle; 
 Though there the western mountaineer 
 Rushed with bare bosom on the spear. 
 And flung the targe aside, 
 And with both hands the broadsword plied: 
 *Twas vain: — For Fortane on the right. 
 With fickle smile, cheer' i Scotland's fight, 
 Then fell that spotless banner white,

 The Howard's lion fell; 
 Yet still Lord Marmion's falcon flew 
 With wavering flight, while fiercer grew 
 
 Arotind the battle yell. 
 The border slogan rent the sky! 
 *'A Home!" "a Gordon!" was the cry: 
 Loud were the clanging blows: 
 Advanced, — ^forced back, — now low, now high, 
 The pennon sunk and rose; 
 As bends the bark's mast in the gale, 
 When rent are rigging, shrouds and sail, 
 
 It wavered 'mid the foes. 
 No longer Blount the view could bear; 
 
 "By Heaven and all its saints I swear 
 I will not see it lost! 
 Fitz Eustace, you with Lady Clare 
 May bid your beads and patter prayer, — 
 
 I gallop to the host." 
 And to the fray he rode amain, 
 Follow'd by all the archer train. 
 The fiery youth with desperate charge 
 Made, for space, an opening large, — 
 
 The rescued banner rose, — 
 But darkly closed the war around, 
 Like pine-tree rooted from the groimd, 
 
 It sunk among the foes. 
 Then Eustace mounted too: — Yet staid,' 
 As loath to leave the helpless maid, 
 
 When fast as shaft can fly, 
 Bloodshot his eyes, his nostrils spread, 
 The loose rein dangling from his head, 
 Housing and saddle bloody red.

 And Eustace, maddening at the sight, 
 
 A look and sign to Clara cast, 
 To mark he would return in haste, 
 Then plimged into the fight. 
 
 Ask me not what the maiden feels. 
 Left in that dreadful hour alone; 
 Perchance her reason stoops or reels; 
 Perchance a courage, not her own. 
 Braces her mind to desperate tone — 
 The scattered van of England wheels; — 
 She only said, as loud in air 
 The tumult roared, "Is Wilton there.?"— 
 They fly, or madden'd by despair. 
 Fight but to die,— "Is Wilton there?"— 
 With that, straight up the hill there rode 
 Two horsemen drenched with gore, 
 And in their arms a helpless load, 
 A wounded knight they bore. 
 His hand still strained the broken brand; 
 His arms were smeared with blood and sand: 
 Dragged from among the horses' feet, 
 With dinted shield, and helmet beat. 
 The falcon, crest and plumage gone, 
 Can this be haughty Marmion ! * * * 
 Young BloTjnt his armor did unlace, 
 And gazing on his ghastly face, 
 Said — "By Saint George, he's gone! 
 That spear-wound has our master sped, 
 And see the deep cut on his head! 
 Good-night to Marmion." 
 "Unnurtured Blount! thy brawling cease;

 By the light quivering aspen made; 
 When pain and anguish wring the brow, 
 A ministering angel thou! — 
 
 Scarce were the piteous accents said, 
 When, with the Baron's casque, the maid 
 
 To the nigh streamlet ran: 
 Forgot were hatred, wrongs, and fears — 
 
 The plaintive voice alone she hears, 
 Sees but the dying man. 
 She stooped her by the runnel's side. 
 But in abhorrence backward drew: 
 For, oozing from the mountain's side. 
 Where waged the war, a dark red tide 
 Was curdling in the streamlet blue. 
 Where shall she turn? — behold her mark

 "Alas!" she cried; "the while,— 
 
 Oh! think of your immortal weal! 
 In vain for Constance is your zeal: 
 She — died at Holy Isle." — 
 Lord Marmion started from the ground 
 As light as if he felt no wound; 
 Though in the action burst the tide, 
 In torrents from his wotmded side. 
 
 "Then it was truth," he said, — "I knew 
 That the dark presage must be true — 
 I would the Fiend, to whom belongs

 Might bribe him to delay. 
 It may not be! — this dizzy trance — 
 Curse on yon base marauder's lance, 
 And doubly cursed my failing brand, 
 A sinful heart makes a feeble hand."

 Supported by the trembling monk. 
 With fruitless labor, Clara bound.

 In the middle of the room, in its white coffin, lay the dead 
 child, a nephew of the poet. Near it,in a great chair, sat Walt 
 Whitman,surroiinded by little ones, and holding a beautiful little 
 girl on his lap. The child looked curiously at the spectacle of 
 death and then inquiringly into the old man's face. "You 
 don't know what it is, do you, my dear?"said he, adding, "we 
 don't either." 
 
 We know not what it is, dear, this sleep so deep and still, 
 The folded hands, the awful calm, the cheek so pale and 
 
 chill; 
 The lids that will not lift again, though we may call and 
 
 call. 
 The strange, white solitude of peace that settles over all. 
 
 We know not what it means, dear, this desolate heart-

 This dread to take our daily way, and walk in it again',

 We know not to what other sphere the loved ones who 
 
 leave us go, 
 Nor why we're left to wonder still ; nor why we do not . 
 
 know. 
 
 But this we know: Our loved and dead, if they should 
 
 come this day — 
 Should come and ask us, "What is life?" not one of us 
 
 could say. 
 Life is a mystery as deep as death can be ; 
 Yet, oh, how sweet it is to us, this life we live and see! 
 
 Then might they say — ^these vanished ones — and blessed 
 
 is the thought! 
 "So death is sweet to us, beloved! though we mayteU ye 
 
 naught; 
 We may not tell it to the quick — this mystery of death — 
 Ye may not tell us, if ye would, the mystery of breath." 
 
 The child who enters life comes not with knowledge or 
 
 intent; 
 So those who enter death must go as little children sent. 
 Nothing is known. But I believe that God is overhead: 
 And as life is to the living, so death is to the dead.

 Round about them orchards sweep, 
 Apple and peach tree fruited deep, 
 
 Fair as a garden of the Lord 
 
 To the eyes of the famished rebel horde, 
 
 On that pleasant mom of the early fall, 
 When Lee marched over the mountain wall, 
 
 Over the mountains winding down. 
 Horse and foot into Frederick town. 
 
 Forty flags with their silver stars, 
 Forty flags with their crimson bars, 
 
 Flapped in the morning wind; the sun 
 Of noon looked down and saw not one. 
 
 Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then, 
 Bowed with her four score years and ten. 
 
 Bravest of all in Frederick town, 
 
 She took up the flag that the men hauled down ; 
 
 In her attic window the staff she set. 
 To show that one heart was loyal yet. 
 
 Up the street came the rebel tread, 
 Stonewall Jackson riding ahead. 
 
 Under his slouched hat left and right 
 He glanced — the old flag met his sight.

 It rent the banner with seam and sash.

 Quick as it fell, from the broken staff 
 Dame Barabara snatched the silken scarf; 
 
 She leaned far out on the window sill, 
 And shook it forth with a royal will. 
 
 "Shoot, if you must, this old gray head. 
 But spare your coimtry's flag!" she said. 
 
 A shade of sadness, a blush of shame 
 Over the face of the leader came; 
 
 The nobler nature within him stirred 
 To life at that woman's deed and word. 
 
 "Who touches a hair of yon gray head 
 Dies, like a dog! March on!" he said. 
 
 All day long through Frederick street 
 Sounded the tread of marching feet. 
 
 All day long that free flag tossed 
 Over the heads of the rebel host; 
 
 Ever its torn folds rose and fell 
 On the loyal winds that loved it well. 
 
 And through the hill gaps sunset light 
 Shone over it with a warm good night. 
 
 Barbara Frietchie's work is o'er, 
 
 And the rebel rides on his raids no more. 
 
 Honor to her! and let a tear 
 
 Fall, for her sake on Stonewall's bier!

 Behold their tears and hear their cries!

 On victory or death. 
 
 Now, now the dangerous storm is rolling, 
 Which treacherous kings confederate raise; 
 
 The dogs of war, let loose are howling. 
 And lo ! our fields and cities blaze ; 
 
 And shall we basely view the ruin. 
 
 While lawless force, with guilty stride. 
 Spreads desolation far and wide, 
 
 With crimes and blood his hands embruing, 
 To arms! to arms! ye brave.

 Once having felt thy generous flame? 
 
 Can dungeons, bolts, or bars confine thee! 
 
 Or whips thy noble spirit tame?

 That falsehood's dagger tyrants wield,

 "Forward, the Light Brigade!" 
 Was there a man dismay'd? 
 Not tho' the soldiers knew

 Theirs not to reason why, 
 Theirs but to do and die.

 Could we but know 
 The land that ends our dark, uncertain travel. 
 
 Where lie those happier hills and meadows low — 
 Ah! if beyond the spirit's inmost cavil 
 
 Aught of that country could we surely know — 
 Who would not go? 
 
 Might we but hear 
 The hovering, angel's high imagined chorus. 
 
 Or catch, betimes, with wakeful eyes and clear, 
 One radiant vista of the realm before us. 
 
 With one rapt moment given to see and hear, 
 Ah! who would fear? 
 
 Were we quite sure 
 To find the peerless friend who left us lonely, 
 Or there, by some celestial stream as pure, 
 To gaze in the eyes that here were love lit only — 
 This weary mortal coil, were we quite sure, — 
 Who would endure?

 Now glory to the Lord of hosts, from whom all glories are ! 
 
 And glory to our sovereign liege, King Henry of Navarre ! 
 
 Now let there be the merry sound of music and of dance. 
 
 Through thy corn-fields green and sunny vines, O pleas- 
 ant land of France! 
 
 And thou, Rochelle, our own Rochelle, protid city of the 
 waters, 
 
 Again let rapture light the eyes of all thy mourning 
 daughters ; 
 
 As thou wert constant in our ills, be joyous in our joy; 
 
 For cold and stiff and still are they who wrought thy 
 walls' annoy. 
 
 Hurrah! hurrah! a single field hath turned the chance 
 of war! 
 
 Hurrah! hurrah! for Ivry, and Henry of Navarre. 
 
 Oh ! how our hearts were beating, when, at the dawn of 
 day, 
 
 We saw the army of the league drawn out in long array; 
 
 With all its priest-led citizens, and all its rebel peers, 
 
 And Appenzel's stout infantry, and Egmont's Flemish 
 spears, 
 
 There rode the brood of false Lorraine, the curses of our 
 land; 
 
 And dark Mayenne was in the midst, a truncheon in his 
 hand; 
 
 And as we looked on them, we thought of Seine's em- 
 purpled flood. 
 
 And good Coligni's hoary hair all dabbled with his blood; 
 
 And we cried unto the living God, who rules the fate of 
 war, 
 
 To fight for His own holy name, and Henry of Navarre.

 The king is come to marshal us, all in his armor drest; 
 And he has bound a snow-white plume upon liis gallant 
 
 crest. 
 He looked upon his people, and a tear was in his eye; 
 He looked upon the traitors, and his glance was stern 
 
 and high. 
 Right graciously he smiled on us, as rolled from wing to 
 
 to wing, 
 Down all our line, a deafening shout : God save our lord 
 
 the king! 
 'And if my standard-bearer fall, as fall full well he may — 
 For never saw I promise yet of such a bloody fray — 
 Press where you see my white plume shine amidst the 
 
 ranks of war, 
 And be your orifiamme to-day the helmet of Navarre." 
 
 Hurrah! the foes are moving. Hark to the mingled din. 
 Of fife, and steed, and trump, and drum, and roaring 
 
 culverin. 
 The fiery duke is pricking fast across Saint Andre's plain, 
 With all the hireling chivalry of Guelders and Almayne. 
 Now by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of 
 
 France, 
 Charge for the golden lilies — upon them with the lance! 
 
 A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears 
 in rest, 
 
 A thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow- 
 white crest; 
 
 And in they burst, and on they rushed while, like a guid- 
 ing star, 
 
 Amidst the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of Nar 
 varre.

 Now, God be praised, the day is ours: Mayenne hath 
 
 turned his rein; 
 D'Aumale hath cried for quarter; the Flemish count is 
 
 slain; 
 Their ranks are breaking like thin clouds before a Biscay 
 
 gale; 
 The field is heaped with bleeding steeds, and flags, and 
 
 cloven mail. 
 And then we thought on vengeance, and, all along our van, 
 Remember Saint Bartholomew! was passed from man to 
 
 man. 
 But out spake gentle Henry — "No Frenchman is my foe: 
 Down, down, with every foreigner; but let your brethren 
 
 go"— 
 Oh! was there ever such a knight, in friendship or in war, 
 As our sovereign lord. King Henry, the soldier of Na- 
 varre? 
 
 Right well fought all the Frenchmen who fought for 
 France to-day; 
 
 And many a lordly banner God gave them for a prey. 
 
 But we of the religion have borne us best in fight ; 
 
 And the good lord of Rosny hath ta'en the comet white — 
 
 Our own true Maximilian the comet white hath ta'en, 
 
 The comet white with crosses black, the flag of false Lor- 
 raine. 
 
 Up with it high; unfurl it wide — that all the host may 
 know 
 
 How God hath humbled the proud house which wrought 
 His church such woe. 
 
 Then on the ground, while trumpets sound their loudest 
 point of war, 
 
 Fling the red shreds, a footcloth meet for Henry of Na- 
 rarre.

 "Beware the pine-tree's withered branch! 
 Beware the awful avalanche!" 
 This was the peasant's last good night: 
 A voice replied, far up the height.

 At break of day, as heavenward 
 The pious monks of St. Bernard 
 Uttered the oft-repeated prayer, 
 A voice cried through the startled air,

 A traveler, by the faithful hound. 
 Half-buried in the snow was found, 
 Still grasping in his hand of ice 
 That banner with the strange device,

 No mist obscures, nor cloud, nor speck, nor stain 
 
 Breaks the serene of heaven;

 Like the ocean girdled with the sky.

 The harp that once through Tara's halls 
 
 The soul of music shed. 
 Now hangs as mute on Tara's walls,

 So sleeps the pride of former days, 
 
 So glory's thrill is o'er, 
 And hearts that once beat high for praise 
 
 Now feel that pulse no more.

 No more to chiefs and ladies bright 
 
 The harp of Tara swells; 
 The chord alone that breaks at night 
 
 Its tale of ruin tells. 
 Thus freedom now so seldom wakes, 
 The only throb she gives 
 Is when some heart indignant breaks 
 
 To show that still she lives.

 HYMN TO THE NIGHT. 
 
 I heard the trailing garments of the Night 
 Sweep through her marble halls! 
 
 I saw her sable skirts all fringed with light 
 From the celestial walls! 
 
 I felt her presence, by its spell of might, 
 
 Stoop o'er me from above; 
 The calm, majestic presence of the Night, 
 
 As of the one I love. 
 
 I heard the sounds of sorrow and delight, 
 
 The manifold, soft chimes, 
 That fill the haunted chambers of the Night, 
 
 Like some old poet's rhymes. 
 
 From the cool cisterns of the midnight air 
 
 My spirit drank repose; 
 The fountain of perpetual peace flows there, 
 
 From those deep cisterns flows. 
 
 O holy Night! from thee I learn to bear 
 
 What man has borne before! 
 Thou layest thy finger on the lips of Caret 
 
 And they complain no more.

 "My sister, and my sister's child,

 Quoth Mrs. Gilpin, "That's well said; 
 
 And, for that wine is dear. 
 We will be furnished with our own,

 John Gilpin kissed his loving wife; 
 
 O'erjoyed was he to find 
 That, though on pleasure she was bent, 
 
 She had a frugal mind. 
 
 The morning came, the chaise was brought, 
 
 But yet was not allowed 
 To drive up to the door, lest all 
 
 Should say that she was proud. 
 
 So three doors off the chaise was stayed 
 
 Where they did all get in — 
 Six precious souls, and all agog 
 
 To dash through thick and thin. 
 
 Smack went the whip, round went the wheels, 
 
 Were never folks so glad; 
 The stones did rattle underneath. 
 
 As if Cheapside were mad. 
 
 John Gilpin at his horse's side 
 
 Seized fast the flowing mane,

 For saddletree scarce reached had he, 
 
 His journey to begin, 
 When, turning round his head, he saw 
 
 Three customers come in. 
 
 So down he came; for loss of time, 
 
 Although it grieved him sore, 
 Yet loss of pence, f\ill well he knew. 
 
 Would trouble him much more. 
 
 'Twas long before the customers 
 
 Were suited to their mind; 
 When Betty, screaming, came down stairs— 
 
 "The wine is left behind!" 
 
 "Good lack !" quoth he — "yet bring it me. 
 My leathern belt likewise, 
 In which I bear my trusty sword 
 When I do exercise." 
 
 Now Mistress Gilpin (careful soul!) 
 
 Had two stone bottles foimd. 
 To hold the liquor that she loved 
 
 And keep it safe and sound. 
 
 Each bottle had a curling ear. 
 
 Through which the belt he drew, 
 And hung a bottle on each side. 
 
 To make his balance true. 
 
 Then over all, that he might be 
 
 Equipped from toe to toe. 
 His long red cloak, well brushed and neat, 
 
 He manfully did throw.

 Now see him mounted once again 
 
 Upon his nimble steed, 
 Full slowly pacing o'er the stones, 
 
 With caution and good heed. 
 
 But finding soon a smoother road 
 
 Beneath his well-shod feet. 
 The snorting beast began to trot, 
 
 Which galled him in his seat. 
 
 So, "Fair and softly," John he cried, 
 
 But John he cried in vain ; 
 That trot became a gallop soon. 
 
 In spite of curb and rein. 
 
 So stooping down, as needs he must 
 
 Who cannot sit upright. 
 He grasped the mane with both his hands, 
 
 And eke with all his might. 
 
 His horse, who never in that sort 
 
 Had handled been before. 
 What thing upon his back had got 
 
 Did wonder more and more. 
 
 Away went Gilpin, neck or naught ; 
 
 Away went hat and wig; 
 He little dreamt, when he set out, 
 
 Of running such a rig.

 Till, loop and button failing both, 
 At last it flew away.

 Down ran the wine into the road, 
 
 Most piteous to be seen, 
 "Which made his horse's flanks to smoke

 But still he seemed to carry weight. 
 
 With leathern girdle braced; 
 For all might see the bottle necks 
 
 Still dangling at his waist.

 From the balcony spied 
 Her tender husband, wondering much 
 
 To see how he did ride. 
 
 "Stop, stop, John Gilpin! here's the house!" 
 
 They all at once did cry; 
 "The dinner waits, and we are tried:" 
 
 Said Gilpin— "So am I!" 
 
 But yet his horse was not a whit 
 
 Inclined to tarry there; 
 For why?— his owner had a house 
 
 Full ten miles ofif, at Ware. 
 
 So like an arrow swift he flew, 
 
 Shot by an archer strong; 
 So did he fly — ^which brings me to 
 
 The middle of my song. 
 
 Away went Gilpin out of breath, 
 
 And sore against his will, 
 Till at his friend the calender's 
 
 His horse at last stood still.

 The calender, amazed to see 
 
 His neighbor in such trim, 
 Laid down his pipe, flew to the gate. 
 
 And thus accosted him: 
 
 "What news? what news? your tidings tell; 
 Tell me you must and shall — 
 Say why bareheaded you are come. 
 Or why you come at all ?" 
 
 Now Gilpin had a pleasant wit, 
 
 And loved a timely joke ; 
 And thus unto the calender 
 
 In merry guise he spoke: 
 
 "I came because your horse would come; 
 And, if I well forbode, 
 My hat and wig will soon be here, 
 They are upon the road." 
 
 The calender, right glad to find 
 
 His friend in merry pin. 
 Returned him not a single word, 
 
 But to the house went in. 
 
 Whence straight he came with hat and wig— 
 A wig that flowed behind, 
 
 A hat not nauch the worse for wear- 
 Each comely in its kind. 
 
 He held them up, and in his turn 
 Thus showed his ready wit — 
 "My head is twice as big as yours. 
 They therefore .needs must fit.

 Six gentlemen upon the road,

 With post-boy scampering in the rear, 
 
 They raised the hue and cry :

 Not one of them was mute: 
 And all and each that passed that way 
 Did join in the pursuit. 
 
 And now the turnpike gates again 
 
 Flew open in, short space; 
 The toll-men thinking as before, 
 
 That Gilpin rode a race.

 From many a stately market-place,

 From many a lonely hamlet.

 Like an eagle's nest hangs on the crest

 Where scowls the far-famed hold 
 Pil^d by the hands of giants

 From all the spacious champaign 
 
 To Rome men took their flight. 
 A mile around the city 
 
 The throng stopped up the ways; 
 A fearful sight it was to see 
 
 Through two long nights and days. 
 
 Now, from the rock Tarpeian, 
 
 Could the wan burghers spy

 I wis, in all the senate 
 
 There was no heart so bold 
 But sore it ached, and fast it beat, 
 
 When that ill news was told. 
 Forthwith up rose the consul — 
 
 Up rose the fathers all; 
 In haste they girded nip their gowns, 
 
 And hied them to the wall. ' 
 
 They held a council, standing 
 
 Before the river-gate; 
 Short time was there, ye well may guess, 
 
 For musing or debate. 
 Out spake the consul roundly: 
 
 "The bridge must straight go down; 
 For, since Janiculum is lost. 
 
 Naught else can save the town." 
 
 Just then a scout came flying. 
 
 All wild with haste and fear: 
 "To arms! to arms! sir consul — 
 
 Lars Porsena is here." 
 On the low hills to westward 
 
 The consul fixed his eye. 
 And saw the swarthy storm of dust 
 
 Rise fast along the sky. 
 
 And nearer, fast, and nearer 
 
 Doth the red whirlwind come ; 
 And louder still, and still more loud, 
 From tindemeath that rolling cloud. 
 Is heard the trumpets' war-note proud, 
 
 The trampling and the hum.

 Now through the gloom appears. 
 Far to left and far to right, 
 In broken gleams of dark-blue light, 
 The long array of helmets bright, 
 The long array of spears.

 Sat in his ivory car, 
 By the right wheel rode Mamilius 
 
 Prince of the Latian name,

 But when the face of Sextus 
 
 Was seen among the foes, 
 A yell that rent the firmament 
 
 From all the town arose. 
 On the housetops was no woman 
 
 But spat toward him and hissed. 
 No child but screamed out curses, 
 
 And shook its little fist. 
 
 But the consul's brow was sad. 
 
 And the consul's speech was low. 
 And darkly looked he at the wall.

 Before the bridge goes down; 
 And if they once may win the bridge,

 "Horatius" quoth the consul, 
 
 "As thou sayest, so let it be." 
 And straight against that great array 
 
 Forth went the dauntless three. 
 For Romans in Rome's quarrel 
 Spared neither land nor gold, 
 ' Nor son nor wife, nor limb nor life, 
 
 In the brave days of old. 
 
 Then none was for a party — 
 
 Then all were for the state ; 
 Then the great man helped the poor, 
 
 And the poor man loved the great; 
 Then lands were fairly portioned. 
 
 Then spoils were fairly sold; 
 The Romans were like brothers 
 
 In the brave days of old. 
 
 Now Roman is to Roman 
 
 More hateful than a foe, 
 And the tribunes beard the high. 
 
 And the fathers grind the low. 
 As we wax hot in faction. 
 
 In battle we wax cold; 
 Whereforie men fight not as they fought 
 
 In the brave days of old. 
 
 Now while the three were tightening 
 
 Their harness on their backs, 
 The consul was the foremost man 
 
 To take in hand an ax; 
 And fathers, mixed with commons. 
 
 Seized hatchet, bar, and crow, 
 And smote upon the planks above, 
 
 And loosed the props below.

 A peal of warlike glee. 
 As that great host, with measured tread,

 Rolled slowly toward the bridge's head.

 Before that deep array; 
 To earth they sprang, their swords they drew, 
 And lifted high their shields, and flew 
 
 To win the narrow way. 
 Stout Lartius hurled down Annus

 Herminius struck at Seius,

 Then, whirling up his broadsword 
 
 With both hands to the height, 
 He rushed against Horatius, 
 
 And smote with all his might. 
 With- shield and blade Horatius 
 
 Right deftly turned the blow. 
 The blow, though turned, came yet too nigh, 
 It missed his helm, but gashed his thigh — 
 The Tuscans raised a jojrful cry 
 
 To see the red blood flow. 
 
 He reeled, and on Herminius 
 
 He leaned one breathing space — 
 Then, like a wild-cat mad with wounds, 
 
 Sprang right at Astur's face. 
 Through teeth, and skull, and helmet, 
 
 So fierce a thrust he sped. 
 The good sword stood a hand- breadth out 
 
 Behind the Tuscan's head. 
 
 On Astur's throat Horatius 
 
 Right firmly pressed his heel. 
 And thrice and four times tugged amain, 
 
 Ere he wrenched out the steel. 
 "'And see," he cried, "the welcome. 
 
 Fair guests, that waits you here! 
 What noble Lucimio comes next 
 
 To taste our Roman cheer.?" 
 
 But at his haughty challenge 
 
 A sullen murmur ran^ 
 Mingled with wrath, and shame, and drfead,

 Ranging a wood to start a hare.

 Where, growling low, a fierce old bear 
 
 Lies amidst bones and blood.

 And backward now, and forward.

 Was a Siren of old, who sung under the sea; 
 And who often, at eve, through the bright billow roved, 
 To meet on the green shore, a youth whom she loved. 
 
 But she loved him in vain, for he left her to weep, 
 And in tears, all the night, her gold ringlets to steep, 
 Till Heaven looked with pity on true love so warm, 
 And changed to this soft harp the sea-maiden's form. 
 
 Still her bosom rose fair — still her cheek smiled the same.

 I would have my spirit filled the more 
 
 With grateful love to Thee; 
 And careful, less to serve Thee much 
 
 Than to please Thee perfectly, .

 There are briers besetting every path, 
 
 Which call for patient care; 
 There is a cross in every lot, 
 
 And an earnest need for prayer, 
 But a lowly heart that leans on Thee 
 
 Is happy anywhere. 
 
 In a service which Thy love appoints, 
 
 There are no bonds for me; 
 For my secret heart is taught "the truth' 
 
 That makes Thy children "free;" 
 And a life of self-renouncing love 
 
 Is a life of liberty.

 MY CREED. 
 
 I hold that Christian grace abounds 
 Where charity is seen ; that when 
 We climb to heaven, 'tis on the rounds 
 Of love to men. 
 
 I hold all else, named piety, 
 
 A selfish scheme, a vain pretense ; 
 Where center is not, can there be 
 Circumference ? 
 
 This I moreover hold, and dare 
 
 Affirm where'er my rhyme may go: 
 Whatever things be sweet or fair. 
 Love makes them so.

 Whether it be the sickle's rush 
 
 Through wheat fields, or the fall of showers, 
 Or by some cabin door a bush 
 Of rugged flowers. 
 
 "Tis not the wide phylactery, 
 
 Nor stubborn fast, nor stated prayers, 
 That makes us saints ; we judge the tree 
 By what it bears. 
 
 And when a man can live apart 
 
 From works, on theologic trust, 
 I know the blood about his heart 
 
 Is dry as dust. Alice Gary. 
 
 CREEDS OF THE BELLS. 
 
 How sweet the chime of the Sabbath bells! 
 Each one its creed in music tells, 
 In tones that float upon the air, 
 As soft as song, as pure as prayer ; 
 And I will put in simple rhyme 
 The language of the golden chime. 
 My happy heart with rapture swells 
 Responsive to the bells, sweet bells. 
 
 "In deeds of love excel, excel !" 
 Chimed out from ivied towers a bell, 
 
 *'This is the church not built on sands, 
 Emblem of one not built with hands ; 
 Its forms and sacred lites revere; 
 Come, worship here, come, worship here; 
 In ritual and faitK excel," 
 Chimed out the Episcopalian bell.

 In solemn tones exclaimed a bell; 
 
 "No progress made by mortal man 
 Can change the just, eternal plan: 
 With God there can be nothing new; 
 Ignore the false, embrace the true, 
 While all is well, is well, is well," 
 Pealed out the good old Dutch church bell. 
 
 "Ye purifying waters swell," 
 In mellow tones rang out a bell : 
 
 "Though faith alone in Christ can save, 
 Man must be plunged beneath the wave. 
 To show the world unfaltering faith 
 In what the sacred Scripture saith: 
 O, swell, ye rising waters, swell," 
 Pealed out the clear-toned Baptist bell. 
 
 "Not faith alone, but works, as well, 
 Must test the soul," said a soft bell: 
 
 "Come here and cast aside your load.

 And hope in Christ, where hope began: 
 Do well, do well, do well, do well!"

 Say to the world farewell, farewell!"

 My last poor life-drop you may drain, 
 
 And crush me to the grave ; 
 Yet still the spirit that endures 
 
 Shall mock your force the while, 
 And meet each cold, cold grasp of yours 
 
 With bitter smile. 
 
 I said to cold Neglect and Scorn, 
 
 Pass on, — I heed you not ; 
 You may pursue me till my form 
 
 And being are forgot ; 
 Yet still the spirit, which you see 
 
 Undaimted by your wiles. 
 Draws from its own nobility 
 
 Its highborn smiles. 
 
 I said to Friendship's menaced blow, 
 
 Strike deep, — ^my heart shall beat; 
 Thou canst but add one bitter woe 
 
 To those already there; 
 Yet still the spirit that sustains 
 
 This last severe distress 
 Shall smile upon its keenest pains, 
 
 And scorn redress. 
 
 I said to Death's uplifted dart, 
 
 Aim sure, — why delay? 
 Thou wilt not find a fearful heart, 
 
 A weak, reluctant prey; 
 For still the spirit, firm and free. 
 
 Unruffled by this last dismay. 
 Wrapt in its own eternity. 
 
 Shall pass away.

 WRESTLING JACOB. 
 
 FIRST PART. 
 
 Come, O thou Traveler unknown, 
 Whom still I hold, but cannot see ; 
 
 My company before is gone, 
 And I am left alone with thee; 
 
 With thee all night I mean to stay. 
 
 And wrestle till the break of day. 
 
 I need not tell thee who I am; 
 
 My sin and misery declare; 
 Thyself hast called me by my name; 
 
 Look on thy hands and read it there; 
 But who, I ask thee, who art thou? 
 Tell me thy name, and tell me now. 
 
 In vain thou strugglest to get free; 
 
 I never will unloose my hold: 
 Art thou the Man that died for me? 
 
 The secret of thy love unfold; 
 Wrestling, I will not let thee go 
 Till I thy name, thy nature know. 
 
 Wilt thou not yet to me reveal 
 
 Thy new, unutterable name? 
 Tell me, I still beseech thee, tell; 
 
 To know it now resolved I am; 
 Wrestling, I will not let thee go 
 Till I thy name, thy nature know. 
 
 What though my shrinking flesh complain 
 And murmur to contend so long,

 The morning breaks, the shadows flee; 
 
 Pure, universal Love thou art; 
 To me, to all, thy bowels move; 
 Thy nature and thy name is Love. 
 
 My prayer hath power with God; the grace 
 
 Unspeakable I now receive; 
 Through faith I see thee face to face ; 
 
 I see thee face to face and live ! 
 In vain I have not wept and strove ; 
 Thy nature and thy name is Love.

 All helplessness, all weakness, I 
 
 On thee alone for strength depend; 
 Nor have I power from thee to move ;

 Lame as I am, I take the prey;

 THE RIGHT MUST WIN. 
 
 O, it is hard to work for God, 
 
 To rise and take His part 
 Upon this battle-field of earth, 
 
 And not sometimes lose heart. 
 
 He hides Himself so wondrously, 
 As though there were no God; 
 
 He is least seen when all the powers 
 Of ill are most abroad. 
 
 Or He deserts us at the hour 
 
 The fight is all but lost ; 
 And seems to leave us to ourselves 
 
 Just when we need Him most. 
 
 Ill masters good, good seems to change 
 
 To ill with greatest ease; 
 And worst of all, the good with good 
 
 Is at cross-purposes.

 Ah! God is other than we think; 
 
 His ways are far above. 
 Far beyond reason's height, and reached 
 
 Only by childlike love. 
 
 Workman of God! 0, lose not heart, 
 
 But learn what God is like; 
 And in the darkest battle-field 
 
 Thou shalt know where to strike. 
 
 Thrice blest is he to whom is given 
 
 The instinct that can tell 
 That God is on the field when He 
 
 Is most invisible. 
 
 Blest, too, is he who can divine 
 
 Where real right doth lie, 
 And dares to take the side that seems 
 
 Wrong to man's blindfold eye. 
 
 For right is right, since God is God ; 
 
 And right the day must win; 
 To doubt would be disloyalty. 
 
 To falter would be sin!

 ■'She is the morning-glory true, 
 And her poor types are they." 
 
 So always from that happy time 
 
 We called her by their name, 
 And very fitting did it seem, — 
 
 For sure as morning came, 
 Behind her cradle bars she smiled 
 
 To catch the first faint ray. 
 As from the trellis smiles the flower 
 
 And opens to the day. 
 
 But not so beautiful they rear 
 
 Their airy cups of blue, 
 As turned her sweet eyes to the light, 
 
 Brimmed with sleep's tender dew; 
 And not so close their tendrils fine 
 
 Round their supports are thrown, 
 As those dear arms whose outstretched plea 
 
 Clasped all hearts to her own. 
 
 We used to think how she had come. 
 
 Even as comes the flower 
 The last and perfect added gift 
 
 To crown Love's morning hour; 
 And how in her was imaged forth 
 
 The love we could not say. 
 
 As on the little dewdrops round 
 
 Shines back the heart of day.

 This world is all a fleeting show, 
 
 For man's illusion given; 
 The smiles of Joy, the tears of Woe, 
 Deceitful shine, deceitful flow —

 And false the light on Glory's plume,

 Are blossoms gathered for the tomb —

 What makes a hero? Not success, not fame. 
 
 Inebriate merchants, and the loud acclaim 
 Of glutted Avarice — caps tossed in air. 
 Or pen of journalist with flourish fair; 
 
 Bells pealed, stars, ribbons, and a titled name —

 His rightful tribute, not his end or aim. 
 Or true reward; for never yet did these 
 Refresh the soul, or set the heart at ease.

 What makes a hero? An heroic mind, 
 Expressed in action, in endurance proved, 
 And if there be pre-eminence of right, 
 Derived through pain well suffered, to the height 
 Of rank heroic, 'tis to bear unmoved 
 Not toil, not risk, not rage of sea or wind, 
 Not the brute fury of barbarians blind, 
 
 But worse — ^ingratitude and poisonous darts, 
 Launched by the country he had served and loved. 
 This, with a free, unclouded spirit pure. 
 This, in the strength of silence to endure, 
 A dignity to noble deeds imparts 
 Beyond the gauds and trappings of renown. 
 This is the hero's complement and crown. 
 This missed, one struggle had been wanting still — 
 One glorious triumph of the heroic will, 
 One self-approval in his heart of hearts.

 Of every earthly scene ; 
 But I know, whate'er may meet me, 
 
 With this promise I am blest — 
 "My presence shall go with thee. 
 
 And I will give thee rest." 
 
 I see the road just winding 
 
 Into a vale of woe. 
 Yet I go forth, not minding. 
 
 Since Christ will lead, I know; 
 For he saith, lest I should falter. 
 
 With undue trouble pressed — 
 "My presence shall go with thee. 
 
 And I will give thee rest." 
 
 Perchance that path of sorrow 
 
 These feet may never tread, 
 Then wherefore should I borrow 
 
 From the future aught of dread.? 
 Whate'er of woe betideth. 
 
 This thought shall fill my breast — 
 Christ's presence shall go with me, 
 
 And He will give me rest.

 And if through Jordan's river 
 
 My feet shall have to go,

 BERNARDO DEL CARPIO. 
 
 The warrior bowed his crested head and tamed his heart 
 
 of fire, 
 And sued the haughty king to free his long- imprisoned 
 
 sire; 
 "I bring thee here my fortress keys, I bring my captive 
 
 train; 
 I pledge thee faith: — ^my liege, my lord, oh, break my 
 
 father's chain!" 
 "Rise! rise! even now thy father comes, a ransomed man 
 
 this day ; 
 Mount thy good steed, and thou and I will meet him on 
 
 his way." 
 Then lightly rose that loyal son, and bounded on his steed 
 And urged, as if with lance in rest, his charger's foamy 
 
 speed. 
 And lo! from far, as on they pressed, there came a glit- 
 tering band. 
 With one that 'mid them stately rode, like a leader in the 
 
 land.

 "Now haste, Bernardo, haste! for there, in very truth, 
 
 is he, 
 The father whom thy faithful heart hath yearned so long 
 
 ^o see." 
 His proud breast heaved, his dark eye flashed, his cheeks' 
 
 hue came and went ; 
 He reached that gray-haired chieftain's side, and there 
 
 dismounting bent — 
 A lowly knee to earth he bent — ^his father's hand he took; 
 What was there in its touch that all his fiery spirit shook ? 
 That hand was cold! a frozen thing! — ^it dropped from 
 
 his like lead : 
 He looked up to the face above — ^the face was of the dead! 
 A plume waved o'er his noble brow — ^that brow was fixed 
 
 and white! 
 He met at length his father's eyes — ^but in them was no 
 
 sight ! 
 Up from the ground he sprang, and gazed; but who can 
 
 paint that gaze? 
 They hushed their very hearts who saw its horror and 
 
 amaze : 
 They might have chained him, as before that stony form 
 
 he stood; 
 For the power was stricken from his arm, and from his 
 
 lip the blood. 
 "Father!" at length he murmured low, and wept like 
 
 childhood then — 
 Talk not of grief till thou hast seen the tears of warlike 
 
 men. 
 He thought on all his glorious hopes, on all his young 
 
 renown. 
 Then flung the falchion from his side, and in the dust 
 
 sat down;

 THE FADED VIOLET. 
 
 You gave it me long years ago, 
 
 In the shadowy evening time — 
 While the clouds stole round the mountain side, 
 
 And the bells rang out a chime. 
 The blossoms listened at our feet — 
 
 The trees stooped from^above. 
 You said, "This flower will say for me 
 
 All that my heart says — ^love." 
 'Tis long ago, but I have yet 
 That little faded violet. 
 
 And life was at its zenith then; 
 
 The world ne'er seemed so bright, 
 For the sweetest story ever told 
 
 I've kissed my violet blue.

 Ah me — I have it hidden yet — 
 That little faded violet. 
 
 We parted long, long months ago 
 
 With not a sigh to tell 
 That once in far-off happy days, 
 
 We two had loved so well. 
 We parted with but few cold words, 
 
 We two who oft had said 
 Not all the world should come between. 
 
 Ah well — the love was dead — 
 The love was dead, but yet, but yet,

 Unvisited over the sea, 
 Who tell me how lonely you stand 
 With a single gold curl in the hand 
 
 Held up to be looked at by me. 
 
 While you asked me to ponder and say 
 
 What a father and mother can do, 
 With the bright fellow-locks put away 
 Out of reach, beyond kiss, in the clay 
 Where the violets press nearer than you,- 
 
 Shall I speak like a poet, or run 
 
 Into weak woman's tears for relief? 
 Oh, children! — I never lost one. 
 Yet my arm's round my own little son 
 And Love knows the secret of Grief. 
 
 And I feel what it must be and is.

 Through the house of a man up to His, 
 With a murmur of music you miss, 
 And a rapture of light you forego.

 How you think, staring on at the door, 
 Where the face of your angel flashed in, 
 
 That its brightness, familiar before. 
 
 Bums off from you ever the more 
 •For the dark of your sorrow and sin. 
 
 "God lent him and takes him," you sigh, — 
 Nay, there let me break with your pain; 
 God's generous in giving, say I, 
 And the thing which He gives I deny 
 That He ever can take back again. 
 
 He gives what He gives. I appeal 
 
 To all who bear babes, — ^in the hour 
 When the veil of the body we feel 
 Rent around us, while torments reveal 
 The motherhood's advent ifl power 
 
 And the babe cries, — ^has each of us known 
 
 By apocalypse (God being there 
 Full in nature) the child is our own. 
 Life of life, love of love, moan of moan. 
 Through all changes, all times, everywhere. 
 
 He's ours and forever. Believe, 
 
 O father — O mother, look back 
 To the first love's assurance. To give. 
 Means, with God, not to tempt or deceive 
 With a cup thrust in Benjamin's sack. 
 
 He gives what He gives. Be content ! 
 
 He resumes nothing given — ^be sure! 
 God lend! Where the usurers lent 
 In His temple, indignant He went 
 
 And scourged away all those impure.

 He lends not ; but gives to the end, 
 As He loves to the end. If it seem 
 
 That He draws back a gift, comprehend 
 
 'Tis to add to it rather — amend, 
 And finish it up to your dream, — 
 
 Or keep — as a mother may toys 
 
 Too costly, though given by herSelf , 
 
 Till the room shall be stiller from noise, 
 
 And the children more fit for such joys, 
 
 Kept over their heads on the shelf. 
 
 So look up, friends! you, who indeed 
 
 Have possessed in your house a sweet piece 
 Of the Heaven which men strive for, must need 
 Be more earnest than others are — speed 
 Where they loiter, persist where they cease. 
 
 You know how one angel smiles there.

 To be drawn by a single gold hair 
 Of that curl, from earth's storm and despair

 'Twas my heart she was kneading as well as the dough. 
 
 At last when she turned for her pan to the dresser,

 Or my bread I'll be spoiling, in spite of my toiling. 
 If you stand here and watch while I'm kneading the

 There's one with ringlets of sunny gold, 
 
 And eyes, the reflection of heaven's own blue; 
 He crossed in the twilight gray and cold. 
 
 And the pale mist hid him from mortal view; 
 We saw not the angels that met him there,

 Over the river the boatman pale 
 
 Carried another, the household pet; 
 Her brown curls waved in the gentle gale — 
 
 Darling Minnie, I see her yet. 
 She crossed on her bosom her dimpled hands. 
 
 And fearlessly entered the phantom bark; 
 We watched it glide from the silver sands. 
 
 And all our sunshine grew strangely dark. 
 We know she is safe on the farther side ; 
 
 Where all the ransomed and angels be, 
 Over the river, the mystic river. 
 
 My childhood's angel is waiting for me. 
 
 For none return from those spirit shores 
 
 Who cross with the boatman cold and pale ; 
 We hear the dip of the golden oars, 
 
 And catch a gleam of the snowy sail; 
 And lo ! they have passed from our yearning hearts 
 
 They cross the stream and are gone for aye ; 
 We may not sunder the veil apart 
 
 That hides from our vision the gates of day. 
 We only know that their barks no more 
 
 May sail with us o'er life's stormy sea; 
 Yet somewhere, I know, on the unseen shore 
 
 They watch and beckon and wait for me. 
 
 And I sit and think when the sunset's gold 
 
 Is flushing river and hill and shore, 
 I shall one day stand by the water cold. 
 
 And list for the sound of the boatman's oar; 
 And when perchance the well-known hail 
 
 Again shall echo along the strand, 
 I shall pass from sight, with the boatman pale, 
 
 To the better shore of the spirit land.

 KEARNEY AT SEVEN PINES. 
 
 So that soldierly legend is still on its journey — 
 
 That story of Kearney who knew not to 3rield! 
 'Twas the day when with Jameson, fierce Berry and 
 Bimey 
 Against twenty thousand he rallied the field. 
 Where the red volleys poured, where the clamor rose 
 highest, 
 Where the dead lay in clumps through the dwarf oak 
 and pine 
 Where the aim from the thicket was surest and nighest, 
 No charge like Phil Kearney's along the whole line. 
 
 When the battle went ill and the bravest were solemn, 
 Near the dark Seven Pines, where we still held our 
 ground, 
 He rode down the length of the withering column 
 
 And his heart at our war-cry leaped up at a bound. 
 He snuffed, like his charger, the wind of the powder; 
 
 His sword waved us on and we answered the sign. 
 Loud our cheer as we rushed, but his laugh rang the 
 louder — 
 "There's the devil's own fun, boys, along the whole 
 line!"

 How he strode his brown steed! how we saw his blade 
 brighten 
 
 In the one hand still left, and the reins in his teeth; 
 He laughed like a boy when the holidays heighten, 
 
 But a soldier's glance shot from his visor beneath. 
 Up came the reserves to the valley infernal. 
 
 Asking where to go in, through the clearing or pine ? 
 "Oh, anywhere! Forward! 'Tis all the same, Colonel; 
 
 You'll find lovely fighting along the whole line !" 
 
 Oh, coil the black shroud of the night at Chantilly 
 
 That hid him from sight of his brave men and tried! 
 Foul ! foul sped the bullet that clipped the white lily,, 
 
 The flower of our knighthood, the whole army's pride. 
 Yet we dream that he still, in that shadowy region,, 
 
 Where the dead form their ranks at the wan drum- 
 mer's sign. 
 Rides on as of old, down the length of his legion. 
 
 And the word still is, "Forward !" along the whole line.

 On his quarry from the heights, 
 And the stag that knows no master, 
 
 Seeks there his wild delights; 
 But we for Thy communion 
 
 Have sought the mountain sod — 
 For the strength of the hills we bless Thee, 
 
 Our God, our fathers' God! 
 
 The banner of the chieftain 
 
 Far, far below us waves; 
 The war-horse of the spearman 
 
 Cannot reach our lofty caves; 
 Thy dark clouds wrap the threshold 
 
 Of freedom's last abode;

 THE BEAUTIFUL LAND OF NOD. 
 
 Come, cuddle your head on my shoulder, dear. 
 
 Your head like the golden-rod, 
 And we will go sailing away from here 
 
 To the beautiful Land of Nod. 
 Away from life's hurry, and flurry, and worry. 
 
 Away from earth's shadows and gloom. 
 To a world of fair weather we'll float off together. 
 
 Where roses are always in bloom. 
 
 Just shut up your eyes and fold your hands — 
 
 Your hands like the leaves of a rose ; 
 And we will go sailing to those fair lands 
 
 That never an atlas shows. 
 On the North and the West they are bounded by rest, 
 
 On the South and the East by dreams, 
 'Tis the country ideal, where nothing is real 
 
 But everything only seems.

 Just drop down the curtain of your dear eyes, 
 
 Those eyes of a bright blue-bell, 
 And we will sail out under starlit skies, 
 
 To the land where the fairies dwell. 
 DoAvn the river of sleep our barque shall sweep. 
 
 Till it reaches that mystical Isle 
 Where no man hath seen, but where all have been, 
 
 And there we will pause awhile. 
 I will croon you a song, as we float along. 
 
 To that shore that is blessed of God, 
 Then ho ! for that fair land ! We're off for that rare land ! 
 
 That beautiful Land of Nod.

 THE LAND WHICH NO MORTAL MAY KNOW. 
 
 Though Earth has full many a beautiful spot. 
 
 As a poet or painter might show. 
 Yet more lovely and beautiful, holy and bright. 
 To the hopes of the heart, and the spirit's glad sight, 
 
 Is the land that no mortal may know. 
 
 There thB crystalline stream bursting forth from the 
 throne 
 
 Flows on, and forever will flow; 
 Its waves, as they roll, are with melody rife. 
 And its waters are sparkling with beauty and life, 
 
 In the land which no mortal may know. 
 
 And there, on its margin, with leaves ever green. 
 With its fruits healing sickness and woe. 
 
 The fair Tree of Life, in its glory and pride. 
 
 Is fed by that deep, inexhaustible tide. 
 Of the land which no mortal may know.

 There, too, are the lost! whom we loved on this earth. 
 
 With whose mem'ries our bosoms yet glow; 
 Their relics we gave to the place of the dead, 
 But their glorified spirits before us have fled. 
 To tjie land which no mortal may know. 
 
 There the pale orb of night, and the fountain of day. 
 
 Nor beauty nor splendor bestow; 
 But the presence of Him, the unchanging I AM! 
 And the holy; the pure, the immaculate Lamb! 
 
 Light the land which no mortal may know. 
 
 Oh! who but must pine, in this dark vale of tears. 
 
 From its clouds and its shadows to go ? 
 To walk in the light of the glory above, 
 And to share in the peace, and the joy, and the love. 
 Of the land which no mortal may know.

 LIFE. 
 
 I made a posie, while the day ran by : 
 "Here will I smell my remnant out, and tie 
 My life within this band." 
 But Time did beckon to the flowers, and they 
 By noon most cunningly did steal away, 
 And withered in my hand. 
 
 My hand was next to them, and then my heart, 
 I took, without more thinking, in good part 
 
 Time's gentle admonition; 
 Who did so sweetly death's sad taste convey, 
 Making my mind to smell my fatal day. 
 
 Yet sugaring the suspicion.

 Farewell, dear flowers! sweetly your time ye spent; 
 Fit, while ye lived, for smell or ornament. 
 
 And, after death, for cures, 
 I follow straight, without complaints or grief; 
 Since, if my scent be good, I care not if 
 
 It be as short as yours.

 THE PLAIDIE. 
 
 Upon ane stormy Sunday, 
 
 Coming adoon the lane, 
 Were a score of bonnie lasses — 
 
 And the sweetest I maintain 
 Was Caddie, 
 That I took unneath my plaidie. 
 
 To shield her from the rain. 
 
 She said that the daisies blushed 
 For the kiss that I had ta'en; 
 
 I wad na hae thought the lassie 
 Wad sae of a kiss complain: 
 "Now, laddie! 
 
 I winna stay under your plaidie, 
 I'll gang awa hame in the rain!" 
 
 But, on an after Stmday, 
 
 When cloud there was not ane, 
 This selfsame winsome lassie 
 
 (We chanced to meet in the lane) 
 Said, "Laddie, 
 Why dinna ye wear your plaidie ? 
 Wha kens but it may rain?"

 TO PRIMROSES, FILLED WITH MORNING DEW. 
 
 Why do ye weep, sweet babes? Can tears 
 Speak grief in you, 
 Who were but born 
 Just as the modest morn 
 Teemed her refreshing dew? 
 Alas! you have not known that shower 
 That mars a flower, 
 Nor felt the unkind 
 Breath of a blasting wind; 
 Nor are ye worn with years, 
 Or warped as we, 
 Who think it strange to see 
 Such pretty flowers, like to orphans young, 
 Speaking by tears before ye have a tongue. 
 
 Speak, whimp'ring younglings, and make known 
 The reason why 
 Ye droop and weep; 
 Is it for want of sleep. 
 Or childish lullaby? 
 Or that ye have not seen as yet 
 The violet? 
 Or brought a kiss 
 From that sweet heart to this? 
 No, no ; this sorrow shown 
 By your tears shed. 
 Would have this lecture read, — 
 "That things of greatest, so of meanest worth. 
 Conceived with grief are, and with tears brought 
 forth."

 LOVE'S FAREWELL. 
 
 Love has come and gone again; 
 
 We were bound and we were free; 
 Love beloved of wiser men 
 
 Never stays too long with me. 
 This was just the golden hour! 
 
 Since the shadow of regret — 
 Odor of a faded flower — 
 
 Sweetens my resentment yet. 
 When it seems no sin to say, 
 
 "All my love I dare not tell!" 
 Could I then foresee this day? 
 
 While I loved, I loved you well. 
 Seas shall sing, though lips be dumb; 
 
 Winters laugh with leaping streams 
 Amber fields of suriimer come. 
 
 Smiling, spite of haggard dreams 
 I shall find what peace there is ! 
 
 Sweetheart lost, adieu, adieu! 
 Lips of mine you will not miss ; 
 
 Other loves will comfort you.

 On greening grass,

 And burst the buds, 
 
 And shine the level lands.

 How freshly fann'd, 
 
 Light airs from where the deep

 HEBREW HYMN. 
 
 When Israel of the Lord belov'd 
 
 Out from the land of bondage Came, 
 Her father's God before her mov'd, 
 
 An awful guide, in smoke and flame. 
 By day, along the astonish' d lands, 
 
 The cloudy pillar glided slow; 
 By night, Arabia's crimson'd sands 
 
 Returned the fiery column's glow. 
 
 There rose the choral hymn of praise, 
 
 And trump and timbrel answer'd keen; 
 And Zion's daughters poured their lays. 
 
 With priests' and warriors' voice between. 
 No portents now our foes amaze. 
 
 Forsaken Israel wanders lone; 
 Our fathers would not know Thy ways. 
 
 And Thou hast left them to their own. 
 
 But present still, though now unseen. 
 When brightly shines the prosp'rous day. 
 
 Be thoughts of Thee a cloudy screen, 
 To temper the deceitful ray.

 And oh! when stoops on Judah's path, 
 In shade and storm, the frequent night, 
 
 Be Thou long suff'ring, slow to wrath, 
 A burning and a shining light. 
 
 Our harps we left by Babel's streams, 
 
 The tyrant's jest, the Gentile's scorn; 
 No censer round our altar beams. 
 
 And mute are timbrel, trump, and horn.

 A contrite heart, a humble thought,

 Where are the swallows fled? 
 Frozen and dead 
 Perchance upon some bleak and stormy shore. 
 O doubting heart! 
 Far over purple seas 
 They wait, in sunny ease. 
 The balmy southern breeze 
 To bring them to their northern homes once more. 
 
 Why must the flowers die? 
 
 Prisoned they lie 
 In the cold tomb, heedless of tears or rain. 
 O doubting heart! 
 They only sleep below 
 The soft white ermine snow 
 While winter winds shall blow, 
 To breathe and smile upon you soon again.

 Attend me, by the Law of God and Reason, 
 They dare impeach and punish for High Treason.

 THE STORY OF THE FAITHFUL SOUL. 
 
 The fettered spirits linger 
 
 In purgatorial pain, 
 With penal fires effacing 
 
 Their last faint earthly stain, 
 Which life's imperfect sorrow 
 
 Had tried to cleanse in vain. 
 
 Yet on each feast of Mary 
 
 Their sorrow finds release, 
 For the great archangel Michael 
 
 Comes down and bids it cease ; 
 And the name of these brief respites 
 
 Is called "Our Lady's Peace." 
 
 Yet once — so runs the legend — 
 
 When the archangel came, 
 And all these holy spirits 
 
 Rejoiced at Mary's name, 
 One voice alone was wailing, 
 
 Still wailing on the same.

 Through the sweet voices broke;

 To still my bitter anguish 
 Or quench my ceaseless pain.

 Thus the archangel answered 
 
 "Your time of pain is brief, 
 And soon the peace of heaven 
 
 Will give you full relief; 
 Yet if his earthly comfort 
 
 So much outweighs your grief, 
 
 "Then, through a special mercy, 
 
 I offer you this grace, — 
 You may seek him who mourns you 
 
 And look upon his face, 
 And speak to him of comfort 
 
 For one short minute's space. 
 
 "But when that time is ended. 
 
 Return here and remain 
 A thousand years .in torment, 
 
 A thousand years in pain; 
 Thus dearly you must purchase 
 
 The comfort he will gain." 
 
 The lime-tree's shade at evening 
 
 Is spreading broad and wide; 
 Beneath their fragrant arches 
 
 Pace slowly, side by side. 
 In low and tender converse, 
 
 A 'bridegroom and his bride. 
 
 The night is calm and stilly. 
 
 No other sound is there 
 Except their happy voices: 
 
 What is that cold, bleak air 
 That passes through the lime-trees. 
 
 And stirs the bridegroom's hair?

 While one low cry of anguish, 
 
 Like the last dying wail 
 Of some dumb, hunted creature, 
 
 Is borne upon the gale; 
 Why does the bridegroom shudder. 
 
 And turn so deathly pale ? 
 
 Near purgatory's entrance 
 
 The radiant angels wait ; 
 It was the great Saint Michael 
 
 Who closed the gloomy gate, 
 When the poor wandering spirit 
 
 Came back to meet her fate. 
 
 "Pass on," thus spoke the angel: 
 "Heaven's joy is deep and vast; 
 Pass on, pass on, poor spirit, 
 
 For heaven is yours at last; 
 In that one minute's anguish 
 
 Your thousand years have passed."

 RETROSPECTION. 
 
 Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean. 
 Tears from the depth of some divine despair 
 Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes. 
 In looking on the happy autumn fields. 
 And thinking of the days that are no more. 
 
 Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail. 
 That brings our friends up from the under world; 
 Sad as the last which reddens over one

 That sinks with all we love below the verge, 
 So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more. 
 
 Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns 
 The earliest pipe of half-awakened birds 
 To dying ears, when tmto dying eyes 
 The casement slowly grows a glimmering square ; 
 So sad, so strange, the days that are no more. 
 
 Dear as remembered kisses after death, 
 And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned 
 On lips that are for others ; deep as love, 
 Deep as first love, and wild with all regret,— 
 O Death in Life, the days that are no more.

 THE LOVE-KNOT. 
 
 Tying her bonnet under her chin, 
 She tied her raven ringlets in. 
 But not alone in the silken snare 
 Did she catch her lovely floating hair, 
 For, tying her bonnet tmder>her chin, 
 She tied a young man's heart within. 
 
 They were strolling together up the hill, 
 Where the wind came blowing merry and chill, 
 And it blew the curls a frolicsome race. 
 All over the happy peach-colored face. 
 Till scolding and laughing, she tied them in, 
 Under her beautiful dimpled chin. 
 
 O western wind, do you think it was fair 
 To play such tricks with her floating hair?

 SNEINTON TOWERS, GOOD FRIDAY, 1S84. 
 
 "His sun went down while it was yet day; it went not down behind 
 eloud, but melted into the pure light of Heaven." 
 
 His sun went down in the morning, 
 
 While all was fair and bright; 
 But 'twas not an eclipse of darkness 
 
 That hid him from our sight : 
 
 For the valley of death was brighter 
 
 Than the hills of life he trod. 
 And the peace that fell on his spirit 
 
 Was the calm, deep peace of God. 
 
 He knew in whom he trusted. 
 
 He counted all things loss. 
 And clung with the arms of faith and love 
 
 To the Christ and to His Cross.

 And from that Cross a radiance 
 
 Fell with a softening beam, 
 That shone through the depths of the shadowy

 And brightened death's narrow stream.

 But it shines to-day on the far-way hills,

 What Lincoln was — ^how large of mold. 
 
 The man who sped the woodman's team, 
 And deepest sunk the plowman's share. 
 
 And pushed the laden raft astream, 
 Of fate before him unaware. 
 
 This was the hand that knew to swing 
 The ax^-since thus would Freedom train 
 
 Her son — and made the forest ring, 
 And drove the wedge, and toiled amain. 
 
 Firm hand, that loftier office took, 
 A conscious leader's will obeyed, 
 
 And, when men sought his word and look. 
 With steadfast might the gathering swayed.

 No courtiers, toying with a sword, 
 Nor minstrel's, laid across a lute; 
 
 A chief's, uplifted to the Lord, 
 
 When all the kings of earth were mute! 
 
 The hand of Anak, sinewed strong, 
 The fingers that on greatness clutch, 
 
 Yet, lo! the marks their lines along 
 Of one who strove and suffered much. 
 
 For here in knotted cord and vein 
 I trace the varying chart of years; 
 
 I know the troubled heart, the strains, 
 The weight of Atlas — ^and the tears. 
 
 Again I see the patient brow. 
 That palm ere while was wont to press; 
 
 And now 'tis furrowed deep, and now 
 Made smooth with hope and tenderness. 
 
 For something of a formless grace 
 This molded outline plays about ; 
 
 A pitying flame, beyond our trace, 
 Breathes like a spirit — ^in and out. 
 
 The love that cast an aureole 
 
 Round one, who, longer to endure, 
 
 Called mirth to ease his ceaseless dole, 
 Yet kept his nobler purpose sure. 
 
 Lo, as I gaze, the statured man. 
 
 Built up from yon large hand, appears 
 
 A type that Nature wills to plan 
 But once in all a people's years.

 The beauteous robes she wore;

 And narrower still the circlet grew; 
 
 Behold! a glittering band, 
 Its roseate diamonds set anew, 
 Her neck's white column spanned. 
 
 Suns rise and set; the straining clasp 
 
 The shortened links resist, 
 Yet flashes in a bracelet's grasp. 
 
 The diamond, on her wrist.

 "ABIDE WITH ME." 
 
 Origin op the Hymn. — In the autumn of 1847, the Rev. Mr. Lyte was 
 advised to go for a time to the south of France, in the hope that a wanner climate 
 would strengthen his failing health. Before leaving England he wished once 
 more to preach to his people. His family feared what the result of such an effort 
 might be, but he gently insisted, and was able to go through with the service. 
 He knew that he was preaching for the last time, and his sermon was full of 
 solemn and tender appeals to those whom he had guided and instructed for many 
 years. At the end of the service he retired, exhausted in body, but with his 
 soul sweetly resting on that Savior whom he had preached with his dying breath. 
 As the evening drew on he handed to a member of his family the following 
 hymn, which he had just written. This was his last hymn on earth. He 
 reached Nice, and shortly after his spirit entered into rest. He pointed upward 
 as he i)aEsed away, and whispered, "Peace, joy!" Thus he went to, abide for- 
 ever with Him who has declared it X(y be His divine will that His followers be- 
 with Him where He is, that they may behold His glory. 
 
 Abide with me ; fast falls the eventide ; 
 The darkness deepens ; Lord, with me abide ! 
 When other helpers fail, and comforts flee, 
 Help of the helpless, O abide with me!

 Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day: 
 Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away; 
 Change and decay in all around I see; 
 
 Thou who changest not, abide with me! 
 
 Not a brief glance, I beg, a passing word, 
 But as Thou dwelt with Thy disciples. Lord, 
 Familiar, condescending, patient, free. 
 Come, not to sojourn, but abide with me! 
 
 Come not in terrors, as the King of Kings; 
 But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings; 
 Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea ; 
 Come, Friend of sinners, and abide with me I 
 
 Thou on my head in early youth didst smile. 
 And though rebellious and perverse, meanwhile 
 Thou hast not left me, oft as I left Thee : 
 On to the close, O Lord, abide with me! 
 
 1 need Thy presence every passing hour; 
 
 What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power? 
 Who like Thyself, my Guide and Stay can be ? 
 Through cloud and stmshine, O, abide with me I 
 
 I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless; 
 Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness; 
 Where is death's sting? where, grave, thy victory! 
 I triumph still, if Thou abide with me! 
 
 Hold Thou Thy cross before my closing eyes, 
 Shine through the gloom, and point me to the skies ; 
 Heaven's morning breaks, and earth's vain shadows 
 
 flee; 
 In life and death, O Lord, abide with me!

 Mine to the core of the heart, my beauty! 
 Mine, all mine, and for love, not duty ! 
 Love given willingly, full and free.

 Duty's a slave that keeps the keys,

 Of his goodly chambers with song and shout, 
 Just as he please — ^just as he please. 
 
 Mine, from the dear head's crown, brown- golden 
 
 To the silken foot that's scarce beholden ; 
 
 Give to a few friends hand or smile. 
 
 Like a generous lady, now and awhile, 
 
 But the sanctuary heart, that none dare win. 
 
 Keep holiest of holiest evermore ; 
 
 The crowd in the aisles may watch the door. 
 
 The high-priest only enters in. 
 
 Mine, my own, without doubts or terrors, 
 With all thy goodness, all thy errors. 
 Unto me and to me alone revealed, 
 "A spring shut up, a fountain sealed." 
 Many may praise thee — ^praise mine as thine; 
 Many may love thee — I'll love them too; 
 But thy heart of hearts, pure, faithful and true, 
 Must be mine, mine wholly, and only mine.

 Something all mine on this side heaven; 
 Something as much myself to be

 THE MODEL CHURCH. 
 
 Well, wife, I've found the model church! I worshiped 
 
 there to-day; 
 It made me think of good old times, before my hairs 
 
 were gray. 
 The meetin'-house was finer built than they were years 
 
 ago; 
 But then I found, when I went in, it wasn't built for 
 . show. 
 
 The sexton didn't seat me 'way back by the door; 
 
 He knew that I was old and deaf, as well as old and poor, 
 
 He must have been a Christian, for he led me boldly 
 
 through 
 The long aisle of that pleasant church, to find a pleasant 
 
 pew. 
 
 I wished you'd heard the singin' — ^it had the old-time 
 
 ring— 
 The preacher said with trumpet voice, "Let all the people 
 
 sing;" 
 The tune was "Coronation," and the music upward 
 
 rolled. 
 Till I thought I heard the angels striking all their harps 
 
 of gold.

 My deafness seemed to melt away, my spirit caught the

 I joined my feeble, trembling voice with that melodious

 And sang, as in my youthful days, "Let angels prostrate 
 
 fall, 
 Bring forth the royal diadem and crown Him Lord of all." 
 
 I tell you, wife, it did me good to sing that hymn once

 I felt like some wrecked mariner who gets a glimpse of 
 
 shore ; 
 I almost want to lay aside this weather-beaten form 
 And anchor in the blessed port forever from the storm. 
 
 The preachin' ! well, I can't just tell all that the preacher 
 
 said; 
 I know it wasn't written, I know it wasn't read; 
 He hadn't time to read, for the lightnin' of his eye 
 Went passing 'long from pew to pew, nor passed a sinner 
 
 by. 
 
 The sermon wasn't flowery, 'twas simple gospel truth; 
 It fitted poor old men like me, it fitted hopeful youth, 
 'Twas full of consolation for weary hearts that bleed, 
 'Twas full of invitations to Qhrist — ^and not to creed. 
 
 The preacher made sin hideous in Gentiles and in Jews; 
 He shot the golden sentences straight at the finest pews, 
 And, though I can't see very well, I saw the falling tear 
 That told me hell was some way off , and heaven very near. 
 
 How swift the golden moments fled within that holy 
 place !

 Surpassing far all these ;

 Both for themselves and those who call them friend? 
 
 For so, the whole round earth is every way 
 
 Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.

 POESY. 
 
 There breathes no being but has some pretense 
 To that fine instinct called poetic sense; 
 The rudest savage roaming through the wild, 
 The simplest rustic bending o'er his child, 
 The infant listening to the warbling bird, 
 The mother smiling at its half- formed word; 
 The boy uncaged, who tracks the fields at large, 
 The girl turned matron to her babe-like charge, 
 The freeman casting with unpurchased hand 
 The vote that shakes the turrets of the land; 
 The slave, who, slumbering on his rusted chain. 
 Dreams of the palm-trees on his burning plain; 
 The hot-cheeked reveler, tossing down the wine. 
 To join the chorus "Aiild lang syne;" 
 The gentle maid, whose azure eye grows dim, 
 While Heaven is listening to her evening hymn ; 
 The jeweled beauty, when her steps draw near 
 The circling dance and dazzling chandelier; 
 E'en trembling age, when spring's renewing air 
 Waves the thin ringlets of his silvered hair, — 
 All, all are glowing with the inward flame. 
 Whose wider halo wreathes the poet's name. 
 While, unembalmed, the silent dreamer dies,. 
 His memory passing with his smiles and sighs 
 If glorious visions, bom for all mankind. 
 The bright auroras of our twilight mind; 
 If fancies, varying as the shapes that lie 
 Stained on the windows of the sunset sky; 
 If hopes, that beckon with delusive gleams. 
 Till the eye dances in the void of dreams;

 OF BOOKS. 
 
 As there might be a meadow fair to view, 
 And many people by that way might pass; 
 
 And one might see the grass, and one the dew. 
 And one alone the daisy in the grass: 
 
 So, on the pages of a written book. 
 
 Though they to all may beauteously shine. 
 
 Yet every one with his own eyes may look. 
 And one alone the writer's thought divine. 
 
 As, in a garden husbanded with care. 
 
 Among the blossoms brilliant-hued and grand, 
 
 May chance to grow a wilding, sweetly fair. 
 Which was not planted by the gardener's hand: 
 
 Which he, if it had come to meet his eye,

 So, on the page with careful labor wrought, 
 The writer on one purpose all intent, 
 
 A better mind may find a better thought — 
 A higher meaning than was ever meant. 
 
 But whether books be meadows fresh and green, 
 Or whether they but cultured gardens be, 
 
 Whoever rambles through them, still must glean 
 Only such flowers as he has eyes to see.

 PATIENCE. 
 
 Were there no night we could not read the stars, 
 The heavens would turn into a blinding glare; 
 
 Freedom is best seen through the prison-bars, 
 And rough seas make the haven passing fair. 
 
 We cannot measure joys but by their loss, 
 Wheii blessings fade away we see them then. 
 
 Our richest clusters grow around the cross. 
 And in the night-time angels sing to men. 
 
 The seed must first lie buried deep in earth. 
 
 Before the lily opens to the sky; 
 So "light is sown," and gladness has its birth 
 
 In the dark deeps where we can only cry. 
 
 "Life out of death" is Heaven's unwritten law. 
 Nay, it is written in a myriad forms; 
 The victor's palm grows on the fields of war, 
 And strength and beauty are the fruit of storms.

 Come, then, my soul, be brave to do and bear; 
 Thy hfe is bruised that it may be more sweet; 
 
 The cross will soon be left, the crown we'll wear- 
 Nay, we will cast it at our Savior's feet. 
 
 And up among the glories never told. 
 Sweeter than music of the marriage bell, 
 
 Our hands will strike the vibrant harp of gold 
 To the glad song, "He doeth all things well."

 HASTE NOT! REST NOT! 
 
 Without haste! without rest! 
 
 Bind the motto to thy breast; 
 
 Bear it with thee as a spell ; 
 
 Storm or sunshine, guard it well ! 
 
 Heed not flowers that 'round thee bloom, 
 
 Bear it onward to the tomb ! 
 
 Haste not ! Let no thoughtless deed 
 Mar for aye the spirit's speed! 
 Ponder well, and know the right. 
 Onward then, with all thy might! 
 Haste not ! years can ne'er atone 
 For one reckless action done. 
 
 Rest not ! Life is sweeping by. 
 Go and dare, before you die ; 
 Something mighty and sublime 
 Leave behind to conquer time! 
 Glorious 'tis to live for aye, 
 When these forms have passed away.

 THE MAID'S LAMENT. 
 
 I loved him not ; and yet, now he is gone, 
 
 I feel I am alone. 
 I checked him while he spoke; yet could he speak 
 
 Alas! I would not check. 
 For reasons not to love him once I sought, 
 
 And wearied all my thought 
 To vex myself and him: I now would give 
 
 My love could he but live 
 Who lately lived for me, and when he fotmd 
 
 'Twas vain, in holy ground 
 He hid his face amid the shades of death! 
 
 I waste for him my breath 
 Who wasted his for me ; but mine returns, 
 
 And this lone bosom bums 
 With stifling heat, heaving it up in sleep. 
 
 And waking me to weep 
 Tears that had melted his soft heart : for years 
 
 Wept he as bitter tears! 
 "Mercifiil God!" such was his latest prayer, 
 
 "These may she never share!" 
 Quieter is his breath, his breast more cold 
 
 Than daisies, in the mould,

 To soar from earth, and find all fears 
 
 Lost in thy light — Eternity!

 I asked the ancient, venerable dead 
 Sages who wrote, and warriors who bled: 
 From the cold grave a hollow murmur flowed, 
 "Time sowed the seeds we reap in this abode !" 
 
 I asked a dying sinner, ere the stroke 
 Of ruthless death life's "golden bowl had broke;" 
 I asked him. What is time? "Time," he replied, 
 "I've lost it: Ah, the treasure!" and he died! 
 
 I asked the golden sun and silver spheres, 
 Those bright chronometers of days and years ; 
 They answered, "Time is but a meteor's glare," 
 And bade me for Eternity prepare. 
 
 I asked the seasons, in their annual round 
 Which beautify, or desolate the ground ; 
 And they replied (no oracle more wise), 
 " 'Tis folly's blank, and wisdom's highest prize." 
 
 I asked a spirit lost, but, O the shriek ' 
 
 That pierced my soul! I shudder while I speak! 
 
 It cried, "A particle! a speck! a mite 
 
 Of endless years, duration infinite!" 
 
 Of things inanimate, my dial I 
 Consulted, and it made me this reply: 
 "Time is the season fair of living well 
 The path to glory, or the path to hell."^ 
 
 I asked my Bible, and methinks it said 
 "Thine is the present hour, the past is fled; 
 Live ! live to-day ! to-morrow never yet 
 On any human being rose ov s§t!"

 I asked old father Time himself at last ; 
 But in a moment he flew swiftly past ; 
 His chariot was a cloud, the viewless wind 
 His noiseless steeds, that left no trace behind.

 One foot on sea, and one on solid land; 
 "By heaven's great King, I swear the mystery's o'er!

 THE CLOSING SCENE. 
 
 Within this sober realm of leafless trees. 
 The russet year inhaled the dreamy air. 
 
 Like some tanned reaper in his hour of ease, 
 When all the fields are lying brown and bare. 
 
 The gray barns looking from their hazy hills 
 O'er the dim waters widening in the vales 
 
 Sent down the air a greeting to the mills. 
 On the dull thunder of alternate flails. 
 
 All sights were mellowed and all sounds subdued. 
 The hills seemed further and the streams sang low ; 
 
 As in a dream the distant woodman hewed 
 His winter log with many a mufified blow. 
 
 The embattled forests, erewhile armed in gold, 
 Their banners bright with every martial hue. 
 
 Now stood, like some sad beaten host of old. 
 Withdrawn afar in Time's remotest blue.

 On slumberous wings the vulture tried his flight ; 
 
 The dove scarce heard his sighing mate's complaint ; 
 And, like a star slow drowning in the light, 
 
 The village church- vane seemed to pale and faint. 
 
 The sentinel cock upon the hill-side crew — 
 Crew thrice, and all was stiller than before — 
 
 Silent till some replying wanderer blew 
 
 His alien horn, and then was heard no more. 
 
 Where erst the jay within the elm's tall crest 
 
 Made garrulous trouble round the unfledged young; 
 
 And where the oriole hung her swaying nest 
 By every light wind like a censer swung; 
 
 Where sang the noisy masons of the eaves, 
 
 The busy swallows circling ever near. 
 Foreboding, as the rustic mind believes. 
 
 An early harvest and a plenteous year; 
 
 Where every bird which charmed the vernal feast 
 Shook the sweet slumber from its wings at morn. 
 
 To warn the reapers of the rosy east — 
 All now was songless, empty and forlorn. 
 
 Alone, from out the stubble piped the quail. 
 
 And croaked the crow through all the dreamy gloom ; 
 
 Alone the pheasant, drumming in the vale, 
 Made echo to the distant cottage loom. 
 
 There was no bud, no bloom upon the bowers; 
 
 The spiders wove their thin shrouds night' by night; 
 The thistle-down, the .only ghost of flowers. 
 
 Sailed slowly by — ^passed noiseless out of sight.

 Amid all this, in this most cheerless air, 
 
 And where the woodbine sheds upon the porch 
 
 Its crimson leaves, as if the year stood there 
 Firing the floor with his inverted torch — 
 
 Amid all this, the center of the scene, 
 
 The white-haired matron, with monotonous tread, 
 Plied her swift wheel, and with her joyless mien 
 
 Sat like a Fate, and watched the flying thread. 
 
 She had known Sorrow. He had walked with her, 
 Oft supped, and broke with her the ashen crust; 
 
 And in the dead leaves still she heard the stir 
 Of his black mantle trailing in the dust. 
 
 While yet her cheek was bright with summer bloom 
 Her country summoned, and she gave her all ; 
 
 And twice War bowed to her his sable plume — 
 Re-gave the swords to rust upon her wall. 
 
 Re-gave the swords — ^but not the hand that drew. 
 And struck for liberty the dying blow; 
 
 Nor him who, to his sire and country true, 
 Fell, 'mid the ranks of the invading foe. 
 
 Long, but not loud, the droning wheel went on, 
 Like the low murmur of a hive at noon ; 
 
 Long, but not loud, the memory of the gone 
 
 Breathed through her lips a sad and tremulous tune. 
 
 At last the thread was snapped — ^her head was bowed. 
 Life dropped the distaff through his hands serene ; 
 
 And loving neighbors smoothed her careful shroud — 
 While Death and Winter closed the Autumn scene

 PICTURES OF MEMORY. 
 
 Among the beautiful pictures 
 
 That hang on Memory's wall, 
 Is one of a dim old forest, 
 
 That seemeth best of all. 
 Not for its gnarled oaks olden. 
 
 Dark with the mistletoe; 
 Not for the violets golden 
 
 That sprinkle the vale below; 
 Not for the milk-white lilies 
 
 That lean from the fragrant hedge, 
 Coquetting all day with the sunbeams. 
 
 And stealing their golden edge; 
 Not for the vines on the upland 
 
 Where the bright red berries rest, 
 Nor the pinks, nor the pale, sweet cowslip 
 
 It seemeth to me the best. 
 
 I once had a little brother 
 
 With eyes that were dark and deep^— 
 In the lap of that dim old forest. 
 
 He lieth in peace asleep. 
 Light as the down of the thistle, 
 
 Free as the winds that blow, 
 We roved there, the beautiful summers, 
 
 The summers of long ago; 
 But his feet on the hills grew weary. 
 
 And one of the autumn eves, 
 I made for my little brother 
 
 A bed of the yellow leaves.

 NATHAN HALE, THE MARTYR SPY. 
 
 After the disastrous defeat of the Americans on Long 
 Island, Washington desired information respecting the Brit- 
 ish position and movements. Capt. Nathan Hale, but twen- 
 ty-one years old, Toluntered to procure the informajtion. 
 He was taken, and hanged as a spy the day after his capture, 
 Sept. 22, 1776. His patriotic devotion and brutal treatment 
 received at the hands c£ his captors 'ave suggested the 
 following: 
 
 'Twas in the year that gave the Nation birth — 
 A time when men esteemed the common good 
 As greater weal than private gain. A battle fierce 
 And obstinate had laid a. thousand patriots low, 
 And filled the people's hearts ^ith gloom. 
 
 Pursued like hunted deer, , 
 The crippled army fled; and, yet, amid 
 Disaster and defeat, the Nation's chosen chief 
 Besolved his losses to retrieve. But not 
 With armies disciplined and trained by years 
 Of martial service could he, this Fabian chief, 
 Now hope to check the hosts of Howe's victorious legions — 
 These had he not. 
 
 In stratagem the shrewder general 
 Ofttimes o'ercomes his strong antagonist. 
 To Washington, a knowledge of the plans, 
 Position, strength of England's force. 
 Must compensate for lack of numbers. 
 
 He casts about for one who'd take his life 
 In hand. , Lol he stands before the chief. In face.

 Appraised the youth at his full worth, and saw

 Detects an atom on either beam, weighed well 
 Your chances of escape 'gainst certain fate 
 Should capture follow in the British camp?" 
 
 In tones of fitting modesty that weli 
 Became his years, the patriot answered thus: 
 "My country's honor, safety, life, it ever was 
 My highest purpose to defend; that country's foes 
 Exultant sweep through ruined land and home

 Judas, self -condemned thou art 
 But the type of many a trait' rous friend, 
 Who ere and since thy time betrayed to death 
 A noble heart. Henceforth be doubly doomed — 
 A base example to earth's weaker souls. 
 
 Before Lord Howe the captive youth 
 Was led. "Base dog!" the haughty general said: 
 "Ignoble son of loyal sires! you've played the spy 
 Quite well I ween. The cunning skill wherewith 
 Tou wrought these plans and charts might well adorn 
 An honest man, but in a rebel's hands they're vile 
 And mischevious. If aught may palliate 
 A traitor's act, attempted in his sovereign's camp, 
 I bid you speak ere I pronounce your sentence." 
 
 With tone and mien that hushed 
 The buzzing noise of idle lackeys in the hall, 
 The patriot thus replied: "You know my name — 
 My rank; — ^my treacherous kinsman made 
 My purpose plain. I've nothing further of myself 
 To tell beyond the charge of traitor to deny.

 The brand of spy I do accept without reproach; 
 But never since I've known the base ingratitude 
 Of king to loyal subjects of his realm 
 Has British rule been aught to me than barbarous 
 Despotism which God and man abhor, and none 
 But dastards fear to overthrow. 
 
 ' 'For tyrant loyalty your lordship represents 
 I never breathed a loyal breath; and he 
 Who calls me traitor seeks a pretext for a crime 
 His trembling soul might well condemn." 
 
 "I'll hear no more such prating cant," 
 Said Howe; "Your crime's enough to hang a dozen men. 
 Before tomorrow's sun shall rise you'll swing 
 'Twixt earth and heaven, that your countrymen 
 May know a British camp is dangerous ground 
 For prowling spies. Away." 
 
 In loathsome cell, deprived 
 Of holy sacrament, and e'en the word of Him 
 Who cheered the thief upon the cross — refused 
 The meaus wherewith he would indite his last 
 Farewell to her who gave him life, 
 And to another whose young heart 
 The morrow's work would shade in gloom — 
 He passed the night in charge of one whom Satan had 
 Commissioned hell's sharpest torments to inflict. 
 
 Securely bound upon a cart, amid 
 A speechless crowd, he stands beneath a strong 
 Projecting limb, to which a rope with noose attached 
 Portends a tragic scene. He casts his eyes

 My humble death upon this tree will light anew 
 The Torch of Liberty. A hundred hands to one 
 Before will strike for country, home, and God,

 A million prayers go up this day to free 
 The land from blighting curse of tyrant's rule.

 Here have I watched in this dungeon cell 
 Longer than memory's tongue can tell; 
 
 Here have I shrieked in my wild despair 
 When the dammed fiends from their prison came, 
 
 Sported and gamboled and mocked me here, 
 With their eyes of fire and tongues of flame. 
 Shouting forever and aye my name! 
 
 And I strove in vain to burst my chain, 
 And longed to be free as the winds again,

 Joy! I spurn thee with disdain; 
 Nothing love I but this clanking chain,

 He who had mocked me many a day, 
 
 And haired me out from its cheerful ray:

 OFTEN THERE IS NEED FOR TRIALS 
 John G. Quinius. 
 
 If you share with other's pleasure, 
 Share with them their tears. 
 
 Sorrow shared doth bring as treasure 
 Heart that never fears. 
 
 Each will have his share of sorrow. 
 
 Pain is ever near. 
 Here on earth we oft must borrow 
 
 Strength from those most dear. 
 
 Often there is need for trials — 
 
 Would the glory in the sky 
 Cleanse and purge you, as denials 
 
 Forced upon you from on high? 
 
 When the day brings joy and comfort, 
 
 How the hours take wing; 
 When the sunhght floods the valleys, 
 
 Easy 'tis to sing. 
 
 Teach us Lord to praise, though sorrow 
 Seemingly us pain doth give. 
 
 Knowing that to-day, to-morrow,' 
 Through all time thy love doth live. 
 
 Thou who knowest all wilt never 
 
 Err in giving joy or pain; 
 E'en though death life's cord doth sever.

 THE HONEST DEACON. 
 
 Aa honest man was Deacon Ray, 
 
 And though a Christian good, 
 He had one fault, — the love of drinks 
 
 For drink he often would. 
 
 On almost every Sunday, too, 
 
 He would at dinner-time 
 Indulge to quite a great extent 
 
 In good Madeira wine. 
 
 At church, in front, upon the side, 
 
 The deacon had his pew; 
 Another worthy. Squire Lee, 
 
 He had a seat there too. 
 
 One Sunday, the sermon done, 
 
 The parson said he'd talk 
 In language plain, that afternoon. 
 
 Of sins within their flock. 
 
 He warned them that they must not flinch 
 
 If he should be severe. 
 Each thought his neighbor'd get dressed downj 
 
 So all turned out hear. 
 
 The church at early hour was fuU; 
 
 The deacon, some behind, 
 Game in quite late ; for he had been 
 
 Indulging in his wine.

 The parson of transgressors spoke, 
 
 And of the wrath to flee ; 
 Ao.d soon he to the query came, — 
 
 "The drunkard — where is he?" 
 
 .A pause; and then the deacon rose, 
 And answered like a man, — 
 
 Though with a hiccup in his voice, — ^ 
 "Here, parson, — hie — 'ere I am." 
 
 Of course the consternation 
 
 Was great on every side: 
 For who'd have thought the deacon 
 
 Would thus aptly have replied? 
 
 The preacher, not the least disturbed. 
 
 With his remarks kept on, 
 And warned him to forsake his ways; 
 
 The deacon then sat down. 
 
 'Twas soon another question came, 
 With no more welcome sound, — 
 
 "Where is the wicked hypocrite? " 
 This made them all turn round.

 ONLY A PIN. 
 
 Only a pin, yet it calmly lay, 
 On the carpet floor in the light of day; 
 And shone serene and clear and bright, 
 Reflecting back the noon-day light. 
 
 Only a boy, yet he saw that pin, 
 And his face assumed a fiendish grin. 
 He stooped for awhile, with look intent, 
 Till he and the pin alike were bent. 
 
 Only a chair, but upon its seat 
 A well-bent pin found safe retreat; 
 Nor could the keenest eye discern 
 That heavenward its point did turn. 
 
 Only a man, but he chanced to drop 
 Upon that chair; when — bangl whiz! pop! 
 Like a cork from a bottle of champagne 
 He bounded right up from that chair again.

 It lacked the remotest idea ot fun; 
 And man and boy, and pin and chair, 
 In close communion mingled there.

 Alone no trace of damage bore; 
 The man was mad and dreadfully sore; 
 He lathered that boy behind and before, 
 
 The chair lay smashed upon the floor, 
 
 Its seat was riot hurt, but the boy was raw.

 LOVE OF COUNTRY. 
 
 In these days of rapid national growth, when the citizen 
 of today is supplanted by the youth and franchised emi. 
 /^rant of tomorrow; when a million voters cast their ballots 
 with no higher motive than compliance with a custom or the 
 dictates of party henchmen; when one-fourth of our popula- 
 tion have no stronger ties of residence than avarice, whose 
 strength varies with the financial fluctuations of the busi- 
 ness world; when year by year our shores receive the 
 restless spirits of other lauds who acknowledge no higher 
 authority than their own caprice; when so many of our 
 youth are growmg into manhood ignorant of everything 
 save the means of licensed indulgences and frivolity our 
 liberty affords; when as partakers of the grandest political 
 inheritance ever transmitted from one generation to another, 
 we are all about to forget the fearful responsibilities thrust 
 upon us in our acceptance of the blessings of liberty we 
 enjoy, it is time to halt.

 acts of piety and benevolence, is the love of country, its 
 flag, the n]art3rrs who fell in its defense, and last but great- 
 est of all, an abiding faith in its institutions and undying 
 devotion to its peace, happiness and perpetuity. Let the 
 examples of patriots, in deeds of heroism and self-sacrifice, 
 be our theme of meditation and discussion. Let our litera- 
 ture gleam mth the noble efforts, the grand achievements of 
 those who gave their all that we, their dependents, might 
 taste the sweets of freedom undisturbed. 
 
 Let us realize that this grandest heritage of earth's 
 martyrs came to us, not alone through the business tact and 
 prudent foresight of our sires, but by years of toU and suf- 
 fering, of cold and hunger, of want and privation, and by 
 the generous sacrifice of precious blood; and, that, though 
 it be vouchsafed to us through blessings of a noble ancestry, 
 its possession implies no permanenee to an unworthy race. 
 
 It is ours not alone to enjoy, but to foster and protect; 
 ours to guard from schism, vice and crime; ours to purify, 
 exalt, ennoble; ours to prepare s. dwelling place fortae 
 purest, fairest, best of earth's humanity.

 A SCIENTIFIC PARTY. 
 
 A short time ago a delegation of eminently learned and

 the Pacific coast to examine the specimens of petrified wood 
 abounding in the Sacramento valley.

 with the localities in which the finest specimens were to be 
 found, was employed as guide. If there is any class of hu- 
 manity for whom Joe has no respect, it is what he terms 
 "the tender-footed, kid-glove, city chaps;" and so, after 
 leading the party through deserted gulches and over unsteady 
 boulders for some hours, and hearing little but long, and to 
 him meaningless words, he became thoroughly disgusted, and 
 lost no opportunity to testify his contempt for their parox- 
 ysms of ectasy which burst forth every time they found 
 what they regarded as a valuable contribution to their cabi- 
 nets of natural curiosities. 
 
 At length one of the scientists stumbled upon a rare 
 specimen which threw the whole party into profound amaze- 
 ment — petrified them, as it were. 
 
 To the insignificant little piece of petrified wood no bigger 
 than a man's hand they gave a name a foot long, and wrap- 
 ped it around twice and tucked it in at the ends. 
 
 Joe, who labored under an aggravating impediment of 
 speech, could hold in no longer. Breaking out in his stutter- 
 ing way, he said: 
 
 "W — ^w — ^why, up a y — y — ^yonder in th — them m — m —

 thar Br-^-a — a — shooting at an eagle, and that h — h — hunter 
 is p — ^p — ^p — p — peetrified. " 
 
 One of the party ventured to suggest that Joe was labor- 
 ing under an erroneous impression regarding the nature of 
 petrification.

 "Oh! my dear fellow," said another of the party, "that 
 is impossible. Such a phenomenon is contrary to the laws 
 of gravitation. The force of gravity acts instantaneously, 
 and when a bird or any other object is no longer sustained 
 by its own or some other power, it at once falls to the 
 earth." 
 
 Joe seemed dazed for a moment, but he was not to be 
 switched off by any such scientific obstructions. Gathering 
 himself for another verbal struggle, he gasped:

 er" should be printed above the doors of "A Buddhist 
 Temple at Benares." To me comes the brakeman, and 
 seating himself on the arm of the seat, says : "I went to 
 church yesterday." 
 
 "Yes?" I said, with that interested inflection that asks 
 for more. "And what church did you attend?" 
 
 "Which do you guess?" he asked. 
 
 "Some union mission church," I hazarded. 
 
 "No," he said, "I don't like to run on these branch 
 roads very much. I don't often go to church, and when 
 I do, I want to run on the main line, where your run is 
 regular and you go on schedule time and don't have to 
 wait on connections. I don't like to run on a branch. 
 Good enough, but I don't like it." 
 
 "Episcopal?" I guessed. 
 
 "Limited express," he said, "all palace cars and $2 
 extra for seat, fast time and only stop at big stations. 
 Nice line, but too exhaustive for a brakeman. All train 
 men in uniform, conductor's punch and lantern silver 
 plated, and no train boys allowed. Then the passengers 
 are allowed to talk back at the conductor, and it makes 
 them too free and easy. No, I couldn't stand the palace 
 cars. Rich road, though. Don't often hear of a receiver 
 being appointed for that line. Some mighty nice people 
 travel on it, too." 
 
 "Universalist ?" I suggested. 
 
 "Broad gauge," said the brakeman; "does too much 
 complimentary business. Everybody travels on a pass. 
 Conductor doesn't get a fare once in fifty miles. Stops at 
 flag stations, and won't run into anything but a union 
 depot. No smoking car on the train. Train orders are

 rather vague, though, and the train men don't get along 
 well with the passengers. No, I don't go to the Univer- 
 salist, but I know some good men who run on that road." 
 
 "Presbyterian?" I asked. 
 
 "Narrow gauge, eh ?" said the brakeman, "pretty track, 
 straight as a rule; tunnel right through a mountain 
 rather than go around it; spirit-level grade; passengers 
 have to show their tickets before they get on the train. 
 Mighty strict road, but the cars a little narrow ; have to 
 sit one in the seat, and no room in the aisle to dance. 
 Then there is no stop-over ticket allowed; got to go 
 straight through to the station you're ticketed for, or you 
 can't get on at all. When the cars are full no extra 
 coaches ; cars built at the shop to hold just so many and 
 nobody else allowed on. But you don't often hear of an 
 accident on that road. It's run right up to the rules." 
 
 "Maybe you joined the Free Thinkers?" I said. 
 
 "Scrub road," said the brakeman, "dirt road bed and no 
 ballast ; no time card and no train dispatcher. All trains 
 run wild, and every engineer makes his own time, just as 
 he pleases. Smoke if you want to; kind of go-as-you- 
 please road. Too many side tracks, and every switch wide 
 open all the time, with the switchman sound asleep and 
 the target lamp dead out. Get on as you please and get 
 off when you want to. Don't have to show your tickets, 
 and the conductor isn't expected to do anything but 
 amuse the passengers. No, sir. I was offered a pass, but 
 I don't like the line. I don't like to travel on a road that 
 has no terminus. Do you know, sir, I asked a division 
 superintendent where that road run to, and he said he 
 hoped to die if he knew. I asked him if the general

 superintendent could tell me, and he said he didn't be- 
 lieve they had a general superintendent, and if they had he 
 didn't know anything more about the road than the pas- 
 sengers. I asked him who he reported to, and he said 
 'nobody.' I asked a conductor who he got his orders 
 from, and he said he didn't take orders from any living 
 man or dead ghost. And when I asked the engineer 
 who he got his orders from, he said he'd like to see 
 anybody give him orders ; he'd run the train to suit him- 
 self, or he'd run it into the ditch. Now, you see, sir, I'm 
 a railroad man, and I don't care to run on a road that 
 has no time, makes no connections, runs nowhere, and 
 has no superintendent. It may be all right, but I've rail- 
 roaded too long to understand it." 
 
 "Maybe you went to the Congregational Church?" 
 
 "Popular road," said the brakeman, "an old road, too — 
 one of the very oldest in the country. Good road-bed 
 and comfortable cars. Well-managed road, too ; directors 
 don't interfere with division superintendents and train 
 orders. Road's mighty popular, but it's pretty independ- 
 ent, too. Yes, didn't one of the division superintendents 
 down east discontinue one of the oldest stations on this 
 line two or three years ago? But it's a mighty pleasant 
 road to travel on — always has such a pleasant class of 
 passengers." 
 
 "Did you try the Methodist?" I said. 
 
 "Now you're shouting !" he said, with some enthusiasm. 
 "Nice road, eh? Fast time and plenty of passengers.

 can hear him at the next station. Every train-light shines 
 like a head-light. Stop-over checks are given on all 
 through tickets ; passenger can drop off the train as often 
 as he likes, do the station two or three days, and hop on 
 the next revival train that comes thundering along. Good 
 wholesouled, companionable conductors; ain't a road in 
 the country where the passengers feel more at home. No 
 passes; every passenger pays full traffic rates for his 
 ticket. Wesleyanhouse air-brakes on all trains, too; 
 pretty safe road, but I didn't ride over it yesterday." 
 
 "Perhaps you tried the Baptist?" I guessed once more. 
 
 "Ah, ah!" said the brakeman, "she's a daisy, isn't she? 
 River road ; beautiful curves ; sweep around anything to 
 keep close to the river, but it's all steel rail and rock 
 ballast, single track all the way, and not a side track from 
 the round house to the terminus. Takes a heap of water 
 to run it, though ; double tanks at every station, and there 
 isn't an engine in the shops that can pull a pound or run 
 a mile with less than two gauges. But it runs through a 
 lovely country; those river roads always do; river on one 
 side and hills on the other, and it's a steady climb up the 
 grade all the way till the run ends where the fountain- 
 head of the river begins. Yes, sir; I'll take the river 
 road every time for a lovely trip; sure connections and a 
 good time, and no prairie dust blowing in at the windows. 
 And yesterday, when the conductor came around for the 
 tickets with a little basket punch, I didn't ask him to pass 
 me. but I paid my fare like a little man — ^twenty-five 
 cents for an hour's run and a little concert by the pas- 
 sengers thrown in. I tell you, pilgrim, you take the river 
 road when you want "

 But just here the long whistle from the engine an- 
 nounced a station, and the brakeman hurried to the door, 
 shouting :

 SAM WELLER AS WITNESS. 
 
 CHARLES DICKENS. 
 
 "What's your name, sir?" inquired the judge. "Sam 
 Weller, my lord," replied that gentleman. "Do you spell 
 t with a 'V or a 'W'?" inquired the judge. "That de- 
 pends upon the taste and fancy of the speller, my lord," 
 replied Sam ; "I never had occasion to spell it more than 
 once or twice in my life, but I spells it with a 'V.' " Here 
 a voice in the gallery exclaimed aloud : "Quite right, too, 
 Samivel; quite right. Put it down a we, my lord, put 
 it down a we." "Who is that that dares to address the 
 court ?" said the little judge, looking up. "Usher !" "Yes, 
 my lord!" "Bring that person here instantly." "Yes, 
 my lord." 
 
 I But as the usher didn't Und the person, he didn't bring 
 him; and, after a great commotion, all tlie people who 
 had got up to look for the culprit, sat down again. The 
 little judge turned to the witness as soon as his indigna- 
 tion would allow him to speak and said : "Do you know 
 who that was, sir ?" "I rather suspect it was my father, 
 my lord," replied Sam. "Do you see him here now?" 
 said the judge. ''No, I don't, my lord," replied Sam,

 staring right up into the lantern in the roof of the Court. 
 "If you could have pointed him out, I would have com- 
 mitted him instantly," said the judge. Sam bowed his 
 acknowledgments, and turned with unimpaired cheer- 
 fulness of countenance toward Sergeant Buzfuz. 
 
 "Now, Mr. Weller," said Sergeant Buzfuz. "Now, 
 sir," replied Sam. "I believe you are in the service of 
 Mr. Pickwick, the defendant in this case. Speak up, if 
 you please, Mr. Weller." "I mean to speak up, sir," re- 
 plied Sam. "I am in the service o' that 'ere genTman, 
 and a wery good service it is." "Little to do, and plenty 
 to get, I suppose?" said Sergeant Buzfuz, with jocularity. 
 "Oh, quite enough to get, sir, as the soldier said ven they 
 ordered him three hundred and fifty lashes," replied Sam. 
 "You must not tell us what the soldier or any other man 
 said, sir," interposed the judge; "it's not evidence." 
 "Wery good, my lord," replied Sam. 
 
 "Do you recollect anything particular happening on 
 the morning when you were first engaged by the defend- 
 ant, eh, Mr. Weller?" said Sergeant Buzfuz. "Yes, I do, 
 sir," replied Sam. "Have the goodness to tell the jury 
 what it was." "I had a reg'lar new fit out o' clothes that 
 mornin', gen'l'men of the jury," said Sam, "and that was 
 a wery particular and uncommon circumstance with me in 
 those days." 
 
 Hereupon there was a general laugh; and the little 
 judge, looking with an angry countenance over his desk, 
 said: "You had better be careful, sir." "So Mr. Pick- 
 wick said at the time, my lord," replied Sam, "and I was 
 wery careful o' that 'ere suit o' clothes ; wery careful, in- 
 deed, my lord." The judge looked sternly at Sam for full

 two minutes, but Sam's features were so perfectly calm 
 and serene that he said nothing, and motioned Sergeant 
 Buzfuz to proceed. 
 
 "Do you mean to tell me, Mr. Weller," said Sergeant 
 Buzfuz, folding his arms emphatically, and turning half 
 round to the jury, as if in mute assurance he would bother 
 the witness yet — "Do you mean to tell me, Mr. Weller, 
 that you saw nothing of this fainting on the part of the 
 plaintiff in the arms of the defendant, which you have 
 heard described by the witnesses?" "Certainly not," 
 replied Sam. "I was in the passage till they called me 
 up, and then the old lady was not there." 
 
 "Now attend, Mr. Weller," said Sergeant Buzfuz, 
 dipping a large pen into the inkstand before him, for the 
 purpose of frightening Sam with a show of taking down 
 his answer, "you were in the passage, and yet saw noth- 
 ing of what was going forward. Have you a pair of eyes, 
 Mr. Weller?" "Yes, I have a pair of eyes," replied Sam, 
 "and that's just it. If they wos a pair o' patent double 
 million magnifyin' gas microscopes of hextra power, 
 p'raps I might be able to see through a flight o' stairs and 
 a deal door; but bein' only eyes, you see, my wision's 
 limited." 
 
 At this answer, which was delivered without the slight- 
 est appearance of irritation, and with the most complete 
 simplicity and equanimity of manner, the spectators tit- 
 tered, the little judge smiled, and Sergeant Buzfuz looked 
 particularly foolish. After a short consultation with 
 Dodson and Fogg the learned sergeant again turned to 
 Sam, and said, with a painful effort to conceal his vexa- 
 tion: "Now, Mr. Weller, I'll ask you a question on an-

 other point, if you please," "If you please, sir," rejoined 
 Sam, with the utmost good-humor. 
 
 "Do you remember going up to Mrs. Bardell's house, 
 one night in November last?" "Oh, yes; wery well." 
 "Oh, you do remember that, Mr. Weller," said Sergeant 
 Buzfuz, recovering his spirits, "I thought we should get 
 to something at last." "I rather thought that, too, sir," 
 replied Sam; and at this the spectators tittered again. 
 "Well ; I suppose you went up to have a little talk about 
 this trial — eh, Mr. Weller?" said Sergeant Buzfuz, look- 
 ing knowingly at the jury. "I went up to pay the rent ; 
 but we did get a talking about the trial," replied Sam. 
 "Oh, you didget a talking about the trial," said Sergeant 
 B^uzfuz, brightening up with the anticipation of some im- 
 portant discovery. "Now, what passed about the trial; 
 will you have the goodness to tell us, Mr. Weller?" 
 
 "Vith all the pleasure in my life, sir," replied Sam. 
 "Arter a few unimportant observations from the two 
 wirtuous females as has been examined here today, the 
 ladies gets into a wery great state o' admiration at the 
 honorable conduct of Mr. Dodson and Fogg — them two 
 gen'l'men as is sittin' near you now." This, of course, 
 drew general attention to Dodson and Fogg, who looked 
 as virtuous as possible. "The attorneys for the plain- 
 tiff," said Mr. Sergeant Buzfuz ; "well, they spoke in high 
 praise of the honorable conduct of Messrs. Dodson and 
 Fogg, the attorneys for the plaintiff, did they?" "Yes," 
 said Sam ; "they said what a wery gen'rous thing it was 
 o' them to have taken up the case on spec, and to charge 
 nothin' at all for costs, unless they got 'em out of Mr. 
 Pickwick."

 At this very unexpected reply, the spectators tittered 
 again, and Dodson and Fogg, turning very red, leaned 
 over to Sergeant Buzfuz, and in a hurried manner whis- 
 pered something in his ear. "You are quite right," said 
 Sergeant Buzfuz aloud, with affected composure. "It's 
 perfectly useless, my lord, attempting to get at any evi- 
 dence through the impenetrable stupidity of this witness. 
 I will not trouble the court by asking him any more ques- 
 tions. Stand down, sir." 
 
 "Would any other gen'l'man like to ask me anythin' ?" 
 inquired Sam, taking up his hat, and looking round 
 most deliberately. "Not I, Mr. Weller, thank you," said 
 Sergeant Snubbin, laughing. "You may go down, sir," 
 said Sergeant Buzfuz, waving his hand impatiently. Sam 
 went down accordingly, after doing Messrs. Dodson and 
 Fogg's case as much harm as he conveniently could, and 
 saying just as little respecting Mr. Pickwick as might 
 be, which was precisely the object he had in view all 
 along.

 "There, Simmons, you blockhead! Why didn't you 
 trot that old woman aboard her train? She'll have to 
 wait here now until the i :05 a. m." 
 
 "You didn't tell me." 
 
 "Yes, I did tell you. 'Twas only your confounded 
 stupid carelessness." 
 
 "She "

 "She! You fool ! What else could you expect of her I 
 Probably she hasn't any wit ; besides, she isn't bound on 
 a very jolly journey — got a pass up the road to the poor- 
 house. I'll go and tell her, and if you forget her tonight, 
 see if I don't make mince meat of you !" and our worthy 
 ticket agent shook his fist menacingly at his subordinate. 
 
 "You've missed your train, marm," he remarked, com- 
 ing forward to a queer looking bundle in the corner. 
 
 A trembling hand raised the faded black veil and re- 
 vealed the sweetest old face I ever saw. 
 
 "Never mind," said a quivering voice. 
 
 " 'Tis only three o'clock now ; you'll have to wait until 
 the night train, which doesn't go up until i :os." 
 
 "Very well, sir; I can wait." 
 
 "Wouldn't you like to go to some hotel ? Simmons will 
 show you the way." 
 
 "No, thank you, sir. One place is as good as another 
 to me. Besides, I haven't any money." 
 
 "Very well," said the agent, turning away indiiferently. 
 "Simmons will tell you when it's time." 
 
 All the afternoon she sat there so quiet that I thought 
 sometimes she must be asleep, but when I looked more 
 closely I could see every once in a while a great tear 
 rolling down her cheek, which she would wipe away has- 
 tily with her cotton handkerchief. 
 
 The depot was crowded, and all was bustle and hurry 
 until the 9:50 train going east came due; then every 
 passenger left except the old lady. It is very rare, in- 
 deed, that any one takes the night express, and almost 
 always after I have struck ten, the depot becomes silent 
 and empty.

 The ticket agent put on his great coat, and bidding 
 Simmons keep his wits about him for once in his life, 
 departed for home. 
 
 But he had no sooner gone than that functionary 
 stretched himself out upon the table, as usual, and began 
 to snore vociferously. 
 
 Then it was I witnessed such a sight as I never had 
 before and never expect to again. 
 
 The fire had gone down — it was a cold night, and the 
 wind howled dismally outside. The lamps grew dim and 
 flared, casting weird shadows upon the wall. By-and-by 
 I heard a smothered sob from the corner, then another. 
 I looked in that direction. She had risen from her seat, 
 and oh ! the look of agony on the poor pinched face. 
 
 "I can't believe it," she sobbed, wringing her thin, white 
 hands. "Oh ! I can't believe it ! My babies ! my babies ! 
 how often have I held them in my arms and kissed them ; 
 and how often they used to say back to me, 'Ise love you, 
 mamma,' and now, O God! they've turned against me. 
 Where am I going? To the poor-house! No! no! no! 
 I cannot ! I will not ! Oh, the disgrace !" 
 
 And sinking upon her knees, she sobbed out in prayer : 
 
 "O God! spare me this and take me home! O God, 
 spare me this disgrace ; spare me !" 
 
 The wind rose higher and swept through the crevices, 
 icy cold. How it moaned and seemed to sob like some- 
 thing human that is hurt. I began to shake, but the 
 kneeling figure never stirred. The thin shawl had dropped 
 from her shoulders unheeded. Simmons turned over and 
 drew his heavy blanket more closely about him. 
 
 Oh, how cold! Only one lamp remained, burning

 dimly; the other two had gone out for want of oil. I 
 could hardly see, it was so dark. 
 
 At last she became quieter and ceased to moan. Then 
 I grew drowsy, and kind a lost the run of things iafter I 
 had struck twelve, when some one entered 'the depot with 
 a bright light. I started up. It was the brightest light 
 I ever saw, and seemed to fill the room full of glory. I 
 could see 'twas a man. He walked to the kneeling figure 
 and touched her upon the shoulder. She started up and 
 turned her face wildly around. I heard him say : 
 
 " 'Tis train time, ma'am. Come !" 
 
 A look of joy came over her face. 
 
 "I'm ready," she whispered. 
 
 "Then give me your pass, ma'am." 
 
 She reached him a worn old book, which he took and 
 from it read aloud : 
 
 "Come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden, 
 and I will give you rest." 
 
 "That's the pass over our road, ma'am. Are you 
 ready?" 
 
 The light died away, and darkness fell in its place. My 
 hand touched the stroke of one. Simmons awoke with a 
 start and snatched his lantern. The whistles sounded 
 down brakes ; the train was due. He ran to the corner 
 and shook the old woman. 
 
 "Wake up, marm ; 'tis train time." 
 
 But she never heeded. He gave one look at the white 
 set face, and dropping his lantern, fled. 
 
 The up-train halted, the conductor shouted "All 
 aboard," but no one made a move that way. 
 
 The next morning, when the ticket agent came, he

 found her frozen to death. They whispered among them- 
 selves, and the coroner made out the verdict "apoplexy," 
 and it was in some way hushed up. 
 
 They laid her out in the depot, and advertised for her 
 friends, but no one came. So after the second day, they 
 buried her. 
 
 The last look on the sweet old face, lit up with a smile 
 so unearthly, I keep with me yet; and when I think of 
 the occurrence of that night, I know she went out on the 
 other train, that never stopped at the poor-house. 
 
 SANDY MACDONALD'S SIGNAL. 
 
 * 
 
 Weel, Sandy, man ; and how did ye like the sermon the 
 day? 
 
 Weel, it's rather a venturesome pint ter handle ; but if 
 ye'll forgie the freedom, I was jeest gaun to say that in 
 your discoorse the day — weel no gang any further than 
 the one the day — in the midst o't like, when ye was 
 on the top o' an illystration, it struck me that every noo 
 and then — ^but ye'll not feel offended at what I'm gaun 
 to say? 
 
 Say awa man, and I'll tell ye after. 
 
 I'm comin' to the pint directly ; all I was gaun to say 
 was just this, that every noo and then in your discoorse 
 the day, I dinna say oftener than noo and then jeest 
 occasionally — 't struck me there was maybee, f rae time 
 to time, jest a wee bit o' exaggeration. 
 
 Exagger— What sir? 
 


## p. (#448) ################################################

356 PROSE SELECTIONS. 
 
 There, there, there! I'll no say anither word! All I 
 meant to say was that ye jeest stretched the pint a iv\ee 
 bit! 
 
 Stretched the pint! D'ye mean to sa;', sir, that I tell 
 lees? 
 
 Well — a — but I didna gang sae far as that. 
 
 Did ever ye hear the elders say that I exaggerated or 
 stretched the pint?' 
 
 I wadna say but what they hae, too. 
 
 Oh ! So the elders and the whole of ye call me a leer, 
 do ye ? Hau'd per tongue, Sandy, it's my turn to speak 
 now. Although I'm your minister, still I'm perfectly 
 willing to admit that I'm a sinful, erring creature, like 
 any one o' ye ; but I've been to colleges and seats of learn- 
 ing, and I've got some sense in my head ! At the same 
 time, Sandy, I am free to admit that I'm only a human 
 being, and it's just possible that being obleedged, Saw- 
 bath after Sawbath to expound the word to sic a doited 
 set o' naturals — for if I wasna to mak ilka thing as big 
 as a "barn door" ye wadna see it at a — I say it's just 
 possible I may have slippit into a kind o' habit o' magni- 
 fying things ; and it's a bad habit to get into, Sandy, and 
 it's a waur thing to be accused o' it : and therefore, Sandy 
 I call upon you, if ever you should hear me say another 
 word out o' joint, to pull me up then and there. 
 
 Losh, sir, but how could I pull ye up i' the kirk? 
 
 Ye could make some kind o' noise. 
 
 A noise i' the kirk? 
 
 Ay ! y'ere sitting down beneath me, so ye might put up 
 yer head and give a bit whustle {whistles) like that. 
 


## p. (#449) ################################################

PROSE SELECTIONS. 357 
 
 A whustle ? What ! whustle i' the Lord's hoose o' the 
 Lord's day? 
 
 Ye needna make such a disturbance about it. I dinna 
 want ye to frighten the folk, but just a wee whustle, that 
 naebody but our two selves could hear. 
 
 But would it no be an awful sin ? 
 
 Hoots man, does na the wind whustle on the Sawbath ? 
 
 Weel, if there's no harm in't I'll do my best. 
 
 So it was agreed between the two that the first word of 
 exaggeration from the pulpit was to elicit the signal from 
 the desk below. 
 
 Next Sunday came; and had the minister only stuck 
 to his sermon he would have had the laugh on Sandy. 
 But it was his habit always before the sermon to read a 
 chapter from the Bible, adding such remarks and expla- 
 nations as he thought necessary. He generally selected 
 such chapters as contained a number of ticklish points so 
 that his marvelous powers of eloocidation might be 
 brought into play. On this occasion he had chosen one 
 that fairly bristled with difficulties. It was the chapter 
 describing Samson as catching three hundred foxes, tying 
 them tail to tail, setting fire brands in their midst and 
 starting them among the standing corn of the Philistines. 
 As he closed the description he shut the book and com- 
 menced to eloocidate as follows : 
 
 "My dear freends, I dare say you have been wondering 
 in your minds how it was possible that Samson could 
 catch three hundred foxes. You or me couldna catch 
 one fox, let alone three hundred — ^the beasts run so fast. 
 But lo! and behold! here we have one single man 'all by,

 himself, catching three hundred of them ! Now, how did 
 he do it? That's the pint; and at first sight it looks 
 a very ticklish pint; but it's not so ticklish as it looks, 
 my freends ; and if you give me your undivided attention 
 for a few minutes, I'll clear away the whole difficulty and 
 make what now seems dark and incomprehensible to your 
 uninstructed minds, as clear as the sun in its noonday 
 meridian. 
 
 "Well, then, we are told in the Scriptures that Samson 
 was the strongest man that ever lived ; and, furthermore, 
 we are told in the chapter next after the one we have 
 been reading, that he was a very polite man ; for when 
 he was at the house of Dagon he bowed with all his might, 
 and if some as you, my freends, would only bow with 
 half your might it would be better for you. But, al- 
 though we are told all this, we are not told that he was a 
 great runner. But if he catched three hundred foxes, 
 he must have been a great runner. But, my dear freends, 
 here's the eloocidation o' the matter. Ye'll please bear 
 this in mind, that although we are not told he was the 
 greatest runner, still we're not told he was'na, and, there- 
 fore, I contend that we have a perfect right to assume, 
 by all the logic and scientific history, that he was the 
 fastest runner that ever was born ; and this was how he 
 catched the three hundred foxes. 
 
 "But after we get rid of this difficulty, my freends, 
 another crops up— how in the world did he tie their tails 
 together? We all know that foxes' tails are not long 
 enough for this operation ; how, then, was Samson able 
 to tie them all? Ah! that's the question; and it's the 
 most ticklish pint you or me has ever had to eloocidatc.

 Common-sense is no good till't; no more is Latin, or 
 Greek, or Hebrew either; no more is logic or moral 
 philosophy; and I've studied them all. But it's a great 
 thing for poor, ignorant folk, like you, that there's been 
 great and learned men, like myself ye ken, that instead 
 of going into the kirk, like me, or into pheesic, like the 
 doctor, or into law, like the lawyer, they have gone trav- 
 eling into foreign parts. 
 
 "Now, among other places, some of these learned men 
 have traveled into Canaan, some into Palestine, and some 
 few into the Holy Land ; and these last-mentioned trav- 
 elers tell us that in these oriental climes the foxes there 
 are a different breed o' cattle altogether from our foxes 
 — ^that they're great big beasts; and what's the more 
 astonishing about them, and what helps explain the 
 wonderful feat of Samson, is that they have all got most 
 extraordinary long tails; in fact, these travelers tell us 
 that these foxes' tails are actually forty feet long {Sandy 
 whistles) ; at the same time I ought to mention that other 
 travelers, and later ones than the ones I've just been 
 speaking about, say that ';his statement is rather an 
 exaggeration on the whole and that there tails are never 
 more than twenty feet long. (Sandy whistles.) 
 
 "Before I leave this subject altogether, my friends, I 
 may just add that there's been a considerable diversity o' 
 opeenion about the length o' these animals' tails, so that 
 the question has come to be regarded as a 'sair pint.' 
 One man ye see says one thing and another another, and 
 I've spent a good lot o' learned research in the matter 
 myself, and after examining one authority and another, 
 and putting one against the other, I have come to the

 conclusion that these foxes' tails on an average are sel- 
 dom more than ten feet long! (Sandy whistles.)

 DEATH-BED OF BENEDICT ARNOLD. 
 
 GEORGE LIPPAKD. 
 
 Fifty years ago, in a rude garret, near the loneliest sub- 
 urbs of the city of London, lay a dying man. He was but 
 half dressed ; though his legs were concealed in long mili- 
 tary boots.. An aged minister stood beside the rough 
 couch. The form was that of a strong man grown old 
 through care more than age. There was a face that you 
 might look upon but once, and yet wear it in your mem- 
 ory forever. 
 
 Let us bend over the bed, and look upon that face. A 
 bold forehead seamed by one deep wrinkle visible between 
 the brows — long locks of dark hair, sprinkled with gray ; 
 lips firmly set, yet quivering, as though they had a life 
 separate from the life of the man; and then, two large 
 eyes — ^vivid, burning, unnatural in their steady glare. 
 Ay, there was something terrible in that face — something: 
 so full of unnatural loneliness — unspeakable despair, that 
 the aged minister started back in horror. But look ! those 
 strong arms are clutching at the vacant air; the death- 
 sweat stands in drops on that bold brow — the man is 
 dying. Throb — throb — throb— beats the death-watch in

 tilt shattered wall. "Would you die in the faith of the 
 Christian ?' faltered the preacher, as he knelt there on the 
 damp floor. 
 
 The white lips of the death-stricken man trembled, but 
 made no sound. Then, with the strong agony of death 
 upon him, he rose into a sitting posture. For the first 
 time he spoke. "Christian !" he echoed in that deep tone 
 which thrilled the preacher to the heart. "Will that faith 
 give me back my honor? Come with me, old man, come 
 with me, far over the waters. Ha ! we are there ! This 
 is my native town. Yonder is the church in which I 
 knelt in my childhood; yonder the green on which I 
 sported when a boy. But another flag waves yonder, in 
 place of the flag that waved when I was a child. 
 
 "And listen, old man, were I to pass along the streets, 
 as I passed when but a child, the very babes in their 
 cradles would raise their tiny hands and curse me ! The 
 graves in yonder churchyard would shrink from my foot- 
 steps; and yonder flag would rain a baptism of blood 
 upon my head !" 
 
 That was an awful death-bed. The minister had 
 watched "the last night" with a hundred convicts in their 
 cells, but ha.d never beheld a scene so terrible as this. 
 Suddenly the dying man arose; he tottered along the 
 floor. With those white fingers, whose nails were blue 
 with the death-chill, he threw open a valise. He drew 
 from thence a faded coat of blue, faced with silver, and 
 the wreck of a battle-flag. 
 
 "Look ye, priest! this faded coat is spotted with my 
 blood !" he cried, as old memories seemed stirring in his 
 heart. "This coat I wore, when I first heard the news of

 Lexington ; this coat I wore when I planted the banner ^i 
 the stars on Ticonderoga ! that bullet-hole was pierced in 
 the fight of Quebec ; and now, I am a — ^let me whisper it 
 in your earl" He hissed that single burning, word into 
 the minister's ear. "Now help me, priest! help me to 
 put on this coat of blue; for you see" — and a ghastly 
 smile came over his face — "there is no one here to wipe 
 the cold drops from my brow ; no wife ; no child. I must 
 meet Death alone ; but I will meet him, as I have met him 
 in battle, without a fear 1" 
 
 And, while he stood arraying his limbs in that worm- 
 eaten coat of blue and silver, the good minister spoke to 
 him of faith in Jesus. Yes, of that great faith, which 
 pierces the clouds of human guilt, and rolls them back 
 from the face of God. "Faith \" echoed that strange man, 
 who stood there, erect, with the death-chill on his brow. 
 "Faith 1 Can it give me back my honor ? Look, yc, priest, 
 there over the waves, sits George Washington, telling to 
 his comrades the pleasant story of the eight year war; 
 there, in his royal halls, sits George of England, bewail- 
 ing, in his idiotic voice, the loss of his colonies! And 
 here am I! — I who was the first to raise the flag of 
 freedom, the first to strike a blow against that king — ^here 
 am I, dying ! oh, dying like a dog I" 
 
 The awe-stricken preacher started back from the look 
 of the dying man, while throb— throb — ^throb — ^beats the 
 death-watch, in the shattered wall. "Hush ! silence along 
 the lines there!" he muttered in that wild, absent tone, 
 as though speaking to the dead; "silence along the 
 lines! not a word — not a word, on peril of your lives! 
 Hark you, Montgomery ! we will meet in the center of the

 town: — we will meet there in victory, or die! — Hist! 
 silence, my men — ^not a whisper, as we move up those 
 steep rocks ! Now on, my boys — now on ! Men of the 
 wilderness, we will gain the town! Now up with the 
 banner of the stars — ^up with the flag of freedom, though 
 the night is dark, and the snow falls! Now! now, one 
 more blow, and Quebec is ours !" 
 
 And look ! his eye grows glassy. With that word on 
 his lips, he stands there — ah! what a hideous picture of 
 despair: erect, livid, ghastly; there for a moment, and 
 then he falls ! — ^he is dead ! Ah, look at that proud form, 
 thrown cold and stiff upon the damp floor. In that glassy 
 eye there lingers, even yet, a horrible energy — a sublimity 
 of despair. Who is this strange man lying there alone, 
 in this rude garret: this man, who, in all his crimes, 
 still treasured up in that blue uniform, that faded flag? 
 Who is this being of horrible remorse — this man, whose 
 memories seem to link something with heaven, and more 
 with hell? 
 
 Let us look at that parchment and flag. The aged 
 minister unrolls that faded flag ; it is a blue banner gleam- 
 ing with thirteen stars. He unrolls that parchment : it is 
 a colonel's commission in the Continental army addressed 
 to Benedict Arnold! And there, in that rude hut, 
 while the death-watch throbbed like a heart in the shat- 
 tered wall : there, unknown, unwept, in all the bitterness 
 of desolation, lay the corse of the patriot and the traitor. 
 
 Oh that our own true Washington had been there, to 
 sever that good right arm from the corse ; and, while the 
 dishonored body rotted into dust, to bring home that 
 noble armj and embalm it among the holiest memories

 of the past. For that right arm struck many a galfent 
 blow for freedom: yonder at Ticonderoga, at Quebec, 
 Champlain, and Saratoga — that arm, yonder, beneath the 
 snow white mountains, in the deep silence of the river 
 of the dead, first raised into light the Banner of the 
 Stars. — From- Brown's Elocution. 
 
 THE BLACK HORSE AND HIS RIDER. 
 
 CHARLES SHEPPARD. 
 
 It was the 7th of October, 1777. Horatio Gates stood 
 before his tent, gazing steadfastly upon the two armies, 
 now arrayed in order of battle. It was a clear, bracing 
 day, mellow with the richness of Autumn. The sky was 
 cloudless; the foliage of the woods scarce tinged with 
 purple and gold ; the Buckwheat in yonder fields frostened 
 into snowy ripeness. But the tread of legions shook the 
 ground; from every bush shot the glimmer of the rifle 
 barrel; on every hill-side blazed the sharpened bayonet. 
 Gates was sad and thoughtful, as he watched the evolu- 
 tions of the two armies. But all at once a smoke arose, 
 a thunder shook the ground, and a chorus of shouts and 
 groans yelled along the darkened air. The play of 
 death had begun. The two flags, this of the stars, that 
 of the red cross, tossed amid the smoke of battle, while 
 the sky was clouded with leaden folds, and the earth 
 throbbed with the pulsations of a mighty heart. 
 
 Suddenly Gates and his olificers were startled. Along 
 the height on which they stood came a rider, upon a black

 horse, rushing toward the distant battle. There was 
 something in the appearance of this horse and his rider 
 that struck them with surprise. Look, he draws his 
 sword, the sharp blade quivers through the air — he points 
 to the distant battle, and lo! he is gone; gone through 
 those clouds, while his shout echoes over the plains. 
 Wherever the fight is thickest, there, through intervals 
 of cannon smoke, you may see riding madly forward the 
 strange soldier, mounted on his steed, black as death. 
 Look at him, as with face red with , British blood he 
 waves his sword and shouts to his legions! Now you 
 may see him fighting in that cannon's glare, and the next 
 moment he is away off yonder, leading the forlorn hope 
 up that steep cliff. Is it not a magnificent sight, to see 
 that strange soldier and that noble black horse dashing, 
 like a meteor, down the long columns of battle ? Let us 
 look for a moment into those clouds of battle. Over this 
 thick hedge bursts a band of American militia-men, their 
 rude farmer coats stained with blood, while, scattering 
 their arms by the way, they flee before that company of 
 red-coat hirelings, who come rushing forward, their solid 
 front of bayonets gleaming in the battle light. In this 
 moment of their flight a horse comes crashing over the 
 plains. The unknown rider reins his steed back on his 
 haunches, right in the path of the broad-shouldered 
 militia-men. 
 
 "Now, cowards : Advance another step, and I'll strike 
 you to the heart !" shouts the unknown, extending a pistol 
 in either hand. "What! Are you Americans, men, and 
 fly before British soldiers? Back again, and face them 
 once more, or I myself will ride you down !"

 This appeal was not without its effect. Their leader 
 turns, his comrades, as if by one impulse, follow his 
 example. In one line, but thirty men in all, they confront 
 thirty sharp bayonets. The British advance. "Now, 
 upon the rebels! charge!" shouts the red-coat officer. 
 They spring forward at the same bound. Look! their 
 bayonets almost touch the muzzles of their rifles. At 
 this moment the voice of the unknown rider was heard: 
 "Now let them have it! Fire!" A sound is heard, a 
 smoke is seen, twenty Britons are down, some writhing 
 in death, some crawling along the soil, and some speech- 
 less as stone. The remaining ten start back. "Club your 
 rifles and charge them home !" shouts the unknown. The 
 black horse springs forward, followed by the militia- 
 men. Then a confused conflict — a cry for quarter, and 
 a vision of twenty farmers grouped around the rider of 
 the black horse, greeting him with cheers. Thus it was 
 all the day long. Wherever that black horse and his 
 rider went, there followed victory. At last, toward the 
 setting of the sun, the crisis of the conflict came. That 
 fortress yonder, on Bemus' Heights, must be won, or the 
 American cause is lost! That cliff is too steep — ^there 
 death is too certain. The officers cannot persuade the 
 men to advance. The Americans have lost the field. 
 Even Morgan, that iron man among iron men, leans on 
 his rifle and despairs of the field. But look yonder : In this 
 moment, when all is dismay and horror, here, crashing on, 
 comes the black horse and rider. That rider bends upon 
 his steed, his frenzied face covered with sweat, and dust, 
 and blood; he lays his hand upoa that bold rifleman's 
 shoulder, and as though living fire had been poured into

 hiiji veins, he seizes his rifle and starts toward the rock. 
 And now look : now hold your breath, as that black steed 
 cr?shes up that steep cliff. That steed quivers; he tot- 
 ters ; he falls ; no ! no ! Still on, still up the cliff, still on 
 toward the fortress. The rider turns his face and shouts, 
 "Come on, men of Quebec! Come on!" That call is 
 needless. Already the bold riflemen are on the rock. Now, 
 British cannon, pour your fires, and lay your dead in tens 
 and twenties on the rock. Now, red-coat hirelings, shout 
 your battle-cry, if you can ; for look : there, in the gates 
 of the fortress, as the smoke clears away, stands the black 
 horse and his rider. That steed falls dead, pierced by 
 a hundred balls ; but his rider, as the British cry for quar- 
 ter, lifts up his voice, and shouts afar to Horatio Gates, 
 waiting yonder in his tent, "Saratoga is won!" As that 
 cry goes up to heaven he falls with his leg shattered by 
 a cannon ball. 
 
 Who was the rider of the black horse? Do you not 
 guess his name ? Then bend down and gaze on that shat- 
 tered limb, and you will see that it bears the mark of a 
 former wound. That wound was received in the storming 
 of Quebec. The rider of the black horse was Benedict 
 Arnoi,d. 
 
 VICTOR HUGO. 
 
 In 1817 a young boy received a mention at the French 
 Academy for the prize in poetry. Soumet said : "This 
 young boy has given new hopes to our literature." The 
 great Chateaubriand said : "This boy has writteti things 
 


## p. (#460) ################################################

 that no poet of the time could have written." But the 
 honors of the Academy and the praise of Soumet and 
 Chateaubriand, though they might have contented any 
 other boy in France, could not satisfy Victor Htigo's 
 ambition. He had marked out for himself a career more 
 glorious than Bossuets and more enduring than Vol- 
 taire's. 
 
 Poetry claimed his attention almost from childhood. 
 In it his political opinions found expression. These were 
 an echo of Voltaire's ; the throne without the altar. The 
 beautiful boy, wrapped up in his devotion to the royalism 
 of Voltaire, never dreamed that one day he should eman- 
 cipate fiction, revolutionize the drama, and fill France with 
 republican ideas destined to overthrow a throne and 
 dynasty. 
 
 At twenty-three, regenerated in religion and politics, 
 resolute in purpose and sanguine of success, Victor Hugo 
 began his great mission. He published his novel "Han 
 d'Islande," and French literature was liberated from the 
 thralldom of Aristotle. He wrote "Cromwell," and the 
 independence of the theater was achieved. "Marion de 
 Lorme" had only to appear, and royalty stood before the 
 world humiliated. The suppression of this play by the 
 government only rendered his next more popular. "Her- 
 nani" was the last of a series of steps up which France 
 was climbing to the revolution of '30. 
 
 In the events of '48 the dream of his lifetime was 
 almost realized. Out of the chaos and ruin of revolution 
 arose the Republic, grand and symmetrical. But this 
 could not long remain. Bonaparte had come from Swit- 
 zerland ; and what could withstand the magic of his name

 or the ascendency of his genius? The Eighteenth Bru- 
 maire repeats itself in the Second of December. The 
 nephew of the Corsican ascends the throne of the Empire, 
 and the barricade of the Faubourg St. Antoine becomes 
 for Hugo the "barricade of the exile." 
 
 Years rolled by. The "old man of Guernsey" had 
 almost relinquished his dream. Suddenly from his sea- 
 girt home he hears the tramp of Prussian soldiery, and 
 catches the gleam of French bayonets. Woerth, Beau- 
 mont, Gravelot and Sedan follow in quick, splendid suc- 
 cession. The fall of the shattered Empire snaps the bonds 
 of the exile ; and once more a freeman, Victor Hugo sets 
 his foot on the soil of republican France. 
 
 Whatever progress France has made is due to ideas 
 of which Victor Hugo was a brilliant advocate ; but his 
 name in the political history of his country is — ^Dreamer. 
 He believed in the Republic ; but it was an ideal Republic 
 — an impossible Republic, without ignorance, without 
 vice, universal in limit, unrestrained in liberty. 
 
 As a writer Victor Hugo has won his title to the 
 world's remembrance. He must ever stand among the 
 great poets and novelists of France. Though we may not 
 share his fancies, let us ever regard with gratitude him 
 whose trials and triumphs will live forever in Les Mis- 
 erables. 
 
 IMAGINATION, A MEANS OF NAPOLEON'S 
 SUCCESS. 
 
 There is a natural tendency among men, when they 
 meet the word "imagination," to give to it a meaning 
 


## p. (#462) ################################################

 which places it among the gew-gaws of the intellect. But 
 this is far from its true meaning. It is not an article for 
 dreaming, fanciful men only to deal with. It is as much 
 the property of men of the world as of men of letters ; 
 as much the property of the soldier as of the poet. It 
 is the motive power of the whole machinery of the mind ; 
 the origin of our endeavors; the prompter of our suc- 
 cess. 
 
 History teems with instances of imaginatioft deter- 
 mining the success of great men ; but among them all is 
 no better illustration of it than the case of Napoleon. He 
 was accustomed, before his battles, to appeal to the imagi- 
 nation of his soldiers. On the eve of one of his battles, 
 under the shadow of the Pyramids, he said : "Soldiers, 
 from yonder pile thirty centuries look down upon you !" 
 No more was needed. The imagination of the French 
 soldiers saw the spirits of the great Egyptian dead encir- 
 cling the summits of the gigantic monuments of their 
 skill. The French soldier was fighting on the battle- 
 field of nations who, centuries before, had passed away; 
 and, if fall he must, the plains of the Pharaohs should be 
 his grave, and Egypt's pyramids his monument. His 
 imagination was the source of his endeavors ; and its in- 
 fluence upon the imagination of others promoted his 
 progress and insured his success. He stepped upon the 
 stage of action when the world was waiting breathlessly 
 for a prominent actor in the tragedy then being enacted 
 in France. Springing from lowly origin, his rapid rise 
 and continued success dazzled the imagination of both 
 actor and spectators. His mind, strong and active, was 
 the basis. But, as in an old cathedral we have seen the

 sunligfit pouring through stained windows, and tinting 
 •with a thousand hues the space within, so imagination 
 penetrated and colored all the deeds of Napoleon. Nature 
 made him a poet ; but he preferred to act rather than to 
 write a poem. His life was a grand epic ; and its music, 
 slow and solenuij was chanted in the roar and din of 
 battle in strains above the praise of critics. From Auster- 
 litz, Jena, Lody and Wagram the whole world heard; 
 and when its mournful cadence marked the slow falling 
 of the curtain upon the closing scene at Waterloo, the 
 nations shuddered. 
 
 'Twas then the "harp the monarch minstrel swept" 
 was hushed. Its chords had broken one by one. That 
 harp, whose tumultuous strains had charmed the world, 
 and brought kings trembling at his feet, was shattered. 
 Upon that field the brightest light of France went out; 
 earth's mightiest poet fell. 
 
 THE POWER OF WORDS. 
 
 Words are most effective when arranged in that order 
 which is called style. The great secret of a good style, we 
 are told, is to have proper words in proper places. To 
 marshal one's verbal battalions in such order that they 
 must bear at once upon all quarters of a subject is cer- 
 tanily a great art. This is done in different ways. Swift. 
 Temple, Addison, Hume, Gibbon, Johnson, Burke, are 
 all great generals in the discipline of their verbal armies, 
 and the conduct of their paper wars. Each has a system

 of tactics of his own^ and excels in the use of some par- 
 ticular weapon. 
 
 The tread of Johnson's style is heavy and sonorous, 
 resembling that of an elephant or a mail-clad warrior. He 
 is fond of leveling an obstacle by a polysyllabic battering- 
 ram. Burke's words are continually practicing the broad- 
 sword exercise, and sweeping down adversaries with 
 every stroke. Arbuthnot "plays his weapons like a tongue 
 of flame." Addison draws up his light infantry in orderly 
 array, and marches through sentence after sentence with- 
 out having his ranks disordered or his line broken. 
 
 Luther is different. His words are "half battle"; "his 
 smiting idiomatic phrases seem to cleave into the very 
 secret of the matter." Gibbon's legions are heavily armed, 
 and march with precision and dignity to the music of 
 their own tramp. They are splendidly equipped, but a 
 nice eye can discern a little rust beneath their fine apparel, 
 and there are suttlers in his camp who lie, cog, and talk 
 gross obscenity. Macaulay, brisk, lively, keen, and ener- 
 getic, runs his thoughts rapidly through his sentence, and 
 kicks out of the way every word which obstructs his 
 passage. He reins in his steed only when he has reached 
 his goal, and then does it with such celerity that he is 
 nearly thrown backward by the suddenness of his stop- 
 page. 
 
 Gifford's words are moss-troopers, that waylay inno- 
 cent travelers and murder them for hire. Jeffrey is a 
 fine "lance," with a sort of Arab swiftness in his move- 
 ment, and runs an iron-clad horseman through the eye 
 before he has had time to close his helmet. John Wilson's 
 camp is a disorganized mass, who might do effectual

 service under better discipline, but who under his lead 
 are suffered to carry on a rambling and predatory war- 
 fare, and disgrace their general by flagitious excesses. 
 Sometimes they steal, sometimes swear, sometimes drink, 
 and sometimes pray. 
 
 Swift's words are porcupine's quills, which he throws 
 with unerring aim at whoever approaches his lair. All 
 of Ebenezer Elliot's words are gifted with huge fists to 
 pummel and bruise. Chatham and Mirabeau throw hot 
 shot into their opponents' magazines. Talfourd's forces 
 are orderly and disciplined, and march to the music of 
 the Dorian flute; those of Keats keep time to the tones 
 of the pipe of Plioebus ; and the hard, harshfeatured bat- 
 talions of Maginn are always preceded by a brass band. 
 Hallam's word-infantry can do much execution, when 
 they are not in each other's way. Pope's phrases are 
 either daggers or rapiers. 
 
 Willis' words are often tipsy with the champagne of 
 the fancy, but even when they reel and stagger, they keep 
 the line of grace and beauty, and though scattered at first 
 by a fierce onset from graver cohorts, soon reunite without 
 wound or loss. John Neal's forces are multitudinous, and 
 fire briskly at everything. They occupy all the provinces 
 of letters, and are nearly useless from being spread over 
 too much ground. Everett's weapons are ever kept in 
 good order, and shine well in the sun, but they are little 
 calculated for warfare, and rarely kill when they strike. 
 Webster's words are thunderbolts, which sometimes miss 
 -the Titans at whom they are hurled, but always leave 
 enduring marks when they strike. 
 
 Hazlitt's verbal army is sometimes drunk and surly.

 sometimes foaming with passion, sometimes cool and ma- 
 lignant; but drunk or sober, are ever dangerous to cope 
 with. Some of Tom Moore's words are shining dirt, 
 which he flings with excellent aim. This list might be 
 indefinitely extended, and arranged with more regard to 
 merit and chronology. My own words, in this connection, 
 might be compared to ragged, undisciplined militia, which 
 could be easily routed by a charge of horse, and which are 
 apt to fire into each other's faces. — E. P. Whipple, 
 
 SOCIETY THE GREAT EDUCATOR. 
 
 Society is the great educator. More than universities, 
 more than schools, more than books, society educates. 
 Nature is the schoolhouse, and many lessons are written 
 upon its walls ; but man is the effective teacher. Parents, 
 relatives, friends, associates ; social manner, maxims, mor- 
 als, worships, the daily example, the fireside conversa- 
 tion, the casual interview, the spirit that breathes through 
 the whole atmosphere of life — these are the powers .ind 
 influences that train the mass of mankind. Even books, 
 which are daily assuming a larger place in human train- 
 ing, are but the influence of man on man. 
 
 It is evident that one of the leading and ordained 
 means by which men are raised in the scale of knowledge 
 and virtue is the conversation, example, influence of men 
 superior to themselves. It seems, if one may say so, to 
 be the purpose, the intent, the effort of nature — of Provi- 
 idence, to bring men together, and to bring them together,

 for the most part, in relations of discipleship and 
 teaching. 
 
 The social nature, first, draws them to intercourse. 
 Perpetual solitariness is intolerable. But then, much of 
 their intercourse is on terms of inequality. Equals in 
 age, people in society, seldom meet, but one is able to 
 teach or tell something, and the other is desirous to learn 
 it. The lower are strongly drawn to the higher. Chil- 
 dren are not content to be always by themselves ; curiosity, 
 reverence, filial affection draw them to their superiors. 
 In the whole business of life — ^tillage, mechanism, manu- 
 facture, merchandise — a younger generation is connected 
 with an elder, to be taught by it. 
 
 Barbarous tribes go on forever in their barbarism, till 
 they are brought into the presence of superior culture. 
 The Chinese exclusion has kept that people stationary, 
 though civilization has been knocking at their gates for 
 more than three centuries. And it is better — I speak of 
 mere results, not principles — ^that the way for light should 
 be opened into that country by cannon balls, or the rend- 
 ing asunder of the empire, than never to be opened. 
 
 But such a fixed barrier to civilization is a solitary 
 phenomenon in history. Nations, the barbarous and civil- 
 ized, by some means or other, in the everlasting ferment 
 of human interests and passions, and thrown into com- 
 munication and iterfusion — if by no better means, by war, 
 by subjugation, by capture: for Providence, if one may 
 say so, will have them come together. Human injustice 
 and cruelty are not to be abetted in this matter. There 
 are better ways, which Christian civilization ought to 
 learn — ^travel, trade, missions of light and mercy; but some

 way, the nations must mingle together, or the ignorant 
 will never be enlightened, the savage never civilized. 
 
 Where are the ruder peasantry of Europe now resort- 
 ing for work and for subsistence? To America. Many 
 an enlightened man, building a railroad, or improving 
 his estate; many a refined woman in her household, is 
 made their teacher — little suspecting the office, perhaps. 
 It were fortunate, I think, for both parties, if they did ; 
 it might make the relation more kindly and holy ; but any 
 way, the work will be done. How fine and delicate and 
 penetrating is this power of man to influence his kind! 
 A word, a tone, a look — ^nothing goes to the depths of 
 the soul like that. The dexterous hands, and the em- 
 bracing arms, the commanding eye and the persuasive 
 lips and the stately presence are fitted for nothing more 
 remarkable than to teach. 
 
 Society has thrones for the good and noble, and purple 
 and gold are but rags and dust in the comparison. Society 
 has prisons and penitentiaries for the base and bad, and 
 stone walls and silent cells are not so cold and death- 
 like. — Orville Dewey. 
 
 THE SCHOOLMASTER AND THE CONQUEROR, 
 
 There is nothing which the adversaries of improve- 
 ment are more wont to make themselves merry with than 
 what is termed the "march of intellect" ; and here I will 
 confess that I think, as far as the phrase goes, they are 
 in the right. It is a very absurd, because a very incorrect

 expression. It is little calculated to describe the operation 
 in question. It does not picture an image at all resembling 
 the proceedings of the true friends of mankind. It much 
 more resembles the progress of the enemy to all improve- 
 ment. The conqueror moves in a march. He stalks on- 
 ward with the "pride, pomp, and circumstance of war" — 
 banners flying — shouts rending the air — ^guns thunder- 
 ing — and martial music pealing, to drown the shrieks of 
 the wounded and the lamentations for the slain. 
 
 Not thus the schoolmaster, in his pleasant vocation. 
 He meditates and prepares in secret the plans which are 
 to bless mankind ; he slowly gathers round him those who 
 are to further his execution — ^he quietly, though firmly, 
 advances in his hiimble path, laboring steadily, but calmly, 
 till he has opened to the light all the recesses of ignorance, 
 and tora up by the roots the weeds of vice. His is a 
 progress not to be compared with anything like a march ; 
 but it leads to a far more brilliant triumph, and to laurels 
 more imperishable than the destroyer of his species, the 
 scourge of the world, ever won. 
 
 Such men — men deserving the glorious title of Teach- 
 ers of Mankind — I have found, laboring conscientiously, 
 though, perhaps, obscurely, in their blessed vocation, 
 wherever I have gone. I have found them, and shaired 
 their fellowship, among the daring, the ambitious, the 
 ardent, the indomitably active French ; I have found them 
 among the persevering, resolute, industrious Swiss; I 
 have found them among the laborious, the warm-hearted, 
 the enthusiastic Germans ; I have found them among the

 high-minded, but enslaved, Italians, and in our own coun- 
 try, God be thanked, their number everywhere abound 
 and are every day increasing. 
 
 Their calling is high and holy ; their fame is the prop- 
 erty of nations; their renown will fill the earth in after 
 ages, in proportion as it sounds not far off in their own 
 times. Each one of those great teachers of the world, 
 possessing his soul in peace, performs his appointed 
 course ; awaits in patience the fulfillment of the promises ; 
 and, resting from his labors, bequeaths his memory to the 
 generation whom his works have blessed, and sleeps under 
 the humble but not inglorious epitaph, commemorating 
 "one in whom mankind lost a friend, and no man got rid 
 of an enemy." — H. Brougham.

 THE CODFISH. 
 
 JOSH BILLINGS. 
 
 The codfish iz a child ov the oshun. This ackounts 
 for their being so salt. 
 
 They are caught with a hook and line, and bite a steel 
 trap, and hang on like a poor relation. 
 
 They are good eating for a wet day ; they are better 
 than an umbreller to keep a man dry. 
 
 Dried codfish iz one ov the luxurys of life, but codfish 
 three times a day would weaken mi confidence in them. 
 
 Codfish never venture in fresh water ; they would soon 
 spile if they did. 
 
 I never hav been codfishing miself^ but think I should 
 like it better than fishing for frogs. 
 
 I think i could ketch frogs well enuff, but I should 
 insist upon their taking themselfs off from the hook.

 I Had rather take a boss bumble bee in mi hand than a 
 live frog, not bekause i am afraid the frog would bite, 
 but i am afraid ov their kicking. 
 
 Sum people ain't afraid to take ehnything with their 
 hands that they can reach, not even an eel, but if i should 
 ever git caught by an eel, if i couldn't settle with him, 
 right off, by giving him the hook and line, i would throw 
 the pole into the bargin and put for home. 
 
 The codfish iz sed tew be an aristokrat, and to keep 
 aloof from the other fish of his size in the sea, and claims 
 tew be a relation of the whales, but this looks to me 
 rather fishy. 
 
 I hav noticed that the codfish alwuz haz a stiff upper 
 lip, but I think this iz more owing tew the bone that iz 
 in him than it iz to his blood. 
 
 THE DESTINY OF THE ANGLO-SAXON. 
 
 FROM "our country." — ^REV. JOSIAH STRONG, D. D. 
 
 The Anglo-Saxon is to exercise the commanding in- 
 fluence in the world's future ; but the exact nature of that 
 influence is, as yet, undetermined. How far his civiliza- 
 tion will be materialistic and atheistic, and how long it 
 will take thoroughly to Christianize and sweeten it, how 
 rapidly he will hasten the coming of the kingdom wl'erein 
 dwelleth righteousness, or how many ages he may retard 
 it, is still uncertain ; but it is now being swiftly determined. 
 Let us weld together in a chain the various links of cur 
 logic which we have endeavored to forge. Is it manifest

 that the Anglo-Saxon holds in his hands the destinies 
 of mankind for ages to come? Is it evident tha; the 
 United States is to be the home of this race, the principal 
 seat of his power, the great center of his influence? Is 
 it true that the great West is to dominate the nation's 
 future? Has it been shown that this generation is to 
 determine the character, and hence the destiny, of the 
 West ? Then may God open the eyes of this generation ! 
 When Napoleon drew up his troops before the Mame- 
 lukes, under the shadow of the Pyramids, pointing to the 
 latter, he said to his soldiers: "Remember that from 
 yonder height forty centuries look down upon you." Men 
 of this generation, from the pyramid top of opportunity 
 on which God has set us, we look down on forty centu- 
 ries! We stretch our hand into the future with power to 
 mold the destinies of unborn millions. 
 
 "We are living, we are dwelling, 
 
 In a grand and awful time, 
 In an age on ages telling — 
 
 To be living is sublime I" 
 
 Notwithstanding the great perils which threaten it, I 
 cannot think our civilization will perish ; but I believe it 
 is fully in the hands of the Christians of the United 
 States, during the next fifteen or twenty years, to hasten 
 or retard the coming of Christ's kingdom in the world 
 by hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of years. We of this 
 generation and nation occupy the Gibraltar of the ages 
 which commands the world's future.

 THE PRESERVATION OF AMERICA. 
 
 HENRY AKMITT BROWN. 
 
 [Peroration from the oration delivered upon the occasion of 
 the Centennial Anniversary of the meeting of the first Colonial 
 Congress in Carpenter's Hall, Philadelphia.] f 
 
 The conditions of life are always changing, and the 
 experience of the fathers is rarely the experience of the 
 sons. The temptations which are trying us are not 
 the temptations which beset their footsteps, nor the dan- 
 gers which threaten our pathway the dangers which sur- 
 round them. These men were few in number; we are 
 many. They were poor, but we are rich. They were 
 weak, but we are strong. What is it, countrymen, that 
 we need to-day? Wealth? Behold it in your hands. 
 Power? God hath given it you. Liberty? It is your 
 birthright. Peace? It dwells amongst you. You have 
 a Government founded in the heart of men, built by the 
 people for the common good. You have a land flowing 
 with milk and honey ; your homes are happy, your work- 
 shops busy, your barns are full. The school, the rail- 
 way, the telegraph, the printing press, have welded you 
 together into one. Descend those mines that honeycomb 
 the hills! Behold that commerce whitening every sea! 
 Stand by your gates and see that multitude pour through 
 them from the corners of the earth, grafting the qualities 
 of older stocks upon one stem; mingling the blood of 
 many races in a common stream, and swelling the rich 
 volume of our English speech with varied music from 
 an hundred tongues. You have a long and glorious his-

 tory, a past glittering with heroic deeds, an ancestry 
 full of lofty and unperishable examples. You have 
 passed through danger, endured privation, been ac- 
 quainted with sorrow, been tried by suffering. You have 
 journeyed in safety through the wilderness and crossed 
 in triumph the Red Sea of civil strife, and the foot of 
 Him who led you hath not faltered nor the light of His 
 countenance been turned away. 
 
 It is a question for us now, not of the founding of a 
 new government, but of the preservation of one already 
 old; not of the formation of an independent power, 
 but of the purification of a nation's life; not of the con- 
 quest of a foreign foe, but of the subjection of ourselves. 
 The capacity of man to rule himself is to be proven in 
 the days to come, not by the greatness of his wealth ; not 
 by his valor in the field ; not by the extent of his dominion, 
 nor by the splendor of his genius. The dangers of to-day 
 come from within. The worship of self, the love of 
 power, the lust for gold, the weakening of faith, the decay 
 of public virtue, the lack of private worth — ^these are the 
 perils which threaten our future; these are the enemies 
 we have to fear; these are the traitors which infest the 
 camp ; and the danger was far less when Cataline knocked 
 with his army at the gates of Rome, than when he sat 
 smiling in the Senate House. We see them daily face to 
 face ; in the walk of virtue ; in the road to wealth ; in the 
 path to honor; on the way to happiness. There is no 
 peace between them and our safety. Nor can we avoid 
 them and turn back. It is not enough to rest upon the 
 past. No man or nation can stand still. We must mount

 It is the Eternal Law — we cannot change it.

 The century that is opening is all our own. The years 
 that lie before us are a virgin page. We can inscribe 
 them as we will. The future of our country rests upon 
 us; the happiness and posterity depends upon us. The 
 fate of humanity may be in our hands. That pleading 
 voice, choked with the sobs of ages, which has so often 
 spoken to deaf ears, is lifted up to us. It asks us to be 
 brave, benevolent, consistent, true to the teachings of our 
 history, proving "divine descent by worth divine." It 
 asks us to be virtuous — ^building up public virtue by 
 private worth ; seeking that righteousness which exalteth 
 nations. It asks us to be patriotic — ^loving our country 
 before all other things ; her happiness our happiness, her 
 honor ours, her fame our own. It asks us, in the name 
 of justice, in the name of charity, in the name of freedom, 
 in the name of God. 
 
 My countrymen : this anniversary has gone by forever, 
 and my task is done. While I have spoken, the hour 
 has passed from us : the hand has moved upon the dial, 
 and the old century is dead. The American Union hath 
 endured an hundred years! Here, on this threshold of 
 the future, the voice of humanity shall not plead to us 
 in vain. There shall be darkness in the days to come; 
 danger for our courage ; temptation for our virtue ; doubt 
 for our faith; suffering for our fortitude. A thousand 
 shall fall before us, and tens of thousands at our right 
 hand. The years shall pass beneath our feet, and century 
 follow century in quick succession. The generations of

 men shall come and go ; the greatness of yesterday shall 
 be forgotten; to-day and the glories of this noon shall 
 vanish before to-morrow's sun; but America shall not 
 perish, but endure while the spirit of our fathers animates 
 their sons. 
 
 AMONG THE FREE LOVERS. 
 
 Some years ago I pitched my tent and unfurled my 
 banner to the breeze in Berlin Hites, Ohio. I had hearn 
 that Berlin Hites was ockepied by the extensive seek 
 called Free Lovers, who believed in affinertys and sich, 
 goin back on their domestic ties without no hesitation 
 whatsomever. They was likewise spirit rappers and high 
 presher reformers on gineral principles. If I can improve 
 these 'ere misguided peple by showin them my unparal- 
 leled show at the usual low price of admitants, me thunk, I 
 shall not hav lived in vane. But bitterly did I cuss the day 
 I ever sot foot in the retchid place. I sot up my tent 
 in a field near the Love Cure, as they called it, and bimeby 
 ihe free lovers began to congregate around the door. A 
 omreer set I have never sawn. The men's faces was all 
 covered with hare and they lookt half-starved to deth. 
 They didn't wear no weskuts for the purpose (as they 
 sed) of allowin the free air of heven to blow onto their 
 boozums. Their pockets was filled with tracks and pam<. 
 phlits, and they was bare-footed. They sed the Postles 
 didn't wear boots, and why should they ? That was there 
 stile of argyment. The wimin was wuss than the men. 
 They wore trowsis, short gownds, straw hats with green 
 ribbins, and all carried bloo cotton umbrellers.

 Presently a perfeckly orful lookin female presented her- 
 self at the door. Her gownd was skanderlusly short and 
 her trowsis was shameful to behold. 
 
 She eyed me over very sharp, and then starin back she 
 sed, in a wild voice : 
 
 "Ah, can it be?" 
 
 "Which?" sed I. 
 
 "Yes, 'tis troo, O 'tis troo!" 
 
 "15 cents, marm," I anserd. 
 
 She bust out cryin & sed : 
 
 "And so I hav found you at larst — at larst, O at larst !" 
 
 "Yes," I anserd, "you hav found me at larst, and 
 you would hav found me at fust, if you had cum 
 sooner." 
 
 She grabed me vilently by the coat collar, and bran- 
 dishin her umbreller wildly round, exclaimed : 
 
 "Air you a man?" 
 
 Sez I, "I think I air, but if you doubt it, you can 
 address Mrs. A. Ward, Baldinsville, Injianny, postage 
 pade, & she will probly giv you the desired informashun." 
 
 "Then thou ist what the cold world calls marrid ?" 
 
 "Madam, I istest!" 
 
 The exsentric female then clutched me franticly by 
 the arm and hollered : 
 
 "You air mine, O you air mine !" 
 
 "Scacely," I sed, endeverin to git loose from her. But 
 she clung to me and sed : 
 
 "You air my Affinerty !" 
 
 "What upon arth is that?" I shouted. 
 
 "Dost thou not know ?" 
 
 "No, Idostent!"

 "Listen man, & I'll tell ye!" sed the strange female; 
 "for years I have yearned for thee. I knowed thou wast

 — ^he's here — you air him — ^you air my Affinerty ! O 'tis

 "Yes," I anserd, "I think it is a darn site too mutch !" 
 
 "Hast thou not yearned for me?" she yelled, ringin 
 her hands like a female play acter. 
 
 "Not a yearn !" I bellered at the top of my voice, throw-

 AS THE PIGEON FLIES. 
 
 C. B. LEWIS. 
 
 Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z ! A monster of iron, steel and brass, stand- 
 ing on the slim iron rails which shoot away from the 
 station for half a mile and then lose themselves in a green 
 forest. 
 
 Puff-puff ! The driving wheels slowly turn, the mon- 
 ster breathes great clouds of steam and seems anxious 
 for the race. 
 
 A grizzly-haired engineer looks down from the cab win- 
 dow, while his fireman pulls back the iron door and heaves 
 in more wood — ^more breath and muscle for the grim 
 giant of the track. 
 
 The fire roars and crackles — ^the steam hisses and 
 growls ; every breath is drawn as fiercely as if the giant 
 was burning to revenge an insult. 
 
 Up — up— up ! The pointer on the steam-gauge moves 
 faster than the minute-hand on a clock. The breathing 
 becomes louder — ^the hiss rises to a scream — ^the iron rails 
 tremble and quiver. 
 
 "Climb up!" 
 
 It is going to be a race against time and the telegraph. 
 
 S-s-s-sh ! 
 
 The engineer rose up, looked ahead, glanced at the dial,

 and as his fingers clasped the throttle he asked the sta- 
 tion-agent : 
 
 "Are you sure that the track is clear?" 
 
 "All clear !" was the answer. 
 
 The throttle feels the pull, the giant utters a fierce 
 scream, and we are off, I on the fireman's seat, the fire- 
 man on the wood. The rails slide under us slowly — 
 faster, and the giant screams again and dashes into the 
 forest. 
 
 This isn't fast. The telegraph poles dance past as if not 
 over thirty feet apart, and the board fence seems to rise 
 from the ground, but it's only thirty-five miles an hour. 
 
 "Wood!" 
 
 The engineer takes his eye off the track and turns just 
 long enough to speak the word to his fireman. The iron 
 door swings back, and there is an awful rush and roar 
 of flame. The firebox appears full, but stick after stick 
 is dropped into the roaring pit until a quarter of a cord 
 has disappeared. 
 
 "This is forty miles an hour !" shouts the fireman in my 
 ear as he rubs the moisture from his heated face. 
 
 Yes, this is faster. The fence posts seem to leap from 
 the ground as we dash along, and the telegraph poles bend 
 and nod to us. A house — a field — a farm — we get but 
 one glance. A dozen houses — a hundred faces — ^that was 
 a station. We heard a yell from the crowd, but it had 
 scarcely reached us before it was drowned in the great 
 roar. 
 
 Nine miles in fourteen minutes — we've lost no time! 
 The engineer takes his eyes from the rail, makes a motion

 lo his fireman, and the sticks drop into the roaring flames 
 again to make new flames. 
 
 Seven miles of clear track now, .and the engineer smiles 
 a grim smile as he lets more steam into the giant's lungs. 
 
 Ah ! Not a mile a minute, but see how we shake from 
 side to side! 
 
 Is there a fence skirting the track? There is a dark 
 line keeping pace with us; it may be a fence. Where 
 are the telegraph poles? Were all those trees falling 
 toward the track as we dashed through the bit of forest ? 
 
 A yell — ^houses — faces — that was another station. 
 Word has gone down the line that a "wild" locomotive 
 is rushing a journalist across the country to catch the 
 lightning express on another road, and the people gather 
 to see us dash past. Seven miles in eight and a half 
 minutes, — ^that's better; but we must run faster! 
 
 The finger on the dial creeps slowly up — we want a re- 
 serve of steam for the last twelve of road, — the best track 
 of all. 
 
 The noise is deafening, the swaying and bumping is 
 terrible. I hang fast to the seat, clutch, cling, and yet it 
 seems as if I must be shaken to the floor. 
 
 Every moment there is a scream from the whistle; 
 every two or three minutes the engineer makes a gesture 
 which calls for the iron door to be opened and the roar- 
 ing, leaping flames to be fed anew. 
 
 Houses — faces — a yell! That was another station. 
 
 We made the last five miles in six minutes. Did you 
 
 ever ride a mile in one minute and twelve seconds ? But 
 
 we were to beat it. 
 
 Like a bird — like an arrow — like a bullet almost, we

 sped forward. Half a dozen men beside the track, — sec- 
 tion men with their hand-car. They lift their hats and 
 yell, but their voices do not reach us. We pass them 
 as lightning flashes through the heavens. That was a 
 farmhouse. We saw nothing but a white object — a. green 
 spot — two or three apple trees where there was a large 
 orchard. 
 
 Scream I 
 
 Hiss! 
 
 Roar! 
 
 Shake — quiver — Abound ! 
 
 We are going to stop, — going to halt for an instant 
 at a station to see if the track is clear for the rush, for 
 a mile a minute, and faster. 
 
 Scream ! Scream ! 
 
 The station is a mile ahead — it is beside us ! The fire- 
 man leaps down with his oil-can, the engineer enters the 
 telegraph office. Both are back in fifteen seconds. 
 
 Twelve and a half miles to go, twelve minutes in which 
 to make it. 
 
 "We can do it 1" said the engineer. "Hold fast now 1 
 We have been running — we are going to fly !" 
 
 Scream ! 
 
 "Good-bye!" 
 
 As a mad horse runs, as an arrow is sent, as a carrier- 
 pigeon flies! Yes, this is a mile a minute! Fences? 
 No, only a black line, hardly larger than my pencil! 
 Trees? No — only one tree, all merged into one single 
 tree, which was out of sight in a flash. Fields? Yes — 
 one broad field, broken for an instant by a highway,— 
 a gray thread lying on the ground!

 It is terrible! If we should leave the railsl If — ^but

 Eight miles in eight minutes, not a second more or

 tive ! Four and a half miles to go, four minutes to make 
 it ! \Ve must run a mile every fifty-three seconds.

 We are making time, but, Great heavens ! it is awful,

 One mile!

 I dare not open my eyes ! I would not look ahead on 
 the track for all the gold ever mined ! 
 
 Three miles! 
 
 Can I ever hear again? Will I ever get this deafening 
 roar out of my ears? Will the seconds ever go by? 
 
 Scream ! 
 
 The engineer shuts off steam, the fireman hurrahs. I 
 open my eyes — ^we are at the station ! The lightning ex- 
 press is not two seconds away!

 He did, but he carried three lives in the palm of the 
 hand that grasped the throttle.

 not of exajt ascertainmci. There are cycles, also, oi 
 the human understanding; or, at least, of opinions with 
 regard to the faculties and organism of the human in- 
 tellect. Locke was thought to have demonstrated, by un- 
 answerable argument, our entire lack of innate ideas, 
 thus demolishing the foundation upon which others had 
 erected so many and such various theories. But now 
 Kant has proven, by a logic far more subtle, and alto- 
 gether more conclusive, that the mind acts only in cer- 
 tain processes, or by means of certain categories, 
 which are the laws of its organization, and whence 
 result conceptions or ideas not derived from expe- 
 rience, or observation, or confidence in others. Plato 
 arrived at the same conclusion two thousand years ago, 
 although he supposed these conceptions or ideas to be 
 the reminiscences of a former and superior state of in- 
 tellectual existence. What has Kant accomplished, in all 
 his philosophy, except our remission to the speculations 
 of Plato, as enforced and illustrated by the wisdom of 
 revealed religion? And so, in the world of moral senti- 
 ment, there must be cycles of repetition and restoration, 
 but of restoration with new auspices, and informed by 
 principles of higher and pure significance. 
 
 The age of Chivalry was an age of moral uiiprove- 
 ment, an age of sympathy and generous enterprise, after 
 centuries of darkness, antagonism, and oppression. When 
 scholars, therefore, shall have become true to themselves, 
 true to mission of their faith and labors, as against the 
 overwhelming allurement of our time; shall have be- 
 come the actual prophets, and priests, and rulers, which 
 once they were, another age ©f Chivalry will arise and

 dawn upon, earth. It will restore us a Government pa- 
 ternal in character, and yet stripped of the usurpations 
 by which government is now rendered oppressive ; it will 
 restore us a Church of pristine authority and influence, 
 but authority and influence derived from purity in prac- 
 tice as well as in precept. And with these two elements 
 so long extinct or lost — leaving mankind to all the ter- 
 rors of tyranny and all the wiles of imposture — with a 
 Church and a Government reflecting the Divine concep- 
 tion of men's duties toward their Creator and toward 
 each other, will Human Society attain, at last, the sum- 
 mit of human perfection. Then will the original broth- 
 erhood and equality of our race be forever acknowl- 
 edged; then will there be work for all, and wages for 
 work, instead of the injustice, the crime, the misery, the 
 wasteful 'disorder which fill our hearts with so much de- 
 spondency and woe. This Chivalry is of magnificent de- 
 sign; since to the faith, to the hope, to the steadfastness 
 of our fathers, to their moral excellence and solid great- 
 ness, will thus be united the wondrous material achieve- 
 ments for which we have been so distinguished — a Chiv- 
 alry of splendors enhanced as well as rekindled, or splen- 
 dors essentially bright, and joyous, and immortal. 
 
 History tells us of republics full of promise and full 
 of glory like our own. Such were those which clustered

 These were all the children of Commerce, and followed 
 her along the borders of the sea. T'leir ships explored 
 the very ends of the world; laid the ladies under tribute; 
 and on this remote continent, also, planted colonies and 
 outposts of civilization. Alas ! those republics and free 
 states and cities have gone to their decay ; the armed le- 
 gions of Despotism tread upon their tombs, and scat- 
 ter even their sacred ashes to the wind. But may our 
 New World, which inherits their enterprise as well as 
 their liberty, rejuvenate the nations grown old in op- 
 pression and despair, and plant upon the Eastern Conti- 
 nent the germs of a Civilization nobler than has yet been 
 recognized — nobler than was ever sung by the poets or 
 foretold by oracles — a Civilization which shall raise up 
 Labor from its fallen estate, heal its infirmities, cover its 
 nakedness, and enthrone it with honor; as the rescued

 of our Savior, clothed, and in his right mind ! 
 
 LINCOLN'S GETTYSBURG ADDRESS. 
 
 [The following address was made by President Lincoln at the 
 dedication ^f Gettysburg Cemetery, November, 1864.] 
 
 Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought 
 forth upon this continent a new nation, conceived in lib- 
 erty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are 
 created equal. Now we are engaged in a great civil war, 
 testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived 
 and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a

 great battle-field of that war. We are met to dedicate 
 a portion of it as the final resting-place of those who 
 here gave their lives that that nation might live. 
 
 It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do 
 this. But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we can- 
 not consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave 
 men, living and dead, who struggled here, have conse- 
 crated it far above our power to add or detract. The 
 world will little note, nor long remember, what we say 
 here, but it can never forget what they did here. 
 
 It is for us, the living, ratlier to be dedicated here to 
 the unfinished work they have thus far so nobly carried 
 on. It is rather -for us to be here dedicated to the great 
 task remaining before us, that from these honored dead 
 we take increased devotion to the cause for which they 
 gave the .last full measure of devotion; that we here 
 highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain, 
 that the nation shall, under God, have a new birth of 
 freedom, and that the government of the people, by the 
 people, and for the people, shall not perish from the 
 earth.

 THE CURTAIN FIXTURE. 
 
 JAMES M. BAILEY. 
 
 The most exquisite article of domestic torture is the 
 modern window-curtain fixture. Years ago, before the 
 desecrating hand of inventive genius was reared, the 
 window covering was either a green shade hung by 
 hooks, or a simple piece of muslin nailed firmly to the 
 upper casing. Now the curtain is uniformly of cloth, 
 with a flat stick at the bottom and a round stick at the 
 top and a complicated lot of brass cogs and ratchets 
 at the ends. 
 
 It isn't much trouble to fit in the flat stick, because 
 that can be measured the right length on the floor, but 
 it is getting the proper length of the round sticks or 
 rollers that plays the mischief with a man's temper. 
 We are not quite certain but that it could be done 
 without much bluster were a man's wife to go oflf toi 
 the other end of town and stay there until the opera- 
 tion is over. She doesn't, however. She keeps right

 close to him, and enlivens the perfomance with such 
 observations as her judgment and experience teach her 
 are the best calculated to tuni his head. 
 
 The window-curtain is generally put up in the even- 
 ing. This is partly because the man has then more time, 
 and partly attributable to his desire to put off the evil 
 job until the last moment. The first thing to be done 
 is to separate the parcels and borrow a saw. Every 
 family keeps its own screw-driver (point broken) and 
 hammer (handle loose). 
 
 You instinctively saw the flat pieces first, becaUBe 
 that is the easiest, and afterward fit the rollers, which 
 is more difficult. Then the curtain is tacked to the 
 roller, which keeps turning over and breaking the tacks, 
 and catching your fingers under the hammer. This done, 
 you are ready to plant your feet on the best cane-bottom 
 chair in the house and put up the fixtures. Here your 
 wife says: "Well, if I ever saw anything quite so idi- 
 otic as ." You then get right down, when she starts 
 
 for a wooden article, and by way of showing that you 
 have no feeling in the matter, you kick the cane-seat 
 into the middle of the room. 
 
 Once mounted on the wooden chair, the brackets are 
 put up. To do this requires that you extend your arms 
 the full length, and while in this condition, with a couple 
 of screws and a screw-driver in your mouth, the hammer 
 in one hand, the other hanging to the fixtures, and the 
 curtain with the unwieldy roller across your shoulder, 
 you make the sickening discovery that you have got noth- 
 ing with which to punch the hole for the screw. Then 
 you get down to the floor again to remedy the defect.

 and find there is nothing for that purpose but the advice 
 of your wife to drive the screw till it sets. You mount 
 again. She holds the lamp so she can see if the woman 
 has cleaned the comers of the glass, and as you have 
 your mouth too full of hardware to articulate with any 
 freedom, you find yourself obliged to kick her elbow to 
 indicate that you actually demand some of the flame 
 to set the screw. The artifice is lost upon her, however, 
 for, likely as not, she will set down the lamp to rub her 
 arm, and ask you what you mean. 
 
 No one has yet set a bracket to a curtain fixture with- 
 out either dropping some of the implements or a remark 
 well calculated to engross the attention of the party hold- 
 ing the lamp. The awful strain on the arms, the won- 
 derful vacillating humors of the screws, the incompre- 
 hensible imbecility of the screw-driver, the obstinacy of 
 the roller, and the astonishing perverseness of your wife, 
 who will persist in moving the lamp at the wrong time, 
 make putting up a modem curtain fixture the most subtle 
 of domestic grievances. 
 
 And when the curtain is finally up, and secured so it 
 won't fall on your head when you touch the string, and 
 you take hold to draw it up, the experience as it waltzes 
 off to one side, and tries to stand on its drunken head, 
 and failing in that, settles right where it is, and obsti- 
 nately refuses to budge either way, has never been truly 
 analyzed. Weeks after, when you are leaning back in 
 your chair engrossed in memories of the dead past, that 
 curtain will suddenly come thundering down upon you, 
 causing you to spring out into the air and lifting your 
 very hair almost free from the scalp.

 THE TRULY GREAT. 
 [From R. G. IngersoU's oration on Roscoe Conkling.] 
 
 Fortunate is that nation great enough to know the 
 great. When a great man dies — one who has nobly fought 
 the battle of life, who has been faithful to every trust, 
 and has uttered his highest, noblest thoughts — one who 
 has stood proudly by the right in spite of jeer and taunt, 
 neither stopped by foe nor swerved by friend, in honor- 
 ing him, in speaking words of praise and love above his 
 dust, we pay a tribute to ourselves. 
 
 How poor this world would be without its graves, 
 without the memories of its mighty dead. Only the 
 voiceless speak forever. 
 
 Intelligence, integrity, and courage are the great pil- 
 lars that support the State. 
 
 Above all, the citizens of a free nation should honor 
 the brave and independent man — ^the man of stainless 
 integrity, of will, and intellectual force. Such men are 
 the Atlases on whose mighty shoulders rest the great 
 fabric of the Republic. Flatterers, cringers, crawlers, 
 time-servers, are the dangerous citizens of a democracy. 
 They who gain applause and power by pandering to the 
 mistakes, the prejudices and passions of the multitude 
 are the enemies of liberty. 
 
 When the intelligent submit to the clamor of the many 
 anarchy begins, and the republic reaches the edge of 
 chaos. Mediocrity, touched with ambition, flatters the 
 base and calumniates the great, while the true patriot, 
 who will do neither, is often sacrificed.

 In a government of the people a leader should be a 
 teacher — ^he should carry the torch of truth. 
 
 Most people are the slaves of habit — followers of cus- 
 tom — ^believers in the wisdom of the past — and were it 
 not for brave and splendid souls, "the dust of antique 
 time would lie unswept and mountainous error be too 
 highly heaped for truth to overpeer." Custom is a prison 
 locked and barred by those who long ago were dust, the 
 keys of which are in the keeping of the dead. 
 
 Nothing is grander than when a strong, intrepid man 
 breaks chains, levels walls, and breasts the many-headed 
 mob like some great cliff that mocks the innumerable 
 billows of the sea. 
 
 The politician hastens to agree with the majority — 
 insists that their prejudice is patriotism, that their igno- 
 rance is wisdom; not that he loves them, but because 
 he loves himself. The statesman, the real reformer, points 
 out the mistakes of the multitude, attacks the prejudices 
 of his countrymen, laughs at their follies, denounces their 
 cruelties, enlightens and enlarges their minds, and edu- 
 cates the conscience — ^not because he loves himself, But 
 because he loves and serves the right and wishes to make 
 his country great and free. 
 
 With him defeat is but a spur to further effort. He 
 who refuses to stoop, who can not be bribed by the 
 promise of success, or the fear of failure — who walks 
 the highway of right, and in disaster stands erect, is 
 the. only victor. Nothing is more despicable than to reach 
 fame by crawling, — position by cringing. 
 
 When real history shall be written by the truthful and 
 the wise, these men, these kneelers at the shrines of

 chance and fraud, these brazen idols worshiped once as

 THE UNION AND ITS RESULTS. 
 
 EDWARD EVERETT^ 
 
 July 4, i860. 
 
 Merely to fill up the wilderness with a population pro- 
 vided with the ordinary institutions and carrying on the 
 customary pursuits of civilized life — ^though surely no 
 mean achievement — was, by no means, the whole of the 
 work allotted to the United States, and thus far performed 
 with signal activity, intelligence and success. The found- 
 ers of America and their descendants have accomplished 
 more and better things. On the basis of a rapid geo- 
 graphical extension, and with the force of teeming num- 
 bers, they have, in the very infancy of their political 
 existence, successfully aimed at higher progress in a 
 generous civilization. The mechanical arts have been 
 cultivated with unusual aptitude. Agriculture, manufac- 
 tures, commerce, navigation, whether by sails or by steam, 
 and the art of printing in all its forms, have been pur- 
 sued with surprising skill. Great improvements have 
 been made in all those branches of industry, and in the 
 machinery pertaining to them, which have been eagerly

 adopted in Europe. A more adequate provision has 
 been made for popular education than in almost any 
 other country. There are more seminaries in the United 
 States, where a respectable academical education may be 
 obtained — ^more, I still mean, in proportion to the popu- 
 lation — ^than in any other country except Germany. The 
 fine arts have reached a high degree of excellence. The 
 taste for music is rapidly spreading in town and country ; 
 and every year witnesses productions from the pencil and 
 the chisel of American sculptors and painters, which 
 would adorn any gallery in the world. Our Astrono- 
 mers, Mathematicians, Naturalists, Chemists, Engineers, 
 Jurists, Publicists, Historians, Poets, Novelists, and Lexi- 
 cographers, have placed themselves on a level with those 
 of the elder world. The best dictionaries of the English 
 language since Johnson are those published in America. 
 Our constitutions, whether of the United States or of 
 the separate States, exclude all public provision for the 
 maintenance of religion. Hut in no part of Christendom 
 is it more generously supported. Sacred science is pur- 
 sued as diligently and the pulpit commands as high a 
 degree of respect in the United States as in those coun- 
 tries where the Church is publicly endowed; while the 
 American Missionary operations have won the admira- 
 tion of the civilized world. Nowhere, I am persuaded, 
 are there more liberal contributions to public-spii-ited and 
 charitable objects. In a word, there is no branch of the 
 mechanical or fine arts, no department of science, exact 
 or applied, no form of polite literature, no description 
 of social improvement, in which, due allowance being 
 made for the means and resources at command, the prog-

 ress of the United States has not been satisfactory, and 
 in some respects astonishing. 
 
 At this moment the rivers and seas of the globe are 
 navigated with that marvelous appliance of steam as a 
 propelling power which was first effected by Fulton. 
 The harvests of the civilized world are gathered by Amer- 
 ican reapers; the newspapers which lead the journalism 
 of Europe are printed on American presses; there are 
 railroads in Europe constructed by American engineers 
 and traveled by American locomotives ; troops armed with 
 American weapons, and ships of war built in American 
 dockyards. In the factories of Europe there is machinery 
 of American invention or improvement ; in their observa- 
 tories telescopes of American construction, and apparatus 
 of American invention for recording the celestial phe- 
 nomena. America contests with Europe the introductions 
 into actual use of the electric telegraph, and her mode of 
 operating it is adopted throughout the French empire. 
 American authors in almost every department are found 
 on the shelves of European libraries. It is true no Ameri- 
 can Homer, Virgil, Dante, Copernicus, Shakespeare, Ba- 
 con, Milton, Newton, has risen on the world. These 
 mighty geniuses seem to be exceptions in the history of 
 the human mind. Favorable circumstances do not pro- 
 duce them, nor does the absence of favorable circum- 
 stances prevent their appearance. Homer rose in the 
 dawn of Grecian culture; Virgil flourished in the court 
 of Augustus; Dante ushered in the birth of the new 
 European civilization; Copernicus was reared in a Polish i 
 cloister; Shakespeare was trained in the green-room of 
 the theater; Milton was formed while the elements of

 English thought and life were fermenting towafd a great 
 political and moral revolution; Newton under the profli- 
 gacy of the Restoration. Ages may elapse before any 
 country will produce a man like these, as two centuries 
 have passed since the last-mentioned of them was bom. 
 But if it is really a matter of reproach to the United 
 5tates that, in the comparatively short period of their 
 existence as a people, they have not added another name 
 to this illustrious list (which is equally true of all the 
 other nations of the earth), they may proudly boast of 
 one example of life and character, one career of disin- 
 terested service, one model of public virtue, one type 
 of human excellence, of which all the countries and all 
 the ages may be searched in vain for the parallel. I 
 need not — on this day I need not — speak the peerless 
 name. It is stamped on your hearts, it glistens in your 
 eyes, it is written on every page of your history, on the 
 battle-fields of the Revolution, on the monuments of your 
 fathers, on the portals of your capitols. It is heard in 
 every breeze that whispers over the fields of Independent 
 America. And he was all our own. He grew up on 
 the soil of America ; he was nurtured at her bosom. She 
 loved and trusted him in his youth; she honored and 
 revered him in his age; and, though she did not wait 
 for death to canonize his name, his precious memory, 
 with each succeeding year, has sunk more deeply into the 
 hearts of his countrymen.

 Is there any American who wishes to consult European 
 Powers as to the propriety or policy of our territorial

 these Powers? We do not exist by the sufferance of 
 Europe, but by its insufferance. We did not grow to

 negject, and in spite of its malevolence. We do not ask 
 its pardon for being born, nor need we apologize to it 
 for growing. It has endeavored to prevent even the legiti- 
 mate extension of our commerce, and to confine us to 
 our own continent. But if we can buy Cuba of Spain, 
 it is our business with Spain. If we have to take it, it 
 is our business with Providence. If we must save Mexico, 
 and make its weakness our strength, we have no account 
 to render unto Europe or its dynasties. 
 
 If European Powers choose to expand their empire 
 and energize their people, we have no protests, no arms 
 to prevent them. England may push from India through 
 the Himalayas to sell her calicoes to the numberless people 
 of Asia, and divide with France the empires of India, 
 Burmah and China. Civilization does not lose by their 
 expansion. Russia may push her diplomacy upon Pekin, 
 and her armies through the Caucasus, and upon Persia 
 and Tartary; she may even plant her Greek cross again 
 on the mosque of St. Sophia, and take the Grecian Levant 
 into her keeping as the head of its church and civilization. 
 France may plant her forts and arts upon the shores of the 
 Red Sea ; complete the canalization of Suez ; erect another 
 Carthage on the shores of the Mediterranean; bind her 
 natural limits from Mont Blanc, in Savoy, to Nice, upon 
 the sea. Sardinia may beconie the nucleus of the Penin- 
 sula, and give to Italy a name and a nationality. Even 
 Spain, proud and poor, may fight over again in Africa 
 the romantic wars with the Morescoes, by which she 
 educated that chivalry and adventure, which three cen- 
 turies ago made her the mistress of the New World. She 
 may demand territory of Morocco, as she has, as indem-

 institutions, but, to the philosophic observer, they move 
 by a law as fixed as that which makes the decay of autumn 
 the herald of spring. They obey the same law by which 
 the constellations change their places in the sky. Astron- 
 omers tell us that the "southern cross," which guarded 
 the adventurer upon the Spanish main four centuries ago, 
 and which now can be seen, the most beautiful emblem of 
 our salvation, shining down through a Cuban and Mexi- 
 can night, — ^just before the Christian era, glittered in our 
 northern heavens ! The same great will, which knows 
 no North and no South, and which is sending again, by 
 an irreversible law, the southern cross to our northern 
 skies, on its everlasting cycle of emigration — does it not 
 control the revolutions of nations, and the vicissitudes 
 of empires ? The very stars in their courses are "Knights 
 of the Golden Circle," and illustrate the record of human 
 advancement. They are the type of that territorial ex- 
 pansion from which this American continent can not be 
 exempted without annihilation. The finger of Providence 
 points to our nation as the guiding star of this progress. 
 Let him who would either dusk its radiancy, or make it 
 the meteor of a moment, cast again with nicer heed our 
 nation's horoscope.

 HOW A MARRIED MAN SEWS ON A BUTTON. 
 
 FROM "'the DANBURY NEWS." 
 
 It is bad enough to see a bachelor sew on a button, 
 but he is the embodiment of grace alongside a married 
 man. Necessity has compelled experience in the case of 
 the former, but the latter has depended upon some one 
 else for this service, and fortunately for the sake of 
 society, it is rarely he is obliged to resort to the needle 
 himself. Sometimes the patient wife scalds her right 
 hand or runs a sliver under the nail of the index finger 
 of that hand, and it is then the man clutches the needle 
 around the neck, and, forgetting to tie a knot on the 
 thread, commences to put on the button. It is always 
 in the morning, and from five to twenty minutes after 
 this he is expected to be down street. He lays the but- 
 ton exactly on the site of its predecessor, and pushes the 
 needle through one eye, and carefully draws the thread 
 after, leaving about three inches of it sticking up for 
 leeway. He says to himself, "Well, if women don't have 
 the easiest time I ever see." Then he comes back the 
 other way and gets the needle through the cloth easy 
 enough, and lays himself out to find the eye, but, in spite 
 of a great deal of patient jabbing, the needle point per- 
 sists in bucking against the solid parts of the button, and 
 finally, when he loses patience, his fingers catch the thread, 
 and that three inches he has left to hold the button slips 
 through the eye in a twinkling, and the button rolls 
 leisurely across the floor. He picks it up without a single 
 remark, out of respect for his children, and makes another

 attempt to fasten it. This time, when coming back with 
 the needle, he keeps both the thread and button from 
 sHpping, by covering them with his thumb; and it is out 
 of regard for that part of him that he feels around for 
 the eye in a very careful and judicious manner, but eventu- 
 ally losing his philosophy as the search becomes more and 
 more hopeless, he falls to jabbing about in a loose and 
 savage manner, and it is just then the needle finds the 
 opening and comes through the button and part way 
 through his thumb with a celerity that no human ingenu- 
 ity can guard against. Then he lays down the things 
 with a few familiar quotations, and presses the injured 
 hand between his knees, and then holds it under the other 
 arm, and finally jams it into his mouth, and all the while 
 he prances and calls upon heaven and earth to witness 
 that there has never been anything like it since the world 
 was created, and howls, and whistles, and moans and sobs. 
 After awhile he calms down and puts on his pants, and 
 fastens them together with a stick, and goes to his business 
 a changed man.

 want one of course — and wherever I should go I should 
 meet the educated classes with my bust, taking it home

 time after he returned with more tears. He said he must 
 leave me forever. I ventured to remind him of the £200 
 he borrowed. He was much cut up. I thought I would 
 not be hard upon him — so told him I would throw off 
 one hundred pounds. He brightened — shook my hand —

 FROM "THE QUAIL." 
 
 (By Ivan Sergieevitch Turgeneff; translated by Isa- 
 bel F. Hapgood; from The Independent.) 
 
 Once on a time, father and I set out on a hunting ex- 
 pedition, just before St. Peter's Day. At that season the 
 young partridges are still small. Father did not wish 
 to shoot them, and so went among the small oak-shrubs, 
 by the side of a rye-field, where quails were always to 
 be found. It was hard to mow there — ^the grass had stood 
 undisturbed for a long while. Such a quantity of flowers 
 grew there — ^vetches and clover and blue-bells, forget-me- 
 nots and wild pinks. When I went thither with my sisters 
 or the maid, I always plucked whole armfuls of them ; but 
 when I went with father I plucked no flowers; I con- 
 sidered that occupation as beneath the dignity of a sports- 
 man. 
 
 AH at once Treasure made a point ; my father shouted : 
 


## p. (#516) ################################################

420 PROSE SELECTIONS. 
 
 "Fetch it!" and from beneath Treasure's very nqse a 
 quail leaped up and flew away. But she flew very oddly; 
 she turned somersaults, twisted in a circle, and fell on 
 the ground, exactly as though she were wounded, or as 
 though her wing was broken. Treasure rushed after her 
 at the full speed of his legs ; he never did this when the 
 bird flew as it should. Father could not even shoot, be- 
 cause he was afraid that he should hit the dog with the 
 small shot. And, suddenly, I see that Treasure has over- 
 taken her, and — slap! he has caught the quail, has brought 
 it and given it to my father. My father took it and laid 
 it in his palm, with its belly up. I ran to him. 
 "What is it?" I say. "Was she wounded?" 
 "No," replies my father; "she was not wounded; but 
 she must have a nest of young ones near by, and she 
 pretended to be wounded on purpose, so that the dog 
 would think that he could catch her easily." 
 "What did she do that for?" I asked. 
 "In order to lead the dog away from her little ones. 
 Afterward she would have flown well. Only, on this 
 occasion, she miscalculated. She pretended too well, and 
 Treasure caught her." 
 "So she is not wounded?" I inquired again. 
 "No ; but she will not live. Treasure must have crushed 
 her with his teeth." 
 
 I approached nearer the quail. She lay motionless in 
 ray father's hand, with her little head hanging, and look- 
 ing sideways at me with her little brown eyes. And, all 
 at once, I felt so sorry for her! It seemed to me that 
 she was gazing at me and thinking: "Why must I die? 
 For what reason? Surely, I have done my duty; I have

 tried to save my little ones, to lead the dog as far away 
 as possible — and I am lost! Poor I! Poor creature! 
 This is unjust ! — unjust !" 
 
 "Papa !" said I, "perhaps she will not die," and I tried 
 to stroke the quail on the head. But my father said to 
 me : "No ; look here ; she has just stretched out her legs, 
 she is quivering all over, and her eyes are closing." 
 
 And so it was. As soon as she closed her eyes, I burst 
 out crying. 
 
 "What's the matter with you?" asked my father, and 
 began to laugh. 
 
 "I am sorry for her," said I. "She did her duty — ^and 
 she got killed. That is unjust." 
 
 "She tried to be cunning," replied my father. "Only 
 Treasure was more cunning than she was." 
 
 "Wicked Treasure," I said to myself; and even my 
 father did not seem good to me on this occasion. What 
 cunning was there about it? It was love for her little 
 children, and not cunning. If she had been commanded 
 to use craft to save her children — ^then Treasure ought 
 not to have caught her. 
 
 My father was on the point of thrusting the quail into 
 his game-back, but I begged her from him, laid her care- 
 fully in both my palms, and breathed upon her — to see 
 whether she would not recover. But she did not stir. 
 
 "It is useless, my dear fellow," said father, "you can't 
 bring her back to life." 
 
 I lifted her carefully by the beak; but as soon as I 
 removed my hand, her head fell again. 
 
 "Are you still sorry for her ?" asked my father.

 "And who will feed her little ones ?" I inquired, in my 
 turn. 
 
 My father gazed intently at me. "Don't trouble your- 
 self about that," said he; "the male quail, their father, 
 will feed them. And stand still," he added. "Treasure 
 seems to be making another point. Can it be the nest? 
 And the nest it is." 
 
 And sure enough, in the grass, a couple of paces from 
 Treasure's muzzle, lay four tiny birds in a row; they 
 were huddling close to each other, and stretching out 
 their little necks, and all were breathing so rapidly and 
 simultaneously that it seemed as though they were trem- 
 bling. And they had already got their feathers — there 
 was no down on them — only their little tails were .«till 
 very short. 
 
 "Papa ! Papa 1" I cried, at the top of my voice ; "call 
 off Treasure, or he will kill them too." 
 
 My father called to Treasure, and, retiring a little to 
 one side, he sat down to eat his lunch, under a bush. But 
 I remained beside the nest, and did not want to eat any 
 lunch. I took out my clean handkerchief and laid the 
 quail on it. 
 
 "Look here, orphans, here is your mother! She sacri- 
 ficed herself for you !" 
 
 The little birds breathed rapidly, as before, with the 
 whole of their bodies. Then I went to my father. 
 
 "Will you give me this quail?" I asked him. 
 
 "If you like. But what do you want to do with it ?" 
 
 "I want to bury it." 
 
 "Bury it?"

PROSE SELECTIONS. ^ 
 
 "Yes; beside her little nest. Give me your knife. I 
 will dig her a grave." 
 
 My father wras amazed. 
 
 "So that her little ones can visit the grave ?" he asked. 
 
 "No," I replied; "but because — I want to. It will be 
 so nice for her to lie there beside her nest!" 
 
 My father did not say a word. He took out his knife 
 and gave it to me. I immediately excavated a little hol- 
 low ; then I kissed the quail on her breast, and laid her 
 in the hole, and covered her with earth. Then, with the 
 same knife, I cut two small branches, stripped the bark 
 from them, placed them in the form of a cross, bound 
 them together with a blade of grass, and stuck them up- 
 right in the grave. 
 
 My father and I soon moved on; but I kept looking 
 back. The cross was whitish and visible at a distance. 
 
 And that night I had a dream. I seemed to be in 
 Heaven ; and what then ? On a small cloud sits my dear 
 little quail, only now she is all white, like that little cross ! 
 And around her head is a small gold haiei and it seems 
 that it has been given to her to reward her for her suffer- 
 ings for the sake of her children. 
 
 Five days later, my father and I returned again to the 
 same spot. I found the grave and the cross, which had 
 turned yellow, but had not fallen. Only the little nest 
 was empty, there was no trace of the birds. My father 
 assured me that the old bird, their father, had taken them 
 away; and when an old quail flew out from under the 
 bushes a few paces away, my father did not try to shoot 
 him. And I said to myself: "Yes, papa is good!" 
 
 But this is the remarkable point about it: from that

 day forth my passion for hunting disappeared, and I never 
 even thought of the time when my father would give me 
 a gun. Nevertheless, when I grew up, I did begin to 
 shoot also, but I never became a genuine sportsman. And 
 that is what weaned me from it. 
 
 THE BABIES. 
 
 S. L. CLEMENS. 
 
 (Speech of Mark Twain at the banquet given in honor 
 
 of General Grant, by the Army of the Tennessee, at 
 
 the Palmer House, Chicago, November 14, 1879.) 
 
 TOAST : 
 
 "The Babies — As they comfort us in our sorrows, let 
 us not forget them in our festivities." 
 
 I like that. We haven't all had the good fortune to 
 be ladies ; we haven't all been generals, or poets, or states- 
 men; but when the toast works down to the babies, we 
 stand on common ground, for we have all been babies. 
 It is a shame that for a thousand years the world's ban- 
 quets have utterly ignored the baby — as if he didn't 
 amount to anything! If you gentlemen will stop and 
 think a minute, — if you will go back fifty or a hundred 
 years, to your early married life, and recontemplate your 
 first baby, you will remember that he amounted to a good 
 deal, and even something over. You soldiers all know 
 that'when that little fellow arrived at family headquarters 
 you had to hand in your resignation. He took entire com-

 mand. You became his lackey, his mere body-servant, and 
 you had to stand around, too. He was not a commander 
 who made allowances for time, distance, weather, or any- 
 thing else. You had to execute his order whether it was 
 possible or not. And there was only one form of march- 
 ing in his manual of tactics, and that was the double- 
 quick. He treated you with every sort of insolence and 
 disrespect, and the bravest of you didn't dare to say a 
 word. You could face the death-storm of Donelson and 
 Vicksburg, and give back blow for blow; but when he 
 clawed your whiskers, and pulled your hair, and twisted 
 your nose, you had to take it. When the thunders of war 
 were sounding in your ears, you set yout faces toward 
 the batteries and advanced with steady tread ; but when 
 he turned on the terrors of his war-whoop, you advanced 
 in the other direction — and mighty glad of the chance, too. 
 When he called for soothing syrup, did you venture to 
 throw out any side remarks about certain services unbe- 
 coming an officer and a gentleman.' No, — you orot up and 
 got it. If he ordered his bottle, and it wasn't v/arm, did 
 you talk back ? Not you, — ^you went to work and warmed 
 it. You even descended so far in your menial office as 
 to take a suck at that warm, insipid stuff yourself, to see 
 if it was right, — ^three parts water to one of milk, a touch 
 of sugar to modify the colic, and a drop of peppermint 
 to kill tliose immortal hiccups. I can taste that stuff yet. 
 And how many things you learned as you went along; 
 sentimental young folks still took stock in that beautiful 
 old saying that when the baby smiles in his sleep, it is 
 because the angels are whispering to him. Very pretty, 
 but "too thin," — simply wind on the stomach, my friends 1

 If the baby f^roposed to take a walk at his usual hour, 
 2:30 in the morning, didn't you rise up promptly and 
 remark — with a mental addition which wouldn't improve 
 a Sunday-school book much — ^that that was the very thing 
 you were about to propose yourself ! Oh, you were under 
 good disipline! and you went fluttering up and down 
 the room in your "undress uniform" you not only prattled 
 undignified baby-talk, but even tuned up your martial 
 voices and tried to sing "Rockaby baby in a tree-top," for 
 instance. What a spectacle for an Army of the Tennes- 
 see 1 And what an affliction for the neighbors, too, — for 
 it isn't everybody within a mile around that likes military 
 music at three in the morning. And when you had been 
 keeping this sort of thing up for two or three hours, and 
 your little velvet-head intimated that nothing suited him 
 like exercise and noise, — "Go on!" — ^what did you do? 
 You simply went on, till you disappeared in the last 
 ditch. 
 
 The idea that a baby doesn't amount to iiiiy thing I Why, 
 one baby is just a house and a front-yard full by itself. 
 One baby can furnish more business than you and your 
 whole interior department can attend to. He is enterpris- 
 ing, irrepressible, brimful of lawless activities. Do what 
 you please, you can't make him stay on the reservation. 
 Sufficient unto the day is one baby; — as long as you are 
 in your mind don't you ever pray for twins. 
 
 Yes, it was high time for a toast-master to recognize 
 the importance of the babies. Think what is in store 
 for the present crop. Fifty years hence we shall all be 
 dead, I trust, and then this flag, if it still survive, — and 
 let us hope it may — ^will be floating over a republic num-

 array of other cradles there are now some 60,000 future 
 office-seekers getting ready to furnish hits occasion to 
 grapple with that same old problem a second time ; and 
 in still one more cradle, somewhere under the flag, the 
 future illustrious commander-in-chief of the American 
 armies is so little burdened with his approaching grand- 
 eurs and responsibilities as to be giving his whole stra-

 Manifest destiny iz the science ov going tew bust, or 
 enny other place before yu git thare. I may be rong in 
 this centiment, but that iz the way it strikes me, and i 
 am so put together that when enny thing strikes me i 
 immejiately strike back. Manifest destiny mite perhaps 
 be blocked out agin az the condishun that man and things 
 find themselfs in with a ring in their nozes and sumboddy 
 hold ov the ring. I may be rong agin, but if i am, awl i 
 hav got tew sa iz, i don't kno it, and what a man don't 
 kno ain't no damage tew enny boddy else. The tru way 
 that manifess destiny had better be sot down iz, the exact 
 distance that a frog kan jump down hill with a striped 
 snake after him ; i don't kno but i may be rong onst more, 
 but if the frog don't git ketched the destiny iz jist what 
 he iz a looking for. 
 
 When a man falls into the bottom ov a well and makes 
 up hiz minde tew stay thare, that ain't manifess destiny 
 enny more than having yure hair cut short iz ; but if he 
 almoste gits out and then falls down in agin i6 foot deeper 
 and brakes off his neck twice in the same plase and dies 
 and iz buried thare at low water, that iz manifess destiny 
 on the square. Standing behind a cow in fly time and 
 gitting kicked twice at one time must feel a good deal 
 like manifess destiny. Being about lo seckunds tew late 
 tew git an express train, and then chasing the train with 
 yure wife, and an umbreller in yure hands, in a hot day,

 that "the Bourbon iz jist out, but they hav got sum gin 
 that cost 72 cents a gallon in Paris," sounds tew me like 
 the manifess destiny ov moste tempranse houses. 
 
 Mi dear reader, don't beleave in manifess destiny until 
 yu see it. Thare iz such a thing az manifess destiny, but 
 when it occurs it iz like the number ov rings on the 
 rakoon's tale, ov no great consequence only for ornament. 
 Man wan't made for a machine, if he waz, it was a loco- 
 motiff machine, and manifess destiny must git oph from 
 the trak when the bell rings, or git knocked higher then 
 the price ov gold. Manifess destiny is a disseaze, but it iz 
 eazy tew heal ; i hav seen it in its wust stages cured by 
 sawing a cord ov dri hickory wood. I thought i had it

 Things in our town is workin. The canal boat Lucy 
 Ann called in here the other day and reported all quiet 
 on the Wabash. The Lucy Ann has adopted a new style 
 of Binnakle light, in the shape of a red-headed girl, who 
 sits up over the compass. It works well.

 Philadelphy, Before he left I took his lily-white hand

 in mine. I suggested to him that if he could induce the 
 citizens of Philadelphy to beheve it would be a good idea 
 to have white winder-shutters on their houses and white 
 door-stones, he might make a fortin. "It's a novelty," I 
 added, "and may startle 'em at fust, but they may conclood 
 to adopt it." 
 
 As several of our public men are constantly being sur' 
 prised with serenades, I concluded I'd be surprised in 
 the same way, so I made arrangements accordin. I asked 
 the Brass Band how mutch they'd take to take me entirely 
 by surprise with a serenade. They sed they'd overwhelm 
 me with a unexpected honour for seven dollars, which I 
 excepted. 
 
 I wrote out my impromptoo speech severil days before- 
 hand bein very careful to expunge all ingramatticisms and 
 payin particler attention to the punktooation. It was, if 
 I may say it without egitism, a manly effort ; but alars ! 
 I never delivered it, as the sekel will show you. I paced 
 up and down the kitchin speakin my piece over so as 
 to be entirely perfect. My bloomin young daughter, Sarah 
 Ann, bothered me summut by singin, "Why do summer 
 roses fade?" 
 
 "Because," said I, arter hearin her sing it about four- 
 teen times, "because it's their biz! Let 'em fade!" 
 
 "Betsy," said I, pausin in the middle of the room and 
 letting my eagle eye wander from the manuscrip — "Betsy, 
 on the night of this here serenade, I desires you to appear 
 at the winder dressed in white, and wave a lily-white 
 hankercher. D'ye hear?" 
 
 "If I appear," said that remarkable female, "I shall 
 wave a lily-white bucket of bilin hot water, and somebodjr

 will be scalded. One bald-headed old fool will get his 
 share." 
 
 She refer'd to her husband. No doubt about it in my 
 mind. But for fear she might exasperate me I said nothin. 
 
 The expected night cum. At nine o'clock precisely 
 there was sounds of footsteps in the yard, and the Band 
 struck up a lively air, which when they did finish it, there 
 was cries of "Ward! Ward!" I stept out onto the por- 
 tico. A brief glance showed me that the assemblage was 
 summut mixed. There was a great many ragged boys, 
 and there was quite a number of grown-up persons evi- 
 gently under the affluence of the intoxicatin bole. The 
 Band was also drunk. Dr. Schwazey, who was holdin up 
 a post, seemed to be partic'ly drunk — so much so that it 
 had got into his spectacles, which were staggerin wildly 
 over his nose. But I was in for it, and I commenced : — 
 
 "Feller Citizens, — For this onexpected honor — " 
 
 Leader of the Band. — "Will you give us our money 
 now, or wait till you git through?" 
 
 To this painful and disgustin interruption I paid no 
 attention. 
 
 " — for this onexpected honor, I thank you." 
 
 Leader of the Band. — "But you said you'd give us seven 
 dollars if we'd play two choons." 
 
 Again I didn't notice him, but resumed as follows : — 
 
 "I say, I thank you warmly. When I look at this crowd 
 of true Americans, my heart swells — " 
 
 Dr. Schwazey.— "So do I!" 
 
 A voice.— "We all do!" 
 
 " — ^my heart swells — " 
 
 A voice. — ^"Three cheers for the swells*

 "We live," said I, "ib troublous timeb, but I hope we 
 shall again resume our former proud position, and go on 
 in our glorious career !" 
 
 Dr. Schwazey. — "I'm willin for one to go on in a glo- 
 rious career. Will you join me, fellow citizens, in a glori- 
 ous career? What wages does a man git for a glorious 
 career, when he finds himself?" 
 
 "Dr. Schwazey," said I sternly, "you are drunk. You're 
 disturbin the meetin." 
 
 Dr. S. — "Have you a banquet spread in the house? 
 I should like a rhynossyross on the half shell, or a hip- 
 popotamus on toast, or a horse and wagon roasted whole. 
 Anything that's handy. Don't put yourself out on my 
 account." 
 
 At this point the Band begun to make hidyous noises 
 with their brass horns, and an exceedingly ragged boy 
 wanted to know if ther wasn't to be some wittles afore 
 the concern broke up? I didn't exactly know what to 
 do, and was just on the pint of doin it, when a upper 
 winder suddenly opened and a stream of hot water was 
 bro't to bear on the disorderly crowd, who took the hint 
 and retired at once. 
 
 When I am taken by surprise with another serenade, 
 I shall, among other arrangements, have a respectable 
 company on hand. So no more from me to-day. When 
 this you see, remember me.

 DAMON AND PYTHIAS. 
 
 » 
 TJley seize in the tyrant of Syracuse' halls a youth 
 
 with a dagger in's vest: he is bound by the tyrant's 
 behest : the tyrant beholds him — rage blanches his cheek : 
 "Why hidest yon dagger, conspirator, speak! — " "To 
 pierce to the heart such as thou !" — "Wretch ! Death on 
 the cross is thy doom even now !" — "It is well," spake 
 the youth; "I am harnessed for death, and I sue not 
 thy sternness to spare ; yet would I be granted one prayer : 
 — ^three days would I ask, till my sister be wed: as a 
 hostage, I leave thee my friend in my stead ; if I be found 
 false to my truth, nail hinv to thy cross without respite 
 or ruth !" — ^Then smiled with a dark exultation the king, 
 and he spake, after brief meditation : "I grant three days' 
 preparation; but see thou outstay not the term I allow, 
 else by the high thrones of Olympus I vow that if thou 
 shalt go scathless and free, the best blood of thy friend 
 shall be forfeit for thee !" 
 
 And Pythias to his friend — "I am doomed to atone for 
 my daring emprize, by death in its shamefulest guise; but 
 the monarch three days ere I perish allows, till I give a 
 loved sister away to her spouse ; thou, therefore, my hos- 
 tage must be, till I come the third day, and again set thee 
 free." And Damon in silence embraces his friend, and he 
 gives himself up to the despot ; while Pythias makes use of 
 his respite : — ^and ere the third morning in orient is burn- 
 ing, behold the devoted already returning to save his 
 friend ere it be later, by dying himself the {file death of a 
 traitor I

 But the rain, the wild rain, dashes earthward in floodsi 
 upswelling the deluging founiains ; strong torrents rush 
 down from the mountains, and lo! as he reaches the 
 deep river's border the bridgeworks give way in ter 
 rific disorder; and the waves, with a roaring like thun- 
 der, sweep o'er the rent wrecks of the arches and under. 
 To and fro by the brink of that river he wanders; — in 
 vain he looks out through the offing — ^the fiends of the 
 tempest are scoffing his outcries for aid ; — fi-om the op- 
 posite strand no pinnace puts off to convey him to land ; 
 and, made mad by the stormy commotion, the river- 
 waves foam like the surges of ocean. Then he drops on 
 his knees, and he raises his arms to Jjipiter, Strength- 
 and-Help-giver — ^"O, stem the fierce force of this river! 
 The hours are advancing — noon wanes — in the west 
 soon Apollo will sink — ^and my zeal and my best aspira- 
 tions and hopes will be baffled — an4 Damoii, my Damon, 
 will die on the scaffold!" 
 
 But the tempest abates not, the rapid flood waits not ; 
 on, billow o'er billow comes hasting; day, minute by 
 minute, is wasting — and, daring the worst that the des- 
 perate dare, he casts himself in with a noble despair, and 
 he buffets the tyrannous waves; and Jupiter pities the 
 straggler — and saves. The hours will not linger; his 
 speed is redoubled — "Forth, faithfulest! bravest, exert 
 thee! The gods cannot surely desert thee!" Alas, as 
 Hope springs in his bosom renewed, a band of barbar- 
 ians rush out of the wood, and they block up a wan- 
 derer's path, and they brandish their weapons in clam- 
 orous wrath. "What will ye ?" he cries ; "I have nought 
 but my life, and that must be yielded ere night : force me

 not to defend it by fight !" But they swarm round him 
 closer, that truculent band: so he wrests the huge cTub 
 from one savage's hand, and he fells the first four at 
 his feet; and the remnant, dismayed and astounded, re- 
 treat. 
 
 The storm-burst is over — low glows the red sun, mak- 
 ing earth and air fainter and hotter; the knees of the 
 fugitive totter — "Alas!" he cries, "have I then breasted 
 the flood, have I vanquished those wild men of rapine 
 and blood, but to perish from languor and pain; while 
 my hostage, my friend, is my victim in vain?" When, 
 hark, a cool sound, as of murmuring water! he hears 
 it — it bubbles — it gushes; hark! louder and louder it 
 rushes ! he turns him, he searches, and lo ! a pure stream 
 ripples forth from a rock, and shines out in the beam 
 of the sun ere he fierily sinks; and the wanderer bathes 
 his hot limbs and he drinks. 
 
 The sun looks his last! — On the oft-trodden pathway 
 hies homeward the weariful reaper; the shadows of 
 evening grow deeper, when pressing and hurrying anx- 
 iously on, two strangers pass Pythias — ^and list ! he hears 
 one to the other exclaiming, "O shame on the wretch 
 that betrayed the magnanimous Damon!" Then Hor- 
 ror lends wings to his faltering feet, and he dashes in 
 agony onward; and soon a few roofs, looking sunward, 
 gleam faintly where Syracuse' suburbs extend; and the 
 good Philodemus, his freedman and friend, now comes 
 forward in tears to his master, who gathers despair from 
 the face of disaster. "Back, Master! Preserve thine 
 own life at the least ! His, I fear me, thou canst not re- 
 deem, for the last rays of eventide beam. O! though

 hour after hour traveled on to its goal, he expected thy 
 coming with confident soul; and, though mocked by the 
 king as forsaken, his trust in thy truth to the last was 
 unshaken!" "Eternal Avenger! and is it too late?" 
 cried the youth with a passionate fervor; "and dare not 
 I be his preserver? Then Death shall unite whom not 
 Hell shall divide! — we will die, he and I, on the road, 
 side by side; and the bloody Destroyer shall find that 
 there be souls whom friendship and honor can bind !" 
 
 And on, on, unresting, he bounds like a roe — see ! they 
 lay the long cross on the ground! See! the multitude 
 gather all round! See! already they hurry their victim 
 along! When, with giant-like strength, a man bursts 
 through the throng, and — "Oh, stay, Jtay your hands !" 
 is his cry ; — ^"I am come — I am here- 'I am ready to die !" 
 And astonishment masters the crowt at the sight, while 
 the friends in the arms of each other weep tears that 
 they struggle to smother. Embarrassed, the lictors and 
 officers bring the strange tidings at length to the ears 
 of the king, and a human emotion steals o'er him. And, 
 admiring, he looks at them long ere he speaks: — ^"You 
 have conquered, O marvelous pair, by a friendship as 
 glorious as rare! You have melted to flesh the hard 
 heart in my breast! go in peace! — ^you are free! But 
 accord one request to my earnest entreaties and wishes 
 — accept a third friend in your king, Dionysius."

 TRAFFIC IN ARDENT SPIRITS. 
 
 LYMAN BEECHER. 
 
 The amount of suffering and mortality inseparable 
 from the commerce in ardent spirits renders it an un- 
 lawful article of trade. 
 
 The wickedness is proverbial of those who in ancient 
 days caused their childrern to pass through the fire unto 
 Moloch. But how many thousands of children are there 
 in our land who endure daily privations and sufferings 
 which render life a burden, and would have made the 
 momentary pang of infant sacrifice a blessing! Theirs 
 is a lingering, living death. There never was a Moloch 
 to ^hom were immolated yearly as many children as are 
 immolated, or kept in a state of constant suffering, in 
 'this land of nominal Christianity. We have no drums 
 and gongs to drown their cries, neither do we make con- 
 vocations, and bring them all out for one mighty burning. 
 The fires which consume them are slow fires, and (they 
 blaze balefully in every part of our land, throughout 
 which the cries of injured children and orphans go up to 
 Heaven. Could all these woes, the product of intemper- 
 ance, be brought out into one place, and the monster who 
 inflicts the sufferings be seen personified, the nation 
 would be furious with indignation. Humanity, con- 
 science, religion, all would conspire to stop a work of 
 such malignity. 
 
 We are appalled and shocked at the accounts from 
 the East, of widows burned upon the funeral-piles of their 
 departed husbands. But what if those devotees of su-

 perstition, the Bramins, had discovered a mode of pro- 
 longing the lives of their victims for years amid the 
 flames, and by these protracted burnings were accus- 
 tomed to torture life away? We might almost rouse up 
 a crusade to cross the deep, to stop by force such inhu- 
 manity. But alas! we should leave behind us, on our 
 own shores, more wives in the fire than we should find 
 of widows thus sacrificed in all the E^st; a fire, too, 
 which, besides its action upon the body, tortures the soul 
 by lost affections, and ruined hopes, and prospective 
 wretchedness. 
 
 Every year thousands of families are robbed of fathers, 
 brothers, husbands, friends. Every year widows and 
 orphans are multiplied, and gray hairs are brought with 
 sorrow to the grave. No disease makes such inroads 
 upon families, blasts so many iiopes, destroys so many 
 lives, and causes so many mourners to go about the 
 streets, because man goeth to his long home. 
 
 Can we lawfully amass property by a course of trade 
 which fills the land with beggars, and widows, and or- 
 phans, and crimes — which peoples the graveyard with 
 premature mortality, and the world of woe with the vic- 
 tims of despair? 
 
 Could all the forms of evil produced in the land by 
 intemperance, come upon us in one horrid array, it 
 would appall the nation, and put an end to traffic in ar- 
 dent spirits. If, in every dwelling built by blood, the 
 stone from the wall should utter all the cries which tHe 
 bloody traffic extorts, and the beam out of the timber 
 should echo them back, — who would build such a house? 
 — ^and who would dwell in it? What if in every part 08

 the dwelling, from the cellar upward, through all the 
 halls and chambers, babblings, and contentions, and 
 voices, and groans, and shrieks, and wailings, were heard, 
 day and night? What if the cold blood oozed out, and 
 stood in drops upon the walls; and by preternatural art 
 all the ghastly skulls and bones of the victims destroyed 
 by intemperance should stand upon the walls, in horrid 
 sculpture within and without the building, — who would 
 rear such a building? What if at eventide, and at mid- 
 night, the airy forms of men destroyed by intemperance 
 were dimly seen haunting the distilleries and stores where 
 they received their bane, — following the track of the ship 
 engaged in commerce, — walking upon the waves, — flit- 
 ting athwart the deck, — sitting upon the rigging, — and 
 sending up from the hold within, and from the waves 
 without, groans, and loud laments, and wailings? Who 
 would attend such stores? Who would labor in such 
 distilleries? Who would navigate such ships? 
 
 Oh ! were the sky over our heads one great whispering- 
 gallery, bringing down about us all the lamentation and 
 woe which intemperance creates, and the firm earth one 
 sonorous medium of sound, bringing up around us from 
 beneath, the wailings of the lost, whom the commerce 
 in ardent spirits had sent thither, — ^these tremendous real- 
 ities, assailing our sense, would invigorate our conscience, 
 and give decision to our purpose of reformation. But 
 these evils are as real as if the stone did cry out of the 
 wall, and the beam answered it, — as real as if, day and 
 night, wailings were heard in every part of the dwelling, 
 and blood and skeletons were seen upon every wall, — as 
 real as if the ghostly forms of departed victims flitted

 about the ship as she passed o'er the' billows, and showed 
 themselves nightly about stores and distilleries, and with 
 unearthly voices screamed in our ears their loud lament. 
 They are as real as if the sky over our heads collected 
 and brought down about us all the notes of sorrow in the 
 land, and the firm earth should open a passage for the 
 wailing of despair to come up from beneath. 
 
 MAN'S CONNECTION WITH THE INFINITE. 
 
 RUSKIN. 
 
 That is to every thing created pre-eminently useful, 
 which enables it rightly and fully to perform the func- 
 tions appointed to it by its Creator. Therefore, that we 
 may determine what is chiefly useful to man, it is nec- 
 essary first to determine the use of man himself. 
 
 Man's use and function is to be the witness of the 
 glory of God, and to advance that glory by his reason- 
 able obedience and reluctant happiness. 
 
 Whatever enables us to fulfill this function is, in the 
 pure and first sense of the word, useful to us. Pre-emi- 
 nently, therefore, what sets the glory of God more 
 brightly before us. But things that only help us to 
 exist are, in a secondary and mean sense, useful, or 
 rather, if they be looked for alone, they are useless and 
 worse, for it would be better that we should not exist, 
 than that we should guiltily disappoint the purposes of 
 existence. 
 
 And yet people speak in this working age, when they

 Speak from their hearts, as if houses, and lands, and food, 
 and raiment were alone useful ; and as if sight, thought, 
 and admiration were all profitless, so that men insolently 
 call themselves Utilitarians, who would turn, if they had 
 their way, themselves and their race into vegetables ; men 
 who think that the meat is more than the life, and the rai- 
 ment than the body; who look to the earth as a stable, 
 and to its fruit as fodder; vine-dressers as husbandmen, 
 who love the corn they grind, and the grapes they crush, 
 better than the gardens of the angels upon the slopes of 
 Eden ; hewers of wood and drawers of water, who think 
 that the wood they hew and the water they draw are bet- 
 ter than the pine forests that cover the mountains like the 
 shadow of God, and than the great rivers that move like 
 his eternity. And so comes upon us that woe of Ae 
 preacher that, though God "hath made everything b«au- 
 tiful in his time, also he hath set the world in their hearts, 
 so that no man can find out the work that God maketh 
 from the beginning to the end." 
 
 This Nebuchadnezzar curse, that sends us to grass like 
 oxen, seems to follow but too closely on the excess or 
 continuance of national power and peace. In the perplex- 
 ities of nations, in their struggles for existence in their 
 infancy, their impotence, or even their disorganization, 
 they have higher hopes and nobler passions. Out of the 
 suffering comes the serious mind; out of the salvation, 
 the grateful heart; out of the endurance, the fortitude; 
 out of the deliverance, the faith ; but now when they have 
 learned to live under providence of laws, and with de- 
 cency and justice and regard for each other, and when 
 they have done away with violent and external sources of

 suffering, worse evils seem rising out of their rest— evils 
 that vex less and mortify more, that suck the blood 
 though they do not shed it, and ossify the heart though 
 they do not torture it. And deep though the causes of 
 thankfulness must be to every people at peace with oth- 
 ers and at unity in itself, there are causes of fear also, a 
 fear greater than the sword and sedition : that dependence 
 on God may be forgotten, because the bread is given 
 and the water is sure; that gratitude to him may cease, 
 because his constancy of protection has taken the sem- 
 blance of a natural law; that heavenly hope may grow 
 faint amidst the full fruition of the world; that selfish- 
 ness may take place of undemanded devotion, compas- 
 sion be lost in vainglory, and love in dissimulation ; that 
 innovation may succeed to strength, apathy to patience, 
 and the noise of jesting words and foulness of dark 
 thoughts, to the earnest purity of the girded loins and the 
 burning lamp. 
 
 I am aware there is a prejudice against any mpn en- 
 gaged in the manufacture of alcohol. I believe from 
 the time it issues from the coiled and poisonous worm in 
 the distillery until it empties into the hell of death, that 
 it is demoralizing to everybody that touches it, from the 
 source to where it ends. I do not believe that anybody 
 can contemplate the subject without being prejudiced 
 against the crime. All they have to do is to think of the 
 wrecks on either side of the stream of death, of the 
 suicides, of the insanity, of the poverty, of the destruc- 
 tion, of the little children tugging at the breast, of weep- 
 ing and despairing wives asking for bread, of the man 
 struggling with imaginary serpents produced by this

 devilish thing; and when you think of the jails, of the 
 almshouses, of the asylums, of the prisons, and of the 
 scaflfolds, on either bank, I do not wonder that every 
 thoughtful man is prejudiced against this vile stuff called 
 alcohol. 
 
 Intemperance cuts down youth in its vigor, manhood 
 in its strength, and age in its weakness. It breaks the 
 father's heart, bereaves the doting mother, extinguishes 
 natural affection, erases conjugal love, blots out filial 
 attachment, blights parental hope, and brings down 
 mourning age in sorrow to the grave. It produces 
 weakness, not strength; sickness, not health; death, not 
 life. It makes wives widows, children orphans, fathers 
 fiends, and all of them, paupers and beggars. It feeds 
 rheumatism, nurses gout, welcomes epidemics, invites 
 cholera, imports pestilence, and embraces consumption. 
 It covers the land with idleness, poverty, disease and 
 crime. It fills your jails, supplies your almshouses, and 
 demands your asylums. It engenders controversies, fos- 
 ters quarrels, and cherishes riots. It crowds your pen- 
 itentiaries, and furnishes the victims for your scaffolds. 
 It is the life-blood of the gambler, the aliment of the 
 counterfeiter, the prop of the highwayman, and the sup- 
 port of the midnight incendiary. It countenances the 
 liar, respects the thief, and esteems the blasphemer. It 
 violates obligation, reverences fraud, and honors infamy. 
 It defames benevolence, hates love, scorns virtue, and 
 slanders innocence. It incites the father to butcher his 
 helpless offspring, helps the husband to massacre his 
 wife, and aids the child to grind the parricidal axe. It 
 bums up man and consumes woman, detests life, curses

 God, and despises heaven. It suborns witnesses, nurses 
 perjury, defiles the jury-box, and stains the judicial er- 
 mine. It bribes voters, disqualifies votes, corrupts elec- 
 tions, pollutes our institutions, and endangers our Gov- 
 ernment. It degrades the citizen, debases the legislator, 
 dishonors the statesman, and disarms the patriot It 
 brings shame, not honor ; terror, not safety ; despair, not 
 hope ; misery, not happiness. And v?ith the malevolence 
 of a fiend, it calmly surveys its frightful desolations ; and, 
 insatiated with havoc, it poisons felicity, kills peace, ruins 
 morals, blights confidence, slays reputation, and wipes 
 out national honor, then curses the world and laughs at 
 its ruin. 
 
 It does all that and more. // murders the soul. It is 
 the sum of all villainies ; the father of crimes ; the mother 
 of all abominations ; the curse of curses ; the devil's best 
 friend, and God's worst enemy.

 an3 with faith; they saw the golden beam inclining to 
 the side of perfect justice; and they fought on amidst 
 the storm of persecution. In Great Britain they tell me 
 when I go to see such a prison: "Here is such a dun- 
 geon, in which such a one was confined ;" "Here, among 
 the ruins of an old castle, we will show you where such 
 a one had his ears cut off, and where another was mur- 
 dered." Then they will show me monuments towering 
 up to the heavens. "There is a monument to such a one ; 
 there is a monument to another." And what do I find ? 
 That the one generation persecuted and howled ^at these 
 men, crying, "crucify them! crucify them!" and danced 
 around the blazing fagots that consumed them; and the 
 next generation busied itself in gathering up the scat- 
 tered ashes of the martyred heroes, and depositing them 
 in the golden urn of a nation's history. O, yes ! the men 
 that fight for a great enterprise are the men that bear 
 the brunt of the battle, and "He who seeth in secret" — 
 seeth the desire of his children, their steady purpose, their 
 firm self-denial — "will reward them openly," though they 
 may die and see no sign of the triumph of their enter- 
 prise. 
 
 Our cause is a progressive one. I read the first con- 
 stitution of the first temperance society formed in the 
 State of New York, in 1809, and one of the by-laws 
 stated, "Any member of this association who shall be 
 convicted of intoxication shall be fined a quarter of a 
 dollar, except such act of intoxication shall taken place 
 on the Fourth of July, or any other regularly appointed 
 military muster." We laugh at that now; but it was a 
 serious matter in those days; it was in advance of the

 public sentiment of the age. The very men that adopted 
 that principle were persecuted; they were hooted and 
 pelted through the streets, the doors of their houses were 
 blackened, their cattle mutilated. The fire of persecu- 
 tion scorched some men so that they left the work. Oth- 
 ers worked on, and God blessed them. Some are living 
 to-day; and I should like to stand where they stand 
 now, and see the mighty enterprise as it rises before them. 
 They worked hard. They lifted the first turf — prepared 
 the bed in which to lay the corner-stone. They laid it 
 amid persecution and storm. They worked under the 
 surface; and men almost forgot that there were busy 
 hands laying the solid foundation far down beneath. 
 By-an-by they got the foundation above the surface, and 
 then commenced another storm of persecution. Now we 
 see the superstructure — pillar after pillar, tower after 
 tower, column after column, with the capitals emblazoned 
 with "Love, truth, sympathy and good-will to men." Old 
 men gaze upon it as it grows up before them. They will 
 not live to see it completed, but they see in faith the 
 crowning cope-stone set upon it. Meek-eyed women weep 
 as it grows in beauty ; children strew the pathway of the 
 workmen with flowers. We do not- see its beauty yet — 
 we do not see the magnificence of its superstructure yet 
 — ^because it is in course of erection. Scaffolding, ropes, 
 ladders, workmen ascending and descending, mar the 
 beauty of the building; but by-and-by, when the hosts 
 who have labored shall come up over a thousand battle- 
 fields, waving with bright grain, never again to be crushed 
 in the distillery — ^through vineyards, under trellised vines, 
 with grapes hanging in all their purple glory, never again

 to be pressed into that which can debase and aegrade 
 mankind — when they shall come through orchards, un- 
 der trees hanging thick with golden, pulpy fruit, never 
 to be turned into that which can injure and debase — 
 when they shall come up to the last distillery and destroy 
 it; to the last stream of liquid death, and dry it up; to 
 the last weeping wife, and wipe her tears gently away ; to 
 the last little child, and lift him up to stand where God 
 meant that man should stand ; to the last drunkard, and 
 nerve him to burst the burning fetters and make a glori- 
 ous accompaniment to the song of freedom by the clank- 
 ing of his broken chains — ^then, ah! then will the cope- 
 stone be set upon it, the scaffolding will fall with a crash, 
 and the building will start in its wondrous beauty before 
 an astonished world. The last poor drunkard shall go 
 into it, and find a refuge there ; loud shouts of rejoicing 
 shall be heard, and there shall be joy in heaven, when the 
 triumphs ,of a great enterprise shall usher in the day of 
 the triumphs of the cross of Christ. I believe it ; on my 
 soul, I believe it. Will you help us? That is the ques- 
 tion. We leave it with you. Good-night. 
 
 THOUGHTS ON IMMORTALITY. 
 
 PHILIP SCHAFF^ D. D. 
 
 Life, death, eternity — ^how vast, how deep, how solemn 
 these three words, so familiar to us all ! Who can meas- 
 ure, who can fathom their meaning? In the midst of 
 life we are surrounded by death, and confronted by eter- 
 nity with its boundless prospects of weal and woe. Life

 on earth ends in death, and death is but the dark door to 
 another life which has no end. 
 
 Astronomy cannot tell whether this visible universe has 
 boundaries or not, and what lies beyond. Theology can- 
 not determine the locality of that invisible universe from 
 which no traveler returns, nor the direction and length of 
 that lonely passage which carries the disembodied spirit 
 from its present to its future abode. But this we do 
 know, and it is enough for our comfort, that in our Fa- 
 ther's house are many mansions, and that our Savior 
 has prepared a place for all his disciples. There is an 
 abundance of room for all even within the limits of this 
 universe, and for aught we know, the spirit world may be 
 verynear and around about us. There are exalted moments 
 in our life when we see the heavens open and the angels 
 of God descending and ascending. Life is a mystery, a 
 glorious mystery with a heaven beyond, but a terrible 
 mystery with annihilation or endless punishment in pros- 
 pect. 
 
 The immortality of the soul is a universal instinct and 
 desire of the human race. Like the idea of (jOd; it is im- 
 planted in our intellectual and moral constitution. We 
 cannot think backward without reaching an ultimate 
 cause which has no beginning; we cannot thipk forward 
 without arriving at a result which has ho ending. God 
 and eternity precede time and succeecl. time, and time 
 itself is filled with both. We cannot concei-^e that a»wise 
 Creator should make man in his own image and^ endow 
 him with the highest faculties without ordaining him for 
 endless existence. He cannot intend the head of His 
 creatures, the masterpiece of His hand to perish like the

 brute. He cannot allow virtue to suffer and iniquity to 
 flourish without some future adjustment which will give 
 to every one his due, and restore the harmony of char- 
 acter and condition. 
 
 It seems impossible that a rational being filled with 
 infinite longings and capable of endless progress should 
 be suddenly cut off in the beginning of its career, "like 
 the empty fabric of a vision leaving no wreck behind." 
 It seems impossible that the mind, which proves its in- 
 dependence of the body and matures in strength while 
 the body declines, should be dissolved with its material 
 tent. No husband can close the eyes of a beloved wife, 
 no parent can commit a child to the cold grave, no friend 
 can bid farewell to a bosom friend without the ardent 
 wish for the recovery of the loss and a meeting again in 
 a better world, where tears of parting are unknown. 
 Every consideration of God's goodness, love, and justice; 
 of man's capacities, desires, and hopes ; and of surround- 
 ing nature, with its perennial renovations of seasons and 
 transformation of death itself into new forms of life, 
 forces upon us the belief in the immortality of the human 
 soul. 
 
 But after all, philosophy and science can lead us only 
 to the probability of immortality, and there is a vast step 
 from probability to certainty. The starry heavens above 
 and the moral law within may well have filled the great 
 philosopher of the last century with ever growing rev- 
 erence and awe; but beyond the starry heavens and be- 
 hind the moral law lie the sublimer regions of faith, 
 which fill us with deeper reverence, and which alone cap 
 give us solid comfort in life and in death.

 THE WRONG ROAD. 
 
 H. W. ADAMS. 
 
 "Good-by, mother; don't worry about me. I can take 
 care of myself. I shall come back in my carriage some 
 day, and see you all again." 
 
 This was Charley Mason's self-confident farewell to 
 his mother, as he left his native town and took the stage 
 for the nearest railroad station, bound for the great 
 metropolis. 
 
 New York was not much like the quiet farming town 
 where he had lived. The city, with its ten thousand 
 sights and sounds, stirred his soul. To see with his own 
 eyes the wonderful things of which his fellow clerks told, 
 did not accord with his conscience or his promises to the 
 dear folks at home. But they were "slow,'' and "behind 
 the age." "There can be no harm in going just once to 
 the theater; lots of church members go there." So over 
 the sins of worldly church members, Charley stumbled. 
 
 Hamlet was played that night. The glare of a thou- 
 sand gas-lights ; the gorgeous scenery ; the gaily-dressed, 
 bright-faced men and women; the royal attire of the 
 actors; the splendid tragedy, which seemed so real; the 
 absence of anything coarse or vulgar, captivated our hero. 
 He saw at once that all the stories about the demoralizing 
 tendencies of the theater were grandmas' fables, told by 
 people who knew nothing about it. 
 
 George Peterson was a grand, whole-souled fellow, 
 a salesman in the store where Charley was employed. He

 had paid for the evening's entertainment, and now they 
 were on the way home. 
 
 "Let's look in here a moment, Charley." 
 
 There was a sudden twinge of conscience, for the bril- 
 liantly-lighted room was a billiard hall, and Charley had 
 never put his foot inside of such a door in his life. 
 
 "All right, George, we will just look in a moment." 
 
 All eyes were centered on a match game by two of the 
 renowned players of the metropolis. It was hotly con- 
 tested. The men were equally skillful, and had kept to- 
 gether, almost point for point, throughout the game. The 
 leader's hand trembled a little as he put himself in posi- 
 tion for the last stroke. He missed, and his opponent 
 soon won the game, amid the plaudits of his friends. 
 
 Charley was more than interested ; he was intensely ex- 
 cited by the game, and by his first taste of gay city life. 
 Near the door where they entered was a bar, grand with 
 gilded decanters, marble, and plate glass. The polite bar- 
 tender handed down a decanter, as they were abo .; to 
 pass but. 
 
 "Let's have a glass, just one, Charley !" 
 
 But Charley stood irresolute. Visions of home, and 
 mother, and sisters, flashed before him. He dared not 
 drink, and under the pressure of the night's glare and 
 whirl, he dared not refuse. 
 
 In the afternoon he would have repelled the temptation, 
 but twice already that night he had been tempted and 
 yielded, and the lesser temptations were the thin end o! 
 the wedge which opened up the way for the greater.

 "Don't be squeamish — you can take care of yourself, 
 and so can I." 
 
 "Well, just a glass, then." 
 
 "The wine when it is red," how it sparkled; b%it who 
 can picture the woe that slept in the depths of the first 
 glass! 
 
 Two years further on. You would hardly know our 
 innocent farmer lad in the fast young man who faces us 
 and tips, with maudlin leer, his glass to an older com- 
 rade. Cigars, cards, and drugged brandy, with the pros- 
 trate form of his partner on the floor, tell of "a high old 
 time," and rapid transit CHi the devil's road to ruin and 
 death. And there is that which we dare not picture. 
 There are scenes which we will not describe, and associ- 
 ates that we may not name, that are wasting fiis sub- 
 stance and consuming his precious life. 
 
 Only twenty-five, and you would think him fifty. Ex- 
 hausted, shattered, wrecked; disgusted with the cup of 
 pleasure, which at the first was so sweet, and now is as 
 bitter as gall. He wakes from a troubled sleep, after a 
 debauch, to find that the deadly mania of the cup is upon 
 him. Snakes writhe and twist themselves about his shiv- 
 ering form^ spiders and toads crawl over him, terrible 
 fancies and forebodings rack his soul. How he pleads 
 with God to save him, and yet he knows that Satan has 
 him bound hand and foot. "At the last it biteth like a 
 serpent and stingeth like an adder." 
 
 The end is not far off, but who can write it ? Diseased, 
 debauched, his nerves unstrung, his constitution broken, 
 his bones rotted, his eyes bleared, horror and darkness 
 settling about him, he sinks in the dire struggle, and his

 sun goes down at noon! Strangers look coldly on him 
 in the dying hour, and rude, unfriendly hands convey him 
 to the Potter's Field. Ah ! how many such graves there 
 are I and no man that lives dare go to the old home where 
 childhood's sunny hours were spent, and tell the whole 
 honest truth about what carried the wandering boy to 
 his grave. No man dares to break that mother's heart 
 with the terrible narration of the sin, and vice, and ruin 
 which the destroyer has wrought. 
 
 But in after years she comes, a worn and wearied pil- 
 grim, gray-haired, with furrows on her care-worn face, 
 and by that neglected grave, where thorns and briers 
 twine and tangle themselves above the sleeping dust, that 
 mother kneels and cries out in the bitterness of her soul, 
 "My son! my son! would to Gk)d that I had died for 
 thee!" 
 
 ELI PERKINS' BOOK AGENT. 
 
 A Philadelphia book agent importuned James Watson, 
 a rich and close New York man, living out at Elizabeth, 
 until he bought a book— the "Early Christian Martyrs." 
 Mr. Watson didn't want the book, but he bought it to get 
 rid of the agent ; then taking it under his arm, he started 
 for the train which takes him to his New York office. 
 
 Mr. Watson hadn't been gone long before Mrs. Watson 
 came home from a neighbor's. The book agent saw her 
 and went in and persuaded the wife to buy another copy 
 of the same book. She was ignorant of the fact that her 
 husband had bought the same book in the morning.

 When Mr. Watson came back from New York at night, 
 Mrs. Watson showed him the book. 
 
 "I don't want to see it," said Watson, frowning terribly. 
 
 "Why, husband?" asked his wife. 
 
 "Because that rascally book agent sold me the same 
 book this morning. Now we've got two copies of the 
 same book — two copies of the 'Early Christian Martyrs,' 
 and " 
 
 "But, husband, we can- 
 
 "No, we can't either !" interrupted Mr. Watson. "The 
 man is off on the train before this. Confound it! I could 
 kill the fellow. I " 
 
 "Why, there he goes to the depot now," said Mrs. 
 Watson, pointing out of the window at the retreating 
 form of the book agent making for the train. 
 
 "But it's too late to catch him, and I'm not dressed. 
 I've taken off my boots and " 
 
 Just then Mr. Stevens, a neighbor of Mr. Watson, 
 drove by, when Watson pounded on the window pane 
 in a frantic manner, almost frightening the horse. 
 
 "Here, Stevens," he shouted, "you're hitched up; won't 
 you run your horse down to the train and hold that book 
 agent till I come ? Run 1 Catch him now !" 
 
 "All right," said Mr. Steveps, whipping up his horse 
 and tearing down the road. 
 
 Mr. Stevens reached the train just as the conductor 
 shouted "all aboard!" 
 
 "Book agent !" he yelled, as the book agent stepped on 
 the train. "Book agent ! hold on ! Mr. Watson wants to 
 see you." 
 
 "Watson? Watson wants to see me?" repeated the

 seemingly puzzled book agent. "Oh, I know what he 
 wants; he wants to buy one of my books; but I ean't 
 miss the train to sell it to him." 
 
 "If that is all he wants," I can pay for it and take it 
 back to him. How much is it?" 
 
 "Two dollars for the 'Early Christian Martyrs,' " said 
 the book agent as he reached for the money and passed 
 the book out through the car window. 
 
 Just then Mr. Watson arrived, puffing and blowing, in 
 his shirt sleeves. As he saw the train pull out he was 
 too full for utterance. 
 
 "Well, I got it for you," said Stevens, "just got it and 
 that's all." 
 
 "Got what?" yelled Watson. 
 
 "Why, I got the book — 'Early Christian Martyrs,' 
 and " 
 
 "By — ^the — great — guns !" moaned Watson, as he placed 
 his hand to his brow and swooned right in the middle 
 of the street. — Eli Perkins. 
 
 THE CHAMPION SNORER. 
 
 ROBERT BURDETTE. 
 
 It was the Cedar Rapids sleeper. Outside it was as 
 dark as the inside of an ink-bottle. In the sleeping-car 
 people slept. Or tried it. 
 
 Some of them slept like Christian men and women, 
 peacefully and sweetly and quietly. 
 
 Others slept like demons, malignantly, hideou^y, fiend-

 ishly, as though it was their misison to keep everybody 
 else awake. 
 
 Of these the man in lower number three was the "boss." 
 When it came to a square snore, with variations, you 
 wanted to count "lower three" in, — with a full hand and 
 a pocket full of rocks. 
 
 We never heard anything snore like him. It was the 
 most systematic snoring that was ever done, even on one 
 of these tournaments of snoring, a sleeping-car. He 
 didn't begin as soon as the lamps were turned and every- 
 body was in bed. Oh, no ! There was more cold-blooded 
 diabolism in his system than that. He waited until every- 
 body had a taste of sleep, just to see how nice and 
 pleasant it was, and then he broke in on their slumbers 
 like a winged, breathing demon, and they never knew 
 what peace was again that night. 
 
 He started out with a terrific 
 
 "Gu-r-r-rt!" 
 that opened every eye in the car. We all hoped it was 
 an accident, however, and trusting that he wouldn't do it 
 again, we all forgave him. Then he blasted our hopes 
 and curdled the sweet serenity of our forgiveness by a 
 long-drawn 
 
 "Gwa-a-h-h-hah!" 
 that sounded too much like business to be accidental. 
 Then every head in that sleepless sleeper was held off the 
 pillow for a minute, waiting in breathless suspense to hear 
 the worst, and the sleeper in "lower three" went on in 
 long drawn, regular cadences that indicated good staying 
 qualities,

 "Gwa-a-a-h! Gwa-a-a-a-h! Gahwayway! Gahwaywah! 
 Gahwa-a-ah !" 
 
 Evidently it was going to last all night, and the weary 
 heads dropped back on the sleepless pillows, and the 
 swearing began. It mumbled along in low, muttering 
 tones, like the distant echoes of a profane thunder-storm. 
 Pretty soon "lower three" gave us a little variation. He 
 shot off a spiteful 
 
 "Gwook!" 
 which sounded as though his nose had got mad at him 
 and was going to strike. Then there was a pause, and 
 we began to hope he had either awakened from sleep or 
 strangled to death — nobody cared very particularly which. 
 Bat he disappointed everybody with a guttural 
 
 "Gurroch!" 
 
 Then he paused again for breath, and when he had 
 accumulated enough for his purpose he resumed business 
 with a stentorious 
 
 "Kowpff!" 
 that nearly shot the roof off the car. Then he went on 
 playing such fantastic tricks with his nose, and breathing 
 things that would make the immortal gods weep, if they 
 did but hear him. It seemed an utter, pteposterous im- 
 possibility that any human being could make the mon- 
 strous, hideous noises with his breathing machine that the 
 fellow in "lower three" was making with his. He then 
 ran through all the ranges of the usual gamut ; he went 
 up and down a very chromatic scale of snores; he ran 
 through intricate and fearful variations until it seemed 
 that his nose must be out of joint in a thousand places. 
 All the night and all the day through he told his story.

 "Gawoh! gurrah! gu-r-r-r! Kowpff! Gawaw-wah!

 Just as the other passengers had consulted together how 
 they might slay him, morning dawned, and "lower num- 
 ber three" awoke. Everybody watched the curtain to see 
 what manner of man it was that had made the sleeping- 
 car a pandemonium. Presently the toilet was completed, 
 the curtains parted, and "lower number three" stood re- 
 vealed. 
 
 Great heavens!

 MY MULE RIDE. 
 
 The boys insisted that I needed relaxation. My health 
 required it. I had a pretty fair article of health, I 
 thought; enough to last me as long as I lived. But I 
 must accumulate a stock for future use. The South was 
 the place to get it. And riding was health. The sand is 
 too deep to ride, except on horseback, so I thought I 
 would take a ride. I applied to the livery man for a 
 horse. He had one. He looked sorrowfully att me, as 
 though he pitied me. Did I ever ride a mule? I never 
 had. He had as good riding horses as were ever sad- 
 dled, but if I wanted a "Rock Me to Sleep, Mother," 
 style of a ride, I would take a mule. I don't consider 
 myself a first-class judge of mules. I had some vague 
 notions in regard to them; I supposed they would do i,

 large amount of work with very little feed, and were im- 
 mortal. I had read of one being driven over the same 
 route by the same boy for eight years, and he was a 
 young mule yet. 
 
 Bring forth the mule. The mule was brought. He 
 was a meek-looking mule — a perfect "Uriah Heep" of a 
 mule, so far as " 'umbleness" was concerned. At least 
 that was the view I took of him. He was saddled, and 
 I mounted. For a mile or two he paced beautifully. I 
 thought those old monks I had read about knew what 
 they were doing when they traveled on mules. I had a 
 high respect for their judgment. Just then my mule 
 began to show symptoms — symptoms of what I did not 
 know. I found out. Dropping his head between his 
 legs, his heels described a parabolic curve in the air, and 
 I got oflf and sat on the ground. I got over his head, and 
 did it quick. I am not so old but I can get off an animal 
 of that kind as quick as a boy. Then I looked at the 
 mule to see if he was hurt. He didn't appear to be. Then 
 I inquired around to see how I was. I reported an 
 abrasion on the left hip, and a contusion on the lower end 
 of my back. Then I thought I would pronounce a left- 
 handed blessing on that mule, on forefathers and fore- 
 mothers before him, and on children after him. But I 
 didn't. I wondered if he would stand fire. If I had had 
 a pistol, I would have put the muzzle to his ear and tried 
 him. Not that I was hostile toward him, but I was 
 afraid somebody might take a ride on him some day and 
 get hurt. But I had no pistol, so that benevolent san- 
 guinary idea was frustrated. Then I got up and shook 
 the dust oflf my feet, and brushed the sand off my trous-

 ers, as a testimony against that place. Then I led the 
 mule carefully home, and stated my case to the livery 
 man. But when I looked that he should offer to send for 
 a doctor or a Samaritan to do me up in a rag, and pour 
 olive oil and champagne on my bruises, he only laughed. 
 And his man that he had to help him laid down on a 
 bench and laughed — then rolled off the bench and 
 laughed. It was ridiculous. But I've learned a little 
 wisdom. Next time I ride on horseback it will be a dif- 
 ferent kind of beast from a mule. 
 
 TOUSSAINT L'OUVERTURE. 
 
 WENDELL PHILLIPS. 
 
 If I stood here to tell you the story of Napoleon, I 
 should take it from the lips of Frenchmen, who find no 
 language rich enough to paint the great captain of the 
 nineteenth century. Were I to tell you the story of 
 Washington, I should take it from your hearts, — you, 
 who think no marble white enough on which to carve the 
 name of the Father of his country. But I am to tell you 
 the story of a negro who has left hardly one written line. 
 I am to glean it from the reluctant testimony of Britons, 
 Frenchmen, Spaniards, — men who despised him as a 
 negro and a slave, and hated him because he had beaten 
 them in battle. All the materials for his biography are 
 from the lips of his enemies. Let us pause a moment, 
 and find something to measure him by. You remember 
 Macaulay says, comparing Cromwell with Napoleon, that

 Cromwell showed the greater military genius, if we con- 
 sider that he never saw an army until he was forty ; while 
 Napoleon was educated from a boy in the best military 
 schools in Europe. Cromwell manufactured his own 
 army ; Napoleon at the age of twenty-seven was placed at 
 the head of the best troops Europe ever saw. They were 
 both successful; but, says Macaulay, with such disad- 
 vantages, the Englishmen showed the greater genius. 
 Whether you allow the inference or not, you will at least 
 grant that it is a fair mode of measurement. Apply it 
 to this negro. Cromwell never saw an army till he was 
 forty; this man never saw a soldier till he was fifty. 
 Cromwell manufactured his own army — out of what? 
 Englishmen, — ^the best blood in Europe. Out of the 
 middle class of Englishmen, — ^the best blood of the isl- 
 and. And with it he conquered what? Englishmen, — 
 their equals. This man manufactured his army out of 
 what? Out of what you call the despicable race of ne- 
 groes, debased, demoralized by two hundred years of 
 slavery, one hundred thousand of them, imported into 
 the island within four years, unable to speak a dialect in- 
 telligible even to each other. Yet out of this mixed, and, 
 as you say, despicable mass, he forged a thunderbolt 
 and hurled it at what? At the proudest blood in Eu- 
 rope, the Spaniard, and sent him home conquered ; at the 
 most warlike blood in Europe, the French, and put them 
 under his feet; at the pluckiest blood in Europe, the 
 English, and they skulked home to Jamaica. Now, if 
 Cromwell was a general, this man at least was a soldier. 
 1 know it was a small territory ; it was not as large as 
 the continent; but it was as large as that Attica which.

 with Athens for a capital, has filled the earth with its 
 fame for two thousand years. We measure genius by 
 ^ality, not by quantity. 
 
 Further, — Cromwell was only a soldier; his fame 
 Stopped there. Not one line in the statute-book of Brit- 
 ain can be traced to Cromwell ; not one step in the social 
 life of England finds its motive power in his brain. The 
 state he founded went down with him to his grave. But 
 this man no sooner put his hand on the helm of State 
 than the ship steadied with an upright keel, and he began 
 to evince a statesmanship as marvelous as his military 
 genius. 
 
 He was a negr-o. You say that is superstitious blood. 
 He was uneducated. You say that makes a man narrow- 
 minded. And yet — ^negro, and a slave — ^he took his place 
 by the side of Roger Williams, and said to his committee : 
 "Make it the first line of my constitution that I know 
 no difference between religious beliefs." Now, blue-eyed 
 Saxon, proud of your race, go back with me to the com- 
 mencement of the century, and select what statesman 
 you please. Let him be either American or European; 
 let him have a brain the result of six generations of cult- 
 ure; let him have the ripest training of university rou- 
 tine; let him add to it the better education of practical

 Peel fifty years, and taking his station by the side of 
 Roger Williams before any Englishman or American 
 had won the right; — and yet this^ is the record which 
 the history of rival States makes up for this inspired 
 black of St. Domingo. 
 
 Above the lust of gold, pure in private life, generous 
 in the use of his power, it was against such a man that 
 Napoleon sent his army, giving to General Leclerc (the 
 husband of his beautiful sister Pauline) thirty thousand 
 of his best troops, with orders to reintroduce slavery. 
 
 Holland lent sixty ships. England promised by a spe- 
 cial message to be neutral; and you know neutrality 
 means sneering at freedom, and sending arms to tyrants. 
 England promised neutrality, and the black looked out 
 on the whole civilized world marshalled against him. 
 America, full of slaves, of course was hostile, only the 
 Yankee sold him poor muskets at a very high price. 
 Mounting his horse, and riding to the eastern end of the 
 island, Samana, he looked out on a sight such as no native 
 had ever seen before. Sixty ships of the line, crowded 
 by the best soldiers of Europe, rounded the point. They 
 were soldiers who had never yet met an equal, whose 
 tread, like Caesar's, had shaken Europe, — soldiers who 
 had scaled the Pyramids, and planted the French ban- 
 ners on the walls of Rome. He looked a moment, count- 
 ed the flotilla, let the reins fall on the neck of his horse, 
 and, turning to Christophe, exclaimed: "All France is 
 come to Hayti; they can only come to make us slaves; 
 and we are lost !" He then recognized the only mistake 
 of his life, — his confidence in Bonaparte, which had led 
 him to disband hi$ army.

 Returning to the hills, he issued the only proclamation 
 which bears his name and breathes vengeance: "My 
 children, France comes to make us slaves. God gave us 
 liberty ; France has no right to take it away. Burn the 
 cities, destroy the harvests, tear up the roads with can- 
 non, poison the wells, show the white man the hell he 
 comes to make ;" — and he was obeyed. When the great 
 William of Orange saw Louis XIV. cover Holland with 
 troops, he said, "Break down the dikes; give Holland 
 back to the ocean ;" and Europe said, "Sublime 1" When 
 the Alexander saw the armies of France descend upon 
 Russia, he said, "Burn Moscow, starve back the invad- 
 ers;" and Europe said, "Sublime!" This black saw all 
 Europe marshalled to crush him, and gave to his people 
 the same heroic example of defiance. 
 
 Some doubt the courage of the negro. Go to Hayti, 
 and stand on those fifty thousand graves of the best 
 soldiers France ever had, and ask them what they think 
 of the negro's sword. And if that does not satisfy you, 
 go to France, to the splendid mausoleum of the Counts 
 of Rochambeau, and to the eight thousand graves of 
 Frenchmen who skulked home under the English flag, 
 and ask them. 
 
 There never was a slave rebellion successful but once, 
 and that was in St. Domingo. Every race has been, some- 
 time or other, in chains. But there never was a race 
 that, weakened and degraded by such chattel slavery, 
 unaided, tore off its own fetters, forged them into swords 
 and won its liberty on the battle-field, but one, and that 
 was the black race of St. Domingo. 
 
 I would call him Napoleon, but Napoleon made his

 way to empire over broken oaths and through a sea of 
 blood. This man never broke his word. "No RetaHa- 
 tion" was his great motto and the rule of his life; and 
 the last words uttered to his son in France were these: 
 "My boy, you will one day go back to St. Domingo; 
 forget that France murdered your father." I would 
 call him Cromwell, but Cromwell was only a soldier, and 
 the State he founded went down with him into his grave. 
 I would call him Washington, but the great Virginian 
 held slaves. This man risked his empire rather than 
 permit the slave-trade in the humblest village of his 
 dominions. 
 
 You think me a fanatic to-night, for you read history, 
 not with your eyes, but with your prejudices. But fifty 
 years hence, when Truth gets a hearing, the Muse of 
 History will put Phocion for the Greek, and Brutus for 
 the Roman, Hampden for England, Fayette for France^ 
 choose Washington as the bright, consummate flower of 
 our earlier civilization, then, dipping her pen in the sun- 
 light, will write in the clear blue, above them all, the 
 name of the soldier, the statesman, the martyr, Toussaint 
 L'Ouverture,
