TO THE PUBLIC 
 
 The veteran and well-known elocutionist, Professor Bronson, 
 left at his death a large quantity of manuscript, embracing matter 
 on all the principles involved in voice-culture, reading, and speak- 
 ing. It was found, upon examination, that much condensation 
 and arrangement of these papers were necessary. This has been 
 a labor requiring time, care, and experience. The result is now 
 before the public. 
 
 The pieces selected for readings, with the emphatic words 
 and rhetorical pauses indicated, are culled from a large quantity 
 thus prepared by him. Any person who attempts to describe 
 accurately an action or vibratory movement of body or limb, in 
 writing, will, realize to a small extent the difficulty an author 
 experiences in attempting to convey on paper, in a comprehensible 
 manner, an idea of the tones of the human voice — its force, its 
 melody, its multiplicity of shades and intonations. It is some- 
 thing like an attempt to cage the wind. As the dancing-master 
 can show by one movement of his foot what he could not fully 
 explain in a dozen pages of a treatise, so the elocutionist in a few 
 spoken words, or waves of voice, can elucidate a principle which 
 many pages of printed matter could not make clear to the mind 
 of his pupil. 
 
 And yet the necessity for the treatise remains — a Manual of 
 Principles is demanded as a text-book for both teacher and pupil.

4 TO THE PUBLIC. 
 
 To meet in some degree this demand these essays and principles 
 are given to the public, with the natural wish of any one who 
 takes charge of a work of this character that, instead of being a 
 mute, it had a voice and could speak. 
 
 However irrelevant may appear to the novitiate some of the 
 things suggested in this book as useful for practice, he may be 
 assured that the experience of the author during almost a life- 
 time of teaching has found them not only necessary, but fruitful 
 of good results; and nothing but what has been proved to be 
 altogether essential has found place in this work.

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 
 
 CHAPTER I. 
 
 Reading — Breath — Speech — Air — Manner of Breathing. 
 
 The elements and principles of reading and speaking have been 
 arranged in essays, for reading-lessons ; so that they can not by any 
 possibility be overlooked or neglected by either teacher or pupil. 
 They constitute the important part of the work, and are not placed 
 here simply to fill a book. 
 
 The want of a knowledge of these principles is very obvious. It 
 is difficult to find the public speaker or elocutionist who does not 
 exhibit a lack of proper training in articulation and pronunciation, 
 to say nothing of the higher and more elegant graces of the art of 
 delivery. By the unprofessional, particularly the youths of our land, 
 the sounds of letters are things not taken into consideration. But if 
 teachers and parents are ignorant, we should not chastise the children. 
 
 One of the most eifective sounds of our language is almost entirely 
 ignored by a large class of persons — the r; and we could spare almost 
 any other subvowel better; for, when properly enunciated, it gives 
 dignity to the language — when neglected, the result is weakness and 
 affectation. 
 
 We therefore make the Elements of Speech the prominent feature 
 of this work. 
 
 To become a good reader involves certain conditions which must 
 be complied with or excellence can not be achieved in this art. 
 
 The first condition is to have developed a clear, round, smooth 
 voice; the second is a perfect control of the vocal organs, com- 
 prising a distinct articulation of all the elements of sound as expressed 
 by the letters of our alphabet; third, perfect self-possession. "No 
 man can serve two masters." If fear or distrust of our powers has 
 the control, art can not be represented.

 "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and 
 breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man became a 
 living soul." How wonderful is breath! this simple motion of air; 
 this mysterious, active agent, invisibly, silently vitalizing and animating 
 nature — pulsations cease or beat — life comes or goes on its wings. With 
 it are woven the sweet words of affection and the melodies of song. 
 
 When our hearts are stirred with responsive sympathies, these gush 
 forth in accents of speech, coined in tender phrases, borne from 
 lip to ear, from soul to soul, by this gentle messenger, this slender 
 stream of air, called breath. Let us reverence it — let it come to us 
 freely, fully, joyfully. Yet it is nothing but air — air that is common 
 every-where. It plays wantonly with the mighty monarchs of the 
 forest, kissing and swaying their branches with rough caress, till they 
 reel and laugh with hoarse mutterings of delight. Again, swollen to 
 the fierce hurricane, it makes fearful music of their crashing limbs 
 and snapping trunks. 
 
 It comes to us in the soft summer morning laden with the perfume 
 of flowers ; but ere it reaches us it has kissed a thousand scented leaves. 
 The birds soar aloft in this mysterious ether, pouring their triumphal 
 songs on its resonant bosom; and the butterfly and buzzing insect, 
 "like winged flowers and flying gems," sparkle and shimmer in their 
 dazzling beauty. 
 
 But whether it brings upon its waves the mutterings of the coming 
 storm, or the merry, ringing laugh of childhood — the awful booming 
 of the heavy cannonade, or the silvery tones of the violin — it is air, 
 such as we breathe. Oh ! then let it become a thing of joy to us — this 
 great motive power, charging with ceaseless activities the complicated 
 machinery of our bodies. Let us learn to make it a thing of beauty, 
 wreathing embodied thoughts in vocal gems of purity and sweetness 
 that shall gladden the ears of all who listen. 
 
 Breathing, — breathing sweet and strong, 
 Breathing, — breathing deep and long, 
 Breathing full, and breathing fair, 
 Breathing naught but purest air. 
 
 Speech is vocalized breath. If the pupil has not learned to breathe 
 naturally, or through bad habits has lost the proper control of the 
 organs, the first effort must be to restore a normal process of breathing. 
 No clear, musical sound can be given unless the muscles of the chest 
 and vocal organs are strong by the exercise of natural breathing. A 
 feeble or imperfect voice is always disagreeable and sometimes painful 
 to the hearer.

 Air, of which breath is made, should be inhaled through the nose. 
 Be it distinctly understood that this is the appropriate organ to receive, 
 warm, and filter the air of impurities, adapting it to the use of the 
 lungs. The nose is suitably lined with a material that catches the 
 minutest particles of dust and all irritating substances, preventing 
 them from reaching the air-passages and lungs. The mouth is not 
 thus prepared, because it has other specific purposes and uses. One 
 of these is to keep the vocal organs moist and soft for the act of talk- 
 ing. The air, unfiltered, as received through this channel, deposits 
 its impurities in the saliva, drying it, and causing a stiffness of the 
 membranes, producing inflexibility of muscle and consequent huski- 
 ness of voice. It visits the lungs cold and unclean, forcing the delicate 
 cells to receive it unprepared for their use, thus effectually sowing 
 seeds for all throat and lung affections. Avoid breathing through the 
 mouth if you desire health and a sweet, smooth-toned vocality. 
 
 Another reason why the air should be received through the nose 
 is that by this effort a natural motion of the muscles of the abdomen 
 is produced, allowing them to vibrate with ease; whereas breathing 
 through the mouth incites a gasping effort, producing an expansion 
 of the upper part of the lungs only, causing an unnatural elevation 
 of the shoulders, leaving the lower part of the lungs unexpanded, 
 and consequently unvitalized with air. 
 
 Stand erect, resting the weight of the body gracefully on the left 
 foot; throw the shoulders and head back, not strainedly, but with 
 sufficient .dignity to allow the diaphragm ease of action ; place the 
 hands upon the hips, with the fingers pressing upon the abdomen, 
 the thumbs extending backward, and with the mouth shut breathe 
 through the nose, forcing the breath down until the motion can be 
 distinctly felt under the fingers. Let this practice be repeated until 
 this long, full breathing becomes a habit. 
 
 When we are sitting at ease, and not using the voice, our breathing 
 is slow and regular; but the more we exercise, speak, or sing, the 
 greater the expenditure of breath, and consequently the more fre- 
 quently we must inhale fresh air. Many persons fall victims to a 
 neglect of this practice ; and little there is in the present method of 
 primary instruction in reading, in our schools, calculated to give any 
 aid to proper breathing. Indeed, it is not considered as having any 
 part in making good readers and speakers ; the results of which are 
 many exceedingly bad habits and unvitalized bodies. 
 
 We shall treat more fully of this subject when we come to Em- 
 phasis, Rhetorical expression, and the Music of the voice.

 CHAPTER II. 
 
 Laughing — Breath and Voice-sounds — Practice for expulsion of 
 Breath — Sighing. 
 
 The effort of laughing is a valuable gymnastic exercise, and when 
 moderately indulged in strengthens the vocal muscles, and much facil- 
 itates a healthy circulation of the blood, a good flow of genial spirits, 
 and a happy disposition. 
 
 A good, round, full, hearty Ha — ha — hah is a delightful expulsion 
 of sound, a stout enemy to the "blue devils," and a far better remedy 
 for dyspepsia than Graham-bread and tepid milk and water, with the 
 condiment of woeful countenance. So, we will commence on the 
 lowest line, right heartily, with a 
 
 2. HAH, hah, hah! 
 
 1. HAH, hah, hah! 
 
 But even this must be indulged in with care and moderation at the 
 commencement; for the lungs, diaphragm, and abdominal muscles, 
 which are obliged to make strenuous exertions in this effort, are in 
 most persons very weak. The complete exhaustion of air, consequent 
 upon throwing out the breath, and the full, strong inhalation that 
 follows, bring into requisition, for contraction and distension, the 
 entire capacity of the muscles. Therefore discretion is necessary to 
 guard against over-exertion at first. The unfortunate and hurtful 
 fashions in clothing, and the various unnatural habits, have produced 
 a weakness of these organs in our American youth. But we hope to 
 laugh all artificial bandages and customs out of countenance; and 
 we even dare to dream that the day will come when a sweet, clear, 
 strong, perfectly-attuned voice may be considered one of the personal 
 adornments. 
 
 The teacher should require the pupil to make selections from authors, 
 or furnish compositions of their own, where laughing is introduced; 
 which should be practiced until it becomes easy to give a seemingly 
 spontaneous laugh whenever required. 
 
 Although it is an easy matter to laugh when one feels like it, it is 
 not so easy to laugh at command. Simply repeating the words ha, ha, 
 


## p. 15 (#21) ##############################################

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 15 
 
 when the printed letters are seen, is not laughing. It will be well to 
 employ the musical scale in this and other exercises, and when con- 
 venient practice with the aid of some musical instrument, running up 
 and down the scale, giving two or three hearty ha-hahs on each note ; 
 but bear in mind this must be done with the laughing explosion, not 
 with the singing effort. Then laugh the third, fifth, seventh, and 
 back again, gaining all the varieties of exercises possible. 
 
 A sweet, musical laugh is always delightful to the ear, and sun- 
 shine and gladness follow in its wake. But we seldom hear it, and 
 so seldom do we indulge in this healthful expression of joy or merri- 
 ment, when we do lose our gravity sufficiently to give way to it, it 
 amounts as a general thing to nothing more than a well-defined titter 
 or giggle, which is disgusting in the extreme. While the little events 
 of life make up the most of our joys and sorrows, let us cultivate 
 those things that make ourselves and those around us happiest, and at 
 the same time that will add most to our accomplishments. 
 
 The whispering exercise also must receive a great deal of practice, 
 and in such a manner as will produce no unpleasant sensations in the 
 throat. The breath must be husbanded with great care, and its 
 expulsion be moderate and even, to enable the pupil to acquire the 
 power of filling a large hall with a clear, smooth whisper. No fears 
 need be entertained that too much attention can be paid to these 
 breath-sounds; for it is only by properly regulated inhalations and 
 exhalations that we can achieve the best results for the voice. To 
 neglect this important first step, and expect to attain excellence, 
 would be as futile as to attempt to run before the strength of the 
 limbs had been tested by the act of walking. By carefully observing 
 in these efforts the various movements of the muscles and the position 
 of the organs, we learn what our resources are. 
 
 To make a breath-sound open wide the mouth and breathe out the 
 word hah with as long and loud a whisper as can be produced. 
 
 Ha 1 — i 1__ __h 
 
 This breath-sound vocalized is the material out of which all voice- 
 sounds are made, both of speech and song. We must conclude, from 
 our experience in practicing this sound, that ha, produced by simply 
 opening the mouth and breathing it out naturally, is the radical sound 
 of language. We can not, with any degree of safety, declare that 
 either the aspirate h or the vowel a hold any such position independ- 
 ently; for if we utter a sound in breathing without an attempt at 
 forming words, it will partake of this aspirate and the vowel a, as

 in ah. Therefore if this is a primitive sound, it is so only by the 
 perfect union of the aspirate and vowel. 
 
 Persons laboring under the weight of some great affliction, or 
 who are depressed with sorrow, give expression to their feelings by 
 sighing the sound hah. Sometimes it is aspirated and sometimes 
 voiced. 
 
 If very heavy and drowsy, they yawn and gape out the Ha — ha — 
 ha — ha — . If boisterously merry, they laugh with explosive force 
 the Ha-hah-hah-hah. And the infuriated wild animal slightly com- 
 presses the glottis, and with set teeth trills, in a rough growl, over 
 nis tongue tne jLi.£L*~~*~*****^^~^~*^*~**i+~ri. d3««w(w>«wwww»vvww,ii, 
 
 It is important in practicing the prolonged expulsive sounds that 
 they be measured by keeping time. "When several persons are prac- 
 ticing together they should preserve unity by expelling the sounds on 
 the same tone and in the same measure. This can be done in any of 
 the usual ways, or by dropping the finger an inch for the first beat, 
 another inch for the second beat ; then by raising it one inch for the 
 third beat, and another for the fourth one ; occupying a w T hole, half, 
 or quarter of a second for each motion, according to intention and 
 desired effect. 
 
 First make the breath-sound one measure long ; then condense it 
 in a voice-sound for one more measure; then give another measure 
 for the breath-sound; closing the last with the voice-sound. The 
 time can be prolonged by an additional number of beats, as strength 
 and facility in prolongation are gained. 
 
 To acquire the habit of taking the quantity of breath necessary, 
 and also to gain the control over the muscles of respiration that will 
 allow of making two prolonged aspirate and two voice-sounds with 
 one breath, is attended with more difficulty than is supposed. The 
 experiment, however, will convince us that hard work and persistent 
 efforts will be required. 
 
 It will be well for the pupil to observe this distinction of breath 
 and vocal-sounds; for herein lies the secret of successful elocution. 
 As before stated, out of the breath-sounds we make all the aspirates 
 in our language, and by converting breath into voice-sound we make 
 all the vowel and subvow T el-sounds. 
 
 Practicing the expulsion of breath, vocalized or unvocalized, in a 
 given length of time is one of the best methods of gaining that 
 desired strength, depth, and clearness of tone that makes us masters 
 of the voice on all occasions. Therefore we ask that practice be be- 
 stowed on this sound of ah until it can be obtained prolonged, clear,

 and strong enough to fill the room. This exercise must be repeated 
 many times to enable us to make the sound easily and musically; 
 and though we never use these prolonged sounds in conversation, they 
 are very essential as vocal gymnastics. It will be readily inferred 
 that to the singer and public speaker such exercises are of incalculable 
 benefit. 
 
 The sigh, which occurs in some compositions, expressive of great 
 grief and despair, when repeated — as, ah, ah, ah — should not be given 
 on the same pitch, but with a full expression, in vocalized breath, in 
 the minor key, falling a half tone on each ; as, 
 
 ah — 
 ah — 
 ah. 
 
 In that exquisite poem by Mrs. Browning, the f< Mother and Poet," 
 which is full of broken-hearted grief, this peculiar sighing occurs ; and 
 if not properly expressed the poem loses its force. 
 
 "Tell his mother. Ah, ah, 'his,' 'their' mother, — not 'mine.' 
 No voice says '■My mother' again to me." . . . 
 [Minor) "Ah — ah — ah, when Gaeta's taken, what then? 
 
 When the fair, wicked queen sits no more at her sport, 
 Of the fire-balls of death crushing souls out of men? 
 When the guns of Cavalli, with final retort, 
 Have cut the game short?" 
 
 Sighing is an emotional effort, sometimes expressing simple weari- 
 ness, sometimes a lover's passion, but frequently it is the utterance 
 of a great grief that does not express itself in words. All of these 
 phases should be studied if the pupil desires to give a full and satis- 
 factory rendering of the various thoughts and emotions with which the 
 broad field of literature is diversified. Much observation and critical 
 discrimination must be brought to bear in the practice of elocution. 
 Every phase of human feeling should be studied as it expresses itself 
 in the trials and experiences of life. We have given some examples 
 in ah (or more properly, ha.) We hear this frequently expressed in 
 0, oh, ho. Sometimes we call it groaning or moaning. Little thought 
 has been given to these audible upheavings of the swelling heart. 
 0, oh, is more indicative of personal pain, the anguish of self-remorse; 
 while ah, ah, expresses hopeless grief caused by outside affliction. 
 
 "Lady Macbeth — Here's the smell of the blood still. All the perfumes of 
 Arabia will not sweeten this little hand. Oh! oh! oh! 
 
 Doctor — What a sigh is there ! The heart is sorely charged."

 A sigh, when it emanates from the lover's breast, is expressive of 
 the sweetest, tenderest sensibility. Moore immortalized this emotional 
 breath by making it one of the three offerings which the beautiful and 
 sorrowing Peri presented at the gates of Paradise — hoping it was the 
 gift most dear to heaven which would gain her entrance within its 
 golden portals. She watches the tender devotion of a beautiful maiden, 
 who is breathing out her life in one long, loving kiss on the dead lips 
 of her affianced husband. 
 
 " 'Sleep,' said the Peri, as softly she stole 
 
 The farewell sigh of that vanishing soul, 
 
 As true — as e'er warmed a woman's breast — 
 
 Sleep on, in visions of odor rest, 
 
 In balmier airs than ever yet stirr'd 
 
 Th' enchanted pile of that lonely bird, 
 
 "Who sings at the last — his own — death — lay; 
 
 And in music — and perfume dies away ! ' 
 
 Thus saying, from her lips she spread 
 
 Unearthly breathings through the place, 
 
 And shook her sparkling wreath, and shed 
 
 Such luster o'er each paly face, 
 
 That like two lovely saints they seemed 
 
 Upon the eve of doomsday taken 
 
 From their dim graves, in odor sleeping; 
 
 "While that benevolent Peri bearrid 
 
 Like their good angel, calmly keeping 
 
 Watch o'er them till their souls would waken." 
 
 CHAPTER III. 
 
 The Philosophy of Vocalization — The Larynx — The Voice — Speech — 
 Language — The Alphabet — Three distinct Classes or Letters. 
 
 It is not deemed necessary to encumber these pages with engrav- 
 ings exhibiting the anatomical construction of the vocal and articu- 
 lating organs, while such are already within the reach of any person 
 who will take the pains to open any work on physiology. Every body 
 possesses in perfection the instrument in which voice-sound is made. 
 So wonderful and elaborate is it in construction, so delicate in its 
 proportions, that for ages it has both puzzled and stimulated the 
 ingenuity of man to construct something that would approximate to 
 its tones.

 Physiologists have named this vocal pipe the larynx, which forms 
 a portion of the respiratory channel, and is not three inches in length 
 perhaps ; and they have given us many elaborate theories to sustain 
 their own ideas as to what kind of an instrument the human larynx 
 is like. Aristotle and Galen, and the older writers in general, looked 
 upon the larynx as a wind-instrument of the flute kind. Fabricius 
 w r as among the first to object to this view of the subject. 
 
 It is stated that about the commencement of the last century 
 Dodart laid before the Academy of Sciences of Paris three memoirs 
 on the theory of the voice, in which he considered the larynx to be 
 a wind-instrument of the horn and not of the flute kind. Ferrein, 
 in a communication also made to the Academy of Sciences, maintained 
 that the larynx is a stringed instrument — each giving w 7 hat seemed to 
 him plausible arguments to sustain his theory. At a later period, 
 even to the present day, a large number of physiologists regard the 
 larnyx as a wind-instrument of the reed kind, such as the clarionet 
 or hautboy. 
 
 We have given quite a variety of opinions, sufficient to show that 
 the larynx is consrdefediry men of science quite a complicated instru- 
 ment. We shall differ from them in one essential point, which is that 
 it is not like any of the aforesaid instruments ; but the degree of likeness 
 of each is to be placed on the instruments that most fully imitate 
 the qualities of the voice; for the larynx is the king of instru- 
 ments — the grand model, fashioned by the Divine hand, animated by 
 a presiding spirit, stamped with the seal of perfection, and which man 
 must be ever content to imitate without the hope of equaling. The 
 crowning excellence of all inventions must ever lie in their nearness 
 of approach to its wonderful capacities. Yet it is a delicate little 
 instrument, nicely packed away out of sight — a miniature affair, too 
 common to be appreciated, because every person is in possession 
 of one. 
 
 Many long years are required, and freely given, to enable persons 
 to achieve excellence in performing on musical instruments, and many 
 years of valuable time are spent in acquiring a knowledge of the dead 
 languages, and also to master the orthography of our own — an orthog- 
 raphy which we might reasonably wish were dead; while the ani- 
 mating and vitalizing spirit of our own tongue — the sweet musical 
 tones of speech, the delightful avenue of expression through which 
 the tenderest and best of life's joys are exchanged — is neglected and 
 abused, without the slightest compunctions of conscience. Had we 
 cultivated voices, music would flow from human lips in speech as well

 as in song, and the pleasure of social intercourse would be enhanced 
 tenfold. 
 
 The little vocal pipe wherein voice-sound is produced forms a 
 portion of the respiratory channel, and its entire management comes 
 under the control of respiratory and muscular action. 
 
 \Ye inhale air and exhale breath. We can do so for an indefinite 
 period of time and produce no sound ; but by volition, so simple we 
 are scarcely conscious that we make it, this breath ripples with sound 
 freighted with thought. Music, the emotions and passions, the tones 
 of tenderness and love, and the shrieks of fear, are borne on its 
 invisible wings. 
 
 By what process is this achieved? Why do we make one breath 
 without sound and the next one vocal with ideas? How does it 
 become a motive power of communication from person to person? 
 We mav sit in a vast church filled with human beings — breathing 
 creatures — and a death-like silence prevail. One single voice bursts 
 forth in song and the atmosphere is filled with sound, the whole 
 superstructure seems alive with melody, and all the delicious variety 
 and sweetness of tones are made by air-waves caused by breath 
 playing on the vocal chords. 
 
 It is said that the voice is an effort of volition ; so it is, and so also 
 are all the efforts we make. But the place and manner of producing 
 voice-sounds are matters of some importance to those who have weak 
 voices, or are suffering from bad management or loss of voice. 
 
 To explain, in the simplest manner possible, how voice is produced, 
 we will say that by volition the chords at the bell-like cavity of the 
 larynx contract so as to collect and retain in the larynx the exhaling 
 column of air, and the expulsion of this concentrated breath plays on 
 the vocal chords, causing their vibration. The principle is that of the 
 Eolian harp. The waves of air sent rapidly out through the mouth 
 produce a sound we call voice, and all sounds made in this way 
 are denominated voice-sounds. Perhaps the nearest thing we can 
 refer to toward illustrating the manner in which the vocal chords 
 contract, and at the same time to show the power which the con- 
 centrated breath displays when forced through a small aperture. 
 it< susceptibility of modulation into a great variety of tones, is the 
 set of whistling. The flexibility and contractility of the lips in some 
 persons is truly wonderful, but of course not so much so as in the 
 chords of the glottis. In the whistling act there is wanting the bell 
 or round-shaped cavities of the mouth and larynx to give resonance 
 to the vibrations.

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 21 
 
 It will be observed that inueli talk is frequently indulged in about 
 chest-tones and head-tones, to designate the grave and acute sounds. 
 All this is simply absurd, as all voice-sounds are made in the same 
 place — neither in the head nor in the chest, but in the glottis, by the 
 vibrations of the chordce vocales, before referred to. 
 
 There are a given number of vibrations in each note of the scale 
 or gamut, and the pitch of a sound always depends upon the number 
 of air-waves or vibrations which produce it. These determine the 
 tone, and any variation in number changes the pitch. The range of 
 voice, in degree from high to low, depends upon the ability one has 
 of contracting and relaxing the vocal chords. The fewer the vibra- 
 tions the graver the sound, and vice versa. Loudness of voice depends 
 upon the extent of the vibrations, and these again will depend alto- 
 gether upon the quality of the air and the force with which it is 
 driven through the larynx. 
 
 But the purity of tone depends upon the regularity or evenness 
 of the air-waves. There is, however, what we denominate a pitch of 
 voice which is peculiar to each one of us, and is as designative as any 
 other individual characteristic. Every one finds that there is a range 
 of tones on which it is easier or more natural to speak than on any 
 other. This can not and should not be interfered with, although the 
 greatest possible range above and below may be cultivated. 
 
 Speech is made of a great variety of vocal and breath-sounds ; and 
 by these sounds, joined or woven together into words and sentences, we 
 convey our thoughts and feelings to each other. This we call artificial 
 language, because it has been sanctioned by long use, and is agreed 
 upon, and remains as yet the only systematic method by which, as 
 human, intelligent beings, we converse and make known our desires. 
 We also have symbols of these sounds, or a system of notation, by 
 which we convey all these thoughts, desires, and emotions by what we 
 denominate written language. This table of notation is with us the 
 English alphabet, whose twenty-six letters, as before stated, are sup- 
 posed to stand as symbols or representatives of the various sounds in 
 the English language. Unfortunately, however, this table is sadly 
 imperfect and fatal to any systematic method of orthography or pro- 
 nunciation. For instance, we say that a has four regular sounds, 
 which is an utter impossibility. The letter a could, with as much 
 truth, stand as a representative of the sixteen vowel-sounds as for 
 the four sounds it now symbolizes. The broad and short sound of a 
 have no nearer similarity in sound to each other than they have to 
 any other vowel-sound. This want of a distinct character for each

 sound loaves us entirely without a basis upon which to construct a 
 system of pronunciation which would be orderly and satisfactory. 
 
 The eye and ear need the same training. They must be taught in 
 harmony, else the results will be imperfect. If the letter a always 
 stood for a simple sound, having once learned it, the eye would recog- 
 nize it, and the voice know at once what sound to make. Now it 
 must have some person's authority, who has several other backers of 
 equal authority; and if these are not at hand, it must venture a guess 
 of one sound out of four, and run the gauntlet of ridicule if the guess 
 do not hit upon the sanctioned sound. Perhaps no one realizes the 
 painful vexations which result from this more than the teacher of 
 elocution. However, we can only enter our protest, and then do our 
 best with the material we have. 
 
 AVe will now return to the letters, and divide them into three dis- 
 tinct classes.

 CHAPTER IV. 
 
 The Vowels — The English Alphabet — Vowels and Aspirates — Vibra- 
 tions oe Atmosphere in Speaking and Singing — Vowel-sounds the 
 motive power op speech. 
 
 The letters a, e, i, o, u, y, are called vowels. These vowels we 
 will call vocalized breath-sound. They are the only pure voice- 
 sounds which we have, and constitute the musical material of both 
 speech and song, and are embodied in all passional and emotional 
 expressions of voice. They are free, open sounds, the simplest ones 
 we make, and are capable of great prolongation. 
 
 They are produced in the larynx, and derive their character of 
 sound by the position and shape of the mouth, tongue, and lips while 
 uttering them. 
 
 To render these sounds full, clear, and pure in tone, free from 
 nasal adulterations, and without running into a different vowel-sound, 
 is an important object to attain,* one that requires persistent care and 
 practice, and without which there can not be such a thing as a sweet 
 and musical voice. 
 
 This practice should be instituted as a daily exercise until the 
 abdominal and respiratory muscles work in perfect harmony with 
 the vocal chords, and all have gained sufficient strength and unity 
 of action to enable the pupil to prolong the sound in pure and even 
 tone ; also to increase it in great volume, and diminish again to an 
 almost imperceptible tone, yet preserving the evenness and uniformity 
 of the vibrations. 
 
 In our table of twenty-six letters, or English alphabet, we have 
 all the characters used in the broad and almost boundless field of 
 English literature. They also stand as representatives of all the 
 sounds we use in speech. It seems hardly possible, when we think 
 of the many words spoken and 'the hundreds of thousands of volumes 
 written, that these twenty-six letters should comprise all the material 
 used in this great work. Imperfect as they are, we may congratulate 
 ourselves that they have served so good and grand a purpose, and 
 that they have enabled us to accomplish so much. 
 
 * J is a combination of ah-e. In making and prolonging it the voice must glide into one 
 or the other of these sounds. It ought to be placed with the diphthongs.

 They tell us, either in written or spoken words, all we know of the 
 history of the earth on which we live and of the human family; all 
 we have learned of the progress of science and art. They give us 
 the ideal creations of the novelist and the poet. They are the me- 
 dium through which we have had transmitted to us the inspirations 
 of prophets and seers. And yet in our spoken language we have not 
 treated them well, and we continue every day to treat them not only 
 disrespectfully, but meanly; for we deprive them of the proper dis- 
 play of their great beauty by not articulating them clearly. 
 
 Now it is important that all should become acquainted with these 
 little symbols; study their forms and proportions as expressed in 
 sounds, and learn what are their specific uses. 
 
 The vowels have a mission specifically their own. The subvowels 
 and aspirates have quite another. 
 
 The vowels convey the full voice. All the vowels, when clearly 
 and fully uttered, vibrate nothing but voice-sound. They are used as 
 motive power to convey words from the speaker to the listener. We 
 might almost say we shoot words on these sounds. We will take for 
 illustration the word hope. Let us sound the long vowel o alone ; then 
 the apirates h and p by themselves; then unite them, and we find the 
 importance which is attached to voice vibrations. If we articulate 
 the aspirates by themselves, they can be heard but a few yards from 
 us ; but when uttered in connection with vowels they are easily dis- 
 tinguished at a comparatively great distance. 
 
 "Wonderful truths, and manifold as wondrous, 
 God hath written in the stars above; 
 But not less in the bright flowers under us 
 Stands the revelation of his love. 
 
 Gorgeous flowers in the sunlight shining, 
 
 Blossoms flaunting in the eye of day, 
 Tremulous leaves, with soft and silver lining, 
 
 Buds that open only to decay. 
 
 Brilliant hopes, all woven in gorgeous tissues, 
 
 Flaunting gaily in the golden light; 
 Large desires, with most uncertain issues, 
 
 Tender wishes blossoming at night. 
 
 These in flowers and men are more than seeming, 
 Workings are they of the self-same powers 
 
 Which the poet, in no idle dreaming, 
 Seeth in himself and in the flowers."

 A given number of vibrations make a particular note or tone, but 
 a forcible continuance of the tone makes pr6longation. Singing can 
 be heard farther than speaking, for the reason that there is a greater 
 prolongation of vowel-sounds in song than in speech. This is 
 philosophical. The atmosphere surrounding the earth, by a beautiful 
 and wise provision of our Creator, is made of vibratory and elastic 
 quality, which renders it the general receptacle and medium of sound. 
 Voice-sound being a sensation produced by tremulous motion, the 
 waves of air thus continuously agitated convey the pulsations to the 
 ear. Therefore the more forcible and continuous these pulsations the 
 farther the sound is conveyed. It is the rapid and continuous vibra- 
 tion of the vocal muscles that produce the prolongation of sound ; and 
 the more even the pulsation the smoother and more musical the tones. 
 
 If we speak, in an ordinary conversational pitch of voice, the 
 words hope or home, we find the vibrations of the vowels are stopped 
 in the mouth for the articulating organs to form the letters p and m ; 
 but if we sing the words, the vibrations are continued as long as we 
 dwell upon that particular note. In singing the articulatory sounds 
 are secondary to the vowel or emotional sounds; while in speaking 
 the expression of thought and ideas requires the clearly-defined expres- 
 sion of the constrained aspirate and sub vowel sounds. Therefore, if we 
 wish our voices to penetrate to great distances, we must use force that 
 will produce continuous vibrations, sufficient to carry the sound to the 
 desired point. If we have not power to do this, the sound of course 
 must stop exactly where the vibration or air-wave ceases. Let this 
 fact be distinctly impressed upon the minds of all who desire to 
 become public speakers. 
 
 Another fact must be remembered, which is, that it is one thing to 
 be heard and quite another thing to be understood. A speaker may 
 have great power in rolling out sounds, yet the aspirates and sub- 
 vowels may be so feebly given, or mouthed in such a slovenly way, as 
 to make the speech all sound and no sense. It is plain that the vowels 
 must receive great practice in regard to loudness, to length of tone, to 
 clearness of tone, to evenness in swelling and diminishing the same sound, 
 either for speaking or singing. 
 
 The vowel-sounds are the basis of spoken language, and subserve 
 a double purpose. They are not only the motive power of \speech, 
 but express the musical tones, and to a great degree the affectional 
 and passional elements. This will be readily seen if we notice the 
 utterances of animals and birds, also of children before they learn 
 to express their wants and desires by articulated words.

 CHAPTER V. 
 
 Vocal Gymnastics — Exercises in Accent and Emphasis — Sounds of 
 
 the Letter A. 
 
 Every pupil should be required to notice distinctly not only all the 
 specific sounds of our language, simple and compound, but also the 
 different and exact positions of the vocal organs necessary to produce 
 them. The teacher should unyieldingly insist upon having these 
 two things faithfully attended to ; for success in elocution and music 
 absolutely demands it. No one therefore should wish to be excused 
 from a full and hearty compliance. Master these elementary princi- 
 ples, and you will have command of all the mediums for communi- 
 cating your thoughts and feelings. 
 
 In practicing the following vocal-sounds the mouth must be as 
 wide open and the lips as free and expanded as the nature of the sound 
 will allow. The sounds must be made pure and strong, free from any 
 nasal taint ; the position of the body elevated enough to permit the 
 perfect and harmonious action of the dorsal and abdominal muscles. 
 
 When the sound is entirely emitted the mouth must be closed, and 
 the replenishing breath received slowly and moderately through the 
 nose. There must be no raising of the shoulders, nor any kind of 
 heaving or motion of the upper portions of the lungs; but an even 
 inhalation, that will contract the diaphragm and put in motion the 
 abdominal muscles. 
 
 The pupil in elocution and music is strongly urged to attend to the 
 right and the wrong method of producing the sounds of our letters, as 
 well as in enunciating words. By all means make the effort entirely 
 below the diaphragm, while the chest is comparatively at rest; and 
 as you value health and life, and good natural speaking, avoid the cruel 
 practice of exploding the sounds, by whomsoever taught or recommended. 
 The author's long experience and practice, with his sense of duty, justify 
 this protest against that unnatural manner of coughing out the sounds, 
 as it is called. Nine tenths of his hundreds of pupils whom he has 
 cured of the bronchitis have induced the disease by this exploding 
 process, which ought itself to be exploded.

 Bear constantly in mind that all sounds are made of vibrations of air. 
 We will vocalize the sound of a, thus : 
 
 Ha h. 
 
 We will next produce the vocal-sound, leaving off the aspirate, which 
 will give us the grave sound of a, commencing full and strong, grad- 
 ually diminishing in force and quantity of sound until it ceases. 
 
 Great care must be observed to make the a h expulsion 
 
 of the breath even, that the sound emitted may be smooth and pure, 
 bearing in mind that converting all the breath into sound gives purity 
 and sweetness ; whereas, if it is allowed to escape without being thus 
 used, a husky or rasping noise will accompany the voice-sound. After 
 having repeated a few times the example given, we will reverse the 
 effort; after which we will unite the swell and diminish; and then 
 reverse it. 
 
 These are daily exercises for the voice ; and in each succeeding 
 daily practice the endeavor should be to increase the volume and 
 length of sound ; but caution must be used, lest it fatigue the organs 
 too much. 
 
 For a second step in measure, we will divide the swell into half 
 the length, the teacher beating or counting the time. 
 
 " Then I heard a strain of music, 
 
 So mighty, so pure, so dear, 
 That my very sorrow was silent, 
 
 And my heart stood still to hear. 
 It rose in harmonious rushing 
 
 Of mingled voices and strings, 
 And I tenderly laid my message 
 
 On the music's outspread wings. 
 
 And I heard it float farther and farther, 
 
 In sound more perfect than speech; 
 Farther than sight can follow, 
 
 Farther than soul can reach. 
 And I know that at last my message 
 
 Has passed through the golden gate ; 
 So my heart is no longer restless, 
 
 And I am content to wait." 
 
 We will now practice on three notes of the scale involving the 
 diminish and swell. Commence softly on the second note, increasing 
 and slurring mip sl full swell on the first note; gradually diminish 
 and slur again to the second note, making it an almost imperceptible 
 sound ; rise to the third note, and descend in the same way, catching 
 breath at the diminishing note.

 To shorten this vocalized breath-sound cut it up for the formation 
 of words and syllables. We will repeat the word Ah a great many 
 times in quick succession, making three sounds at each effort: the 
 first one very loud, the second much fainter, and the third one a 
 mere echo of the second : An-a/i-ah. 
 
 In the examples just given we take the first step in forming words. 
 By giving stress or force to the first effort, lessening it on the second, 
 and letting the third receive the natural diminution of the sound, we 
 bring into use accent. In this second unaccented expulsion we get 
 the true sound of ah as used in all conditions where there is no partic- 
 ular stress needed. 
 
 Examples. — I saw a man and a "boy in a field after a horse, a cow, and 
 a sheep, while a hawk, a swallow, and a robin flew over them all. Charles 
 bought a large and a small apple for a cent of a woman who had a stall beside 
 a stream where a lad caught a pike, a roach, and a trout. Ah, alms, arch, ark, 
 arms, art, aunt, ardent, argue. 
 
 Here is an illustration of the manner in which words are enun- 
 ciated: AitT^-ly, ART-less-lj, ART-i-zan. 
 
 In these examples the accent is on the first syllable, while the others 
 are merely spoken loud enough to be heard. 
 
 In the following examples the accent is on the second syllable, the 
 first one being like the last sound of the preceding measure : Ap-PLi- 
 ance, so-NO-rom, be-HA v-ior. 
 
 The accented syllables should be as prominent to the ear as these 
 letters are to the eye. 
 
 " Let each cadence melt in languor 
 Softly on my ravished ears, 
 Till my half-closed eyes are brimming 
 With a rapture of sweet tears. 
 
 Summon back fond recollections, 
 
 Such as gentle sounds prolong; 
 Flights of memory embalming 
 
 In the amber of a song." 
 
 " Then read from the treasured volume 
 The poem of thy choice, 
 And lend to the rhyme of the poet 
 The beauty of thy voice. 
 
 And the night shall be filled with mus^c, 
 
 And the cares that infest the day 
 Shall fold their tents like the Arabs, 
 
 And as silently steal away."

 In expelling the vowel-sounds we find the first one in each measure 
 is strongly accented. Now this accent is the element of emphasis. Let 
 us give it several times, as heretofore, and increase in strength and 
 loudness in each succeeding effort. 
 
 A as in ale is the name sound of a, and must receive the same 
 kind and amount of practice as the preceding sound. Ace, ache, age. 
 This is always the sound of the article a when contrasted with the 
 word the; as, I said a man, not the man; a book, not the book; a horse, 
 not the horse ; a knife, not the knife ; a star, not the star. 
 
 Now let us again expel this sound, and instead of making the 
 emphasis, we will prolong the sound equally, as we did the first a. 
 
 Let us do the same, but give the swell and diminish instead of the 
 last equal long sound. 
 
 Let us notice particularly the important principles here indicated, 
 which are the expulsion of sounds, the accented and unaccented syllables, 
 the emphasis, and the measure of speech and song, for these elements are 
 involved in every word and sentence. The practice of these different 
 sounds, according to examples, is for drilling and educating the organs 
 to produce the sounds distinctly, clearly, and musically; and, as these 
 vowels are all distinct sounds, not one should be neglected. Pupils 
 might expect as rationally to perfect themselves in all the notes in 
 the musical scale by practicing one or two as to think to render all 
 these sounds correctly by practicing one or two of them. Each one 
 requires a different position of the organs, and, of course, exercise on 
 that position to insure strength of the class of muscles used. 
 
 The third sound of A is broad; and is so called because in making 
 it the mouth is, perpendicularly, more opened, or broader, than it is 
 when we make other sounds of the same letter. This is shown by 
 dropping and projecting the jaw, bringing the corners of the mouth 
 nearer together, and projecting the lips. Awe, all, awl, Al-ba-ny, 
 al-be-it, al-most, al-ter, al-ways, au-burn, au-dit, au-ger, au-thor, 
 au-tumn, aw-ful, pal-frey, wa-ter (not wot-ter, as many say.) 
 
 "Once the welcome light was broken, who shall say 
 "What the un imagined glories of the day? 
 "What the evil that shall perish in its ray? 
 
 Aid the dawning, tongue and pen; 
 
 Aid it, hopes of honest men; 
 
 Aid it, paper ; aid it, type ; 
 
 Aid it, for the hour is ripe, 
 And our earnest must not slacken into play. 
 Men of thought and men of action, clear the way I "

 We \vill practice these sounds as before, and see if we can not 
 improve our manner of giving them by making the accent and the 
 emphasis more prominent and musical: Awe — awe — awe. Being 
 careful to observe the important points in this exercise, let us repeat, 
 and give the long equal sound instead of the emphatic one. In 
 making all the long single sounds we must keep the mouth and lips 
 in the same position, from beginning to end, whether we make them 
 equal all the way, or give the swell and diminish. 
 
 The fourth sound of A is shoii, because we can not prolong it at all 
 without changing this peculiar characteristic, as may be seen by trying 
 it: ab, ac, ad, ap, ag, al, am, an, and, apt, as, ash, asp, at, ab-bot, 
 ac-cent, ag-ile, af-ter, al-ley, am-ple, An-na, ap-ple, ar-row, as-pen, 
 ax-es, hash, dash, can, fast, rash, sat, trap, rat, rams. Many incor- 
 rectly tell us to give a long, intermediate sound to this a, nearly like 
 the radical sound, as in fa-ther ; but this is entirely wrong, and comes 
 from their not opening the mouth properly, and bringing forward its 
 corners so as to avoid a very unpleasant nasal, whining sound. Thus 
 they run from one extreme into another. Beware of such mistakes in 
 this class of words — grasp, pass, etc. 
 
 In passing from the radical sound into a in all and ale, and in 
 gliding into a in at, we see in the former case that there is a continuous 
 sound, which is called long because it can be continued without altera- 
 tion ; while in the latter it was instantly stopped because it is a short 
 sound, and never can be prolonged in speech without being altered or 
 changed into something else. Let us try them again, and we shall see 
 the marked difference between long and short sounds. 
 
 To give the short sounds of a in mat, rat, cat, etc., open wide the 
 mouth, project the under jaw and lips, and let them play freely in 
 speaking such words as has, cast, etc. If any attempt is made to 
 prolong this sound in such words as his and hat, it will run into the 
 sound of e, as hah-et, hi-es. This short explosive sound can not be 
 made without a violent effort of the abdominal muscles. 
 
 " Poison be their drink, 
 Gall, — worse than gall, — the daintiest meat they taste; 
 Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees; 
 Their sweetest prospects — mouldering basalisks; 
 Their music frightful — as the serpent's hiss; 
 And boding screech-owls make the concert full." 
 
 "Though the mills of God grind slowly, yet they grind exceeding small; 
 Though with patience he stand waiting, with exactness grinds he all."

 CHAPTER VI. 
 
 Vocal Gymnastics, continued — Sounds of E; Sounds of I; Sounds of 0; 
 Sounds of U — Quantity and Quality. 
 
 E has two regular sounds: first, the name-sound, which is capable 
 of great prolongation, and must receive practice on all the examples 
 given for the long and broad sounds of a. Eve, east, eel. 
 
 The second sound of E is short, because we can not prolong it without 
 altering it. Ebb, edge, egg, eld, elf, emblem, en-ter, ep-ic, er-rand, 
 Es-sex, eth-ics, er-ror, ex-cel, ex-cept, ex-empt, ex-pense, ex-tend, 
 beg, cell, dell, pen, gem, hen, jest, let, met, net, pet, guess, rent, sell, 
 test, vest, well, yes, rest. Any attempt to prolong this sound will 
 give us the mongrel sound as as in short a. 
 
 In expelling triis short sound of e we must remember and distin- 
 guish those important things, accent, emphasis, etc. We must be 
 particular to drop and project the jaw a little in making this sound. 
 
 " Ye clouds that gorgeously repose 
 Around the setting sun, 
 Answer ! have ye a home for those 
 "Whose earthly race is run ? 
 
 The "bright clouds answer' d — '"We depart, 
 
 We vanish from the sky; 
 Ask what is deathless in thy heart 
 
 For that which can not die ! ' " 
 
 " Joys, that leap'd 
 Like angels from the heart, and wander' d free 
 In life's young morn to look upon the flowers, 
 The poetry of nature, and to list 
 The woven sounds of breeze, and "bird, and stream 
 Upon the night air, have been stricken down 
 In silence to the dust." 
 
 I has two regular sounds: we give the first sound, which is long, in 
 speaking its name. When pronounced in full it is diphthongal, com- 
 mencing with the sound of ah and ending with e. Ice, ides, ire, isle, 
 i-dle, i-ron (i-urn), i-o-ta, i-vo-ry, bide, cite, drive, pine, knife, hide, 
 mite, nine, pie, ride, site, tile, vile, wine, etc. What part of a sound 
 should be prolonged ? As a general rule, the radical part, which is

 where the vocal organs first open on the sound. But i long is an 
 exception. The first radical ah sound glides into ee. Therefore the 
 position of the organs must change. In giving this name-sound of i 
 we must be very cautious about having the organs in the right position, 
 and making the proper effort from the lower muscles before alluded to. 
 
 The second sound of lis short. If, ill, imp, in, ink, inch, inn, is, it, 
 itch, illi-cit, im-be-cile, in-ci-dent, in-dis-tinct, in-hab-it, in-quis-i-tive, 
 in-sip-id, in-stinct, in-di-vis-i-bility, is-o-late ; hid, cid, did, fib, gilt, 
 hilt, jib, kid, lid, mit, nit, pin, quip, sit, tin, victim, wish, zinc. 
 
 Let us remember that in expelling the vowel-sounds we are prac- 
 ticing some of the most important principles involved in reading, 
 speaking, and singing — measure, accent, and emphasis. 
 
 A peculiarly soft sound is given to i when it follows the hard 
 guttural sound of g and k. Begin by making two syllables out of one, 
 and then gradually shorten them into one by degrees, speaking them 
 faster and faster. Begin thus: gee-ide, gee-ide, gee-ide, gyide; kee-ind, 
 kee-ind, kee-ind, ky-ind, kyind ; geear-di-an ; kyind-ness, lov-ing- 
 kyind-ness; which gives us a very soft and pleasant sound, both in 
 speech and song. Let us make our language as agreeable as possible, 
 and we can produce much better effects. 
 
 " Laughing voices, scraps of song, 
 Lusty music, loud and strong, 
 Rustling of the banners blowing, 
 Whispers as of rivers flowing, 
 "Whistle of the hawks we bore 
 As they rise and as they soar ; 
 Now and then a clash of drums 
 As the rabble louder hums, 
 Now and then a burst of horns 
 Sounding over brooks and bourns, 
 As in merry guise we went 
 Biding to the tournament." 
 
 lias three regular sounds: first, its name-sound, or long. Make 
 the long name-sounds full and complete, by giving them plenty of 
 room. Coal, dole, home, hope, dome, hole, ho-ly, mole, hone, mote, 
 note, pole, role, sole, stole, whole, whol-ly, whole-some. 
 
 Swell of voice is seen when we begin with a little sound, and grad- 
 ually increase or widen it as we give it continuously. This is a very 
 important practice, but the sound should be given smoothly as it 
 becomes louder and longer. We will now expel this long sound of o 
 by giving the accented, unaccented, and emphatic sounds, as before, 
 with the pure measure of speech and song. This is an excellent

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 33 
 
 sound to prolong ; but we must be sure to keep the mouth well opened, 
 by dropping and projecting the under jaw, protruding the rounded 
 lips, and keeping all the organs in the same state till we complete 
 the exercise. 
 
 In making the swells and diminish with this sound, as with all the 
 other single long sounds, we must not move any of the organs, from 
 beginning to end, thus shoving the sound, as it might be said. 
 
 « O world ! O life ! O time ! 
 
 On whose last steps I climb, 
 Trembling at that where I had stood before; 
 "When will return the glory of your prime? 
 
 No more — oh, nevermore. 
 
 Out of the day and night 
 
 A joy has taken flight ; 
 Fresh Spring, and Summer, and "Winter hoar, 
 Move my faint heart with grief, but with delight 
 
 No more — oh, nevermore." 
 
 The second sound of is close — oo ; so called because the lips and 
 internal vocal organs are brought close together in pronouncing it ; as 
 ooze, oo-zy, oo-zing; coo, do, fool, roof, soot, tool, moon, loom, cool, 
 doom, hoop, noon, poor, boo-by, cool-ing, do-ing, fool-ing, poo-dle, 
 goose, soup, tooth. In prolonging equally this close sound of o we 
 must not pucker the lips too much, but rather turn them out a little 
 all around, like a funnel. 
 
 The third sound of is short; and, like the other short sounds, can 
 not be prolonged. Odd, of, off, on, or, oz, ob-ject, oc-tave, of-fer, 
 om-e-let, on-ward, op-e-ra, or-der, bod-kin, con-ceit, cob-bler, dol-lar, 
 fol-ly, gog-gles, hob-by, jol-ly, mod-el, non-sense, rob-in, yon-der, 
 bot-tle, dot-ted, fop-pish, gob-ble, jock-ey, knock-er, lot-te-ry, mon-u- 
 ment, non-plus, pop-py, wan-ton, etc. . 
 
 In expelling this short sound of o, and giving the proper accent, 
 etc. , let us vocalize all the breath that escapes, so as to prevent un- 
 pleasant sensations in the throat and injury to the sounds; and by 
 remembering how we pronounce the forbidding word to children, 
 "Och, och, och! let that alone," we shall be the better able to do it. 
 
 U has three regular sounds : first, its name-sound, because it is the 
 sound we make in speaking its name. At least we get this sound 
 pure in the word you. Un-ion, u-nique, u-ni-son, u-ni-ty, u-ni-form, 
 u-nit. 
 
 When the name-sound of u is at the beginning of a word or syl- 
 lable, it has a triple sound; that is, it is a diphthong, composed of 
 
 3 
 


## p. 34 (#40) ##############################################

34 MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 
 
 the consonant-sound of y, and its own double or diphthongal sound, 
 which consists of short e and the full sound of u. By drawling out 
 its Qame-sound, as in use, these three elements may be seen; thus 
 y-u-so : also in un-ion, nat-ure, vol-ume ; but when a consonant-sound 
 goes before u in the same syllable, the sound of y is omitted. We 
 must never pronounce duty, dooty; tune, toon; news, nooz; stew, 
 stoo; dew, doo. 
 
 We shall find it somewhat difficult at first to expel this name- 
 sound of u unless we begin aright. Let us therefore commence as 
 though we were going to pronounce short e and close o together, like 
 ew t or speak the word lute, repeating it several times rapidly, and 
 thus leave off 1 the sound of I and t; thus, lute, lute, lute, ute, ute, 
 ute, ew. 
 
 Now we will prolong this double sound by dwelling on the radical 
 part of it, and keeping the vocal organs in the same position as when 
 we first began the sound, and make it all the same size. 
 
 Now let us make the swell and diminish with it, and be very careful 
 to prolong only the root of the sound. 
 
 TJie second sound of U is short, as in up. 2W-nips de-murred at the 
 numb-skull of a musk-j scul-lion ; a cowr-teous hus-hsmd coup-led himself 
 to a tum-bling tur-tle ; burst with the bulk of fun and run to the un- 
 dertakers. 
 
 TJie third sound of U is full, as in pull. T>ru-tw.s, the cru-el cuck-oo, 
 would \m.-brue his youth-ful hands in Ruth's rouge; sin-fid butch-ers' 
 bid-let push-ed puss grace-ful-ly on the peaceful cush-ion. 
 
 To expel this full sound of % in a proper manner is quite hard for 
 most persons, merely because the vocal organs are not in the right 
 position, especially the lips, which must be projected straight forward, 
 without turning them either up or down. Let us speak drawlingly 
 the first syllable of the word w-man ; let us prolong the letter o a 
 little, and this will be the exact sound of full u. 
 
 "And if it be Prometheus stole from heaven 
 
 The fire which we endure, it was repaid 
 
 By him to whom the energy was given 
 
 Which this poetic marble hath arrayed 
 
 With an eternal glory, which, if made 
 
 By human hands, is not of human thought; 
 
 And time himself hath hallowed it, nor laid 
 
 One ringlet in the dust; nor hath it caught 
 
 A tinge of years, but breathes the flame with which 'twas wrought." 
 "The light winds, which from wnstaining wings 
 
 Shed the music of many mwrmurings." .

 Vanishing force is exhibited when we begin a word or sentence 
 very loud and full, and gradually diminish it to a point of inaudibility. 
 
 Quantity means the longer or shorter time employed in enunci- 
 ating sounds, syllables, words, and sentences. The further we wish a 
 sound to be heard the longer it must be made, and with a proportioned 
 enlargement of its volume. Quality means the kind of voice we use, 
 and may be soft, harsh, clear, smooth, rough, or deep. 
 
 There are two special objects to be kept in view. These are the 
 proper cultivation of both voice and ear in connection with all the 
 elements of speech and song. 
 
 We shall find that practicing each vowel-sound and vocal conso- 
 nant-sound on all the notes of the scale is of primary importance, and 
 that perfect success can not be attained without such exercise ; and 
 we must carry each element to its utmost extent in the right direc- 
 tion. We can obtain as good control over our vocal organs as over' 
 any of our bodily organs. 
 
 " Rest not content in thy darkness — a clod ! 
 "Work — for some good, be it ever so slowly ; 
 Cherish some flower, be it ever so lowly; 
 Labor ! — all labor is noble and holy ; 
 
 Let thy great deeds be thy prayer to thy God." 
 "We look before and after, and pine for what is naught. 
 Our sweetest laughter with some pain is fraught ; 
 Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought." 
 
 CHAPTER VII. 
 
 Pitch of the Voice — Diatonic Scale — Scale or Ladder for the Voice. 
 
 Pitch of the voice is a most important subject, and fortunately 
 for us nature has given us just the thing we need to definitely fix all 
 kinds of reading, speaking, and singing, in giving us the diatonic 
 scale, on some one of whose notes or tones the pitch of the voice is 
 always found. Now, this scale consists of seven different pitches, five 
 of which are each a whole tone apart from its neighbor, and two of 
 them only half a tone apart ; but the whole ones may be divided into 
 half-tones, and these into quarters, these into eighths, these into six- 
 teenths, these into thirty-seconds, and these into sixty-fourths; and 
 all of these are used more or less by every one who talks in the 
 usual manner. 
 


## p. 36 (#42) ##############################################

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 
 
 By stud) jig the effects that are produced by the voice when we 
 permit it to range from the lowest to the highest notes in the natural 
 scale, we find that the half-tones always occur between the third 
 and fourth and seventh and eighth notes or pitches, both in speech 
 and song. 
 
 The lower three are for private conversation ; also for emphasis in 
 very grave and solemn subjects, hereafter to be more fully explained. 
 The upper three are for impassioned words and phrases, where the 
 feelings predominate over the thoughts ; and the middle four are for 
 all the ordinary and general objects of reading and speaking, where 
 the great object is to be heard by all Avhen imparting information on 
 any subject whatever, either by explaining or illustrating the truths 
 of science, philosophy, or religion. 
 
 When speaking to a person near by, when in company with others, 
 and I do not wish them to hear what I say, I speak on a lower note, or 
 pitch, as it is called, and suppress my voice so as to be heard only by 
 the person addressed; thus: "My dear friend, I hope you will be 
 very careful about saying any thing ill of your neighbors, and always 
 do as you would be done by." In most cases of this kind the voice 
 will drop to its lowest natural pitch, or to C, the first note in the 
 diatonic scale. 
 
 When we call to a person at a great distance we naturally raise 
 our voices to the highest notes or pitches; thus: "Mr. Hall, come 
 back ; I have a letter for you." All of which is given on the upper 
 pitches of voice, ranging from eight to ten. 
 
 If we address a person at a medium distance, in company with 
 others, in a public assembly, for instance, the voice will range about 
 midway between the first and eighth; thus: "I wish you all to hear 
 what I say before I close; it is this: never, on any consideration, 
 profess what you do not believe; for if you do you are hypocrites." 
 
 In the above three examples we see what are the two extreme 
 pitches of voice, and the medium ones, which comprehend all that 
 are ever used in speech; for all the voice-sounds we ever hear come 
 within the scale of the eight notes, though really there are but seven, 
 the eighth being the first repeated, just an octave or eighth above or 
 below. (See the illustrations.) 
 
 As a general rule, we must not begin to speak or read below our 
 third note (which is the upper one of the lower pitches), nor above 
 our fifth note ; for if we do we shall be quite sure to run into extremes. 
 Therefore it is just as necessary to pitch our voices on the right key 
 in reading and speaking as it is in singing; for as we begin so shall

 we be likely to continue to the end of the exercise. Let us be certain 
 that we are in the right way, and then persevere in it. 
 
 Gracchus, the Roman orator, used to have a person stand behind 
 him, privately, to give him skillfully the proper note when he wished 
 to change the pitch of his voice and quicken or soften its vehemence. 
 The knowledge of this fact led the author of these pages to study and 
 practice elocution and music together, and taught him that there is 
 nothing in the latter that does not exist in the former. We must 
 practice each of these sixteen vowel-sounds on every pitch of voice 
 found in the diatonic scale, or voice-ladder, both in the speaking and 
 singing tones. 
 
 8. Ale, an, all, at, eel, ell, isle, ill, etc. 
 
 7. Ale, an, all, at, eel, ell, isle, ill, etc. 
 
 6. Ale, an, all, at, eel, ell, isle, ill, etc. 
 
 5. Ale, an, all, at, eel, ell, isle, ill, etc. 
 
 4. Ale, an, all, at, eel, ell, isle, ill, etc.

 2. Ale, an, all, at, eel, ell, isle, ill, etc. 
 
 1. Ale, an, all, at, eel, ell, isle, ill, etc. 
 
 The Diatonic Scale is so called because it extends through or 
 comprehends all the pitches of voice and sound ever used in speaking 
 or singing. Let us erect this scale, or ladder for the voice, on our 
 lowest natural note, as before indicated.

 Here is a ladder for the voice to ascend or descend on, or to move 
 along upon any of its sounds ; and it is always on some one of these, 
 for it can be nowhere else. It naturally divides itself into three 
 parts — the lower pitches for depressed tones of conversation, and 
 grave and sublime emphasis; the middle for the common uses of 
 speech; and the upper ones for calling out at a distance, and for 
 impassioned eloquence.

 MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 
 
 To extend the compass of voice is very desirable both in reading 
 and singing; and an excellent way thus to stretch the voice is to 
 speak any phrase on as low a note or pitch as we can, and ascend the 
 scale, or voice-ladder, by regular steps. 
 
 Example. 
 
 8. | O you hard hearts ! you cruel, etc.

 (Lowest.) 1. 
 
 you hard hearts ! 
 
 you cruel men of Kome ! 
 
 After practicing this exercise awhile, we must try to go higher and 
 lower than these eight degrees, uttering the w T ords as musically as we 
 can, and seeing that the organs are moving properly. 
 
 The four vowel-sounds which are presented above, when naturally 
 given, will be found on the lower half of the scale, and the other ones 
 on the upper half; thus :

 For the varied purposes of elocution the diatonic scale of seven 
 notes is divided only into three parts, which must be perfectly under- 
 stood, otherwise we shall have no solid foundation on which to build 
 these arts. These divisions are the tone pitches. 
 
 The lower pitch extends from one to three inclusive — i. e., one, 
 two, three ; the middle pitch extends from three to six — three, four, 
 five, six; the highest pitch from six to eight — six, seven, eight. The

 pupil must practice on these several pitches until he or she can tell 
 instantly on which of them the voice is at any time. 
 
 Directions for Talking the Scale. — A practice to be highly 
 recommended is the talking of the scale, which may be done with the 
 accompaniment of the piano or some other musical instrument, as 
 follows: Strike the middle C of the key -board repeatedly, keeping 
 up the sound as long as required, and speak a whole sentence or 
 couplet in that tone, prolonging the accented vowel in each word in 
 as loud, clear, round, and full a voice as possible, and without any 
 variation of the pitch; then strike the next note below, and repeat 
 all the words in that tone ; and so on down in the same way until the 
 lowest possible pitch of voice is reached. Then ascend the scale in 
 the same manner, speaking all the words on each note slowly, taking 
 ample time for full prolongation, until the highest falsette pitch of 
 voice is reached, without breaking into singing tones ; then gradually 
 descend. For example, take the sentence, " O ye cruel men of Rome ! " 
 
 F 
 E 
 
 C 
 
 B 
 A 
 
 G 
 
 F 
 
 Then talk on the third, the fifth, the seventh, and back again ; then 
 from the third to the seventh, and back again ; from the first to the 
 seventh, and back again. This practice persevered in will give great 
 strength and compass to the voice, and flexibility, purity, and sweetness 
 to the tones. 
 
 When classes are drilled in concert in this exercise, the teacher 
 should beat time, and be careful that harmony of pitch is preserved.

 CHAPTER VIII. 
 
 Elements of Speech — Exercises in Articulation — Table of Aspirates — 
 Aspirates and Subvowels — Table of Subvowels. 
 
 Human speech is made of vibrations of air, or exhaling breath. 
 There are two kinds of sounds made by this exhaling breath — one we 
 denominate voice or vowel-sound, the other breath or aspirate-sound. 
 All voice-sounds are made in the glottis, whether they are pure open 
 vowels or subvowels, as has been before explained. The aspirates 
 are unvocalized sounds ; that is, the air in passing through the glottis 
 is not disturbed by the vocal chords, but passes out freely as in 
 common breathing, is retained in the mouth, and shaped into peculiar 
 characteristics or waves of sound by the tongue, teeth, and lips. 
 
 What we term the subvowels are voice-sounds, restrained and 
 articulated by the tongue, teeth, and lips, just as are the aspirates. 
 Indeed, these are equally paired, each of the aspirates having a cor- 
 relative vocal or atonic, made by exactly the same position of the 
 organs; the difference being that one is pure breath and the other 
 vocal breath, or breath that has been previously agitated by the vocal 
 chords. Tlie aspirates are articulated breath; the subvowels are vocalized 
 articulated breath. 
 
 The table in this chapter will show the division, giving the names 
 of each, as also an arrangement of the correlatives, followed by a 
 full description of the way in which each is produced by the organs 
 of speech. 
 
 They are minutely described for the benefit of those who lisp, 
 stammer, and have imperfect articulation; the last-named being 
 much more numerous, but equally incapable of making themselves 
 understood. 
 
 The sounds must be made correctly and practiced with care, for 
 they are the elements of speech. They, with the exercises, are given 
 as a practice for the articulating organs. The exercises on the vowel- 
 sounds have been hitherto mostly for strengthening, increasing, and 
 beautifying the voice ; now we want the same perfection in the enun- 
 ciation of letters, syllables, and words, and they should be used as a

 daily practice even after the pupil has mastered them. They do for 
 the articulating muscles what the five-finger piano exercises do for the 
 muscles of the fingers and hands ; i. e. , give power and flexibility of 
 motion, and render them intuitively obedient to the will. 
 
 Particularly do foreigners, who desire a correct pronunciation of 
 our language, require a thorough drill on these sounds and their 
 combinations. A few weeks of practice on these elements would do 
 more thar» many months of study. The French and Germans find 
 great difficulty in pronouncing the th. For th the former give z, and 
 the latter give d ; making they, zay and day. For iv they give v — I vos 
 for ivas; vot you zay for what you say. For p they place b — bleazes 
 for phases. Such should be taught the true position of the articu- 
 lating organs. A little practice will overcome the difficulty. 
 
 Slovenliness in articulation is as deserving of reprehension as 
 slovenliness in dress or gait. Indeed, much more so; for words are 
 used to clothe our thoughts and give expression to our sentiments, 
 but if not clearly and distinctly uttered they can never convey with 
 purity the information we wish. 
 
 Listen attentively to hear yourself pronounce the following exer- 
 cises, and if your ears detect each word perfectly coined they will be 
 much gratified.

 Aspirates — Manner of forming Aspirates — Sounds of C; F; H; P; Q;

 In the formation of words the aspirates interfere and break off the 
 vowel-sounds, whizzing, puffing, and buzzing between them in a very 
 funny and inharmonious manner, somewhat like the noise of imple- 
 ments or machinery in rapid motion. The ventriloquist is dependent 
 upon the aspirates in imitating the noise of certain kinds of machinery 
 and of escaping steam. These sounds are made by the tongue and 
 lips, and are very penetrating ; the tongue assuming certain positions 
 in the mouth in relation to the teeth and lips, forming avenues, angles, 
 and corners around and through which the breath is forcibly expelled. 
 The aspirated sounds make up a large part of our language, and are 
 quite difficult to master in connection with the vowels and subvocals.

 Indeed, the majority of people never acquire a good articulation, 
 which results from want of proper training of the organs used in 
 making these sounds. 
 
 Manv persons lisp all their lives for the reason that they have never 
 been taught where to place the tongue to insure a distinct utterance 
 of the sounds of th and s. They make the sound of th between the 
 point of the tongue and the upper front teeth ; then instead of with- 
 drawing the tongue within toward the roof of the mouth, where the 
 sound of ^ is always produced, they simply repeat the th, not making 
 the sound of s at all. The words this, these, and others of like ter- 
 mination, lisping people pronounce as thith, ilietlie. 
 
 Example. — A charming young gentleman expressed his lisping and con- 
 fessed his love in this wise: "Tlrweet Thynthia, my heart-th treathure, thmile 
 upon me, or I thall fly acroth the "broad bothom of the othean and thigh out 
 my latht breath on thorn e foreign thore." 
 
 Parents sometimes think lisping in their children very cunning; 
 but the time will come when the children will think it neither cunning 
 nor wise in their parents to have allowed them to retain such a habit. 
 Let no person indulge in this childish habit ; it is not only ridiculous, 
 but devoid of personal dignity. 
 
 C takes four regular sounds, or rather at times it becomes the 
 equivalent of s, sometimes of h, and again of z, and also of sh. When 
 it is sounded as s in see or so, it takes what is called its soft or name- 
 sound. 
 
 To produce this clear, shrill sound the teeth nearly, but do not quite, 
 meet ; the lips are drawn away, and the end of the tongue is placed 
 in close proximity to the roots of the upper front teeth, leaving just 
 room enough for the breath to be forced over the end of the tongue 
 and out through the mouth. With the organs in this position, make 
 the endeavor to whisper the word see, and continue the sound of .$ 
 without gliding into ee. 
 
 It is very difficult for persons who lisp to make this sharp, clear, 
 whistling sound. Indeed, but very few persons can articulate it dis- 
 tinctly when, at the end of w r ords, it follows t or th. 
 
 Practice the following with a view of gaining the sound distinctly: 
 Withs, smiths, ghosts, hosts, masts, pasts, marts, Christs, boats, toasts, 
 spits, splits, quits, writs. 
 
 Pronounce the following, where c and s take exactly the same 
 sound: City, cite, cede, cease, cent, cell, Cyprus, civet, citron, circle; 
 saints, sinners, and singers saved Sampson's sisters, Sophia, Susan, 
 and Cynthia.

 A very pretty ventriloquial exercise of this sound (c) is produced 
 by imitating the sharp, clear noise made by the carpenter planing a 
 board. The sound is prolonged, and then brought suddenly to a close 
 in the effort to pronounce p. To make the illusion more complete, 
 the performer will take a book or block of some kind and perform the 
 pantomimic action of planing on the surface of a table, but must be 
 very sure to cease the effort as soon as the p is sounded ; thus : 
 
 C p, c p, c p, c__ p, cp. 
 
 C usually takes this sound before e, i, and y — Cecil, facile, vagrancy. 
 
 When c borrows the sound of k it is said to be hard, but it simply 
 assumes the sound of h. This is the correlative of g hard, as in go. 
 To form these two sounds the organs are placed in exactly the same 
 position; the mouth is slightly open, and the end of the tongue 
 pressed down against the lower front teeth. This effort forces the 
 middle of the tongue up near the roof or hard palate in the form 
 of an arch. To produce the clicking sound of a, the breath is then 
 forcibly thrown over the tongue; to make the hard sound of g, the 
 breath is vocalized before it is thrown over — that is all the difference. 
 It takes this sound before a, 0, u, I, r, t — care, came, act, come, clock, 
 craft, cane, cape, case, calf, cask, couple, cork. It is exactly like k 
 in kin, kick, kirk, kit. 
 
 Pronounce and spell, by the use of the sounds of the letters, the 
 following: Climac-teric, cackle, cake, calico, caloric, cal-ca-reous, 
 Capricorn, carcass, casque with classical cloak ; kicking, clicking, and 
 kissing the keepsake. 
 
 When these soft and hard sounds come together, s and c are re- 
 quired; as in screech, scrawl, scream, scrubble, scripture, scur-ril, 
 scutch-eon, San-skrit, school. 
 
 C also takes the subvowel-sound of z, and the manner of producing 
 it is the same as in making the soft sound of c, of which it is a 
 correlative ; the difference being that in c soft the breath passes unvo- 
 calized ; in z it is vocalized, giving a buzzing sound. C in suffice, s in 
 cheese, and z in wheeze, all have the same sound, which is the first 
 subvowel-sound of z. 
 
 Very many words ending in s take this sound also ; as was, has, 
 gas, arms, harms, swarms, rags, figs, drugs, tongs, gibs, fibs, bags, etc. 
 When double s occurs, we give the soft sound ; as in grass, pass, glass, 
 wit-ness, good-ness, bright-ness. 
 
 C sometimes takes the sound of sh after an accent followed by 
 ea, ia, eo, ean, ion. This is a pure aspirate -sound, and is the coun-

46 MANUAL OF ELOCUTION: 
 
 tarpart of the second sound of z, as in azure, and is produced by 
 shutting the teeth together and forcibly blowing the breath between 
 them. When the breath is vocalized before it is thus forced through, 
 it tnaikes the sound of z just mentioned — Grecian, conscientious, 
 propitious ocean, retention, vicious. It has precisely the same sound 
 as aft in sham, shine, shimmer, shoes. 
 
 Examples of all the Sounds of C. — Cede, city, crime, clack, charm, 
 social, suffice. * 
 
 F is a pure aspirate. To make it the upper front teeth are placed 
 on the lower lip and the breath blown through. V is the counter- 
 part of this, only the breath is vocalized. In of, f takes the vocal 
 sound, but its usual sound is a pure aspirate ; as form, feet, fuss, fool, 
 infinite, effete, affirm, etc. 
 
 H has one sound, which is produced by opening wide the mouth 
 and forcibly expelling the breath. The vocal counterpart of this 
 aspirate is the vowel ah — hit, harm, home, half, help, hand, etc. 
 
 P also has one sound, which is an aspirate. It is made by pressing 
 the lips tightly together, then suddenly separating them, as though 
 going to whisper the word puff. It is simply a puff of air — pipe, port, 
 post, ripe, pale, pip-pin. The vocal sound of this same effort is b — 
 bribe, Jacob, break, babble. In Jacob, Jupiter, and Baptist, it is 
 quite difficult to distinguish the one from the other. 
 
 Q takes one sound, and is also an aspirate. The sound is quite 
 similar to k, but in producing it the lips with the corners of the mouth 
 protrude forward and closer together, instead of being drawn back, 
 as in making k; nor is the tongue held down so firmly. Make the 
 effort to whisper queen without reaching the vowel u — quill, quoth, 
 quirk, sequel, sequence. The vowel effort that corresponds to this is 
 oo or close o. 
 
 S takes four sounds, two of which are pure aspirates — so, sh. It 
 takes the sound of sh in sugar, sure, etc. Both of these sounds have 
 been fully treated of in the remarks about the letter c. It also takes 
 the two subvowel-sounds of z, which have been before presented. 
 
 Exercises in the Soft Sound of S. — Sam saved and sawed six slim 
 slippery saplings, and swimming, swam smack into the Swiss swamp, south 
 of Smith's settlement. Amidst the mists he thrusts his fists against the posts, 
 and insists he sees hosts of ghosts, and twists and "boasts of toasts. Get the 
 latest amended edition of Charles Smith's Thucydides, and study the colonists, 
 best interests-. 
 
 Z— The first sound of z is found in ro-se-ate, pleas-ures, en-thu-si-ate, 
 scis-sors ; was and is on Iser's praise dis-dainful rais'd ; a busy muse,

 applause and despise, the noiseless waves and closing skies; sighs, 
 fantasy, wisdom, and business. 
 
 The second sound of z is in the following words: Adhesion to 
 ambro-sial inclo-sures to treasures and pleasures, take ho-siers, bra-zier's 
 crosiers, brasions and treasures, for corrosions and explosions, illusions, 
 confusions, conclusions, and intrusions. 
 
 To make the second sound of z the teeth meet firmly together, the 
 lips are thrown out, while the tip of the tongue rests at the base of the 
 lower front teeth, bending the tongue up so as to completely line the 
 upper and lower front teeth, scarcely touching them. The vocalized 
 breath is forced through the small aperture and between the teeth. 
 The correlative of this sound is s/i, made in the same way, but with 
 unvocalized breath. 
 
 K takes one pure aspirate-sound, which has received attention 
 under the letter c. Its vocal equivalent is g hard. Crickets, keen, 
 kill'd, rebuke; quaker, quirk'd, work'd, cork'd, york'd, look'd and 
 smok'd, provok'd and invok'd, joked, poked, and croak'd. 
 
 G hard and the vowel e are made with the organs in the same 
 position. In the vowel-sound the vocalized breath passes out evenly 
 without interruption, while in making the subvowel g and the aspi- 
 rate k the expulsion is sudden and forcible. 
 
 T takes two sounds, its real one, which is an aspirate, and its vocal 
 correlative d. To make it the tongue is first pressed tightly against 
 the roof of the mouth and suddenly withdrawn, expelling the breath 
 forcibly. Tilt, tit-tat, with a rat-tat-tat. 
 
 D is made in the same way. With the vocalized breath d fre- 
 quently takes the sound of t. 
 
 Exercise in Jaw-breakers. — Thou wreath'd'st and muzzl'd'st the far- 
 fetched ox, and imprison'd'st in the volcanic mountains of Pop-o-cat-a-petl in

 thou black'n'st and contaminated'st with his filch'd character. Thou lov'd'st

 CHAPTER X. 
 
 Aspirates continued — B; D; G; J; L; M; N; R; V; W; X — Digraphs: 
 
 ch, sh, gh, ph, th, wh. 
 
 B is a restrained vocal sound, made precisely as p is, only the vocal 
 breath is thrown up against the lips, producing a swallowed sound. 
 Compress the lips tightly and try to speak ub. Jacob hob-nob'd with 
 a cobbler, dabbled in ribbons, bonbons, berries, and cabbage; the 
 baboon baby babbl'd and gabbl'd its gibberish with a rub-a-dub-dub. 
 
 D is also a restrained vocal sound, explained under the aspirate t. 
 It frequently takes the sound of t at the end of words. He escap'd 
 vex'd and watch'd the spic'd food with arch'd brow ; tripp'd his crisp'd 
 feet; dash'd, smash'd, jump'd, and scratched like a tax'd turkey, burn'd 
 and crisp'd. 
 
 G takes three sounds. Its hard sound, and the manner of making 
 it, was explained when treating of the letter c. It sometimes borrows 
 the second sound of z, as in rouge. It also becomes the equivalent 
 of j in many words ; to make which will be explained when treating 
 of that letter. 
 
 Sard sound of G. — A giddy gander got a cigar and gave it to 
 a gangrene beggar. Goggles growled and giggled at the giddy girls, 
 gloated over the gruel, till a ghastly ghost got good game and gave 
 Brobdignag* green glass goggles. 
 
 G as J. — A giant in Ghent, a genuine genius for gems and original 
 magic, exaggerated the genealogy of Georgius, the logical sergeant, 
 germinating genteel gingerbread just as the aborigines abjured Geneva, 
 Genoa, and Germany. 
 
 When g takes the sound of z, it occurs generally in French w r ords 
 not Anglicised. 
 
 J takes one sound, which is semi-vowel ; in reality it is a combina- 
 tion of the subvowel d and the aspirate ch, as in church. The tongue 
 is thrown up to obstruct the voice-sound, as in producing the d sound, 
 and the forcible aspirate explosion following gives the sound of ch 
 referred to. Endeavor to speak quickly the syllable jup without 
 sounding the p, and the sound of j will be perfectly rendered. June, 
 July, Judith; judge and Judaism joined judgment; joyfully jolting

 jugs and justice; juvenile jurymen; Jupiter; Julian joined juice and 
 julep in juxtaposition. 
 
 L takes one uniform sound ; to make which the mouth is open, and 
 the lips drawn back and in at the corners ; the tongue is placed firmly 
 against the front palate as in the sound of d, and held there ; while the 
 vocalized breath is forced out from the sides of the tongue through 
 the open mouth. In this position of the organ endeavor to speak 
 the syllable eel. Lord Lemuel Lyall loved a lasslorn lady, luckless, 
 languid, and luxurious ; she with blissful dalliance genteelly listened 
 to his luckless, lazy, illogical lunacy. A lying, lyrical, lymphatic 
 lynch, lynx-eyed and lumpish. The lawless law-maker lauded and 
 laughed at the lapidary. 
 
 M has one sound, which is partly mouth and partly nasal ; i. e. , 
 the voice-sound is thrown up against the firmly closed lips, as in the 
 sound of b, but is thrown back and out through the nose. Mail maim'd 
 the main-mast, mostly making malignant music. Majestical mediocrity 
 meditates mean mechanical measure, modified by meek menace. Mer- 
 ciful mercurial metamorphosis mastered the methodistic meter. 
 
 N takes one sound, which is also partly mouth and partly nasal ; 
 but the vocal breath is stopped by the tongue being firmly placed 
 against the roof of the mouth, as when making the sounds of d and e, 
 and thrown back through the nasal passage. Nineteen nippers, non- 
 concurrent, non-essential, and nonsensically nice, nipped noisily at 
 ninepins; a novel novice, notable with nosegays, nourished naughty 
 nurslings in nymph-like nudity. 
 
 N before g and k becomes a purely nasal sound. The end of the 
 tongue is placed against the lower front teeth, as in producing the 
 sound of h and g hard, while the back part is thrown up so as to 
 prevent any sound from, passing out through the mouth, forcing it 
 all through the nose. Kanting, banking, cranking, singing, sighing, 
 smiling, dying, crying, flying, flanking, winking, waking, sleeping. 
 
 B. — To make the first sound of r the teeth are nearly closed, the 
 lips thrown out, and the tongue drawn back and up. In this position 
 of the organs try to speak the syllable er, and the desired sound will 
 be obtained. When r occurs after a vowel it takes this smooth sound. 
 Floor, more, word, sword, gourd. 
 
 The second sound of r is rough or trilled. To make it the organs 
 are in the same position as when required to produce the smooth 
 sound ; but a more forcible expulsion of vocal air becomes necessary 
 to cause the vibration of the tongue required to produce this trill, or 
 rolling sound.

 Trill the r. The romping, ragged rascal, rash, raspy, reaching, 
 rearing, and recreant, roamed in riotous revolt. Ribaldry, reviving 
 rhapsody, rained rich rockets, riddles, ribbons, and rocks. The royal 
 roofless rooster roared in the rookery, and the rough ruffian ruined 
 the Rubicon. 
 
 Notk,— Many poisons have a very affected and pernicious habit of making the letter r 
 silent in all the words they use. For barn they say bahn; for ioxm, fahm ; for harm, hahm, etc. 
 Some have a still more exquisite fancy, and pronounce bird as though spelled bu-yed, sounding 
 the i like Short «; first, fu-ycst ; firs, fu-ys, etc. 
 
 V. — This sound is made in the same manner as is/, but with vocal 
 breath. Vainglorious vagabonds value valentines with voluptuous 
 vanity. Vampires, vapors, and varnish vanish and vent venom, 
 viperous, virile, and valid. 
 
 W has two sounds. The first is a close vowel-sound of oo, as in 
 ooze, preceded by a slight aspirate, giving a wavy sound that oo does 
 not possess. It takes this sound before vowels. The warden washed 
 the wall, wisely warming the water with wonderful wood, wormy and 
 worthless. 
 
 The second sound is a pure aspirate. To make it place the lips 
 as though you were going to whistle, blowing a short breath through 
 the lips. It usually takes this sound before h. Which, whiggish, 
 what, whimsical, whip-stock, whooping, whistle. 
 
 X (g z, k s) is in fact a character representing four sounds. It 
 takes two sounds, a subvocal and an aspirate, both of which are a 
 union of two sounds. The subvocal takes the sound of g hard and 
 of z (gz), while the aspirates (ks) are but the correlatives. As a 
 particular description of the manner of making these sounds has been 
 already given, it will only be necessary to unite them — gz, sub vowels; 
 k s, aspirates. 
 
 At the beginning of words x takes the sound of z. In such cases 
 it is a vocal sound, and the g sound is silent; as Xenia, Xenophon. 
 Should the real sound of the letter be pronounced, it would be exactly 
 as though spelled Gzenophon, Gzenia, having the same sound that it 
 does in exist, exile. It will be well to remember this analysis to pre- 
 vent any stumbling. 
 
 When x is the first letter of the word the g sound is silent, and the 
 words pronounced as though written Zenia, Zenophon. The xanthic 
 xystus, with xylotile Xylopia, received a xylographer with xylites 
 xylophilan. Xerxes and Xenophon from Xenia. 
 
 Words in which x takes the sub vowel -sound: Exalt the exactor 
 and exaggerate the examination with exactitude, and exasperate the 
 examiner with exotic exultation.

 It takes the hs sound in the following : Extort the exquisite expert 
 and extinguish the expectant explainer; extirpate the extorter in 
 extemporal exegesis. 
 
 Such words as the following sound as though spelled with the word 
 commencing with the letter x — play upon xes: Charles X., x-king of 
 France, was xtravagantly xtoll'd, but is xceedingly xecrated. He 
 xperienced xtraordinary xcellences ; he was xcellent in xternals, but 
 xtrinsic in xtasy; he was xtatic in xpression, xtreme in xcitement, 
 and xtraordinary in xtempore xpression. He was xpatriated for his 
 xcesses, and to xpiate his xtravagance was xcluded, and xpired in 
 xpulsion. 
 
 Digraphs. 
 
 Ch. — The manner of producing this sound was described under the 
 letter j, of which it is the aspirate correspondent. It takes the sound 
 of sh in some words, as in chaise. In words derived from the ancient 
 languages ch is generally hard, like k; as, chemistry, Chaldee, Mel- 
 chisedec. If we reverse the order of this combination in its soft 
 sound, and prolong the c, we get a certain significant expression of 
 hate and disgust. Snakes and geese use this sound when irritated 
 or alarmed; and even men have been known to express themselves 
 by a vigorous use of these sounds. Persons, however, who hiss this 
 language seem to know intuitively how to utter it without any ex- 
 planation here. But to return and discuss the regular English sound 
 of this digraph. There is a very useful agent, for the convenience of 
 mankind, which has been invented since snakes, geese, and men were 
 created. If you wish to hear how clearly and rapidly it utters this 
 sound listen to the locomotive when it is just put in motion — ch, ch, 
 ch, ch, ch, etc. 
 
 Sh has also been described, as it is the aspirate correlative of the 
 second sound of z. 
 
 Ph usually takes the sound of/ — Phil-o-mel, Phi-pher. According 
 to some lexicographers, in the words nephew and Stephens, they take 
 the sound of v. In some words the h is silent — nap/i-tha. 
 
 Oh (ough). This combination can hardly be called a digraph, as it 
 has no sound specifically its own. At the beginning of words the h is 
 silent, and at the end of words both letters are generally silent. In 
 some words it takes the sound of/, as in laugh and cough. In others, 
 when preceded by ou, it takes the sound of w, as in furlough — the ugh is 
 silent. In through it takes the close sound of oo; and in thorough the 
 entire ough is sounded like short u. Altogether it is a tough combi- 
 nation of letters to rely upon, but perhaps a good arrangement for

 suggesting a guess; or, what would be more satisfactory perhaps, it 
 gives one the freedom of choice when it occurs in proper names. 
 Greenough, Clough, Vaughn, Brough, Brougham. 
 
 Th has its two sounds, aspirate and voice. These sounds are made 
 by placing the end of the tongue against the edge of the upper front 
 teeth. To make the aspirate-sound, as in thin, the breath is simply 
 blown through. In the vocal sound, as in this, the vocal breath is 
 blown through, making a buzzing sound. This, those, that, them, 
 thine. '

 Articulation — Gymnastics of the Voice — Exercises eor Running the 
 Gauntlet — The "Leader" Exercise. 
 
 The great obstacle to articulation lies in the pupil not being able 
 to articulate aspirate and sub vowel-sounds, particularly when they 
 come together in one syllable, or follow each other in different syllables. 
 Articulation generally is so poor that the following table is inserted 
 for the purpose of affording gymnastic exercises. Let no one neglect 
 this practice. Let them be pronounced and spelled. In classes, one 
 pupil may pronounce and the next one spell, and the speller pronounce 
 the next word for spelling, and so on around the class. Each one will 
 then discover in what condition his or her articulating powers are. 
 
 Remember, exactness and grace go together in other gymnastic 
 exercises — fencing, riding, boxing — so do not slight these nobler 
 gymnastics of the voice.

 By indefatigable study and long-continued practice the renowned orators 
 of antiquity became almost perfect in articulation. They were unwilling that 
 even a single error should escape their lips. This is one of the great secrets 
 of their immortality. They knew that the faculty of speech is the power 
 of giving sounds to thought. They were correct in their views.

 ami compound sounds "which our twenty-six letters represent. It is 
 to the oar what a fair handwriting is to the eye, and relates, of course, 
 to the Bounds, not to the names, of both vowels and consonants. It 
 depends on the exact positions and correct operations of the vocal 
 powers, and on the ability to vary them with rapidity, precision, and 
 effect. Thus articulation is purely an intellectual act, and belongs 
 not to any of the brute creation. 
 
 Be very particular in pronouncing the jaw or voice-breakers, and 
 cease not till you can give every sound fully, correctly, and distinctly. 
 If your vocal powers are well exercised by faithful practice on the 
 more difficult combinations, they will acquire a facility of movement, 
 a precision of action, a flexibility, grace, and force truly surprising. 
 
 The awful cruelties, barbarisms, horrors, crimes, massacres, and conflagra- 
 tions of civil wars, regardless of rights or wrongs, wreak rough, wrathful 
 revenge on your shrill-shrieking daughters. The forest's shades and the 
 fortresses' foreheads faced the forecastle's forked form ; thatched the theft and 
 thaw'd the thick thimble, thwack athwart the thyroid. 
 
 Self-possession, under all circumstances, is a most desirable attain- 
 ment. Kunning the gauntlet will test it. We have all heard of the 
 practice that prevails among some tribes of Indians called "running 
 tJie gauntlet." A company is arranged in two rows, a few yards apart, 
 and a prisoner is obliged to run between the ranks. Each throws his 
 hatchet at him as he passes, and if he escapes this ordeal without 
 being killed he is permitted to live without further hazard. In the 
 important exercise here recommended, each member of the class, 
 after making some proficiency, memorizes and recites a strong and 
 powerful sentence, and the others try to put out or break down the 
 one that is speaking, by all sorts of remarks, sounds, looks, and 
 actions, though without touching him ; and the gauntlet-speaker girds 
 up the loins of his mind and endeavors to keep the fountain of feeling 
 higher than the streams, and so long as he does so he is safe ; but alas 
 for him that shrinks into himself and yields to his opponents. 
 
 Any one who can recite the following with expression, under the 
 noise, confusion, and jests of the class, will have achieved a great 
 success : 
 
 " Hast thou, in feverish and unquiet sleep, — 
 Dreamt — th't some merciless demon of the air 
 Rais'd thee aloft, — and held thee by the hair 
 Over the brow — of a down-lookmg steep, 
 Gaping, below, into a chasm — so deep 
 Th't, by the utmost straining of thine eye, 
 Thou canst no resting--p\aca descry;

 Not e'en a bush — to save thee, shouldst thou sweep 
 
 Adown the black descent; that then the hand 
 
 Suddenly parted thee, and left thee there, 
 
 Holding — but by finger-ti^s, the bare 
 
 And jagged ridge above, that seems as sand 
 
 To crumble 'neath. thy touch ? — If so, I deem 
 
 Th't thou hast had rather an ugly dream." 
 
 The following will be easier : 
 
 "Echoed from earth a hollow roar 
 Like ocean on the midnight shore ; 
 A sheet of lightning o'er them wheeled, 
 The solid ground beneath them reel'd; 
 In dust sank roof and battlement, 
 Like webs the giant walls were rent; 
 Eed, broad, before his startled gaze, 
 The monarch saw his Egypt blaze. 
 Still swelled the plague — the flame grew pale ; 
 Burst from the clouds the charge of hail ; 
 "With arrowy keenness, iron weight, 
 Down poured the ministers of fate ; 
 Till man and cattle, crushed, congealed, 
 Covered with death the boundless field." 
 
 " Eoll proudly on ! brave blood is with thee sweeping, 
 
 Poured out by sons of thine, 
 "When sword and spirit forth in joy were leaping 
 
 Like thee, victorious Ehine ! 
 Go, tell the seas that chain shall bind thee never ; 
 
 Sound on, by hearth and shrine ; 
 Sing through the hills that thou art free forever ; 
 
 Lift up thy voice, Ehine ! " 
 
 Vir. How! is it something can't be told 
 At once ? Speak out, boy ! Ha ! your looks are loaded 
 "With matter. Is 't so heavy that your tongue 
 Can not unburden them ? Tour brofher left 
 The camp on duty yesterday — hath aught 
 Happened to him ? Did he arrive in safety ? 
 Is he safe ? Is he well ? 
 
 In the leader exercises one reads until he or she makes a mistake 
 in articulation, the entire class being critics for the occasion. The 
 moment the leader makes a mistake the next one takes up the word, 
 repronounces it, and proceeds until he is dethroned by an error, and so 
 on around the class. This is an exciting exercise, and requires all to 
 have their eyes and ears open and their tongues supple. All must 
 be careful to mind the "stops."

 Kmt.i ttfli 1. Cicero and Demosthenes. — An orator, addressing himself 
 more to the passions, naturally has much passionate ardor; whilst another, 
 ssing an elevation of sfyk and majestic gravity, is never coW, though he 
 has not the same vehemence. In this respect do these great orators differ. 
 tfhenes — abounds in concise sublimity ; Cicero, — in diffuseness: the former, 
 on account of his destroying and consuming everything by his violence, rapidity, 
 strength, and vehemence, may be compared to a hurricane or thunderbolt; the 
 latter, to a wide extended conflagration, spreading in every direction with a 
 great, constant, and irresistible flame. 
 
 Exercise 2. The Power of Imagination. 
 The lunatic, the lover, and the poet 
 Are of imagination — all compact : 
 One — sees more devils — than vast hell can hold ; 
 That — is the madman. The lover, all as frantic, 
 Sees Helen's beauty— in a brow of Egypt. 
 The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling, 
 
 Doth glance from heaven — to earth, from earth — to heaven ; 
 And, as imagination — bodies forth 
 The forms of things unknown, the poet s pen 
 Forms them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing 
 A local habitation and a name." 
 
 Exercise 3. The Human Voice. — Among all the wonderful varieties 
 of artificial instruments which discourse excellent music, where shall we find 
 one that can be compared to the human voice? And where can we find 
 an instrument comparable to the human mind, upon whose stops the real 
 musician, the poet, and the orator sometimes lays his hands, and avails himself 
 of the entire compass of its magnificent capacities ? Oh ! the length, the breadth, 
 the height, and the depth of music and eloquence 1 
 
 Exercise 4. Self-sacrificing Ambition. — We need a loftier ideal to 
 nerve us for heroic lives. To know and feel our nothingness without regretting 
 it; to deem fame, riches, personal happiness, but shadows of which human 
 good is the substance ; to welcome pain, privation, ignominy, so that the sphere 
 of human knowledge, the empire of virtue, be thereby extended: such is the 
 soul's temper in which the heroes of the coming age shall be cast. When the 
 stately monuments of mightiest conquerors shall have become shapeless and 
 forgotten ruins, the humble graves of earth's Howards and Frys shall still be 
 freshened by the tears of fondly admiring millions, and the proudest epitaph 
 shall be the simple entreaty, 
 
 " Write me as one who loved his fellow-men."

 CHAPTER XII. 
 
 Accent — Inflection^Emphasis — Cadence. 
 
 Accent takes its place in the orthoepy of words. Inflection gives 
 true expression to words. Emphasis defines their value in a sentence. 
 
 By accent we divide the sounds in a word into syllables (so called), 
 and by giving more stress to one particular combination than to the 
 others we enunciate the word properly. 
 
 The rudimental principles of accent and emphasis, and the manner 
 of producing them, were given in the exercises for the vowel-sounds. 
 We have been very particular in directing attention to the distinctive 
 characteristics of the vowel, subvowel, and aspirate-sounds, and to 
 their distinctive utterance in all words wherein they are sounded. 
 
 Words are made up of one or more syllables ; but if we pronounce 
 all the syllables with equal stress of voice, the result, so far as sound 
 is concerned, will be that no word has been articulated. Therefore 
 accent is the discreting element of words, and plays the important 
 part of directing their pronunciation, and giving beauty and individ- 
 uality to their proportions. 
 
 Some words, meaning very different things, are spelled alike, and 
 distinguished by their accentuation alone; that is, the stress is 
 placed on one syllable in the one and on another syllable in the 
 other; as, Au-gust, the name of a month, and au-gust, an adjective 
 expressing something grand or majestic. So also many other words 
 differ in meaning when used to represent different parts of speech. 
 
 The pronunciation of the English language, like most others, is 
 arbitrary, and, like other things, is exposed to the caprices of fashion 
 and taste, and not unfrequently to vulgarism ; but its most deadly foe 
 is affectation. Provincialisms break in upon uniform rules; and all 
 combined leave but a very uncertain clew to direct us in the use of 
 accent. Orthoepists disagree, and it is not the province of this work 
 to decide. What is required by us is that on whatever syllable the 
 accent is placed it shall be clearly, distinctly, and musically rendered. 
 
 Accent embraces three functions — Stress, Time, and Pitch — which 
 we will illustrate as follows : 
 


## p. 58 (#64) ##############################################

58 MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 
 
 Accent denotes pitch, or the stepping down or up from a note or 
 halt-note, as the case may be. 
 
 Pitch and time may both be represented in the word ac-cent so as 
 to correspond to one note and a half-note in music, the accented sylla- 
 ble taking the whole note. The following will make it plain : 
 
 £ 
 
 The forcible prolongation of pitch on a particular syllable is called 
 accent. Any one who is well acquainted with the musical scale, 
 though never having practiced with reference to speech, may readily 
 ascertain this upward and downward intonation of the tones and 
 semitones by catching the note of the vowel -sound, and striking its 
 corresponding tone or key on some instrument. The aspirates have 
 nothing to do with the music of the voice. 
 
 Rule. — The accented syllable should be made more forcible in 
 utterance and of greater prolongation than other syllables in the 
 word, and on either a higher or lower pitch of voice. 
 
 It will be well to recall what has been before frequently said about 
 
 the functions of the vowels as the conveying element of the word. 
 
 The following arrangement of syllables will indicate the ranges of 
 
 voice when properly accentuating a word : 
 
 / a \ . 
 .cent. /Cent. / Mion. 
 
 Ac/ Ac/ X u X 
 
 Any combination of sounds that represent distinct ideas, though 
 they be monosyllables, may be said to have accent. But accent is 
 more clearly discernible in words of two or more syllables ; for it is 
 the thread with which we unite letters and syllables into words. 
 
 There have been some critical discussions on the subject of the 
 change of pitch which accent requires. Sheridan, in an elaborate 
 treatise on accent, declares it to be simple force on a syllable, and 
 likens it to "the hard and soft taps on a drum-head," which are 
 exactly on the same pitch, the more forcible tap producing the louder 
 sound. Accent can be produced exactly in this w T ay, and in our 
 rudimentary practice of accent on the vowel-sounds we have so given 
 it. But to say that the accented and unaccented syllables in words 
 are always on the same pitch is to make a statement that can not be 
 true, and which must have arisen from an uncultivated ear. 
 
 So little attention has been given to the cultivation and detection 
 of the delicate shades of voice-sound that the ear is rarely able to 
 


## p. 59 (#65) ##############################################

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 59 
 
 catch and discriminate closely the short and delicate steps which 
 a cultivated voice takes in the accentuation of a word of several 
 syllables. 
 
 Sheridan further says that the difference between our accent and 
 that of the Greek depends upon its seat, which always occurs on a 
 vowel in the latter, while ours may be either on a vowel or a conso- 
 nant, and that the reason why the Greek accent was placed over the 
 vowel w T as "that, as their accent consisted in a change of notes, they 
 could not be distinctly expressed but by the vowels, in uttering which 
 the passage is entirely clear for the issue of the voice without inter- 
 ruption or stop, as in pronouncing the consonants." 
 
 But the fact that consonants follow a vowel in a syllable should 
 make no difference in the change of notes, for the vowel-sound ceases 
 as soon as it has performed its mission ; and it should be sounded fully 
 and musically, whether it ends a syllable or is followed by a conso- 
 nant. This surely can in no way effect a change of note, for the 
 sound has to be commenced anew, so that the next vowel-sound can 
 take another note just as easily as it can resume the same sound. 
 Besides, the musical effect of speech depends much upon the purity 
 of the vow T el-sound, and the modulation of voice which the change 
 of pitch in accent gives. 
 
 Bead the following with due attention to accent and articulation. 
 Do not leave out any letter that is not silent, but give the accented 
 ones their time and pitch : 
 
 DEATH OF MORRIS. By Walter Scott. 
 
 It was under the burning influence of revenge that the wife of M&cgregor 
 commanded that the hostage, exchanged for her husband's safety, should he 
 brought into her presence. I believe her sons had kept this unfortunate wretch 
 out of her sight, for fear of the consequences ; but if it was so, their humane 
 precaution only postponed his fate. They dragged forward, at her summons, 
 a wretch, already half-dead with terror, in whose agonized features I recog- 
 nized, to my horror and astonishment, my old acquaintance Morris. 
 
 He fell prostrate before the female chief, with an effort to clasp her knees, 
 from which she drew back as if his touch had been pollution; so that all he 
 could do, in token of the extremity of his humiliation, was to kiss the hem 
 of her plaid. I never heard entreaties — for life poured forth with such agony 
 of spirit. The ecstasy of fear was such that, instead of paralyzing his tongue, 
 as on ordinary occasions, it even rendered him — eloquent; and with cheeks as 
 pale as ashes, — hands compressed in agony, — eyes that seemed to be taking 
 their last look of all mortal objects, he protested, with the deepest oaths, his 
 total ignorance of any design on the life of Eob Eoy, — whom he swore he 
 loved and honored as his own soul. In the inconsistency of his terror, he said

 he was but the agent of others; and he muttered the name of Rashleigh. He 
 prayed but for life; for life — he would give all he had in the world; — it was 
 hut life he asked; — life, if it were to be prolonged under tortures and priva- 
 tions; — he asked only breath, though it should be drawn in the damps of the 
 lowest caverns of their hills. 
 
 It is impossible to describe the scorn, the loathing and contempt, with which 
 the wife of Macgregor regarded this wretched petitioner — for the poor boon 
 of existence. 
 
 ■• 1 could have bid. you live" she said, "had life been to you the same weary 
 and wasting burden — that it is to me — that it is to every noble — and generous 
 mind. But you, — wretch ! you could creep through the world unaffected by its 
 various disgraces, its ineffable miseries, its constantly-accumulating masses of 
 crime and sorrow; — you could live and enjoy yourself, while the noble-minded 
 are betrayed, — while nameless — and birthless villai?is tread on the neck of the 
 brave and long-descended ; — you could enjoy yourself, like a butchers dog in the 
 shambles, — battening on garbage, while the slaughter of the brave went on 
 around you! This enjoyment you shall not live to partake of; you shall die, — 
 base dog, and that before yon cloud has passed over the sun." 
 
 She gave a brief command, in Gaelic, to her attendants, two of whom 
 seized upon the prostrate suppliant and hurried him to the brink of a cliff 
 which overhung the flood. He set up the most piercing and dreadful — cries 
 that fear ever uttered; — I may well term them — dreadful, for they haunted 
 my sleep for years afterward. As the murderers, — or executioners, call them 
 as you will, dragged him along, he recognized me, even in that moment of 
 horror, and exclaimed, in the last articulate words I ever heard him utter, 
 " O Mr. Osbaldistone, save me ! — save me ! ; ' 
 
 I was so much moved by this horrid spectacle that, although in momentary 
 expectation of sharing his fate, I did attempt to speak in his behalf; but, as 
 might have been expected, my interference was sternly disregarded. The 
 victim was held fast by some, while others, binding a large heavy stone in a 
 plaid, tied it around his neck, and others again eagerly stripped him of some 
 part of his dress. Half-naked, and thus manacled, they hurried him into the 
 lake, there about twelve feet deep, — drowning his last death-shriek with a loud 
 halloo of vindictive triumph, over which, however, the yell of mortal agony — 
 was distinctly heard. The heavy burden splashed in the dark -blue waters of 
 the lake ; and the Highlanders, with their pole-axes and swords, watched an 
 instant, to guard lest, extricating himself from the load to which he was 
 attached, he might have struggled to regain the shore. But the knot had been 
 securely bound ; the victim sank without effort ; the ivaters, which his fall had 
 disturbed, settled calmly over him ; and the unit of that life for which he had 
 pleaded so strongly was forever withdrawn from the sum of human existence. 
 
 Inflections embrace the concrete or continuous movements of 
 voice on a single word ; but cadence has reference to the fall or 
 proper closing of sentences. The cadence which is most pleasing to 
 the ear is the fall of a triade, or regular gradation of three notes, 
 from the prevalent pitch of voice. Therefore these two movements 
 


## p. 61 (#67) ##############################################

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 61 
 
 of voice should never be confounded. Cadence never occurs properly 
 in the middle of a sentence, nor should a sentence ever end with a 
 feeble and depressed utterance. All the slender characteristics of 
 voice are embraced in inflections. 
 
 Inflection and emphasis are closely related ; in many respects they 
 seem to mean so nearly the same thing that it is quite difficult to treat 
 them as separate subjects. We can scarcely give a decided inflection 
 to a word without its becoming, in consequence, more or less emphatic. 
 Nor can a word receive important emphasis without taking an inflec- 
 tion. Yet each has its own specific function, notwithstanding both 
 are required to give a full expression of the thought. 
 
 While treating upon accent, we demonstrated that it has its own 
 specific mission; which is to give character to a word, or rather 
 individuality, by throwing more stress and prolongation on one syl- 
 lable than on others, the accented syllable being uttered on a different 
 pitch of voice from the rest. 
 
 Inflection gives character and expression to the thought by point- 
 ing out all the delicate shades of meaning contained in the word. 
 The true meaning of words, from the lips of the person pronouncing 
 them, can never be misunderstood if the proper inflections are given — 
 whether of pleasure or contempt, fact or irony, love or hate, truth or 
 falsehood. 
 
 Inflections are the subtle exponents of the state of feeling expressed 
 in speech. 
 
 It has been said that human speech was invented for the purpose 
 of hiding our thoughts. This statement need not be taken as correct 
 by any means ; for, although human speech conveys many falsehoods 
 which we receive and believe, it is only so because we have not learned 
 to hear correctly. When we have learned what certain intonations 
 express, we can not well accept a falsehood from human lips. Truth 
 and falsehood can not be represented alike by vocality. Each uses 
 unconsciously its own tell-tale inflection, for each has a way of 
 expression peculiar to itself. Our business is to learn how things 
 express themselves. (See Gesture and Deportment.) 
 
 The modifications of inflections are four; viz., the rising, falling, 
 the wave or circumflex, and the intense monotone. These will be 
 marked in the following examples by these signs : - — — - — - ^~^ 
 
 The rising inflection turns the voice upward on a word or sentence ; 
 as, Are you going West ? All direct questions that can be answered 
 by yes or no take this inflection. Indeed, nearly all simple questions 
 take it.

 In addressing individuals or an audience use the rising inflection; 
 as, "Miss Smith;" "Mr. Brown;" " Ladies and gentlemen." 
 
 " Fellow-citizens, I am here to defend this cause." In this example 
 the sense is continuous to the close of the sentence. But if we say, 
 1 ' Fellow-citizens, I am here to defend this cause," the falling inflection 
 before the sense is complete makes a meaningless expression. "I am 
 here to defend this cause" sounds as if a new sentence had been com- 
 menced. Besides, the falling inflection used in addressing a person 
 is expressive of contempt, more or less, according to the amount 
 of circumflex used in the downward pointing of the voice; as, "Mr. 
 Brown — Mr. Brown — Mr. Brown." If the desire is to express con- 
 tempt for persons, then this inflection is appropriate ; but never give 
 the falling inflection to a name you desire to present respectfully. 
 
 Exebcises. 
 
 "Friends, Komans, countrymen! Lend me — your ears. I come to bury 
 Csesar, not to praise him." 
 
 " But thou, O Hope ! with eyes so fair, 
 "What was thy delighted measure? " 
 
 " Kind friends, at your call 
 I 'm come here to sing. 
 Or rather to talk, of my woes." 
 
 " Fathers, we once again are met in council." 
 
 ^ -v 
 
 " Air. Chairman — I trust, that I shall he indulged in a few reflections on 
 the danger of permitting the conduct — upon which it has been my painful 
 duty to animadvert — to pass without a solemn expression of the disapprobation 
 of this house." 
 
 "Falstaff. Master Brook, you shall hear. As good luck would have it, 
 comes in one Mrs. Page, gives her intelligence of Ford's approach, and by her 
 invention, and Ford's wife's direction, — I was conveyed into a buck-basket. 
 
 " Brook. A buck-basket ? 
 
 " Fal. Yea ;— buck-basket." 
 
 Great care should be observed lest in reading the voice acquire 
 the habit of taking the full falling inflection in the middle of a sen- 
 tence. Such a practice produces a very monotonous effect, and makes 
 it difficult for the listener to follow the chain of thought. Many 
 speakers fall into this error in their endeavor to obtain a solemn, 
 impressive manner. Another equally pernicious habit is a sort of 
 rainbow style, or reading on a curve. This is equally solemn, and 
 quite as somnolent as the other — is much employed in reading hymns 
 and poetry generally.

 The voice here rises in the middle of the lines, and falls at each 
 end. It is well to respect the ear and good sense of an audience ; and 
 the above style of reading any composition can only be used with 
 propriety and effect when the speaker wishes to soothe listeners into 
 a quiet slumber. It is meaningless, and of course can excite no 
 attention. The proper use of inflections is to give expression to the 
 thought. Affectation has its own inflection, which is easily detected ; 
 therefore beware of the misuse of these delicate and truthful expo- 
 nents of thought and feeling. 
 
 Eules for the Fatjjng Inflection. — Falling inflection is a 
 turning of the voice downward on a word, lower than it began. It is 
 always heard in the answer to a question; as, "Yes; I shall go next 
 week." Also in affirmative sentences; as, "I shall do so." And in 
 the language of authority; as, "Back to thy punishment, false 
 fugitive, and to thy speed add wings." Also of terror; as, "The 
 light burns blue." In the surprise of indignation; as, "Go, false 
 fellow! and let me never see your face again." In contempt; as, 
 "I had as lief not be as live to be in awe — of such a thing — as 
 myself." And of exclamation; as, "O heaven! O earth!" And 
 always in the final pause (not the interrogative form) where the sense 
 and sentence are completed. All general rules have some exceptions. 
 
 Examples in Rising and Falling Inflections. 
 
 "Are they ministers of Christ? Are they Jews?'' "They "are." 
 " Did you not speak tolt? " "My lord, I "did." 
 "Armed, say "you?" "Armed, my lord." 
 
 In conversation people are nearly always right in their use of in- 
 flections. In reading or reciting they are usually wrong. Therefore 
 it is well to train the ear to colloquial language by close attention; 
 also to cultivate the voice by breaking up sentences wherein difficul- 
 ties occur, putting them in colloquial form for the practice of inflec- 
 tion. They who do this will soon see how foolish and unnatural has 
 been their use of what should be delicate exponents of feeling. Of 
 course it will be understood that there is a great difference between

 the delicate turning of the voice on a word in a sentence and the full 
 falling cadence of a closing period. 
 
 On. When or in its disjunctive sense connects words and clauses 
 of an interrogatory character, the rising inflection occurs before it 
 and the falling after it. "Will you speak — or be silent?" "What 
 prompted you, love — or hate?" This implies that the question can 
 not be answered by yes or no, but demands an explanation. 
 
 When or is used in a conjunctive form, and can be replied to by 
 yes or no, it is usually followed by the rising inflection. "Shall you 
 go next week — or this?" 
 
 Few examples are given here because it is desired that the learner 
 furnish specimens under all the rules, and point them, for the criti- 
 cism of the class or teacher. It is only by such close analysis that 
 proper attention can be directed to this most important branch of 
 reading. The following exercises may be rendered under the rules 
 above given : 
 
 EXTRACT FROM "AS YOU LIKE IT." 
 
 Will. And good even to you, sir. 
 
 Touch. Good even, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy head; nay, 
 prithee, — be covered. How old are you, friend? 
 
 Will. Five and twenty, sir. 
 
 Touch. A ripe age. Is thy name William? 
 
 Will. William, sir. 
 
 Touch. A fair name. Wast horn i' the forest here? 
 
 Will. Ay, sir, I thank God. 
 
 Touch. Thank God ! a good answer. Art rich ? 
 
 Will. Faith, sir, so so. 
 
 Touch. So so is good, very good, — very excellent good : and yet it is not ; it 
 is hut so so. Art thou wise? 
 
 Will. Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit. 
 
 Touch. Why, thou sayest well. I do now rememher a saying, " The fool 
 doth think he is wise; hut the toise man knows himself to he a fool." The 
 heathen philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape, would open his 
 lips when he put it into his mouth; meaning thereby that grapes were made 
 to eat and lips to open. You do love this maid? 
 
 Will. I do, sir. 
 
 Touch. Give me your hand. Art thou learned? 
 
 Will. No, sir. 
 
 Touch. Then learn this of me: to have is to have; for it is a figure in 
 rhetoric that drink, — being poured out of a cup into a glass, — by filling one doth 
 empty the other; for all your writers do consent that ipse is he: now, you are 
 not ipse, for I am he. 
 
 Will. Which he, sir? 
 
 Touch. He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you clown, 
 abandon — which is in the vulgar leave — the society — which in the boorish is

 company — of this female — which in the common is woman; which together 
 is abandon the society of this female, or, clown, thou perishest; or, to thy 
 better understanding, diest; or, to wit, I kill thee, — make thee away, — translate 
 thy life into death, thy liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with thee, 
 or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy with thee in faction; I will o'errun 
 thee with policy ; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways : therefore tremble 
 and depart. 
 
 Aud. Do, good William. 
 Will. God rest you merry, sir. 
 
 The importance of rendering the inflections correctly will be ap- 
 parent by reading the following exercise with the rising inflection : 
 
 " The man who is in the daily use of ardent spirits, if he does not become 
 a drunkard, is in danger of losing his health and character. 
 
 It will be seen that using the rising inflection on the words marked 
 for emphasis implies that the man must become a drunkard in order 
 to preserve his health and happiness. If rendered with the down- 
 ward inflection, the true idea will be conveyed. 
 
 Rule. — When two words are connected, expressing an alternative, 
 the first one takes the rising, the second the falling inflection. Swift — 
 or slow; rough — or smooth; smooth — or rough. Live — or die; sur- 
 vive — or perish. But when spoken in an interrogative manner the 
 inflection is changed, the first word taking the falling and the second 
 the rising inflection ; as, "Swift — or sbivf Good — or bad?" etc. 
 
 The monotone or intense forward inflection indicates that the 
 voice is kept nearly on the same pitch or tone for several successive 
 words. This sometimes occurs in rapid expression, and sometimes 
 gives marked effect in grave and solemn passages. "But hark! 
 through the fast flashing lightning of war;" "But that I am forbid 
 to tell the secrets of my prison-house;" "Haste me to know it, that 
 I, with wings as swift as meditation or the thoughts of love, may 
 sweep to my revenge." 
 
 There is much abuse of this inflection, many persons trying to 
 render whole paragraphs without the least regard to emphasis or 
 the sentiment of the piece, taking for granted that a low continuous 
 tone expresses all of gravity. A greater mistake could not be made. 
 Many actors, indeed almost without exception, in playing the part 
 of the ghost in "Hamlet," assume what they probably consider a 
 sepulchral tone of voice. For what reason they take this liberty it 
 is hard to imagine. Is it a style peculiar to ghosts? Who can tell 
 us? Or did the senior Hamlet talk in that way.

 CHAPTER XIII. 
 
 The Circumflex, or Wave — Emphasis — Stress and Quantity — 
 Khetorical Pauses. 
 
 The circumflex, or wave, is a union of the rising and falling inflec- 
 tions, sometimes on one syllable and sometimes on several. Sneers, 
 taunts, gibes, and reproachful expressions have an accentuation pecul- 
 iarly their own, and partake largely of circumflections. 
 
 What we mean does not depend so much on what we say as on the 
 manner in which we say it. The modifying influences of accentuation, 
 inflection, and emphasis change the intention or whole idea, making 
 it something else. Whether we will or not, whatever is uttered under 
 the pressure of strong feeling expresses itself exactly. If the same 
 words are uttered under different circumstances, with reversed or 
 changed inflection, indicating a different state of mind, they will 
 mean something else. Therefore we must bear in mind that nature, 
 true to herself, stamps her meaning in all outward expression. 
 
 The question arises here then, of what use is the study of elocution 
 if nature is the best and only reliable teacher? As our education in 
 letters is obtained from books, and we become fixed in the habit of 
 using the letter without the spirit, we neglect giving such attention 
 to the manner as nature, the great master, prompts. The true elocu- 
 tionist, like the teacher of any art, can not go beyond the expression 
 of nature and give any degree of satisfaction. All that he can do is 
 to gather facts by close and critical study, and embody them in such 
 rules and distinctions as will place the pupil on the right road to 
 knowledge. If we take the following examples and simply read them 
 without taking into consideration the spirit in which they are uttered, 
 we will not convey their meaning. 
 
 If we were to say candidly to some persons, ' ' You are very wise 
 men, deeply learned in the truth; we, weak, contemptible, mean per- 
 sons ;" it would indicate an appreciation of merits in them far superior 
 to our own. But if we use the waves of voice that express sarcasm 
 we give just the reverse of what the simple definition of the words

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 37 
 
 implies: that they are self-conceited, and entertain a poor opinion of ws; 
 as, " You are very wise men, deeply learned in the truth; we, weak, 
 contemptible, mean persons." The Queen of Denmark, in reproving 
 her son Hamlet for his conduct toward his stepfather, whom she 
 married shortly after the murder of the king, her husband, says to 
 him emphatically, "Hamlet, you have your father much offended." 
 He replies, with the circumflex that indicates a taunt, "Madam — 
 you — have my father much offended/' While she meant that he had 
 offended her second husband, he, using the same words, flings the 
 reproach upon her that she had proven untrue to his own father ; thus 
 endeavoring to give expression to his suspicions and plant the dagger 
 of remorse in her bosom. 
 
 Art, studied appreciatively, adds beauty, ease, and gracefulness to 
 the promptings of nature, giving greater power for good or evil. Yet 
 there is a distinction that must be made w T hen art is studied and 
 applied to evil purposes or to deceive ; then it is leveled to trickery. 
 But wdien it is sought for ennobling objects, for higher achievements, 
 it becomes the handmaid of progress. Study it always in behalf of 
 the latter, and you will help to bless the world. 
 
 Close and critical attention to these delicate slides of voice is all- 
 important. In speech, the right or wrong rendering of these gives a 
 pervading character to the whole delivery, and the grace and refined 
 ease of polished society is much indebted to the correct expression 
 of inflections. Do not fear that time will be lost in the study and 
 practice of these essential elements in good reading and speaking. 
 The following examples may now be rendered : 
 
 " Moneys — is your suit. 
 
 "What should I say to you ? Should I not say, 
 
 Hath a dog money ? — is it possible 
 
 A cur can lend — three thousand ducats?" 
 " "What says that fool of a Hagar's offspring? " 
 " "What ! — can so young a thorn begin to prick ? " 
 " How like a fawning publican he looks ? " 
 " They tell us to be moderate; but they — they are to revel in profusion ! " 
 
 "Then Satan — answered the Lord, and said, Doth Job — fear God — for 
 naught? And Job answered — and said, No doubt — but ^ye^— are the people, 
 and wisdom — shall die with you." 
 
 In strongly impassioned sentences it frequently requires the slur 
 of several notes on one word to express the intensity of scorn. The 
 following reply of Death to Satan gives a striking example of this

 length of circumflex. The scorn and contempt exhibited is so intense 
 there is little danger of overdoing: 
 
 • Ami reckon'st tKou thyself with sjnnts of heaven, HELL-DOOMED, 
 ami breath 1 si defiance liTrc and scorn, where i reign king, and to enrage thee 
 more, — thy king, and lord." 
 
 The circumflex is also used in grand and impressive passages. In 
 the following example from Isaiah, so simple, yet so grand and com- 
 prehensive, is a fine illustration of the pitch of dignified descent or 
 cadence of the slur, and of the intense monotone : 
 
 4 r is the Lord God of Hosts. 
 
 3 J Holy, <Sh The whole earth — is full — 
 
 2 ) Holy, of his glory. 
 
 Who shall ascend into the hill of the Lord? or — who — shall — stand — in his 
 holy 2^ ace ? 
 
 The following words which Shakespeare put into the mouth of the 
 untamed Hotspur most perfectly expresses his opinion of an effeminate 
 dandy. The recitationist should endeavor to look through the eyes 
 of a blunt, straightforward, honest, earnest soldier, defending himself 
 from an unjust accusation. It will be found that only a free use of 
 the slender qualities of voice, made up largely of inflections and 
 waves, can express the utter contempt and insignificance with which 
 he regards the subject.

 " Hotspur. My liege, — I did deny no prisoners. 
 But I remember when the fight was done, 
 "When I was dry with rage, and extreme toil, 
 Breathless, and faint, leaning upon my sword, 
 Came there a certain lord; neat, trimly dress'd; 
 Fresh as a bridegroom ; and his chin, new reap'd, 
 Showed like stubble-land — at harvest home. 
 He was perfumed like a milliner; 
 And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held 
 A pouncet-hox, which ever and anon 
 He gave his nose. And still he smil'd and talk'd; 
 And as the soldiers — bore dead bodies by, 
 He called them untaught knaves, unmannerly, 
 To bring a slovenly, unhandsome corse 
 Betwixt the wind — and his nobility. 
 "With many holiday — and lady terms 
 He question'd me; among the rest, demanded 
 My prisoners in her majesty's behalf.

 To be so pestered with a popinjay, 
 
 Out of my grief, and my impatience, 
 
 Answered negligently — I know not what, — 
 
 He should, or should not ; for he made me mad 
 
 To see him shine so b7'isk, and smell so sweet, 
 
 And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman 
 
 Of guns, and drums, and wounds (heaven save the mark!) 
 
 And telling me the sovreign'st thing on earth 
 
 Was spermaceti — for an inward bruise; 
 
 And that it was a great pity (so it was) 
 
 That villainous saltpetre — should be digged 
 
 Out of the bowels of the harmless earth, 
 
 Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd 
 
 So cowardly ; and but for these vile guns 
 
 He would himself have been a soldier. 
 
 This bald un jointed chat of his, my lord, 
 
 I answered indirectly, as I said; 
 
 And I beseech you let not his report 
 
 Come current, for an accusation, 
 
 Betwixt my love and your high majesty." 
 
 There have been many rules laid down and suggestions given in 
 regard to the proper rendering of the emphatic words in sentences. 
 With what degree of success they have been attended, or what actual 
 guide they have been to the student, we will not discuss here. 
 
 Most readers and speakers, however, regard emphasis as a matter 
 of private judgment, which their own taste and appreciation of the 
 sentiment should dictate, and which can not be determined by fixed 
 rules; forgetting that taste would lose its significance, or at least 
 become very bad taste, if it failed to translate the author's sentiments 
 correctly. 
 
 We might, with as much propriety, use the same liberty with the 
 accentuation of syllables, or declare that individual taste should settle 
 the various parts of speech. Emphasis is either something or nothing. 
 It has a specific use or it has no use. If it has a legitimate place, it 
 must be amenable to some law. 
 
 Then who is to decide this matter, it is asked. Is not one person 
 as good authority as another? To the first question we would reply, 
 nature is to decide ; to the second, they are the best authority who 
 have studied most closely natural effects. People in earnest, animated 
 conversations and discussions, in asking or answering questions, always 
 place the emphasis on the proper word, and would not deviate in 
 rendering the ideas of others if they had not been erroneously taught 
 by those who have ignored nature's invaluable lessons. 
 


## p. 70 (#76) ##############################################

70 MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 
 
 We will give some specimens where taste and appreciation of sen- 
 timent decided the emphatic words. 
 
 Example 1. — The first sentence in the soliloquy of Macbeth when 
 he is debating the murder of King Duncan — "If it were done when 
 't is done, then it were well it were done quickly." 
 
 Any one w T ho has observed critically the rendition of this passage 
 by different professional readers and actors will have heard it empha- 
 sized in the following various styles: "If it were done when 'tis done, 
 then it were well it were done quickly." The sense of which is: "If 
 it were done when 'tis, it were well." Here the sense is already com- 
 pleted, and "it were done quickly" becomes a meaningless clause, 
 having no reference to what precedes it. 
 
 Example 2. — "If it were done when 'tis done, then it were well it 
 were done quickly." "If it were when 'tis" is without meaning. If 
 it is, it absolutely is; there is no "if it were" about it. By such 
 emphasis we are led to this conclusion, that "if it were when 'tis, then 
 it were well it were." 
 
 The true idea to be conveyed is that the act does not prevent 
 consequences following it; that committing the murder is no surety 
 that the business will be finished — the object attained. 
 
 Let us substitute the word finished for the first "done," and we 
 will have no trouble in placing the emphasis: "If it were finished 
 when 'tis done, then it were w T ell it were done quickly." Of course we 
 can not help wishing that Macbeth had possessed a more copious 
 language, and had not been obliged to use the same word three times 
 in a sentence. But the office of the elocutionist is to find the meaning 
 of the author and give it the proper expression, no matter how much 
 it may be hidden by inexpressive words. 
 
 We will give one other example, from Paul : 
 
 "0 death ! where is thy sting? 
 grave ! where is thy victory? " 
 
 The majority of persons who read these sentences place the em- 
 phasis on is, which conveys the idea that the sting of death and the 
 victory of the grave are things the reader is searching to find and 
 eager to possess. They are simply exclamations of triumph, in con- 
 sequence of the resurrection having gained the victory over death and 
 the grave. This having been fully demonstrated, the apostle bursts 
 forth with this psean, placing the emphasis on where; meaning, where 
 now is thy sting: 
 
 " death ! where is thy sting ? 
 grave ! where is thy victory?"

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 71 
 
 We hope these quotations will be sufficient to convince both reader 
 and student that emphasis must be governed by fixed rules, inherent 
 in the nature of things. 
 
 As we have shown that emphasis placed on the wrong words 
 entirely changes the meaning of the author, it will be further seen 
 that close and critical analysis is required, not only to find the truly 
 emphatic word iu a sentence, but to ascertain in what way it is con- 
 trolled by something previously expressed. 
 
 Rule. — Simple courtesy requires that all proper names, when 
 introduced for the first time, should receive emphasis. 
 
 This rule must also be observed in presenting people to each other ; 
 and further, when several names are spoken in succession, each must 
 receive stress, and must not be pronounced in the same pitch of voice 
 nor with the same breath. 
 
 Example. — " George and Mary, James and Cynthia, John and Eliza 
 attended the celebration." These persons are distinctly and separately 
 introduced, and each individual name must be pronounced with dif- 
 ferent emphasis (or pitch of voice) from the preceding one. 
 
 We can readily see the folly of disregarding this rule if we present 
 a number of persons in succession, trying to pronounce their .names 
 with one breath and in exactly the same pitch of voice. Certainly 
 nothing could be more disrespectful. Therefore we see here a law, 
 founded on the nature of things, to neglect or disobey which would 
 be inexcusable. 
 
 The above rule applies also to objects and topics when first pre- 
 sented. It is but an act of politeness, due to the listeners, that they 
 may become acquainted with a new subject demanding their consid- 
 eration. If this is neglected, the subject — its acts, qualities, etc. — 
 mingle in inextricable confusion in the mind of the listener. 
 
 >'ote. — After a formal, emphatic presentation of nouns has taken place, according to the 
 preceding rule, on their recurrence the}' do not take the same prominence ; but their acts 
 and qualities are next in order to receive stress. 
 
 Example. — It rained, it hailed, it bleiv, making the storm terrific." 
 Storm does not receive stress, because it stands in the position of a 
 recurrence of the word. But the writer has introduced three distinct 
 acts to express the character of the storm, and these should not be 
 spoken on the same pitch of voice. As they all mean different things, 
 different qualities of voice are required. 
 
 Therefore all students of elocution should analyze each sentence, 
 for the purpose of gaining the author's full meaning. This, of course, 
 involves an amount of study that may be discouraging to those who

 expect to become proficients without labor; but it is the shortest and 
 only road to excellence. 
 
 One very simple way of finding correct emphasis is by questions 
 and answers. Let us take a part of the 23d Psalm, and by questions 
 and answers see what we learn: 
 
 "The Lord is my Shepherd: I shall not want." Why shall I not 
 want? Because the Lord is my Shepherd. Therefore we get this 
 rendering: "The Lord is my SJiepherd: I shall not want" 
 
 "He maketh me to lie down in green pastures." Where doth He 
 make me to lie down ? In green pastures. He leadeth me where ? By 
 the still waters. He leadeth me in what paths? Of righteousness. 
 For whose sake? For His name's sake. Again, "Unto thee, O Lord, 
 do I lift up my soul!" Unto whom do I lift up my soul? Unto tJiee. 
 What do I lift up unto thee? My soul. 
 
 Note.— Remember that my is never emphatic unless it is used to denote possession, in 
 contrast to something possessed by others, or when the object possessed is a subject of con- 
 troversy. 
 
 "The Lord said unto my lord, sit thou at my right hand until I 
 make thine enemies — thy footstool," is correct, for two separate lords 
 are designated. 
 
 Rule. — When any two words in a sentence are brought in contrast 
 they are emphatic; as, "Why should it live — wdiile Jam fallen?" 
 
 In simple emphasis, where there are repetitions, or a succession of 
 particulars to be designated, the stress is marked more by different 
 pitches of voice and inflection than by increased loudness. 
 
 "They (through faith) subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained 
 promises, stopped the mouths of lions; — out of weakness were made strong, — 
 waxed valiant in fight, turned to flight the arms of the aliens." 
 
 " But the fruit of the spirit is love, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, 
 goodness, faith, meekness, temperance." 
 
 " The rocks crumble, the trees fall, the leaves fade, and the grass withers" 
 
 Emphasis may be properly divided into two classes, the Grammat- 
 ical and Rhetorical. 
 
 Grammatical emphasis sustains the corresponding relation to words 
 in a sentence that accented syllables do to words, it being one of the 
 essential elements that helps to give correct meaning, as well as life and 
 soul to all delivery. As the subject and predicate are the important 
 words in a sentence, they receive the stress from grammatical necessity. 
 
 We will construct an example in simple grammatical emphasis. 
 In pronouncing the name of God we should give it sufficient force to 
 convey our devotional reverence for his name. If we say God is, there

 is an interest awakened, and the important stress is placed on the predi- 
 cate, which means that he exists, that he is all in all. If we say God 
 is great, it then becomes a simple copula ; great is the thing predicated, 
 and which receives the important stress. In all simple declarations 
 this is a rule : John is wise ; Julia is beautiful ; James is good. 
 
 Rule 1. — But if they assume the form of positive affirmation or 
 opposition to some other expressed opinion, then the copula receives 
 the important stress; as, John is wise, notwithstanding you do not 
 think so; Julia is beautiful, and James is good. 
 
 Rule 2. — In altercations and disputes the emphasis is changed 
 from the pronoun to the verb : ' ' This is my book. It w t as your book, 
 but it is not now." The student should be required to originate sen- 
 tences, emphasizing according to the preceding examples. 
 
 Rule 3. — In the repetition of a question the verb takes the stress; 
 as, Who is this man of whom you speak? No answer being received, 
 the question is repeated, Who is this man of whom you speak? 
 
 In all affirmations confirming a fact about which doubt has been 
 expressed follow the same rule. 
 
 There are two ways of making emphasis — by stress and quantity. 
 Stress is simple unimpassioned emphasis, such as occurs in important 
 words in general conversation, or in reading sentiments or thoughts 
 not particularly impressive. Quantity is either loudness or force, 
 with more prolongation of the vowel-sounds on the unaccented sylla- 
 bles, and is marked also by variety of pitch. 
 
 When two or more states, conditions, or qualities are used in the 
 predicate they are all emphatic, and usually increase in force of 
 utterance, the last one receiving more stress than the preceding 
 ones ; but they should be spoken on different pitches, rather than 
 in loudness of voice, bearing in mind also that two emphatic words 
 must not be spoken without taking breath between them. God is 
 Qtyreat — and Wgood — and '^glorious. 
 
 Exercise in Medium Emphasis. 
 
 Ere three shrill notes the pipe had uttered, 
 You heard as if an army muttered ; 
 And the grumbling — grew to a mighty — rumbling, 
 And out of the house the rats came tumbling; — 
 Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats, 
 Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats ; 
 Grave old plodders, — gay young fris Jeers ; 
 Fathers, mothers, — uncles, cousins, 
 Curling tails and pricking whiskers ; 
 Families — by tens and dozens; —

 Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives — 
 Followed the piper for their lives. 
 From street to street ho piped, advancing, 
 And step for step they followed, dancing, 
 Until they came to the river Weser, 
 Wherein all — plunged and perished 
 Save one, — who, stout as Julius Cassar, 
 Swam across, and lived to carry- 
 To itatf-land-home his commentary. 
 
 Words are emphatic when opposition is expressed or understood, 
 or when we wish to enforce contrast. 
 
 Example. — He who can not bear a joke should never give one. He that is 
 past shame is past hope. The head— without the heart — is like a steam-engine 
 without the boiler. They are generally most ridiculous themselves— who see 
 most to ridicule in others. 
 
 Words used to exhibit differences, joined by conjunctions, are 
 emphatic; as, "Sink or swim, — live or die, — survive or 'perish." "The 
 sun and moon — refused to shine." "Heaven and earth — will witness." 
 "Land and sea." 
 
 Over, under, beneath, below, above, upon, unto, within, without, 
 my, your, our, their, etc. , are never emphatic unless made so by being 
 contrasted by their opposite in meaning. 
 
 Example. — We went over the bridge, not under it. We took the road 
 below the town, not the one leading through the town. This is my seat, not 
 yours. He is the governor of our state, not of theirs. 
 
 Remark.— If we say, we loved, you hated, they wept, both subject and predicate receive 
 stress ; for attention is drawn to the fact that there are not only different parties, but that 
 they are doing different things. 
 
 Exercise in Emphasis and Khetorical Pauses. — How mean, — how 
 timid, — how abject, must that spirit be which can sit down — contented with 
 mediocrity. As for myself — all that is within me is on fire. I had rather be 
 torn into a thousand pieces than relax my resolution of reaching the sublimest 
 heights of virtue — and knowledge, of goodness — and truth, of love — and wisdom. 
 Nothing so admirable in human affairs but may be attained by the industry 
 of man. We are descended from heaven; thither let us go. Let nothing satisfy 
 us — lower than the summit of all excellence.^ 
 
 Note. — Parenthetical clauses must be spoken in quicker time, and at least a note lower, 
 than the words preceding and following. 
 
 The student may now be required to read the following exercise 
 from "The Passions," paying strict attention to all that has been said 
 about emphasis, breathing, pitch, and parenthetical modulation : 
 
 "When Music (heavenly maid) was young, 
 While yet, in early Greece, she sung, 
 


## p. 75 (#81) ##############################################

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 75 
 
 The Passions oft (to hear her shell) 
 Throng'd around her magic cell, — 
 Exulting, trembling, raging, fainting, — 
 Possess'd beyond the Muse's painting. 
 By turns, they felt the glowing mind 
 Disturbed, delighted, raised, refined ; 
 Till once ('t is said) when all were fired, 
 Filled with fury — rapt — inspired — 
 From the supporting myrtles round 
 They snatched her instruments of sound ; 
 And, as they oft had heard apart 
 Sweet lessons of her forceful art, 
 Each — (for madness ruled the hour — ) 
 Would prove his own expressive power." 
 
 After facility in simple emphasis has been acquired, it will be easy 
 to master the rhetorical. 
 
 Khetorical emphasis has relation to the expression of the forcible, 
 passional, and emotional qualities. It does not interfere with the 
 grammatical sense, but conveys intensity and passional expression 
 that the other fails to do. 
 
 If we say, "To arms, they come," the grammatical sense is complete ; 
 But if the clauses are repeated, it is indicated that there is something 
 more to be expressed. If we repeat the words without any additional 
 stress of voice, there is nothing gained by their repetition. "They 
 come! to arms! to arms! to arms!" The simple call, "They come! 
 to arms!" will convey just as much as the repetition; but if each 
 additional "to arms" is given with increasing force and higher pitch, 
 some idea of the state of alarm and the necessity for immediate 
 resistance will be manifested. 
 
 r™ ln „ol to arms! 
 
 ml . , , TO ARMS ! 
 
 They come ! to arms ! 
 
 This manner of rendition is absolute in all such passages where 
 alarm and sudden resistance, or desire for help, is to be expressed. 
 ' T is nature's own expression. Let this and similar clauses be prac- 
 ticed by commencing with the loud and high pitch, and diminishing 
 in ratio to the close, and it will be seen how foolish and inadequate 
 is the result. Kesistance and bravery will appear to be rapidly 
 oozing out. 
 
 Note.— Words, phrases, and sentences that require high pitches of voice before the 
 climax is attained we denominate intense rising emphasis ; those which require descent 
 to lower and graver pitches of voice we will denominate the intense falling or descending 
 emphasis. 
 
 The repetition of words always indicates their increased expression, 
 but does not indicate that they shall always be given on higher pitches

 of voice. Repetitions of a sacred, grave, impressive, and dignified 
 
 character require the downward stepping of the voice; and, if the 
 
 last repeated word closes the sentence, takes usually a low, emphatic, 
 
 prolonged half-whisper. 
 
 If I were an American as I am an Englishman, I never would lay down 
 
 my arms; no, never, 
 
 ' never! 
 
 The student will see at once the marked contrast in the two exam- 
 ples above given, and also the difference of expression necessary to 
 render the opposite conditions or states of mind. 
 
 The cool deliberation of a person debating a strong case, endeav- 
 oring to convince the judgment of an assembly, and enforcing his 
 arguments by the powers of reason and rhetoric, would be quite 
 different from the excited condition of one trying to arouse people to 
 resistance against immediate danger. Neither would he use the scold- 
 ing or high tones of anger ; to do so would only make him ridiculous, 
 and be but a waste of breath and passion. The same rule is in force 
 where a succession of words follow each other which directly appertain 
 to the same subject, although not the same words repeated ; as, 
 
 They, — by a strange frenzy driven, — fight for power, for plunder — and 
 
 extended rule; we,-for our country, a ltars,-an& 
 
 ' our homes. 
 
 Without a grave,— unlcneUed _ 
 
 ' uncoffined,-^ ^^ 
 
 Also in all clauses and words that are used to express contempt ; as, 
 
 Thou slave, ,-, , , 
 
 ' thou wretch, ,, _ , 
 
 ' thou coward! 
 
 Thou art too base for man 
 
 To tread upon ; ,, , 
 
 r ' thou scum! ,, ,., . 
 
 thou reptile 1 
 
 But this full, falling emphasis occurs on the last-repeated word 
 only when it ends a sentence. 
 
 But if the repeated words or clauses commence the sentence — as in 
 this example, "Ever thicker, thicker, thiclcer froze the ice on lake and 
 river" — the first and second should take the increasing descending 
 emphasis, but the last word "thicker" commences on exactly the pitch 
 on which the second terminated, rising with a circumflex of voice to 
 the pitch on which the first word "ever" was spoken ; for it is a law 
 that no word should receive a full falling inflection or cadence until 
 the sense or thought in the sentence is complete. The sense is here 
 continued; and while the grave and impressive stress is required, it

 completory.

 How often we hear clergymen read the following passage: "Holy, 
 holy, holy is the Lord God," etc., in a grave and monotonous tone 
 of voice, giving just exactly as much force on one word as on the 
 other; and the "who was, and ivho is, an^ who is to come," with the 
 emphasis each time on the who. 
 
 Holy ' holy liolV is the Lord God Almighty, 
 Who ivas, and who is, and who is to come. 
 
 Was, is, and is to come are used here to express the omnipresence 
 of the Lord God Almighty, from the beginning to the end of time. 
 If these are not emphasized the sense is not rendered. 
 
 When a sentence is commenced with repeated clauses which have 
 reference to time, place, distance, or particular qualities, the noun 
 should be the first to receive the emphasis ; in the second repetition 
 the adjective receives the stress ; in the third or last, both adjective 
 and noun take increased power.

 Repeated sentences commencing with the same word or clauses ex-

 of the words strike and home takes an increasing circumflex also.

 Pauses sometimes correspond to rests in music. As we have dwelt 
 so much upon the necessity of respiration, it will be only necessary to 
 Bay that the first use of a pause is to give time for the speaker to take 
 breath. Pauses, or suspensions of voice, are of various lengths, from 
 the slight breaking of voice between syllables to the prolonged rhetor- 
 ical pause required to give effect and particularize a meaning which 
 rapidity of utterance never allows. 
 
 Close, attentive listening to rapid reading or speaking will enable 
 a person to catch the leading idea of the author, but scarcely any 
 thing further than this. To present a subject fully requires something 
 more. ''There is a time for all things," is a saying as old as Solomon ; 
 and that all things require time for their completion and perfect work 
 is equally true. And it frequently becomes essential that not only a 
 suspension of voice is necessary, but a visible pause is required before 
 a word to excite expectation in the minds of the listeners, else they 
 will not be impressed with the full importance of the word which is 
 to follow. We denominate this "rhetorical effect," and the suspension 
 
 Of Voice RHETORICAL PAUSE. 
 
 The rhetorical pause occurs before or after the important words, 
 and it is sometimes necessary that a word or sentence shall be com- 
 pletely cut off or separated from what precedes it, and also from that 
 which follows, by this suspension of voice, in order that sufficient 
 attention may be drawn to it. But the words or clauses thus set 
 apart receive emphasis in some form of modulation of voice that 
 is not given to the others. Thus where opposite things or qualities 
 are contrasted, the quality of voice must be used that will best 
 express the character of each; as, Virtue — leads to happiness; — 
 vice, — to misery. 
 
 These pauses are of greater or less duration, and are regulated in 
 length by the importance of the words or clauses before and after 
 which they occur. To give some idea of the comparative length of 
 these rests, we will illustrate by the use of one or more little pause- 
 dashes, but give them merely as an illustration ; for the pupil should 
 strive so to enter into the spirit of what he says or reads as to have 
 them prompted by his feelings. 
 
 A Deity — believed — is joy begun ; a Deity adored is joy advanced ; 
 
 a Deity BELOVED is joy matured. 
 
 It will be seen that this gives a separate molding of the different 
 degrees of development of the religious state; and when rendered 
 with the proper observance of the pauses, and. a slightly increasing 
 


## p. 79 (#85) ##############################################

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 79 
 
 emphasis, with an equally increasing rising circumflex of voice on the 
 words believed, adored, bebved, the effect is very impressive. 
 
 " Eoll on, — thou deep — and dark — blue ocean, roll ; 
 
 Ten thousand fleets sweep — over thee in vain." 
 
 "Hail ! universal Lord ! Be bounteous still — to give us only good ; and 
 if the night — have gathered — aught of evil — or concealed, — disperse it now, as 
 light — dispels the dark." 
 
 It must be remembered that these pauses follow the law of climax 
 just as does emphasis; that there are always strong points to be 
 made, and the greatest force and expression must be reserved for 
 that purpose. 
 
 "Be our plain answer — this, The throne we honor — is the people's 
 
 choice; the laws we reverence — are our fathers' legacy; the faith — we 
 
 follow — teaches us— to live in bonds of charity with all mankind, — and die — 
 with hopes of bliss — beyond — the grave." 
 
 Let any person read the following extract from the flight of Xerxes 
 without the suspension of voice, and then with it, and they will dis- 
 cover the importance of its use : 
 
 " He who with heaven contended 
 Fled like a fugitive and slave; 
 Behind, the foe — before, the wave." 
 "Behind, the foe; before, the wave." 
 
 In the first case Xerxes is behind the foe ; in the last, the foe is 
 behind him. 
 
 Again, in the following quotation from Othello, where he smothers 
 Desdemona, the distinction between putting out the light of a taper 
 and the extinguishing of life could not be expressed without this 
 prolonged pause. Although Othello had many admirable traits of 
 character, the passion of jealousy was too fierce to be controlled by 
 his frank and generous nature. The pathetic detail which he gave 
 to Desdemona of the dangers and hardships he had passed "in the 
 tented field," excited in her the profoundest sympathy and love for 
 this rough and swarthy soldier; "and he loved her that she did pity 
 them." Othello was truly and devotedly attached to his wife; but, 
 being impetuous and hasty in his disposition, his suspicions were 
 easily awakened. Desdemona possessed a nature full of sweetness, 
 gentleness, and compassion, and was ever true and constant to her 
 husband. But Iago, a pretended friend of Othello — whose villainy 
 has scarcely a parallel even among the most odious characters which 
 Shakespeare has painted — by his dark innuendoes and insinuations

30 MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 
 
 against the conduct of Desdemona, succeeds in making Othello madly 
 jealous of her. In his tones of mingled jealousy, despair, and revenge 
 
 he says : 
 
 "She is gone! — I am abused; and my relief 
 Must be to hate her." 
 
 After the agitation of the storm in his bosom had in some measure 
 subsided, he concluded to terminate her existence. In the scene, 
 Desdemona is lying on a couch; Othello enters with a light, and, 
 with convulsed frame and broken murmurs, gazes upon his sleeping 
 victim, and then gives expression to his feelings in the following 
 
 words : 
 
 " It is the cause, it is the cause, — my soul ; 
 Let me not name it to you, — you chaste stars ! — 
 It is the cause. Yet I '11 not shed her blood; 
 Nor scar that whiter skin of hers — than snow, 
 And smooth as monumental alabaster. 
 Yet she must die, else she '11 betray more men. 
 
 Put out the light, — and then Put out — the light ! 
 
 If I quench thee, — thou flaming minister, — 
 
 I can again thy former light restore, 
 
 Should I repent me : but — once put out thine 
 
 (Thou cunning'st pattern of excellent nature), 
 
 I know not where is that Promethean heat 
 
 That can — thy light relume. When I have plucked thy rose, 
 
 I can not give it vital growth again, — 
 
 It needs must wither. I '11 smell it on the tree. 
 
 O balmy breath, that doth almost persuade 
 
 Justice herself to break her sword ! One more, one more ! 
 
 Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee, — 
 
 And love thee after." 
 
 To read or recite this requires great rhetorical expression ; and the 
 line wherein occurs, "Put out the light, and then put out the light," 
 must be particularly significant. The phrase "put out the light" in 
 the first case implies blow out the candle. Where it is repeated — thus, 
 " and then put out the light" — means put out the light of life; quite a 
 different matter. A rhetorical pause ought therefore to be made 
 after the word then and before the word the — the taking also a 
 prolonged emphatic circumflex. To read or recite this soliloquy 
 merely in a grammatical manner, without emphasis or rhetorical 
 pause, would make it unimpressive, flat, and even farcical — would 
 convey the idea that smothering one's wife was an easy and simple act 
 in the course of events.

 CHAPTER XIV. 
 
 Climax — Deep Breathing — Air — Stammering. 
 
 In argumentative composition there is always a point to be made 
 clear ; the culmination of proofs must be enforced gradually and with 
 increasing intensity of voice until the climax is attained. 
 
 Example 1. — " Let us contemplate then this connection which binds the 
 posterity of others to our own ; and let us manfully discharge all the duties it 
 imposes. If we cherish the virtues and principles of our fathers, Heaven 
 will assist us to carry on the work of human liberty and human happiness." 
 
 Example 2. — "Auspicious omens cheer us. Our firmament now shines 
 brightly above us. Washington is in the clear upper sky; Adams, Jefferson, 
 and other stars have joined the American constellation; — they circle round the 
 center, and the heavens — beam, with new — light. Beneath this illumination let 
 us walk the course of life; and — at its close devoutly commend our beloved 
 country, — the common parent of us all, — to the Divine Benignity." 
 
 In this peroration the last clause should terminate in a solemn half- 
 whisper, accompanied with the upraised hand of veneration. 
 
 Another equally good specimen is from the supposed speech of 
 John Adams on the Declaration of Independence, given elsewhere. 
 
 In highly poetical and emotional compositions the same law of 
 preserving the climax must be observed, or the beauty and perfection 
 of the idea as a whole will be lost. To illustrate this we will take the 
 last four verses of the 24th Psalm in full, as they are replete with 
 intense devotional fervor combined with great poetical exaltation. 
 After enumerating the qualities of head and heart that will insure 
 the blessing from the Lord, the Psalmist bursts forth in this poetical 
 rapture on the greatness and power of the King of glory : 
 
 Lift up your heads, — O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye everlasting doors; 
 and the King of glory — shall come in. 
 
 Who — is this King — of glory? The Lord — strong — and mighty, the 
 Lord — mighty in battle. 
 
 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye everlasting doors; — 
 and the King of glory shall come in. 
 
 "Who is — this King of glory? The Lord of Hosts, — he is the King — of glory.

 Exercises embracing Inflections, Emphasis, Rhetorical 
 Pauses, Modulation, and Prolongation. 
 
 All the preceding knowledge gained on these subjects must be put 
 in practice on these exercises. The numbers indicate the modulation 
 of voice required, as explained before by the use of lines and spaces. 
 It will be well for the teacher to write these and similar passages on 
 the blackboard for concert practice, as this will allow the class per- 
 sonal freedom for the graces of gesture.

 Note.— The last "how " must receive the upward, concrete slur of three notes (4, 5, 6) ; the 
 voice then falling to the 1st, by a discrete movement, on the word " like" finishing the climax 
 in a half-whisper.

 The first essential qualification for becoming a good speaker, reader, 
 or singer, is good breathmg. It is a solemn fact that one half the 
 civilized world knows not how to respire. All infants breathe prop- 
 erly ; but natural inflation is soon squeezed out of them. Air is very 
 well for animals, but is too common and vulgar for refined humanity. 
 A little air is all — a little short breath to flutter and pant with makes 
 a deliciously-interesting condition of health. It is so exquisite to be 
 too delicate to sing, and too feeble to read or converse. 
 
 Very false notions have hitherto prevailed with regard to the im- 
 portance of the uses of bodily functions. It is time that there should

 be an earnest protest instituted against any neglect of them. They 
 were given us as instruments and means of expressing the high, nohle, 
 and almost infinite faculties with which our Creator has been pleased 
 to endow us, and should be reverently and wisely preserved and used 
 for the purposes for which they were designed. People who squeeze 
 all the breath they can out of their lungs should never attempt to 
 sing praises to the name of God "with voice and cornet," for they can 
 not do it. That which was breathed into our nostrils, and made us 
 living souls, must have an abiding place ; and if we give it not room, 
 how can we thank or praise him while refusing to accept freely and 
 fully this first gift of life ? 
 
 There are certain muscles used in the act of breathing that must 
 be strong and flexible, else the process of respiration is very imperfect, 
 the blood is not vitalized, and a general debility and disease is the 
 result. Those to which we shall call special attention are the dia- 
 phragm and the abdominal muscles. If these are weak and inactive 
 the person is incapable of drawing a full breath and expelling it with 
 adequate force; and under these circumstances it will be out of the 
 question for a speaker to properly economize and utilize his breath. 
 He will suffer from fatigue, and be wanting in evenness and purity of 
 tone, and fail entirely in becoming impressive. 
 
 The diaphragm is an exceedingly elastic muscle, dividing by its 
 grand arch the lungs above from the stomach below. It is sometimes 
 spoken of as "the floor of the lungs and the roof of the stomach." 
 \Vhen this muscle is strong and under good control it contracts and 
 expands with great power. In the process of inhaling breath it 
 should contract so as to allow the lower air-cells of the lungs to 
 become fully inflated with air. This motion acts on the stomach, 
 and by its downward pressure on the abdominal muscles produces an 
 expansion. In exhaling breath these motions are reversed. And 
 this beautiful, harmonious contraction and expansion of the muscles 
 not only cause a vitalization of the blood, but incite the stomach to 
 activity and the viscera to healthy conditions, and render them all 
 efficient co-operators in the act of speaking. Indeed, if proofs are 
 wanted in regard to the use of these lower muscles, Ave may derive 
 instruction from observation of the animals in their expulsion of 
 voice-sounds. Observe the cow, how her flanks expand and contract, 
 and what tremendous expulsions of sound she makes, when bellowing 
 for her lost youngling. 
 
 The majority of persons breathe by taking as small a quantity of 
 air as possible into the upper portion of the lungs. If asked to take

 a deep breath, they will inhale what air they can, raise the shoulders, 
 expand the diaphragm, press it up against the lower portions of the 
 lungs, thereby preventing any possibility of this vitalizing element 
 entering that region. And they will hold this breath in the upper 
 part of the respiratory organs as long as they can, distending and 
 straining them to their utmost capacity. This they call deep breath- 
 ing; but the human organism in a normal condition of respiration 
 never makes such spasmodic exertions. Deep breathing is quite a 
 different process, and requires an opposite muscular movement. As 
 before stated, in the act of inhaling breath the diaphragm should con- 
 tract and the abdominal muscles expand, leaving room for the lower 
 cells of the lungs to become perfectly inflated. Then when the return 
 action of these muscles takes place there is a goodly quantity of breath 
 out of which to produce sound ; and these friendly muscles are in a 
 proper condition and position to hold and control the expulsion of 
 breath, make the vibrations even and the sounds pure. In the 
 method first referred to the muscles have already done their best in 
 sending the air into the upper cells. The contraction is already com- 
 pleted, and they are unprepared to assist the laryngeal chords in 
 controlling the voice-sounds. Besides, the unnatural forcing of air 
 into the upper part of the respiratory organs, straining and distending 
 them, and the rapid expulsion of this concentrated column of breath, 
 passing out by mere force of its accumulation, excite undue activity 
 of the vocal chords and often cause their paralysis and a consequent 
 loss of voice. In all cases it renders them disobedient to the will; 
 the vibrations are uneven and the voice-sounds imperfect. Stam- 
 mering, weak throats, and bronchial affections are the results most 
 common. Indeed, the amount of labor thrown upon the laryngeal 
 chords to perform without sufficient air, and without the friendly 
 co-operation of the dorsal and abdominal muscles, is appalling. And 
 the discordant, rating, rasping, screeching, sounds produced in con- 
 sequence are enough to drive one mad with torture. 
 
 To convey the ideas of the human mind, its emotions, its shades 
 of thought, requires a variety of vocal efforts. At times, loud and 
 strong tones — again, high and piercing ones — and again, delicate 
 inflections and soft intonations are necessary. All these subtle move- 
 ments of the chords and muscles should be of the nicest and most 
 delicate order, or the voice utterly fails to give such expression as the 
 mind desires. Certain means must be used to produce certain desired 
 results. Therefore it will be seen that a full, natural respiration is 
 the first essential qualification for producing a good voice. It is not

 to be understood that good breathing is all that is necessary; but 
 without a full expansion of the lungs, and a perfect control of the 
 muscles used in respiration, there can not be lasting resonance and 
 beauty of voice. 
 
 The ancient teachers of vocal culture, called pbnasei or vocists, in 
 order to develop strength of voice in their pupils, carried them through 
 a severe course of training of all the chords and muscles used in 
 breathing and speaking. How well they understood the co-operation 
 of the diaphragm and the abdominal muscles with the vocal apparatus, 
 and the importance of their strength and flexibility, is shown by their 
 compelling their pupils to lie on their backs with weights on their 
 chests, and to declaim while walking, running, and climbing. 
 
 We know but faintly what w r onderful power, flexibility, and 
 sweetness of voice we are capable of cultivating. The silver voice 
 of Cicero and the thunder-tones of Demosthenes echo through cen- 
 turies and encourage us to labor for perfection. A speaker with a 
 strong, magnetic voice comes before his audience clothed with power. 
 There is nothing so inspiring ; it gives weight to thought and enforces 
 argument. All great orators and tragedians have possessed great 
 force and resonance in this wonder-working instrument. It is said 
 that Garrick could speak with ease to ten thousand people. Let any 
 one seriously contrast the full, round, healthful voice with a sick, 
 feeble, squeaking one, and he will be willing to work faithfully for 
 the better one. 
 
 INFLUENCE OF POETRY AND MUSIC. 
 
 As the tendency of poetry — is to exalt the thought, so that of music is to 
 exalt the affections. As the aspirations of the poet are to raise the mind to 
 higher flights and sentiments, so those of the musician are to elevate it to 
 higher — and fuller exaltation of the emotions. We read poetry for the 
 former, and resort to music for the latter; and in vocal music both effects 
 are produced if the means — are adapted to the end. Poetry in its external 
 form should be expressed in language that implies the elevation of the senti- 
 ments, and be composed in rhythmical or metrical lines. Music — in its outward 
 form is a composition of varied sou?ids or tones, expressed in such style as to 
 imply the elevation of the affections, and composed in rhythmical proportion. 
 What poetry is — to thought, music is — to feeling. As in painting or in sculpture 
 we speak of the "poetry of form," so music may be called the poetry of sound; 
 and, internally, the poetry of feeling and emotion. How sad it is — to think of 
 its being perverted and made the servant or slave to the lower passions ! 
 
 Stammering is sufficiently common to require no description here, 
 further than to say it is a hesitation or interruption of speech. It 
 presents a variety of forms. In some cases the stammerer makes an

 effort to speak while his lips seem to be hermetically sealed ; in others, 
 he will, while speaking, suddenly lose all power of volition over his 
 articulating organs, while his mouth remains wide open. Others, 
 again, make an effort to speak, and all breath is expelled without 
 producing a sound. In most cases, however, there is usually little or 
 no vocality. To enumerate all the phases is unnecessary, as the cause 
 is essentially the same in all — weakness of the vocal and respiratory 
 muscles. But many persons continue the habit, which was acquired 
 in a delicate state of health, after these chords and muscles are strong. 
 In such cases it becomes exceedingly obstinate, and requires great 
 patience and determination on the part of both pupil and teacher to 
 effectually overcome it. 
 
 It will be recollected that we have said all voice or vocal sounds 
 are made in the top of the larynx, and that aspirates are pure breath- 
 sounds. Therefore, when we find the organs of speech simply give 
 us aspirate-sounds without any voice-sound, we refer the fault to the 
 place where the voice is produced. If the laryngeal chords are too 
 weak to obey volition, and can not contract soon enough to obstruct 
 the breath and cause an immediate vibration of air, the tongue 
 and lips take the unvocal breath and make it into aspirates. The 
 organs are all ready to talk, and the effort is to co-operate naturally. 
 And when the unfortunate person finds but a portion of his organs 
 working vigorously while the rest are making only spasmodic efforts, 
 it becomes embarrassing, and this of course only heightens the 
 difficulty. 
 
 The first step toward a cure is to direct the mind of the afflicted 
 person to the seat of the difficulty ; the second, a return to a normal 
 condition of breathing. The patient must acquire a full, even inhala- 
 tion and exhalation of air — so complete that the whole abdominal 
 surface will rise and fall harmoniously, unaccompanied by any spas- 
 modic exertions from the top of the lungs, or raising of the shoulders. 
 Nothing can be done that will give the least promise of success until 
 this much is gained. The next step should be a course of vocal 
 gymnastics, with as little talking as possible. Indeed, it would much 
 facilitate improvement if talking should be dispensed with altogether 
 at first, and the patient concentrate all energy in forming the vowel- 
 sounds. All the vowels should be expelled by different degrees of 
 force, in different lengths, and in different qualities of voice, until the 
 vocal muscles are strengthened and become perfectly obedient to the 
 will — never forgetting that these exercises must be moderate, and be 
 discontinued at the slightest indication of fatigue, and never losing

 sight of the important feet that the muscles and organs of speech, 
 like other members of the body, can be strengthened by use. 
 
 Syllables containing pure voice and pure aspirate-sounds may then 
 be taken as the next step in the order of practice; and so on, slowly 
 and calmly, to words; from words to clauses; from clauses to sen- 
 tences — remembering always to hold firmly to the vowel-sounds, at 
 least until the habit is completely acquired. The vowel-sounds are 
 the anchor of hope to the stammerer. It is often remarked that 
 stammerers have no trouble in singing what they wish, being perfectly 
 understood, while they can not speak a word intelligibly. In singing 
 they are obliged to prolong and make predominant the vocal or vowel- 
 sounds. The same practice should obtain in speaking, but not to so 
 great an extent. The stammerer must learn to use these sounds in 
 speech as readily as in song, and the battle is won. 
 
 We are fully aware that no written directions can take the place 
 of the calm, strong, helpful will of a teacher. The magnetic presence 
 of one who will not only inspire the patient to effort, but become a 
 support and strength to the yielding courage, is of great importance. 
 But let those who are thus afflicted consider this, that no one is with- 
 out a resource; that, to throw away all excitement and sensitive 
 nervousness on the subject, calmly accept the inevitable, and as calmly 
 determine to master the difficulty, will surely result in a triumph over 
 all obstacles. 
 
 The tendency of most persons in reading and writing is to let the 
 voice drop before a climax is obtained, or the fury of passion has 
 reached its height, which quite destroys the effect. To break up this 
 habit the preceding exercises (see pages 88, 89, 90, 91) have been 
 arranged on lines similar to the musical staff. By this means the eye 
 assists and guides the voice in the continuous upward intensity which 
 belongs to the vigor of passion; and then again, also, for the down- 
 ward or falling intensity. These are exceedingly important exercises, 
 and very invigorating and exciting. 
 
 The rapid circumflex of voice, or running of the scale, on a single 
 word, as in the illustrations, must not be omitted ; it will be impos- 
 sible to produce the desired effect without it. If the word up, as 
 illustrated on the chart, is first struck on the high pitch of voice upon 
 which the preceding and following words are uttered, there is nothing 
 gained but a severe strain of the vocal chords. But the rapid, upward 
 circumflex of voice, or running of the scale, ending on the high pitch, 
 will give the full expression and not injure the voice. This rule holds 
 good in all intense emphatic words in which the climax is centered.

 CHAPTER XV. 
 
 Pitch — The Orotund Voice — The Falsetto — The Conversational 
 Voice — The Grave Voice — The Tremolo — The "Whisper — Various 
 Movements oe Voice. 
 
 There is a diversity of opinion among authors in regard to what 
 constitutes the orotund and the falsetto voices; and after the most 
 elaborate descriptions students are no wiser, but are frequently more 
 puzzled than before. 
 
 The name "orotund," or round tone, perhaps contains within itself 
 the best definition that can be given. It properly means a prolonged 
 utterance on a high pitch of voice, but not so high as to preclude 
 the sound from a ringing fullness of tone. To make it the mouth 
 must be wide open, the lips projected, the voice pitched perhaps on 
 B, below the middle C, of the musical scale, and ranging in general 
 modulation up to E for female voices ; the male voice will be a fifth, 
 or an octave, below. In producing this voice the organs are open, 
 allowing a greater and more forcible column of air to pass out, 
 causing a great breadth of vibration. 
 
 This is a general rule ; but of course organic diversity must always 
 be respected. Whatever the organism may be, producing either alto 
 or treble, bass or tenor, each human voice has its relatively high, low, 
 and medium tones. The natural pitch of each is the predominating 
 tone used in speaking and reading; and the protracted exercises of 
 speaking requires that there be no violation of this organic law. Still, 
 in recitative exercises, one person may assume a variety of keys, and 
 carry on quite a dialogue, sustaining each pitch of voice very satis- 
 factorily. 
 
 The orotund is one of the most commanding and impressive move- 
 ments of the voice. It fully displays the majesty of man as a being 
 of soul, of thought, of imagination, and will. It is a quality of voice 
 that every public speaker should cultivate, for it bears vital and 
 magnetic forces on its wings. The patriotic and the loftier feelings

 of the soul are touched and aroused by its potency, and the religious 
 emotions awakened at its magic call. 
 
 "Now for the fight! Now for the cannon-peal! 
 
 Forward — through hlood, and toil, and cloud, and fire ! 
 Glorious the shout, the shock, the crash of steel, 
 
 The volley's roll, the rocket's blasting spire ! 
 
 They shake ! like broken waves their squares retire ! 
 On them, hussars ! Now give them rein and heel ! 
 
 Think of the orphan'd child, the murdered sire: 
 Earth cries for blood ! In thunder on them wheel ! 
 This hour to Europe's fate shall set the triumph-seal ! " 
 
 Exercises in Orotund Voice. 
 
 In the following exercises the voice ranges from G, on the fifth 
 of the scale, to B, C, D, and E: 
 
 (B) "Majestic monarch — of the cloud! 
 
 "Who rear'st aloft — thy regal form 
 To hear — the tempest — trumpings loud, 
 And see the lightning lances driven, 
 
 "When strive — the warriors of the storm 
 And rolls — the thunder-drum of heaven ! — 
 
 (C) Child of the sun! — to thee 'tis given 
 
 To guard the banner of the free, — 
 To hover — in the sulphur smoke, 
 To ward away — the battle-stroke, 
 (E) And bid its Mendings — shine afar, — 
 Like rainbows — on the cloud of war, 
 
 The harbingers — of victory. 11 — Drake. 
 
 (C) "No, let us rather choose, — 
 
 Arm'd with hell-flames and fury — all at once — 
 
 (E) O'er heaven's high tow'rs to force resistless way, 
 Turning our tortures into horrid arms 
 Against the torturer, (B) when, — to meet the noise 
 Of his almighty engine, — he shall hear 
 Infernal thunder, and — for lightning see 
 Black fire and horror shot with equal rage 
 Among his angels ; and his (E) throne itself 
 Mixt with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire, 
 His own invented torments." — Milton. 
 
 "The horrors and cruelties of civil and intestine war, the bloodshed and 
 the barbarism of the battle-field, the furies and the crimes attendant upon 
 massacre, conflagration, and pillage, can never be made to prepare the way for 
 the blessings of liberty, — peace, — and equal rights to enter — and take up their 
 abode in any land. They serve only to bind upon it still more firmly the burden

 and the woes of slavery and sin. 'All they that take the sword' (that is, select 
 and adopt it as the means of improving their social or political condition) 
 'shall perish with the sword.' But tryth — is mighty, reason — is mighty, con- 
 science — is mighty, yet the spirit of human and of Christian benevolence is 
 mightier than them all, — and the most despised minority, the most trampled 
 victims of oppression and slavery, if they make these the weapons of their 
 warfare, and wield them in faith, patience, and perseverance, will be sure to 
 conquer, — for God — will be their ally. And the strongest and fiercest— giant, 
 who comes to the field with a spear, and with a sword, and with a shield will 
 be sure to fall before the merest stripling who meets them in the name 
 of— the Lord."— C. W. Upham. 
 
 The falsetto, as its name implies, is false voice. We may more 
 properly say a strained voice. In oratory it is talking on a higher 
 pitch than the orotund, and partakes of the tones used in the effort 
 of calling or talking to persons at a distance. To produce it properly 
 the imagination should be directed to distance. The lips and corners 
 of the mouth are drawn further back than in producing the orotund, 
 and the sound is more shrill. The round O will best represent the 
 orotund tone and the compressed the falsetto. 
 
 This quality of voice is not much used in speaking, yet we have 
 many passages in recitations where it occurs, adding usually great 
 rhetorical force and beauty of expression, by its bursting suddenly 
 upon the hearer, in tones from eight to ten notes higher than the 
 general tenor of the piece. It occurs in passages where intense 
 excitement or alarm is to be exhibited, as in the cry of fire, help, 
 or of resistance, of victory, and in calling and hailing persons at a 
 distance; as, ^Fire! ( 9 )Fire! ( 10 )FIRE! 
 
 " 'Ah ! ' she said, ' the eyes of Panguk 
 Glare upon me in the darkness; 
 I can feel his icy fingers

 "The midday watch was set beneath the blaze of light, 
 When there came — a cry from the tall mast-head, 
 (ii) 'A sail! (I2)a sail in sight ! '" 
 
 This voice, when used to represent sounds in the distance, must be 
 fainter and much softer than that pitch of voice used in representing 
 
 something near : 
 
 "When o'er the silent seas alone 
 For days and nights we 've cheerless gone, 
 Oh! they who 've felt it know how sweet 
 Some sunny morn a sail to meet.

 Sparkling at once is every eye; 
 (9) 'Ship ahoy ! CH>)ship ahoy ! • our joyful cry; 
 While answering back the sounds we hear, 
 (li) 'Ship ahoy! (l*)sAi/4hoy I what cheer? what cheer?'" 
 
 The conversational voice, though it should be pure in tone, is re- 
 stricted in compass or prolongation, and the vibrations are not so 
 forcible as in the orotund. Very many people, in common conver- 
 sation, run into an insipid falsetto, mixed with nasal tones, which are 
 exceedingly grating to the ear of the listener. 
 
 We may perhaps be allowed to add here that this nasal-sound is a 
 predominant fault in some parts of our country. But it should never 
 be dignified, as it sometimes is, by naming it a head-voice. There is 
 no such thing as a head-voice in nature. It is a habit, and an exceed- 
 ingly bad one, of perverting pure sound ; forcing it through the nose 
 when it ought to have free passage through the open mouth. There 
 is but one pure nasal-sound in the English alphabet, which occurs on 
 ng or nk, and in this there is no mixture of mouth-sound. M and n 
 are formed in the back of the mouth, and the sound thrown through 
 the nose. They are mixed mouth and nasal-sounds. If there is any 
 stoppage of this passage, by a drying of the secretions, by catarrh, or 
 by snuff-taking, these sounds can not be produced, while the swallowed 
 sounds of bo, d, gr usually take their place. If persons thus affected 
 attempt to say "good morning" the result is good bordig. This is not 
 more objectionable, however, than the constant habit of driving the 
 sound through the nose or splitting it between the nasal and mouth 
 passages. This habit prevails so widely in some parts of the United 
 States — the sounds are so common — that they are unnoticed, and 
 persons imitate each other by association without knowing it. To 
 remedy this it is necessary to husband the expenditure of the breath, 
 holding the sound firmly, and forcing it out through the open mouth. 
 This, like other bad habits, requires frequent friendly hints from 
 associates if we would have it effectually eradicated. 
 
 Others again talk on one key without modulation or breath. In- 
 cessant talkers generally choose this manner, and are called tiresome 
 and disagreeable. The painful sympathy of the listener, occasioned 
 by their want of breath wherewith to make pure sounds, is almost 
 intolerable. To be decently smothered would be merciful in com- 
 parison. 
 
 The following example shows the ascent from the conversational 
 te falsetto, and the descent to the conversational voice:

 " The war — that for a space did fail 
 Now trebly thundering swell'd the gale, 
 
 And — Stanley — was the cry. 
 A light on Marmion's visage spread, 
 
 And fired his glazing eye; 
 "With dying hand above his head 
 He shook the fragment of his blade, 
 And shouted, 'Victory! Charge, Chester, charge! 
 On, Stanley, ON ! ' 
 Were the last words of Marmion." 
 
 The grave tones of voice are the antipodes of the orotund and fal- 
 setto, and are used in solemn and impressive styles, which are more 
 difficult to acquire. The transition of the voice from the extreme 
 upper tones of the falsetto to a full low register in many instances is 
 productive of marvelous rhetorical effects, and repays the student for 
 the labor of acquiring such power. 
 
 "The world was void; 
 The populous and the powerful was a lump, 
 Seasonless, — her bless, — treeless, — manless, — lifeless; — 
 A lump — of death ; — a chaos — of hard clay. 
 The rivers, — lakes, — and ocean — all stood still ; 
 And nothing stirr'd — within their silent depths. 
 Ships, sailorless, — lay rotting on the sea, 
 And their masts fell down piecemeal ; as they dropp'd, 
 They slept on the abyss without a surge. 
 The waves were dead ; the tides were in their grave ; — 
 The moon, their mistress, had expired before ; 
 The winds were wither' d in the stagnant air; 
 And the clouds perished. — Darkness had no need 
 Of aid from them; — she — was the universe." 
 
 " But Linden saw another sight, 
 When the drum beat at dead of night, 
 Commanding fires of death to light 
 The darkness of her scenery." 
 
 Example of ascent from the grave tones of voice into the orotund, 
 ending in the falsetto : 
 
 "The combat deepens; — on, ye brave, 
 Who rush to glory, or the grave! 
 Wave, Munich, all thy banners wave! 
 And charge with all thy chivalry !" 
 
 Tremor of voice is produced by a retention of the volume of air in 
 the larynx, with the glottis sufficiently contracted to prevent an even

 escape of sound. The escaping air playing upon the chords of the 
 glottis, and this double vibratory force reaching the sounding-board 
 above, gives a tremulous or wavy sound of the voice, corresponding 
 somewhat to the trembling, buzzing sound produced in making the 
 name-sound of z. But the difference between these is wide; the first 
 being an emotional sound formed in the voice-chamber, the other an 
 articulating sound made by the tongue and teeth. There are many 
 emotions which can not be expressed without this effort. It is used 
 in sorrow, in terror, and in distress of mind. Bestow much practice 
 on the trilled words: 
 
 " Cromwell, — I did not think — to shed a tear 
 In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me, 
 Out of thy honest truth, to play — the woman." 
 
 Queen Katharine said, in commending her daughter to Henry, "And 
 a little to love her, for her mother's sake; who hved him — Heaven 
 knows how dearly!" 
 
 That which gives beauty to all the qualities of the voice is feeling. 
 We must feel what we say. 
 
 u Hark — I hear thy thunder's sound 
 Shake the forum — round — -and round. 
 Shake — the pillars — of the earth ! " 
 
 " Tried — and convicted — traitor ! — Who says this ? 
 1 Banish'd !' — I thank you for it." 
 
 "Unnerved, and now unsettled in his mind, 
 From long and exquisite pain, he sobs and cries, 
 Kissing the old man's cheek, — ' Help me, — my father! 
 Let me, I pray thee, — live once more among ye. 
 Let me — go home.' ' My son,' returns the Doge, 
 
 1 Obey. — Thy country wills it.' " 
 
 Hamlet Oh ! that this too, too solid flesh would melt, 
 Thaw and resolve itself into a dew ; 
 Or that the Everlasting had not fixed 
 His canon 'gainst self-slaughter. O God ! O God ! 
 How weary, stale, flat, and unprofitable 
 Seem to me all the uses of this world ! 
 Fie on 't ! O fie ! 't is an unweeded garden, 
 That goes to seed ; things rank, and gross in nature, 
 Possess it merely. That it should come to this ! 
 But two months dead ! — nay, not so much, not two :

 The following words uttered by Lady Macbeth must be given 
 mostly in a prolonged half whisper, with a liberal use of rhetorical 
 
 pauses : 
 
 Physician. How came she by that light? 
 
 Gent Why, it stood by her; she has light by her continually; 'tis her 
 command. 
 
 Phy. You see, her eyes are open. 
 
 Gent. Ay, — but their sense is shut. 
 
 Phy. What is it she does now ? Look, how she rubs her hands. 
 
 Gent. It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus washing her hands : 
 I have known her continue in this a quarter of an hour. 
 
 Lady M. Yet here 's a spot. 
 
 Phy. Hark! she speaks. 
 
 Lady M. Out, damned spot! — out, I say! One, two; why, then 'tis time 
 to do 't ! Hell — is murky I Fie, — my lord, Jie / a soldier and afeard ? What need 
 we fear who knows it, when none can call our power — to account ? Yet — who 
 would have thought the old ma?i to have had so much blood in him ? 
 
 Phy. Do you mark that? 
 
 Lady M. The Thane of Fife had a wife ; where is she now ? What, — will 
 these hands ne'er be clean ? No more o' that, my lord, — no more o' that; you 
 mar all with this starting. 
 
 Phy. Go to, go to ; you have known what you should not. 
 
 Gent. She has spoken what she should not, I am sure of that : Heaven 
 knows what she has known. 
 
 Lady M. Here's the smell of the blood still: — all the perfumes of Arabia 
 will not sweeten this — little hand. Oh! — oh! — oh! 
 
 Phy. What a sigh is there ! The heart is sorely charged. 
 
 Gent. I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the dignity of the 
 whole body. 
 
 Lady M. Wash your hands, — put on your night-gown ; look not so pale : 
 I tell you yet again, Banquo 's buried; he can not come out of his grave. 
 
 Phy. Even so. 
 
 Lady M. To bed, to bed ; there 's knocking at the gate. Come, — come, — 
 come, — come, give me your hand: what's done — can not be undone. To bed, — 
 to bed, — to bed. 
 
 Phy. Will she go now to bed ? 
 
 Gent. Directly. 
 
 Phy. More needs she the divine than the physician.

 Modulation — Delivery — Examples in Various Styles: Tenderness; 
 Kapid, Light, and Brilliant; Awful; Threatening; Eevenge; 
 Scorn; Disgust and Contempt; Sarcasm; Kemorse and Humilia- 
 tion; Contrition and Doubt; Fear; Love; Sorrow and Grief; 
 Horror and Agony. 
 
 Modulation comprises all the qualities of speech heretofore treated, 
 from the division of accent, and all qualities of voice in shades of 
 inflection and varieties of pitch. To have good modulation requires 
 the mastery of every element in the art, with judgment and taste 
 to direct their use. This gives the music of speech and the melody 
 of oratory. 
 
 The most delicate shades of sound are those made by human 
 speech. It is through the ear that we learn to imitate sound, as 
 through the eye we learn to imitate motions. Let not persons say 
 they can not learn to sing because they have no ear for music — can 
 not detect sound or learn tunes. If such had not possessed a dis- 
 criminating ear, they never could have learned to utter those words 
 in which they say they have not the ability to detect sound. They 
 are denying the sounds they use. 
 
 'T is true we all have ears, and hear not the wonderful sounds that 
 strike the tympanum; but it is because consciousness is not atten- 
 tive — does not listen for them; and of course the mouth can not 
 articulate what is unknown to the ear. The dumb are only so 
 because the ear is dead. Therefore those who have eyes and ears 
 need never limit their attainments. 
 
 Eules. — To be heard distinctly at a distance requires a full expul- 
 sion of the vowel-sounds ; to be understood requires a clear and perfect 
 articulation of the aspirates and subvowels ; to be appreciated the voice 
 must be modulated so as to present each new thought or sentiment on 
 a different pitch from the preceding one.

 Delivery is word-painting ; the speaker sees the subject in his mind 
 distinctly. If it is a picture of a landscape, a battle-scene, a death- 
 scene, it matters not what, it must be first distinctly understood and 
 appreciated by the individual before any attempt should be made to 
 express it. We have words, similes, tropes, analogies — the various 
 tones and movements of voice, which correspond to the pigments of 
 the artist — by which we transfer what we have in our own mind to 
 the minds of others. Therefore let the student get a general outline 
 of the subject of the piece he is about to recite. First comprehend 
 the general situation of affairs, then the various objects in its com- 
 position, their relations to each other and to the main subject, and 
 then, by voice and action, endeavor to make it intelligible to others, 
 exactly as it lies in his own mind. 
 
 Take the following extract, learn it, analyze it, review it, and then 
 recite it : 
 
 [King Henry before the gates of Harfieur ; the governor and citizens above, on the walls 
 of the besieged city. The attitude and action those of one speaking to an audience at some 
 elevation — the voice loud and prolonged, to enable it to be heard at a distance ; together with 
 the imperious tone of command, to express the matter of the speech, the tenor of which is 
 a threat.] 
 
 K. Henry. How yet resolves the governor of the town ? 
 This is the latest parle we will admit : 
 Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves ; 
 Or, like to men proud of destruction, 
 Defy us to our worst: for as I am a soldier — 
 A name that in my thoughts becomes me best — 
 If I begin the battery once again, 
 I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur 
 Till in her ashes she lie buried. 
 The gates of mercy shall be all shut up; 
 And the flesh' d soldier, rough and hard of heart, 
 In liberty of bloody hand shall range 
 "With conscience wide as hell; mowing like grass 
 Tour fresh fair virgins and your flowering infants. 
 "What is it then to me if impious war, 
 Array' d in flames like the prince of fiends, 
 Do, with his smirch' d complexion, all fell feats 
 Enlink'd to waste and desolation? 
 What is 't to me, when you yourselves are cause, 
 If your pure maidens fall into the hand 
 Of hot and forcing violation ? 
 What rein can hold licentious wickedness 
 When down the hill he holds his fierce career? 
 We may as bootless spend our vain command 
 Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil, 
 As send precepts to the Leviathan

 And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls; 
 
 Your naked infants spitted upon pikes, 
 
 Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused 
 
 Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry 
 
 At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.

 "There's another, — not a sister; — in the happy days gone by 
 You 'd have known her — by the merriment that sparkled in her eye; 
 Tell her — the last night of my life (for ere the moon be risen 
 My body will be out of pain, my soul be out of prison) 
 I dreamed I stood with her, and saw the yellow sunlight shine 
 On the vine-clad hills — of Bingen, fair Bingen on the Rhine ! 
 I saw the blue Rhine sweep along, — I heard, or seemed to hear, 
 The German songs we used to sing, in chorus sweet and clear ; 
 And down the pleasant river, and up the slanting hill, 
 The echoing chorus sounded, through the evening calm and still ; 
 And her glad — blue eyes were on me as we passed with friendly talk, 
 Down many a path beloved of yore, and weZ£-remembered walk ; 
 And her little hand lay lightly, — confidingly in mine ; 
 But we'll meet no more at Bingen, loved Bingen on the Rhine! "

 With her lips apart. 
 Softly I She is dying 
 Of a broken heart. 
 Whisper! She is going

 Whisper ! Life is growing 
 
 Dim within her breast. 
 Gently ! She is sleeping ; 
 
 She has breathed her last. 
 Gently I While you are weeping, 
 She to heaven has passed !"

 ALARM AND GRIEF. 
 
 Macduff. Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight 
 With a new Gorgon. Do not bid me speak : 
 See, and then speak yourselves. Awake ! awake ! 
 King the alarum-bell. Murder and treason ! 
 Banquo and Donalbain ! Malcolm ! awake ! 
 Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit, 
 And look on death itself! — up, up, and see 
 The great doom's image ! Malcolm ! Banquo ! 
 As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites 
 To countenance this horror ! Bing the bell. 
 
 Lady Macbeth. What 's the business, 
 That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley 
 The sleepers of the house ? speak, speak ! 
 
 Macd. gentle lady ! 
 
 'T is not for you to hear what I can speak: 
 The repetition, in a woman's ear, 
 Would murder as it fell. — Banquo ! Banquo ! 
 Our royal master's murder' d!

 Polonius. "What do you read, my lord? 
 
 Hamlet. Words, words, — icords. 
 
 Pol. What is the matter, my lord? 
 
 Ham. Between whom ? 
 
 Pol. I mean the matter that you read, my lord. 
 
 Ham. Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here that old men have 
 gray beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purging thick amber and 
 plum-tree gum; and that they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most 
 weak hams: all which, sir, though I most powerfully and potently believe, 
 yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down ; for you yourself, sir, should 
 be old as I am, — if, like a crab, you could go backward.

 REMORSE AND HUMILIATION. L 
 
 King. Oh ! my offense is rank, — it smells to heaven ; 
 It hath the primal eldest curse upon 't, — 
 A brother's murder ! Pray can I not, 
 Though inclination be as sharp as will : 
 My stronger — guilt defeats my strong intent ; 
 And, like a man to double business bound, 
 I stand in pause where I shall first begin, 
 And both neglect. What if this cursed hand 
 Were thicker than itself with brother's — blood, 
 Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens 
 To wash it white — as snow ? Whereto serves mercy 
 But to confront the visage of offense? 
 And what 's in prayer, but this two-fold force, — 
 To be forestalled, ere we come to fall, 
 Or pardon? d, being down? Then, I'll look up: 
 My fault is past. But, oh ! what form of prayer 
 Can serve my turn ? Forgive me my foid — murder I 
 That can not be ; since I am still possess'd 
 Of those effects for which I did the murder, — 
 My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen. 
 May one be pardon' d and retain th' offense ? 
 In the corrupted currents of this world 
 Offense's gilded hand may shove by justice ; 
 And oft 't is seen, the wicked prize itself 
 Buys out the law; but 't is not so — above ; 
 There is no shuffling, — there the action lies 
 
 and we ourselves compell'd,

 Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults, 
 To give in evidence. What then ? what rests ? 
 Try what repentance can : what can it not ? 
 Yet what can it, when one can not repent ? 
 O wretched state ! O bosom, black as death ! 
 
 limed soul, that, struggling — to be free, 
 
 Art more engaged ! Help, — angels ! make assay : 
 Bow, stubborn knees ; and, heart, with strings of steel, 
 Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe! 
 All may be well. 
 
 CONTRITION AND DOUBT. 
 
 Hamlet. Ay, so, God be wi' you ! Now I am alone. 
 Oh, what a rogue and peasant slave am I ! 
 Is it not monstrous that this player here, 
 But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, 
 Could force his soul so to his own conceit, 
 That, from her working, all his visage wann'd ; 
 Tears in his eyes, distraction in his aspect, 
 A broken voice, and his whole function suiting 
 With forms to his conceit ? and all for nothing ! 
 For Hecuba ! 
 
 What 's Hecuba — to him, or he — to Hecuba, 
 That he should weep for her ? What would he do 
 Had he the motive and the cue for passion 
 That I have ? He would drown the stage with tears, 
 And cleave the general ear with horrid speech. 
 Make mad the guilty, and appall the free, 
 Confound the ignorant ; and amaze, indeed, 
 The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I, — 
 A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak, 
 And can say nothing : no, not for a king, 
 Upon whose property, and most dear life, 
 A damn'd defeat was made. — Am I a coward? 
 Who calls me villain ? breaks my pate across ? 
 Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face ? 
 Tweaks me by the nose ? gives me the lie i' the throat 
 As deep as to the lungs ? Who does me this ? Ha ! 
 Why, I should take it ; for it can not be, 
 But I am pigeon-liver' d, and lack gall 
 To make oppression bitter, or ere this 
 
 1 should have fatted all the region kites 
 With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain! 
 Kemorseless, treacherous, cruel, kindless villain ! 
 Oh, vengeance ! 
 
 Why, what an ass am I ! This is most brave, 
 That I, the son of a dear father murdered, 
 Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,

 And fall a cursing, like a very drah, 
 
 A scullion ! 
 
 Fie upon 't ! foh ! About, my brain ! — I have heard 
 
 That guilty creatures, sitting at a play, 
 
 Have by the very cunning of the scene 
 
 Been struck so to the soul, that presently 
 
 They have proclaimed their malefactions ; — 
 
 For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak

 Play something like the murder of my father

 I '11 tent him to the quick : if he but blench,

 Macbeth. Is this a dagger which I see before me, 
 The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee : 
 I have thee not, and yet I see thee still. 
 Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible 
 To feeling — as to sight? or art thou but 
 A dagger of the mind, & false creation, 
 Proceeding from the Tieatf-oppressed brain ? 
 I see thee yet, in form as palpable 
 As that which now I draw. 
 Thou marshal 1 st me the way that I was going; 
 And such an instrument I was to use. 
 Mine eyes are made the fools of the other senses, 
 Or else worth all the rest: I see thee still; 
 And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood, 
 "Which was not so before. There 's no such thing : 
 It is the bloody business which informs 
 Thus to mine eyes. Now, o'er one half the world 
 Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse 
 The curtain'd sleep ; now witchcraft — celebrates 
 Pale Hecate's offerings ; and withered murder, 
 Alarmed by his sentinel, the wolf, 
 "Whose howl 7 s his watch, thus with his stealthy pace,

 "Ah ! mercy on my soul. What is that ? My old friend's ghost? They say 
 none but wicked folks walk ; I wish I were at the bottom of a coal-pit. See ! 
 how long and pale his face has grown since his death : he never was handsome ; 
 and death has improved him very much the wrong way. Pray do not come 
 near me! I wished you very well when you were alive; but I could never 
 abide a dead man, cheek by jowl with me. Ah, ah, mercy on us ! No nearer, 
 pray ; if it be only to take leave of me that you are come back, I could have 
 excused you the ceremony with all my heart ; or if you — mercy on us ! no 
 nearer, pray; — or if you have wronged any body, as you always loved money a 
 little, I give you the word of a frightened Christian, I will pray as long as 
 you please for the deliverance or repose of your departed soul. My good, worthy, 
 noble friend, do, pray disappear, as ever you would wish your old friend to come

 SORROW AND GRIEF. 
 
 " I love it ! I love it ! and who shall dare 
 To chide me for loving that old arm-chair ? 
 I 've treasured it long as a sainted prize, 
 I 've bedewed it with tears and embalmed it with sighs; 
 'T is bound by a thousand bands to my heart, 
 Not a tie will break, not a link will start ; 
 Would you know the spell ? a mother sat there ! 
 And a sacred thing is that old arm-chair. 
 
 In childhood's hour I lingered near 
 
 That hallowed seat with a listening ear 
 
 To the gentle words that mother would give 
 
 To fit me to die and teach me to live ; 
 
 She told me shame would never betide 
 
 With truth for my creed and God for my guide ; 
 
 She taught me to lisp my earliest prayer 
 
 As I knelt beside that old arm-chair. 
 
 I sat and watched her many a day 
 
 When her eye grew dim and her locks were gray, 
 
 And I almost worshiped her when she smiled 
 
 And turned from her Bible to bless her child : 
 
 Years rolled on, but the last one sped, 
 
 My idol was shattered, my earth-star fled ! 
 
 I felt how much the heart can bear

 " Three years ago to-day 
 
 "We raised our hands to heaven, 
 And on the rolls of muster 
 
 Our names were thirty-seven ; 
 There were just a thousand bayonets, 
 
 And the swords were thirty-seven, 
 As we took the oath of service 
 
 With our right hands raised to heaven. 
 
 Oh ! 't was a gallant day, 
 
 In memory still adored, 
 That day of our sun-bright nuptials 
 
 "With the musket and the sword ! 
 Shrill rang the fifes, the bugles blared, 
 
 And beneath a cloudless heaven 
 Twinkled a thousand bayonets, 
 
 And the swords were thirty-seven. 
 
 Of the thousand stalwart bayonets 
 
 Two hundred march to-day ; 
 Hundreds lie in Virginia swamps, 
 
 And hundreds in Maryland clay ; 
 And other hundreds, less happy, drag 
 
 Their shattered limbs around, 
 And envy the deep, long, blessed sleep 
 
 Of the battle-field's holy ground. 
 
 For the swords — one night, a week ago, 
 
 The remnant, just eleven, 
 Gathered around a banqueting-board 
 
 "With seats for thirty-seven ; 
 There were two limped in on crutches, 
 
 And two had each but a hand 
 To pour the wine and raise the cup, 
 
 As we toasted ' Our flag and land!' 
 
 And the room seemed filled with whispers 
 
 As we looked at the vacant seats, 
 And, with choking throats, we pushed aside 
 
 The rich but untasted meats :

 BELIAL'S SPEECH AGAINST THE WAR WITH HEAVEN. Milton. 
 
 I should be much for open war, O peers ! 
 As not behind in hate, if what was urged, 
 (Main reason to persuade immediate war,) 
 Did not dissuade me most, and seem to cast 
 Ominous conjecture on the whole success: 
 WTien he, (who most excels in fact of arms, 
 In what he counsels and in what excels 
 Mistrustful,) grounds his courage on despair. — 
 And utter dissolution, as the scope 
 Of all his aim, — after some dire — revenge. 
 First, what — revenge ? The towers of Heaven are filled 
 With armed watch, that render all — access — 
 Impregnable : oft on the bordering deep 
 Encamp — their legions, or with obscure wing 
 Scout far and wide into the realm of night, 
 Scorning surprise ! Or could we break our way 
 By force, and at our heels all hell should rise 
 With blackest insurrection, to confound 
 Heaven's purest light; yet our great Enemy,- — 
 All incorruptible, would on his throne

 SHIP ON FIRE. 
 
 The storm o'er the ocean flew furious and fast, 
 
 And the waves rose in foam at the voice of the blast, 
 
 And heavily labor'd the gale-beaten ship, 
 
 Like a stout-hearted swimmer — the spray at his lip ; 
 
 And dark was the sky o'er the mariner's path, 
 
 Except when the lightning illumed it in wrath. 
 
 A young mother knelt in the cabin below, 
 
 And pressing her babe to her bosom of snow, 
 
 She prayed to her God 'mid the hurricane wild, 
 
 " Father ! have mercy, look down on my child." 
 
 It pass'd—- the fierce whirlwind careered on its way, 
 
 And the ship, like an arrow, divided the spray; 
 
 Her sails glimmer'd white in the beams of the moon, 
 
 And the breeze up aloft seem'd to whistle, to whistle a tune; 
 
 And the wind up aloft seem'd to whistle, to whistle a tune. 
 
 There was joy in the ship as she furrowed the foam, 
 
 For fond hearts within her were dreaming of home; 
 
 The young mother press'd her fond babe to her breast, 
 
 And sang a sweet song as she rocked it to rest ; 
 
 And the husband sat cheerily down by her side, 
 
 And looked with delight on the face of his bride. 
 
 " Oh, happy," said he, " when our roaming is o'er, 
 
 "We '11 dwell in our cottage that stands by the shore ; 
 
 Already in fancy its roof I descry, 
 
 And the smoke of its hearth curling up to the sky 
 
 Its garden so green and vine-covered wall, 
 
 The kind friends awaiting to welcome us all, 
 
 And the children that sport by the old oaken tree." 
 
 Ah, gently the ship glided over the sea. 
 Hark ! what was that ? Hark x hark to the shout ! — 
 Fire ! then a tramp and a rout, 
 And an uproar of voices arose in the air ; 
 And the mother knelt down, and the half-spoken prayer 
 That she offered to God in her agony wild 
 
 Was, "Father, have mercy, look down, look down on my child!" 
 She flew to her husband, she clung to his side, 
 Oh ! there was her refuge whate'er might betide. 
 
 Fire ! fire ! it was raging above and below ; 
 And the cheeks of the sailors grew pale at the sight, 
 And their eyes glistened wild in the glare of the light. 
 'T was vain o'er the ravage the waters to drip, 
 The pitiless flame was the lord of the ship ; 
 And the smoke in thick wreaths mounted higher and higher — 
 O God ! it is fearful to perish by fire. 
 Alone with destruction, alone on the sea, 
 Great Father of mercy, our hope is in thee !

 Sad at heart and resigned, yet undaunted and brave, 
 
 They lowered the boat, a mere speck on the wave ; 
 
 First entered the mother, enfolding her child, 
 
 It knew she caressed it, look'd upward and smiled. 
 
 Cold, cold was the night as they drifted away, 
 
 And mistily dawned o'er the pathway the day ; 
 
 And they prayed for the light, and at noontide about 
 
 The sun o'er the waters shone joyously out. 
 
 "Ho ! a sail ! Ho ! a sail ! " cried the man on the lee; 
 
 "Ho! a sail! " and they turned their glad eyes o'er the sea.

 When King Victor — has Italy's crown — on his head,

 What then ? Do not mock me. (Ah, — ring your bells — low, 
 And burn your lights— faintly.) My country — is there, 
 
 Above the star — pricked — by the last peak of snow. 
 My Italy 's — there ! with my brave — civic Pah', 
 To disfranchise — despair ! 
 
 Forgive me. Some women — bear children — in strength, 
 And bite back — the cry — of their pain — in self -scorn ; 
 
 But — the birth-pangs — of nations — will wring us (at length) — 
 Into wail — such as this ! — and we sit on — (forlorn) —

 THE RUM MANIAC. Allison. 
 
 Say, — (Doctor,) may I not have rum 
 
 To quench — this burning thirst — within? 
 Here, — on this cursed bed I lie, 
 
 And can not get one drop of gin. 
 I ask not health, — nor even life: — 
 
 Life! what a curse — it's been to me! 
 I 'd rather sink — in deepest hell 
 
 Than drink — again — its misery. 
 
 But, (Doctor,) may I not have rum? 
 
 One drop — alone is all I crave: 
 Grant — this small boon ; — I ask no more. 
 
 Then — I '11 defy — even the grave: 
 Then, (without fear,) I'll fold my arms, 
 
 And bid the monster — strike his dart 
 To haste me — from this world of v?oe, 
 
 And claim his own, — this ruin'd heart/ 
 
 A thousand curses — on his head 
 
 Who gave me first — the poison' d bowl, — 
 Who taught me first — this bane — to drink ; — 
 
 Drink — death — and ruin — to my soul. 
 My soul ! Oh ! cruel, — horrid thought ! 
 
 Full well — I know — thy certain fate; 
 With what instinctive horror— shrinks 
 
 The spirit — from that awful state !

 M y fate — is sealed; my doom is .

 But, (Doctor,) don't you see him — there? 
 
 In that dark corner — low he sits ; 
 See! how he sports — his fiery tongue, — 
 
 And at me — burning brimstone spits !

 Look! there — he peeps through yonder crack! 
 Mark — how his burning eyeballs flash! 
 
 How fierce he grins! what — brought him back? 
 There, — stands his burning coach of fire ! 
 
 He smiles, — and beckons me — to come! 
 What are those words — he's written there? 
 
 "In hell we never want — for rum! 11 
 
 One loud — one piercing shriek — was heard; 
 
 One yell — rang out — upon the air ; 
 One sound, and one — alone — came forth, — 
 
 The victim's cry — of wild despair. 
 Why longer wait? I'm ripe for hell! 
 
 A spirit 's sent — to bear me doion; 
 There, — in the regions — of the lost, 
 
 I sure — will wear — a fiery crown! 
 Damrid — (I know,) without a hope! 
 
 One moment — more — and then — I'll comet 
 And there — I '11 quench — my awful thirst — 
 
 With boiling ! burning ! fiery rum ! 
 
 SOLILOQUY OF THE DYING ALCHEMIST. N. P. Willis. 
 
 The night wind — (with a desolate moan) — swept by; 
 And the old shutters — of the- turret swung 
 Creaking — upon their hinges ; and the moon, 
 (As the torn edges of the clouds flew past,) 
 Struggled aslant — the stained and broken panes 
 So dimly, that the watchful eye of death 
 Scarcely was conscious — when it went — and came.

 The fire — beneath his crucible — was low : 
 Yet still — it burned ; and ever, (as his thoughts 
 Grew insupportable,) he raised himself — 
 Upon his wasted arm and stirred the coals — 
 "With occult energy, and when the rod 
 Fell from his nerveless fingers, and his eye — 
 Felt— -faint — within its socket, he shrunk back 
 Upon his pallet, and — (with unclosed lips) 
 Muttered a curse — on death! 
 
 The silent room, 
 (From its dim corners) mockingly gave back 
 His rattling breath; the humming — in the fire — 
 Had the distinctness — of a knell; and when — 
 Duly — the antique horologe — beat one 
 He drew a vial — (from beneath his head) 
 And drank. And instantly — his lips compressed, 
 And (with a shudder — in his skeleton frame) 
 He rose — with supernatural strength, and sat 
 Upright, — and communed — with himself: — 
 
 I did not think to die — 
 Till I had finished — what I had to do; 
 I thought — to pierce th' eternal secret through — 
 
 "With this — my mortal eye; 
 Ifelt — God! it seemeth — even now 
 This can not be the death-dew — on my brow! 
 
 And yet — it is ; I feel 
 (Of this dull sickness — at my heart) afraid; 
 And in my eyes — the deaM-sparks— -flash — and fade; 
 
 And somethiyig — seems to steal 
 Over my bosom — like a frozen hand, — 
 Binding its pulses — with an icy band. 
 
 And this — is death ! But why — 
 Feel I this recoil ? It can not be 
 The immortal spirit — shuddereth — to he free! 
 
 Would it not leap — to fly 
 Like a chain' d eaglet — at its parent's call? 
 I fear, — I fear — that this poor life — is all! 
 
 Yet thus — to pass away ! — 
 To live — but for a hope — that mocks — at last, — 
 To agonize, — to strive, — to watch, — to fast, 
 
 To waste — the light of day, 
 Night's better beauty,— feeling,— fancy, — thought, 
 All — that we have — and are,- — for this, — for naught! 
 
 Grant me another year, 
 God of my spirit ! — but a day, — to win 
 Something — to satisfy this thirst — within ! 
 
 I would know something — here! 
 Break for me — but one seal — that is unbroken / 
 Speak for me — but one word — that is unspoken!

 Critical attention must be observed in articulating the words. 
 After we have thoroughly conquered our indistinctness of articu- 
 lation, we must acquire the facility of rapid and clearly enunciated 
 utterances. There are many passages that require a spirited, brilliant, 
 and rapid rendering, else their intention is not expressed.

 Iii the last stanza the voice falls from the loud and rapid move- 
 ments of excitement to the slow and conversational pitch. In the 
 two last lines it descends to the very slow and grave tones, while on 
 the word "spirits" it falls to a whisper, and the word "flaps" is ren- 
 dered in a tremulous half-whisper. A full rhetorical pause is necessary 
 before both of these words to give them proper effect. 
 
 " NO." By Eliza Cook. 
 
 Would you learn — the bravest thing — 
 
 That man — can ever do ? 
 Would you be an uncrown' d king, 
 
 Absolute — and true? 
 Would you seek to emulate 
 
 All we learn in story 
 Of the moral, — -just, — and great, 
 
 Rich — in real glory ? 
 Would you lose much bitter care 
 
 In your lot below ? 
 Bravely speak out — when — and where — 
 
 'T is right to utter— "No." 
 
 Learn to speak this little word — 
 
 In its proper place ; — 
 Let no timid doubt be heard, 
 
 Clothed with skeptic grace ; 
 Let thy lips — without disguise — 
 
 Boldly pour it out, 
 Though a thousand — dulcet lies 
 
 Keep hovering about. 
 For be sure — our hearts — would lose 
 
 Future years — of woe 
 If our courage — could refuse — 
 
 The present hour — with — "No." 
 
 When temptation's form — would lead 
 
 To some pleasant wrong ; — 
 When she tunes her hollow reed — 
 
 To the syren's song ; — 
 When she offers bribe — and smile, ' 
 
 And our conscience feels 
 There is naught — but shining guile 
 
 In the gifts she deals ; 
 Then, oh! then let courage rise 
 • To its strongest flow ; 
 
 Show — that ye are brave — as wise, 
 
 And firmly answer — "No."

 THE RED HUNTERS, OR PRAIRIE ON FIRE. M. V. Fuller. 
 Out of the woods — at midnight 
 
 The swift — red hunters — came ; 
 The prairie — was their hunting-groxmci, 
 
 The bison — was their game : 
 Their spears — were of glist'ning silver, 
 
 Their crests — were of blue and gold ; 
 Driven — by the panting winds of heav'n, — 
 
 Their shining chariots — rolled.— 
 Over that level hwiting-groxmd, 
 
 Oh, what a strife — was there ! 
 What a shouting ! — what a threat ning cry ! — 
 
 What a murmur — on the air ! 
 Their garments — over the glowing wheels 
 
 Streamed — backward, — red and fair ; 
 They flaunted — their purple banners 
 
 In the face — of each pale star. 
 Under their tread — the autumn flowers 
 
 By myriads — withering lay : 
 (Poor things ! — th't from those golden wheels 
 
 Could nowhere — shrink away !) 
 Close, — and crashing together, 
 
 The envious chariots — rolled ; — 
 While anon, before his fellows, — 
 
 Leaped out — some hunter bold. 
 Their — hot breath, — thick and lowering, 
 
 Above — their wild eyes — hung, 
 And around — their frowning foreheads, 
 
 Like wreaths of night-shade, hung. 
 u The bisons ! ho, the bisons ! " 
 
 They cried — and answered back — 
 (Poor herds of frightened creatures 
 
 With such hunters — on their track !) 
 
 With a weary, — lumbering swiftness 
 
 They sought — the river's side, — 
 Driven — by those hunters — from their sleep 
 
 Into its chilling tide. 
 Some face — their foe — with anguish, 
 
 Dilating — their brute eyes ; — 
 The spears of silver strike them low, — 
 
 And dead — each suppliant lies. 
 
 Now by the brightening river — 
 
 The red hunters — stand — at bay; 
 Vain — their appalling splendor — 
 
 The river shields their prey ! 
 Into the waves with baffled rage 
 
 They leap — in death 1 s despite ; — 
 Their golden wheels roll — roaring in, 
 
 And leave the withered night.

 The ecJw is a re-percussion or reflected sound, and is sometimes 
 repeated several times, always growing fainter in each reverber- 
 ation. 
 
 When giving imitations of this in recitations, it is simply neces- 
 sary, after speaking the word to be echoed, to pause long enough 
 for the supposed sound to return from a distance; then utter it 
 in a softer tone of voice, making it softer and less distinct in each 
 repetition. 
 
 " ' Gitche Man'ito, the mighty ! '

 In that hitter hour of anguish,

 For my dying Minnehaha!' 
 Through the far-resounding forest, 
 Through the forest vast and vacant 
 Bang that cry of desolation ; 
 But there came no other answer

 THE LONG EXPECTED : TRUE LOVE NEVER LOST. Masset. 
 
 Oh! many and many a day — before we met 
 
 I knew — some spirit — walked the world alone, 
 
 Awaiting the Beloved — from afar ; 
 
 And I — was the anointed — chosen one 
 
 Of all the world — to crown — her queenly brows — 
 
 With the imperial crown — of human love, — 
 
 And light its glory — in her happy eyes. 
 
 I saw not — (with mine eyes — so full of tears,) 
 
 But heard — Faith's low — sweet si7iging — in the night, 
 
 And, — (groping — through the dark?iess,) touched — G-od's liand. 
 
 I knew — my sunshine — someivhere — warmed the world, 
 
 Though i— trode — darkling — in a perilous way; 
 
 And I should reach it — in His own — good time, 
 
 Who sendeth sun, — and dew, — and love — for all : 
 
 My heart — might toil on — blindly, but, — (like earth,) — 
 
 It kept sure footing — through the thickest gloom. 
 
 Earth, — (with her thousand voices,) talked of thee; — 
 
 Sweet winds, — and whispering leaves, and piping birds; 
 
 The trickling sim-light and the flashing dews; 
 
 Eve's crimson air — and light of twinkling gold ; 
 
 Sp>ring's kindled greenery, and her breath of balm; 
 
 The happy hum — and stir — of summer woods, 
 
 And the light dropping — of the silver rain. 
 
 Thine eyes — oped with their rainy lights — and laughters, 
 
 In April's tearful heaven — of tender blue, 
 
 With all the changeful beauty — melting through them, 
 
 And dawn — and sunset — ended — in thy face. 
 
 And standing, — as in God's own joreserace-chamber, 
 
 When silence — lay like sleep — upon the world, 
 
 And it seemed rich — to die — alone — with night, 
 
 Like Moses — 'neath the kisses — of God's lips, 
 
 The stars — have trembled — thro' the holy hush, 
 
 And smiled down tenderly, — and said to me — 
 
 The love — hid for me — in a budding breast, 
 
 Like incense — folded in a young jlo wer's heart. 
 
 Strong — as a sea-swell — came the wave of wings, — 
 
 Strange trouble — trembled thro' my inner depths,

 And answering wings — have sprung within my soul ; 
 
 And — from the dumb, — waste places — of the dark 
 
 A voice has breathed — " She comes ! " and ebVd again ; 
 
 "While all my life — stood listening — for thy coming. 
 
 Oh ! I have guessed — thy presence, out of sight, 
 
 And felt it — in the beating — of my heart ! 
 
 When all — was dark — within — sweet thoughts would come, 
 
 As starry guests — come — golden — down the gloom, — 
 
 And thro' night's lattice — smile a rare delight; 
 
 While, (lifted — for the dear — and distant dawn,) 
 
 The face of all things — wore a happy light, — 
 
 Like those dream-smiles — which are the speech of sleep. 
 
 Thus — love — lived on, — and strengthen d — with the days, — 
 
 Lit — by its own true light — within my heart, 
 
 Like a live diamond — burning — in the dark. 
 
 Then — came there One, — a mirage — of the dawn. 
 
 She swam on toward me — in her sumptuous triumph, 
 
 Voluptuously upborne, — (like Aphrodite,) — 
 
 Upon a meadowy swell — of emerald sea. 
 
 A ripe, — serene — smile, — affluent graciousness, — 
 
 Hung, — (like a shifting radiance,) — on her motion, — 
 
 As bickering hues — upon the dove's neck — burn. 
 
 Her lip — might flush a wrinkled life — in bloom ! 
 
 Her eyes — were an omnipotence — of love ! 
 
 "Oh, yes!" — (I said,) "if such — your glories be, 
 
 Sure — 't is a warm heart — -feedeth ye — with light."

 Hurries its startled being — into song; 
 
 And, (from her sumptuous wealth — of golden hair — 
 
 Unto the delicate — pearly finger-tvp,) 
 
 Fresh beauty — trembled from its thousand springs: 
 
 And, — (standing in the outer porch of life,) 
 
 All eager — for the tempted mysteries, 
 
 With a rich heart — as full of fragrant love — 
 
 As May's musk-roses are — of morning's wine, 
 
 What marvel — if I questioned not her brow, 
 
 For they?ame-signet — of the hand divine, 
 
 Or gauged it — for the crown — of my large love ? 
 
 I plunged — to clutch the pearl — of her babbling beauty, 
 
 Like some swift diver — in a shallow stream, 
 
 That smites his life out — on its heart of stone. 
 
 Ah! how my life did run — with. fire — and tears!

 Was cold — at heart — as snow — in last year's nest, —

 My (ears — (th't rained out life) she froze — in falling,

 Where no green leaf — drinks up precious life; 
 
 Yet love doth — {evermore) — enrich itself; — 
 
 It? bitterest waters — run some — golden sands! 
 
 No star — goes down — but climbs — in other skies;

 All thoughts, — all passions, — all delights, 
 Whatever — stirs — this mortal frame, 
 
 All are — but ministers — of Love, 
 And feed — his sacred flame. 
 
 Oft — in my waking dreams — do I 
 Live o'er again — that happy hour, 
 
 "When — (midway) on the mount I lay 
 Beside the ruin'd tower. 
 
 The moonshine — (stealing o'er the scene) 
 Had blended — with the lights of eve; 
 
 And she — was there, (my hope, — my joy!) 
 My own — dear Genevieve ! 
 
 She leaned — against the armed man, 
 The statue — of the armed knight ; 
 
 She stood — and listen' d — to my lay 
 Amid the lingering light. 
 
 Few sorrows — hath she of her own, 
 My hope! my joy! my Genevieve! 
 
 She loves me best — whene'er I sing 
 The songs — th't make her grieve. 
 
 I played a soft — and doleful air, 
 I sang an old — and moving story, — 
 
 An old — rude song, th't suited well 
 That ruin — wild — and hoary. 
 
 She listened — with a flitting blush, 
 
 With downcast eyes — and modest grace; 
 
 For well she knew — I could not choose 
 But gaze — upon her face.

 ADDRESS TO THE OCEAN. Byeon. 
 
 Oh ! that the desert — were my dwelling-ipil&ce, 
 
 With one fair spirit — for my minister, 
 That I might all forget — the human race, 
 
 And, hating no one, love but only her ! 
 Te elements! — (in whose ennobling stir 
 
 I feel myself exalted) — Can ye not 
 Accord me such a being ? Do I err 
 
 In deeming such — inhabit many a spot ? 
 Though with them to converse — can rarely — be our lot. 
 
 There is a pleasure — in the pathless woods; 
 
 There is a rapture — on the lonely shore ; 
 There is . . society, where none intrudes, 
 
 By the deep sea, and music in its roar : 
 I love not man — the less, but nature — more, 
 
 From these our interviews, in which I steal 
 From all I may be, or have been — before, 
 
 To mingle — with the universe, — and feel — 
 What I can ne'er express, yet can not all — conceal. 
 
 Boll on, thou deep — and dark blue ocean, — roll ! 
 
 Ten thousand fleets — sweep — over thee in vain ; j 
 Man — marks the earth — with ruin ; — his control 
 
 Stops — with the shore ; — upon the watery plain — 
 The wrecks are all thy deed, — nor doth — remain 
 
 A shadow — of man's ravage, — save his own, 
 When (for a moment,) like a drop of rain, 
 
 He sinks — into thy depths — with bubbling groan, 
 Without a grave, — unknelled, — uncojflned, — and unknown.

 Borne, like thy bubbles, — onward: from a boy — 
 
 I wantoned with thy breakers : they — to me — 
 "Were a delight; and if the freshening sea 
 
 Made them a terror, — 't was & pleasing fear,

 My task — is done; my song hath ceased; — my theme

 THE OCEAN. Fanny Green. 
 
 With the boundless sea around, — and the boundless sky above, I have been 
 for days, as it were, swallowed up in the grandeur of the scene. You remem- 
 ber, my brother, when we stood together in the midst of the Great Desert, and 
 the deep repose of a starry night was folded round us as a garment. Silence 
 stretched out her great wings, brooding over all things, and Fear shrunk 
 trembling into the deepest shadows. The crouching lion was hushed in his 
 lair, and stirred not even when the grim shadow of the silent-footed camels 
 fell across his track; and the silly ostrich hid her head in the sand and nestled 
 silently, as if she too felt the great Power that lives in Nature. 
 
 We stood together, grasping each other by the hand, — silent before the 
 Majesty which had clothed itself in vastness, and reigned alone. Oppressed 
 with a strange awe, we could only whisper, " How great is Allah!" Then we 
 started at the sound of our own voices, which were drunk up in a moment ; 
 for the stillness itself — was the prqfoundest voice of God. 
 
 A night view of the sea is akin to that; but in some respects quite different. 
 The desert lies stretched out in its immensity, boundless in extent, and terrible 
 in stillness ; but wholly void of life. The great creation seems to have dropped 
 still-born from the hands of Allah; and, thenceforth become dead, it lies as it 
 was first laid, with the sorrowful and silent stars looking in its wan face; 
 though the Ages have embalmed it, and like the Dead of Egypt it has been 
 brought to the Banquet of Life. 
 
 But the sea is full of motion, of physical character and life in their grandest 
 forms. It is in itself a great motive power, and only weaker than the Strong- 
 est. As I look afar over the broad, heaving bosom of the ocean, I am filled 
 with a variety of strange and new sensations. I feel a deep longing after the 
 Beautiful and the True. I stretch out my arms to embrace the Greatness. I 
 aspire toward all the Possible. 
 
 THE ALPS. Willis Gaylord Clark. 
 
 Proud monuments — of God! sublime ye stand 
 
 Among the wonders — of his mighty hand: 
 
 With summits — soaring in the upper sky, 
 
 Where the broad day looks down — with burning eye; 
 
 Where gorgeous clouds — in solemn pomp repose, 
 
 Flinging rich shadows — on eternal snows : 
 
 Piles — of triumphant dust, ye stand alone, 
 
 And hold, (in kingly state,) & peerless throne!

 Like olden conquerors, on high ye rear 
 The regal ensign, and the glittering spear : 
 Round icy spires — the 7iii$ts, (in wreaths unrolled,) 
 Float ever near, in purple — or in gold; 
 And voiceful torrents, sternly rolling there, 
 Fill (with wild music) the unpillared air: 
 "What garden, or what hall — on earth beneath, 
 Thrills to such tones as o'er the mountains breathe? 
 
 There, (through long ages past,) those summits shone 
 "When morning radiance — on their state was thrown; 
 There, (when the summer day's career was done,) 
 Played the last glory — of the sinking sun ; 
 There, (sprinkled luster — o'er the cataract's shade,) 
 The chastened moon — her glittering rainhow made; 
 And, — (blent with pictured stars,) her luster lay 
 Where — (to still vales) the free streams leaped away. 
 
 Where — are the thronging hosts — of other days, 
 "Whose banners — floated o'er the Alpine ways; 
 "Who, (through their high defiles,) to battle — wound, 
 "While deadly ordnance — stirred the heights around ? 
 Gone, like the dream — that melts at early morn, 
 When the lark's anthem — through the sky is borne: 
 Gone, like the wrecks — that sink in ocean's spray, 
 And chill Oblivion — murmurs : Where are they? 
 Yet "Alps — on Alps" still rise ; the lofty home 
 Of storms — and eagles, where their pinions roam ; 
 Still — round their peaks — the magic colors lie, 
 (Of morn — and eve,) imprinted — on the sky; 
 And still, while kings — and thrones — shall fade — and. fall, 
 And empty crowns — lie dim — upon the pall; 
 Still — shall their glaciers flash ; their torrents roar, 
 Till kingdoms fail, and nations — rise no more. 
 
 THE CELESTIAL ARMY. T. Buchanan Read. 
 
 I stood by the open casement, 
 
 And looked upon the night, 
 And saw the westward-going stars 
 
 Pass slowly out of sight. 
 
 Slowly the bright procession 
 
 Went down the gleaming arch, 
 And my soul discerned the music 
 
 Of their long triumphant march. 
 
 Till the great celestial army, 
 
 Stretching far beyond the poles, 
 Became the eternal symbol 
 
 Of the mighty march of souls.

 Onward! forever onward, 
 
 Red Mars led down his clan, 
 And the moon, like a mailed maiden, 
 
 Was riding in the van. 
 
 And some were bright in beauty, 
 
 And some were faint and small; 
 But these might be in their great height 
 
 The noblest of them all. 
 
 Downward ! forever downward, 
 
 Behind earth's dusky shore, 
 They passed into the unknown night — 
 
 They passed, and were no more. 
 
 No more ! Oh, say not so ! 
 
 And downward is not just ; 
 For the sight is weak and the sense is dim 
 
 That looks through the heated dust. 
 
 The stars and the mailed moon, 
 
 Though they seem to fall and die, 
 Still sweep with their embattled lines 
 
 An endless reach of sky. 
 
 And though the hills of death 
 
 May hide the bright array, 
 The marshaled brotherhood of souls 
 
 Still keeps its upward way. 
 
 Upward ! forever upward ! 
 
 I see their march sublime, 
 And hear the glorious music 
 
 Of the conquerors of time. 
 
 And long let me remember, 
 
 That the palest fainting one 
 May unto divine wisdom be 
 
 A bright and blazing sun.

 Nor stnii thy steadfast step; — but on, — still oh, 
 
 While systems — change and su?is — retire, and worlds — 
 
 Slumber — and wake, thy ceaseless march proceeds. 
 
 The near horizon tempts to rest in vain ; 
 
 Thou, faithful sentinel, dost never quit

 Who thus had cast another sparkling gem, 
 Little but beautiful, amid the crowd

 As thou art now, — so wast thou then the same. 
 Ages have roll'd their course, and time grows gray;

 Exhaustless flood ! — forever spent ! renewed

 This distant planet. Messengers still come, 
 Laden with your far fire, and we may seem 
 To see your lights still burning, while their blaze 
 But — hides the black wreck of extinguish d — realms. 
 Where anarchy — and darkness long have reign'd. 
 Yet what is this which to the astonish' d mind 
 Seems measureless, and which the baffled thought 
 Confounds ? A span, a point in those dominions 
 Which the keen eye can traverse. Seven stars 
 Dwell in that brilliant cluster ; and the sight 
 Embraces all at once ; yet each from each 
 Recedes as far as each of them from earth, — 
 And every star from ev'ry other burns 
 No less remote. 
 
 From the profound of heaven, 
 Untravel'd e'en in thought, — keen-piercing rays 
 Dart through the void, revealing to the sense 
 Systems — and — worlds — unnumbered. Take the glass, 
 And search the skies. The opening heavens pour down 
 Upon your gaze — thick showers of sparkling fire; — 
 Stars crowded, — thronged, in regions so remote 
 That their swift beams — the swiftest things that be — 
 Have traveled centuries on their flight to earth. 
 Earth, sun, and nearer constellations, what 
 Are ye amid this infinite expanse 
 And multitude of God's most infinite works? 
 
 And these are Suns ! — vast central, — living — fires,- — 
 
 Lords of dependent systems, — kings of worlds — 
 
 That wait as satellites upon their power, 
 
 And flourish in their smile. Awake, my soul, 
 
 And meditate and — wonder ! Countless suns 
 
 Blaze round thee, leading forth their countless worlds ! 
 
 Worlds — in whose boso?ns — living things rejoice, 
 
 And drink the bliss of being from the fount 
 
 Of all-pervading love. 
 
 What mind can know, 
 What tongue can utter all their multitudes? 
 Thus numberless in numberless abodes ! 
 Known but to the blessed Father! Thine — they are 
 Thy children — and thy care; and none — o'erlooked 
 Of thee! — no, not the humblest soul that dwells 
 Upon the humblest globe — which wheels its course 
 Amid the giant glories of the sky, 
 Like the mean mote that dances in the beams, 
 Amongst the mirror 'd lamps — which fling 
 Their wasteful splendor from the palace wall. 
 None can escape the kindness of thy care : 
 All compass'd underneath thy spacious wing, 
 Each fed and guided by thy powerful hand.

 Tell mo, ye splendid orbs, — as from your throne 
 
 Ye mark the rolling provinces that own 
 
 Your sway, what beings fill those bright abodes ? 
 
 Do they bear 
 The stamp of human — nature, or has God 
 Peopled those purer realms — with lovelier forms 
 And more celestial — minds? Does innocence 
 Still wear her native and untainted bloom; 
 Or has sin breathed his deadly blight abroad 
 And sown corruption in those fairy bowers? 
 Or are they yet all Paradise, — unf alien 
 And uncorrupt, — existence one long joy, 
 Without disease upon the frame, or sin 
 Upon the heart, — or weariness of life ? 
 Hope never quenched, — and age — unknown, 
 And — death — unfear'd; — while fresh and fadeless youth 
 Glows in the light from God's near throne of love? 
 Open your lips, ye wonderful and fair! 
 Speak ! speak ! the mysteries of those living worlds 
 Unfold! No language? Everlasting light 
 And everlasting silence ? Yet the eye 
 May read and understand. The hand of God 
 Has written legibly what man may know — 
 The glory of his Maker. There it shines, 
 Ineffable, unchangeable; and man, 
 Bound to the surface of this pigmy globe, 
 May know, and ask no more. 
 
 In other days, 
 "When death — shall give the encumbered spirit wings, 
 Its range shall be extended ; it shall roam 
 Perchance amongst those vast mysterious spheres ; — 
 Shall pass from orb to orb, — and dwell in each, 
 Familiar with its children. 
 
 Eternity 
 Shall thus roll on with ever fresh delight, — 
 No pause of pleasure or improvement; 
 
 While the soul, — 
 Advancing even to the source of light 
 And all perfection, — lives, adores, and reigns 
 In cloudless knowledge, purity, and bliss. 
 
 PARADISE AND THE PERI. Moore. 
 
 One morn — a Peri at the gate 
 Of Eden stood, — disconsolate; 
 And as she listened to the Springs 
 
 Of Life within, — like music flowing, — 
 And caught the light upon her wings 
 
 Through the half-open portal glowing, 
 She wept to think her recreant race 
 Should e'er have lost that glorious place!

 And the stars themselves have flowers for me, 
 
 One blosson of Heaven outblooms them all. 
 
 "Though sunny the lake of cool Cashmere, 
 With its plane-tree Isle reflected clear, 
 
 And sweetly the founts of that valley fall; 
 Though bright are the waters of Sing-su-hay, 
 And the golden floods that thitherward stray ; 
 Yet, — oh ! 't is only the blest can say 
 
 How the waters of Heaven outshine them all ! 
 
 "Go, — wing your flight from star to star, 
 From world to luminous world, as far 
 
 As the universe spreads its flaming wall : 
 Take all the pleasures of all the spheres, 
 And multiply each through endless years, 
 
 One minute of Heaven is worth them all ! " 
 
 The glorious Angel, who was keeping 
 The gates of Light, beheld her weeping; 
 And, as he nearer drew and listen' d 
 To her sad song, a tear-drop glisten'd 
 "Within his eyelids, like the spray 
 
 From Eden's fountain, when it lies 
 On the blue flow'r, which — Brahmins say — 
 
 Blooms nowhere but in Paradise. 
 
 " Nymph of a fair — but erring line ! " 
 Gently he said — " One hope is thine. 
 'T is written in the book of fate, 
 
 That Peri yet may be forgiven 
 Who brings to this eternal gate 
 
 The gift that is most dear to Heaven I 
 Go, — seek it, — and redeem thy sin — 
 'T is sweet to let the Pardorfd in." 
 
 Bapidly as comets run 
 
 To the embrace of the Sun ; — 
 
 Fleeter than the starry brands 
 
 Flung at night from angel hands, 
 
 At those dark and daring sprites 
 
 Who would climb th' empyrical heights, 
 
 Down the blue vault the Peri flies, 
 And, lighted earthward by a glance 
 
 That just then broke from Morning's eyes, 
 Hung hov'ring o'er the world's expanse.

 But whither shall the Spirit go 
 
 To find this gift from Heaven ? "I know 
 
 The wealth," she cries, " of every urn, 
 
 In which unnumbered rubies burn, 
 
 Beneath the pillars of Chilminar : 
 
 I know where the Isles of Perfume are, 
 
 Many a fathom down in the sea, 
 
 To the south of sun-bright Araby ; 
 
 I know, too, where the Genii hid 
 
 The jewel'd cup of their King Jamshid, 
 
 With Life's elixir sparkling high : 
 
 But gifts like these are not for the sky. 
 
 Where was there ever a gem that shone 
 
 Like the steps of Alla's wonderful Throne? 
 
 And the Drops of Life — oh ! what would they be 
 
 In the boundless Deep of Eternity?" 
 
 While thus she mused, her pinions fannd 
 The airs of the sweet Indian land, 
 Whose air is balm, whose ocean spreads 
 O'er coral rocks and amber beds ; 
 Whose sandal groves and bowers of spice 
 Might be a Peri's Paradise ! 
 But crimson now her rivers ran 
 
 With human blood ; — the smell of death 
 Came reeking from those spicy bowers; 
 And man, — the sacrifice of man, — 
 
 Mingled his taint with every breath 
 Upwafted from the innocent flowers. 
 
 Land of the Sun ! What foot invades 
 Thy Pagods and thy pillar' d shades, — 
 Thy cavern-shrines, and Idol-stones, 
 Thy Monarchs and their thousand Thrones? 
 'T is He of G-azna — fierce in wrath 
 
 He comes, and India's diadems 
 Lie scattered in his ruinous path. 
 
 His bloodhounds he adorns with gems, 
 
 Torn from the violated necks 
 Of many a young and loved Sultana ; 
 Maidens, within their pure Zenenna, 
 Priests — in the very fane he slaughters, 
 
 And chokes up with glittering wrecks 
 Of golden shrines the sacred waters ! 
 Downward the Peri turns her gaze, 
 And, through the war-field's bloody haze, 
 Beholds a youthful warrior stand 
 
 Alone, — beside his native river, — 
 The red blade broken in his hand, 
 
 And the last arrow in his quiver.

 " Live," said the Conqueror, " live to share 
 
 The trophies and the crowns I bear ! " 
 
 Silent that youthful warrior stood ; 
 
 Silent he pointed to the flood, 
 
 All crimson with his country's blood; 
 
 Then sent his last remaining dart, 
 
 For answer, — to the Invader's heart. 
 
 False flew the shaft, though pointed well ; 
 The Tyrant lived,— the Hero— fell ! 
 Yet marked the Peri where he lay ; 
 
 And when the rush of wars was past, 
 Swiftly descending on a ray 
 
 Of morning light, she caught the last, — 
 Last — glorious drop his heart had shed 
 Before his free-born spirit fled ! 
 
 " Be this," she cried, as she winged her flight, 
 " My welcome gift at the Gates of Light. 
 Though foul are the drops that oft distill 
 
 On the field of warfare,— blood like this, 
 
 For Liberty shed, so holy is, 
 It would not stain the purest rill 
 
 That sparkles among the Bowers of Bliss ! 
 Oh ! if there be on this earthly sphere 
 A boon, — an offering Heaven holds dear, 
 'T is the last libation Liberty draws 
 From the heart that bleeds and breaks in her cause! " 
 
 " Sweet," said the Angel, — as she gave 
 
 The gift into his radiant hand, — 
 " Sweet is our welcome of the Brave 
 
 "Who die thus for their native land : — 
 But see — alas ! — the crystal bar 
 Of Eden moves not ; — holier far 
 Than even this drop the boon must be 
 That opes the Gates of Heaven for thee ! " 
 
 BATTLE OF BUNKER HILL. F. S. Cozens. 
 
 It was a starry night — in June; the air — was soft — and still, 
 
 When the minute-men — (from Cambridge) came, — and gathered — on the hill. 
 
 Beneath us — lay the sleeping town; around us — frowned the fleet; 
 
 But — the pulse — of freemen, {not of slaves,) within our bosoms beat; 
 
 And every heart — rose high — with hope, — as — (fearlessly) we said, — 
 
 '• We will be numbered — with the free, — or numbered — with the dead." 
 
 " Bring out the line — to mark the trench, — and stretch it — on the sword!" 
 
 The trench — is marked, — the tools — are brought, — and we utter — not word ; 
 
 But stack our guns, — then fall to work — with mattock — and with spade, 
 
 A thousand men — with sinewy arms, — and not a sound — is made : 
 
 So still were we — (the stars beneath) th't scarce a whisper — fell ; 
 
 We heard the ?^c?-coat's musket click, — and heard him cry, — ("All } s well!")

 And now — they 'reforming at the Point; — now — the lines advance: 
 
 We see — (beneath the sultry sun) — their polished bayonets glance; 
 
 We hear — (anear) — the throbbing drum, — the bugle challenge ring; 
 
 Quick bursts — and loud — the flashing cloud, — and rolls — from wing — to wing ; 
 
 But — on the height — our bulwark stands, — tremendous — in its gloom, — 
 
 As sullen — as a tropic sky — and silent — as the tomb. 
 
 And so — we waited — till we saw, — at scarce ten rifles' length, 
 
 The old — vindictive Saxon spite, — in all its stubborn strength; 
 
 When — sudden — flash — on flash — around the jagged rampart burst

 " Hurrah! they run! the field — is won!" " Hurrah! the foe is fled!"

 As his heart — kept praying — (all the while) for home — and native land. 
 
 Thrice — on that day we stood the shock — of thrice — a thousand foes, 
 And thrice — (that day) — within our lines — the shout of victory rose! 
 And — tho' our swift fire — slackened then, — and reddening — in the skies — 
 We saiv — (from Charlestowri' 's roofs — and walls) the flamy columns rise ; 
 Yet — while we had a cartridge left — we still — maintained the fight, 
 Nor gained the foe — one foot of ground — upon that blood-st&med height. 
 
 What — though for us — no laurels bloom, — nor — o'er the nameless brave — 
 
 No sculptured trophy, — scroll, — nor patch — records a warrior's grave! 
 
 What — tho' the day — (to us) — was lost ! Upon the deathless page — 
 
 The everlasting charter stands — for every land — and age ! 
 
 For man — hath broke — his felon bands, — and cast them — in the dust, 
 
 And claimed his heritage divine, — and justified — the trust. 
 
 While — thro' his rifled prison-bars, — the hues of Freedom pour — 
 
 O'er every nation, — race, — and clime, — on every sea — and shore. 
 
 Such glories — as the patriarch viewed — when — 'mid the darkest skies

 ODE TO ELOQUENCE. 
 
 Heard ye — those loud contending waves 
 
 That shook Cecropia's pillar'd state;

 And bid the raging tumult cease?

 HERVE KIEL. By Robert Browning. 
 
 On the sea and at the Hogue, sixteen hundred ninety-two, 
 Did the English fight the French — woe to France ! 
 And, the thirty-first of May, helter-skelter through the blue, 
 Like a crowd of frightened porpoises a shoal of sharks pursue, 
 Came crowding ship on ship to St. Malo on the Bance, 
 With the English fleet in view. 
 
 'T was the squadron that escaped, with the victor in full chase ; 
 First and foremost of the drove, in his great ship, Damfreville ; 
 
 Close on him fled, great and small, 
 
 Twenty-two good ships in all; 
 
 And they signaled to the place, 
 
 " Help the winners of a race ! 
 Get us guidance, give us harbor, take us quick — or, quicker still, 
 
 Here 's the Eno-lish can and will ! " 
 
 Then the pilots of the place put out brisk and leaped on board; 
 
 " Why, what hope or chance have ships like these to pass ?" laughed they : 
 
 " Eocks to starboard, rocks to port, all the passage scarred and scored; 
 
 Shall the Formidable here, with her twelve and eighty guns, 
 
 Think to make the river-mouth by the single narrow way, — 
 
 Trust to enter where 't is ticklish for a craft of twenty tons, 
 
 And with flow at full beside ? 
 
 Now, 't is slackest ebb of tide. 
 
 Beach the mooring? Bather say, 
 
 While rock stands or water runs, 
 
 Not a ship will leave the bay ! " 
 
 Then was called a council straight ; 
 
 Brief and bitter the debate: 
 " Here's the English at our heels ; would you have them take in tow 
 All that 's left us of the fleet, linked together stern and bow 
 
 For a prize to Plymouth Sound ? 
 
 Better run the ships aground ! " 
 
 (Ended Damfreville his speech.) 
 
 "Not a minute more to wait ! 
 
 Let the captains all and each 
 Shove ashore ; then blow up, burn the vessels on the beach ! 
 
 France must undergo her fate.''" 
 
 " Give the word ! " But no such word 
 
 Was ever spoke or heard ; 
 For up stood, for out stepped, for in struck amid all these — 
 A captain ? A lieutenant ? A mate — first, second, third ? 
 
 No such man of mark, and meet 
 
 With his betters to compete ! 
 But a simple Breton sailor, pressed by Tourville for the fleet— 
 A poor coasting-pilot he, Herve Biel the Croisickese.

 And " What mockery or malice have we here?" cries Herve Kiel; 
 ••Are you mad, you Malouins? Are you cowards, fools, or rogues? 
 Talk to me of rocks and shoals, me who took the soundings, tell 
 On my fingers every bank, every shallow, every swell 
 Twixt the offing here and Greve, where the river disembogues? 
 Are you bought by English gold? Is it love the lying 'a for? 
 
 Morn and eve, night and day, 
 
 Have I piloted your bay ; 
 Entered free and anchored fast at the foot of Solidor. 
 Burn the fleet and ruin France ? That were worse than fifty Hogues ! 
 Sirs, they know I speak the truth ! Sirs, believe me there 's a way ! 
 
 Only let me lead the line, 
 
 Have the biggest ship to steer, 
 
 Get this Formidable clear, 
 
 Make the others follow mine, 
 And I '11 lead them most and least by a passage I know well, 
 
 Eight to Solidor, past Greve, 
 
 And there lay them safe and sound; 
 
 And if one ship misbehave — 
 
 Keel so much as grate the ground — 
 Why, I 've nothing but my life : here 's my bead ! " cries Herve Kiel. 
 
 Not a minute more to wait. 
 
 "Steer us in then, small and great! 
 Take the helm, lead the line, save the squadron ! " cried its chief. 
 
 Captains, give the sailor place ! 
 
 He is admiral, in brief. 
 
 Still the north wind, by God's grace. 
 
 See the noble fellow's face 
 
 As the big ship, with a bound, 
 
 Clears the entry like a hound, 
 Keeps the passage as its inch of way were the wide sea's profound ! 
 
 See, safe through shoal and rock, 
 
 How they follow in a flock ! 
 Not a ship that misbehaves, not a keel that grates the ground, 
 
 Not a spar that comes to grief! 
 
 The peril, see, is past, 
 
 All are harbored to the last, 
 And just as Herve Kiel hollas "Anchor !" sure as fate, 
 
 Up the English come, too late. 
 
 So the storm subsides to calm : 
 
 They see the green trees wave 
 
 On the heights o'erlooking Greve: 
 
 Hearts that bled are stanched with balm. 
 
 "Just our rapture to enhance, 
 
 Let the English rake the bay r 
 
 Gnash their teeth and glare askance, 
 
 As they cannonade away! 
 'Neath rampired Solidor pleasant riding on the Kance!" 
 How hope succeeds despair on each captain's countenance!

 Out burst all with one accord, 
 
 " This is paradise for hell ! 
 
 Let France, let France's king 
 
 Thank the man that did the thing ! " 
 
 What a shout, and all one word 
 
 11 Herve Kiel." 
 
 As he stepped in front once more, 
 
 Not a symptom of surprise 
 
 In the frank blue Breton eyes — 
 
 Just the same man as before. 
 
 Then said Damfreville : " My friend, 
 I must speak out at the end, 
 Though I find the speaking hard: — 
 Praise is deeper than the lips : 
 You have saved the king his ships, 
 You must name your own reward. 
 'Faith, our sun was near eclipse ! 
 Demand whate'er you will, 
 France remains your debtor still. 
 Ask to heart's content, and have — or my name 's not Damfreville ! " 
 
 Then a beam of fun outbroke 
 
 On the bearded mouth that spoke, 
 
 As the honest heart laughed through 
 
 Those frank eyes of Breton blue : 
 
 " Since I needs must say my say, 
 
 Since on board the duty's done, 
 And from Malo Koads to Croisic Point — what is it but a run ? — 
 
 Since 't is ask and have, I may — 
 
 Since the others go ashore — 
 
 Come ! A good whole holiday ! 
 Leave to go and see my wife, whom I call the Belle Aurore ! " 
 That he asked, and that he got — nothing more. 
 
 Name and deed alike are lost : 
 
 Not a pillar nor a post 
 In his Croisic keeps alive the feat as it befell ; 
 
 Not a head in white and black 
 
 On a single fishing-smack, 
 In memory of the man but for whom had gone to wrack 
 All that France saved from the fight whence England bore the bell. 
 
 Go to Paris ; rank on rank 
 
 Search the heroes flung pell-mell

 CHAPTER XVIII. 
 
 The Keverential Style — True Emphasis — Name of the Deity — 
 
 Exercises. 
 
 The question is frequently asked, in what manner should we read 
 the Scriptures and compositions of a sacred character. As a general 
 rule, their meaning and sentiment must dictate, as do those of all 
 other compositions. Where the style is solemn and grand, the voice, 
 time, and movement must be correspondingly so. The name of the 
 Divine Being, when directly addressed, should never be pronounced 
 in the pitches of voice used by the profane and the blasphemous; 
 yet many ministers and preachers of the Word make no difference 
 in this respect. But before the name is pronounced the voice should 
 be fully suspended, and sufficient pause be given to allow an inflowing 
 of reverential feeling. The voice should fall at least from one to two 
 tones lower, as in parenthetical modulations. Yet, instead of being 
 spoken more rapidly, it, on the contrary, should take a slow and 
 tremulous circumflex movement; and this must not be affected, but 
 heartfelt. 
 
 "Deliver my soul, O Lord, from lying lips and from a deceitful tongue." 
 
 "Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever! The scepter of thy kingdom is 
 a right scepter." 
 
 Much difficulty is experienced by many people about finding the 
 true emphasis of such clauses as the following: "I was created by 
 God;" and "by God and his holy angels." If "by God" is ren- 
 dered without emphasis, there is felt a want of reverence; if the 
 preposition by is emphasized, it smacks of profanity; if again, the 
 emphasis is placed on the name of God, it is equally suggestive of 
 swearing ; but if we resort to that slight suspension of voice, before 
 spoken of, after the word "by," and pronounce the name God in a 
 grave tone, with a slight circumflexion of voice, nothing harsh or out 
 of place will be experienced. "It was created by — God — and his 
 Iwly angels," etc. These are seemingly small matters, but exceed- 
 ingly important, as they go to make up the aggregate of truthful 
 expression.

 The following exercises will be practiced with direct reference to 
 this rest of voice before the clauses and names of the Deity, and with 
 the low, tremulous circumflex which the pronunciation of the name 
 requires : 
 
 "3 Hail — 1 Universal Lord! — 3 be bounteous still, and only good." 
 
 "2 And if the night — hath gathered aught of evil — 3 r concealed, — 
 2 Disperse it now as light — dispels — 1 the dark." 
 
 "6 Prayer — ardent — opens heaven; lets down a sir earn of glory — on the 
 consecrated hour of man — 3i n audience with — ithe Deity." 
 
 " In its sublime research, — philosophy 
 
 May measure out the ocean deep, — may count 
 The sands or the sun's rays ; — but, — 1 God, — for thee 
 
 There is no weight — nor measure : none can mount 
 Up to thy mysteries; — reason's brightest spark, — 
 
 Though kindled by thy light, — in vain would try 
 To trace thy counsels infinite and — dark; 
 
 And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high, 
 
 Even like past moments — in eteknity." 
 
 But there are passages that require rapid and joyful movements 
 of voice. It is always important, as has been before stated, that the 
 subject and sentiment should be clearly defined in the mind before 
 attempting to give them forcible expression. 
 
 Passages written under the excitement of exalted imagination, 
 when the soul communes with the spirit of nature, require the iden- 
 tification of one's self with the spirit to render them properly. 
 
 The magnificent outburst of joyful emotion exhibited in the selec- 
 tion given below from the Psalms shows a spirit appreciative of the 
 creative forces of all things, and if the student has not the power to 
 enter this exalted state he can not render the words of the great 
 singer. But if, with David, he can behold the great mass of waters 
 surging their vast floods in the rhythm of motion — mighty waves 
 lifting their crested heads in the sunshine, chasing each other with 
 delight — all impelled irresistibly onward by that same power w T hich 
 inspires us with life and impulse — then the imagination can perceive 
 that the floods can clap their hands and the hills be joyful together : 
 
 "Make a joyful noise unto the Lord, all the earth; make a loud noise, and 
 rejoice, and sing praise. 
 
 Sing unto the Lord with the harp; with the harp and the voice of a psalm. 
 
 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before — the Lord, — 
 the King. 
 
 Let the sea — roar, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that dwell 
 therein.

 Lei the foods — clap their hands: let the hills — be joyful together 
 Before — the Lord ; for he cometh to judge the earth: with righteousness shall 
 lie judge the icorld, and the people with equity." (Psalm xcviii, 4-9.) 
 
 There is a feeling, which quite generally prevails, that in reading 
 the Sacred Scriptures or the Church Ritual elocutionary rules need 
 not be observed. This idea is based upon the supposition that all 
 elocution is an affected, stilted style of reading, which should not be 
 applied to Holy Writ. If this were so, the art of elocution should 
 certainly not be thus applied. 
 
 Some believe that the letter of the Word is of little value ; that 
 the spiritual meaning only should be brought out, and that this 
 requires some peculiar style. But they fail to inform us what the 
 peculiar style is. These forget that it is only through the letter that 
 the spirit can be embodied, and through the letter alone can we give 
 forth its true expression. It would be a foolish waste of time to utter 
 words only, if these could not be made the interpreters of the thoughts, 
 the affections, the emotions of the soul. 
 
 When we attend church for the sake of divine worship, we can but 
 feel sad at the great neglect of the proper reading of the Scriptures 
 and the church service. Ministers and congregation alike seem to be 
 unconscious of the importance of giving their best efforts in such 
 service. The mumbled, hurried, and discordant sounds heard in 
 responses are not worship ; they are not even lip-service. Without 
 any desire to be censorious, and with the sincere wish that what 
 purports to be worship should be such in spirit and in truth, we 
 must say that we have listened to responses given in churches which 
 struck the ear more like a dissatisfied grumble than an earnest, hearty 
 outgushing of praise or supplication. It is not well to cherish the 
 idea that this stinted offering is praise or service. He who has so 
 wonderfully constructed the human voice ought to receive as tribute 
 the highest outpouring of soul in sweetest and most harmonious utter- 
 ances; and they who are devout and reverent should also praise in 
 harmony. 
 
 But says the objector, religious expression is an individual thing, 
 and each must be allowed to give it utterance in his own way. Cer- 
 tainly, but his way should be a harmonious one, so long as harmonic 
 laws can be studied by all. 
 
 Let us look at the subject of collective and individual worship. 
 For individual worship people do not come into assemblies. The 
 ability to bring one's self into communion with the Divine Spirit is 
 one thing, and the ability to unite with a number of persons, giving

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 155 
 
 mutual strength and assistance in coming into a condition receptive 
 of the inflowing of the Spirit, is quite another thing. It is somewhat 
 like the difference of tuning one instrument to harmony in a certain 
 key, and bringing a great number of different instruments to a perfect 
 accord in the same key. 
 
 Individual worship alone does not satisfy; people desire to unite 
 in prayer and praise. Man is socially religious as well as intellect- 
 ually, scientifically, or musically social. For this reason temples for 
 worship and instruction are reared ; and in the union and harmony 
 of the entire congregation is produced the best state for the reception 
 of divine truths. The Spirit of the Lord can only descend in the 
 harmonies, never in the discords. 
 
 If this individual indifference and disregard of the laws of har- 
 mony and time were applied to singing the hymns, we should see how 
 ridiculous it is ; yet the reading, the prayer, and the responses are just 
 as much a part of the worship. Let us tune our voices in unison ; 
 get control of the letter of the Word, that we may through that 
 medium give expression to the spirit. People should read in concert, 
 sing in concert, and praise in concert. 
 
 Some persons object to teaching any part of the Bible as a reading- 
 lesson ; alleging that it is of too sacred a character to be used for the 
 purposes of education. We should say that if it is too sacred to be 
 used in instruction, it is too sacred to be read badly : and if people 
 w r ere taught to read the Bible as it should be read, with true spirit 
 and feeling, it would be better valued and appreciated than it is 
 to-day. 
 
 SENNACHERIB'S RUIN. Isaiah xxxvi, 13-22 ; xxxvii, 1-7, 33-38. 
 
 Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews 1 language, 
 and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, — the king of Assyria. Thus 
 saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he shall not be ahle to deliver 
 you. Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord, saying, The Lord will 
 surely deliver us : this city shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of 
 Assyria. Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria, Make 
 an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me : and eat ye every one 
 of his vine, and every one of his fig-tree, and drink ye every one of the waters 
 of his own cistern ; until I come and take you away to a land like your own 
 land, a land of corn and wine, — a land of bread and vineyards. Beware lest 
 Hezekiah persuade you, saying, The Lord will deliver us. Hath any of the gods 
 of the nations — delivered his land — out of the hand of the king of Assyria? 
 Where — are the gods of Hamoth and Arpad? where are the gods of Sephar- 
 vaim ? and have they — delivered Samaria — out of my hands ? Who — are they — 
 among all the gods of these lands, that have delivered their land out of my 
 hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand? But they

 held their peace, and answered him not a word; for the king's commandment 
 was. saying, Answer him not. 
 
 Then came Eliakim, (the son of Hilkiah, that was over the household,) and 
 Shebna the scribe, and Joah (the son of Asaph,) the recorder, — to Hezekiah — with 
 their clothes rent, and told him — the words of Rabshakeh. 
 
 And it came to pass when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent his clothes, 
 and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord. And 
 he sent Ella kirn, (who was over the household,) and Shebna the scribe, and 
 the elders of the priests, (covered with sackcloth,) unto Isaiah the prophet, (the 
 son of Amoz.) And they said unto him, — Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a 
 day of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy : for the children are come to 
 the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. It may be — the Lord thy 
 G*d will hear the words of Rabshakeh, (whom the king of Assyria, his master, 
 hath sent to reproach the living God,) and will reprove the words which the 
 Lord thy God hath heard : wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is 
 left. So — the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah. 
 
 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master, Thus saith 
 the Lord, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, wherewith the serv- 
 ants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. Behold — I will send a blast 
 upon him, and he shall hear a rumor, and return to his own land; and I will 
 cause him to fall by the sword in his own land. Therefore thus saith the Lord 
 concerning the king of Assyria, He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an 
 arrow there, nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it. By the 
 way that he came, by the same shall he return, and shall not come into the city, 
 saith the Lord. For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and 
 for my servant David's sake. Then the angel of the Lord went forth, and 
 smote in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand : 
 and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead corpses. 
 
 So Sennacherib, (the king of Assyria,) departed, and went and returned, 
 and dwelt at Nineveh. And it came to pass, as he was worshiping in the house 
 of Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote him with the 
 sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia: and Esarhaddon his son 
 reigned in his stead. 
 
 PAUL AT CESAREA. Acts xxv. 
 
 Now — when Festus was come into the province, (after three days) — he as- 
 cended from Cesarea. to Jerusalem. Then — the high priest — and the chief of 
 the Jews — informed- him against Paul, and besought him, and desired favor 
 against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying wait — (in the 
 way) — to kill him. But Festus answered, — that Paul should be kept at Cesarea, 
 and that he himself — would depart shortly thither. Let them therefore, said 
 he, which among you are able, go down with me, and accuse this man, — if there 
 be any wickedness in him. And when he had tarried among them more than 
 ten days, — he went u dow?i unto Cesarea; and the next day — (sitting on the 
 judgment-seat) — commanded Paul to be brought. And w r hen he was come, the 
 Jews — (which came down from Jerusalem) — stood round about, and laid 
 many — and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove. 
 While he answered for himself, Neither against the law of the Jews, neither

 against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, — have I offended anything at all. 
 But Festus,— (willing to do the Jews & pleasure,) answered Paul, — and said, — 
 Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me? 
 Then said Paul, — I stand at Ccesar's judgment-seat, — where I ought to be 
 judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, — as thou very well knowest. For 
 if I be an offender, or have committed any thing— worthy of death, I refuse not 
 to die: but if there be none of these things (whereof these accuse me,) no man 
 may — deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Ccesar. Then Festus, (when he 
 had conferred with the council,) — answered, Hast thou appealed unto Ccesar? 
 unto Caesar — shalt thou go. 
 
 And after certain days — King Agrippa and Bernice — came unto Cesarea — 
 to salute Festus. And when they had been there many days, Festus declared 
 Paul's cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man — left in bonds by 
 Felix: about whom, — (when I was at Jerusalem,) the chief priests and the 
 elders of the Jews informed me, — desiring to have judgment against him. To 
 whom I answered, — It is not the manner of the Eomans to deliver any man to 
 die, before that he — (which is accused) — have the accusers— /ace — to face, — and 
 have license to answer for himself — concerning the crime laid against him. 
 Therefore, — when they were come hither, — (without any delay) — on the morrow 
 I sat on the judgment-seat, — and commanded the man to be brought forth. 
 Against whom — when the accusers stood up, — they brought none accusation 
 of such things as I supposed: but had certain questions against him — of their 
 own superstition, and of one Jesus, which was dead, whom Paul affirmed — to 
 be alive. And because I doubted of such manner of questions, — -I ashed him— 
 whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters. But 
 when Paul had appealed to be reserved unto the hearing of Augustus, I com- 
 manded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar. Then Agrippa said 
 unto Festus, — I would also hear the man myself. To-morrow, said he, thou 
 shalt hear him. 
 
 And on the morrow, — when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great 
 pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and 
 principal men of the city, at Festus's commandment Paul was brought forth. 
 And Festus said, — King Agrippa, and all men: — which are here present with 
 us, ye see this man, about whom — all the multitude of the Jews have dealt 
 with me, both at Jerusalem, and also here, crying — that he ought not to live 
 any longer. But when I found — that he had committed nothing — worthy of 
 death, and that he himself hath appealed to Augustus, — I have determined to 
 send him. Of whom I have no certain thing to write unto my lord. Where- 
 fore — I have brought him forth before you, and specially — before thee, — O King 
 Agrippa, that, after examination had, I might have somewhat to write. For it 
 seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal — to signify the 
 crimes — laid against him. 
 
 PAUL BEFORE AGRIPPA. Acts xxvi. 
 
 Then Agrippa — said unto Paul, — Thou art permitted — to speak for thyself. 
 Then — Paul stretched forth the hand, — and answered for himself: I think my- 
 self happy, King Agrippa, — because I shall answer for myself this day before 
 thee — touching all the things — whereof I am accused of the Jews: especially —

 because I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among 
 the Jews: wherefore — 1 beseech thee — to hear me patiently. My manner of 
 life— from my youth, —(which was — at the first— among mine own nation at 
 Jerusalem,) know all the Jews; which knew me from the beginning,— \f they 
 would testify, — that after the most straitest sect of our religion — I lived — a 
 Pharisee. And now — I stand — and am judged for the hope — of the promise — 
 made of God unto our fathers : unto which promise — our twelve tribes, instantly 
 serving God — day — and night, hope to come. For which hope's sake, — King 
 Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews. Why should it be thought — a thing 
 incredible with you, that God — should raise the dead? /verily thought — with 
 myself, — that I ought to do many things — contrary to the name of Jesus — of 
 Nazareth. "Which thing I also did — in Jerusalem: and many of the saints — 
 did I shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief priests ; and 
 when they were put to death, — I gave my voice against them. And I punished 
 them oft — in every synagogue, and compelled them to blaspheme; and being 
 exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities. 
 Whereupon — as I went to Damascus with authority and commission from the 
 chief priests, at midday, — O king, — I saw — in the way — a light from heaven, 
 (above the brightness of the sun,) shining round about me — and them which 
 journeyed with me. And when we were all fallen to the earth, — I heard a 
 voice — speaking unto me, and saying — in the Hebrexo tongue, — Saul, Saul, why 
 p>ersecutest thou me? it is hard for thee — to kick against the pricks. And I 
 said, — "Who art thou, Lord ? And he said, I am Jesus — whom thou persecutest. 
 But rise, and stand upon thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for this pur- 
 pose, to make thee a minister — and a witness — both of these things — which thou 
 hast seen, — and of those things — in the which I will appear unto thee ; deliver- 
 ing thee from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, 
 to open their eyes', — and to turn them from darkness — to light, — and from the 
 power of Satan — unto God, — that they may receive, forgiveness of sins, — and 
 inheritance among them which are sanctified by faith — that is in me. "Where- 
 upon, — O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient — unto the heavenly vision : but 
 showed first — unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the 
 coasts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to 
 God, and do works meet for repentance. For these causes — the Jews caught me 
 in the temple, and went about to kill me. Having therefore — obtained help 
 of God, I continue — unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying 
 none other things than those which the prophets and Moses — did say should 
 come : that Christ should suffer, and that he should be the first that should rise 
 from the dead, and should show light unto the people and to the Gentiles. 
 
 And as he thus spake for himself, — Festus said — with a loud voice, — Paid, 
 thou art beside thyself; much learning — doth make thee mad. But he said, I am 
 not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth the words of truth and soberness. 
 For the king knoweth of these things, — before whom also I speak freely : for I 
 am persuaded — that none of these things — are hidden from him; for this thing 
 was not done in a corner. King Agrippa, — believest thou the prophets'? I 
 know that thou believest. Then Agrippa — said unto Paul, — Almost — thou per- 
 BUadest me to be a Christian. And Paul said, I would to God, that not only 
 thou, but also all that hear me this day, were both almost, — and altogether such

 as 7am, — except these bonds. And when he had thus spoken, the "king rose up, 
 and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them : and when they 
 were gone aside, they talked between themselves, — saying, This man doeth 
 nothing worthy of death — or of bonds. Then said Agrlppa — unto Festus, This 
 man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Ccesar. 
 
 DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB. Byron. 
 The Assyrian came down like a wolf — on the fold, 
 And his cohorts — were gleaming — in purple and gold; 
 And the sheen of his spears — was like stars — on the sea 
 "Where the blue wave — rolls nightly on deep Galilee. 
 
 Like the leaves of the forest — when Summer is green, 
 That host, — with their banners, — at sunset were seen; 
 Like the leaves of the forest — when Autumn hath blown, 
 That host, — on the morrow, — lay — withered and strown. 
 
 For the Angel of Death — spread his wings on th' blast, 
 And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed ; 
 And the eyes of the sleepers — waked deadly and chill, 
 And their hearts — but once heaved, — and forever were still. 
 
 And there — lay the steed, — with his nostrils all wide, 
 But through them — there rolVd not the breath of his pride; 
 And the foam of his gasping — lay white on the turf, 
 And cold — as the spray of the rock-beating surf. 
 
 And there — lay the rider, distorted and pale, 
 "With the dew on his brow and the rust on his mail; 
 And the tents were all silent, the banners — alone, 
 The lances — unlifted, the trumpets — unblown. 
 
 And the widows of Ashur — are loud in their wail; 
 And the idols are broke — in the temple of Baal; 
 And the might of the Gentiles, unsmote by the sword, 
 Hath melted — like snow in the glance of the Lord. 
 
 THE CONSTANCY OF THE JEWS IN CAPTIVITY. Psalm cxxxvii. 
 
 By the rivers of Bab-y-lon, there — we sat down, — yea, — we wept, when we 
 remembered Zion. 
 
 We hanged our harps — upon the willows — in the midst thereof. 
 
 For there — they (that carried us away captive) required of us a song ; and they 
 that wasted us — required of us mirth, saying, Sing us — one of the songs of Zion. 
 
 How shall we — sing the Lord's song — in a strange land? 
 
 If I forget thee, — Jerusalem, let my right hand — forget her cunning. 
 
 If I do not remember thee, — let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth; 
 if I prefer not Jerusalem — above my chief joy. 
 
 Eemember, — Lord, — the children of Edom — in the day of Jerusalem; — 
 who said, Raze it, raze it, even to the foundation thereof. 
 
 O daughter — of Bab-y-lon, who art to be destroyed ; happy shall he be that 
 rewardeth thee as thou hast served — us. 
 
 Hapjjy shall he be, that taketh — and dasheth thy little ones against the stones.

 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me — in the paths of righteousness for his

 Yea, though I walk — through the valley — of the shadow of death, I will

 Thou preparest a table before me— in the presence of mine enemies: thou

 Above its sad — and lowly — plains 
 
 They bend on hov'ring wing. 
 And ever o'er the Babel — sou/ids 
 
 The blessed angels sing. 
 
 But with the woes of sin and strife 
 
 The world hath suffered long ; 
 Beneath the angel strain have rolled — 
 
 Two thousand years of wrong. 
 And man — at war with man, — hears not 
 
 The love-song which they bring : — 
 Oh! hush the noise. — ye men of strife, 
 
 And hear the angels sing. 
 
 And ye, — beneath life's — crushing load, — 
 
 Whose forms are bending low, 
 Who toil along the climbing way 
 
 With painful steps and d 
 Look now ! for glad and golden hours 
 
 Come swiftly on the wing ; — 
 Oh ! rest beside the weary road, 
 
 And hear the angels sing. 
 
 For lo, the days are hastening on, 
 
 By prophet bards foretold, 
 When with the ever-circling years 
 
 Comes round the age of gold; 
 When peace shall over all the earth 
 
 Its ancient splendors fling, 
 And the whole world send back the song 
 
 Which now the angels sing.

 Sing unto the Lord with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm. 
 
 With trumpets — and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the 
 Lord, — the King. 
 
 Let the sea — roar, and the fullness thereof; the world, and they that a. .■>'.'.

 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills hejoyfid together 
 
 Before the Lord; for he cometh to judge the earth : with righteousness shall 
 he judge the icorld, and the people with equity.

 CREATION PROVES THE EXISTENCE OF GOD. L. M. Double. 
 
 The spacious firmament on high, 
 
 And all the blue ethereal sky, 
 
 And spangled heavens, a shining frame, 
 
 Their Great Original proclaim. 
 
 Th' unwearied sun, from day to day, 
 
 Does his Creator's power display, 
 
 And publishes to every land 
 
 The work of an Almighty Hand. 
 
 Soon as the evening shades prevail, 
 The moon takes up the wondrous tale, 
 And nightly to the list'ning earth 
 Repeats the story of her birth ; 
 While all the stars that round her burn, 
 And all the planets in their turn, 
 Confirm the tidings as they roll, 
 And spread the truth from pole to pole. 
 
 "What though, in solemn silence, all 
 Move round the dark terrestrial ball; 
 What though no real voice or sound 
 Amid their radiant orbs be found ; 
 In reason's ear they all rejoice, 
 And utter forth a glorious voice, 
 Forever singing, as they shine, 
 The Hand that made us is Divine!

 THE LIVING WATERS. 
 
 See — from Zion's sacred mountain 
 Streams of living — water flow ! 
 
 God has open'd there — a fountain: 
 This supplies the plains below. 
 
 They are blessed 
 Who its sovereign — virtues know. 
 
 Through ten thousand channels flowing, 
 Streams — of mercy — find their way; 
 
 Life and health and joy bestowing. 
 They the Savior's love display. 
 
 O ye — nations, 
 Hail the long-expected day ! 
 
 Gladden'd by the flowing treasure, — 
 
 All — enriching as it goes, 
 Lo ! the desert smiles — with pleasure. 
 
 Buds and blossoms as the rose : 
 Etfry object 
 
 Sings for joy — where'er it flows. 
 
 Trees of life — the banks adorning, — 
 Yield their fruit to all around. 
 
 They who eat — are saved from mourning ; 
 Pleasures spring and hopes abound: 
 
 Fair their portion ! 
 Endless life with glory crown' d. 
 
 THE MORNING DAWNS. 
 
 The morning dawns : celestial light 
 Dispels the gloomy shades of night : 
 Truth rears her standard once again, 
 And love, — celestial love, shall reign. 
 
 The Heavenly — Sun, the Lord our God, 
 Beams his refulgent rays abroad : 
 He comes to bless the humble soul, 
 And spread his truth — from pole — to pole. 
 
 Now nations barbWous, rude, and blind, 
 In Jesus shall salvation find : 
 Idols before his name shall fall, 
 And he alone be — Lord of all. 
 
 Thus — ev'ry land and clime shall hear 
 The Lord is God, — his name revere ; 
 From sin, and death, and darkness rise, 
 And join the concert of the skies.

 THE HEAVENLY CANAAN. Watts. 
 There is a land — of pure delight, 
 
 "Where sai7its — immortal — reign ! 
 Eternal day excludes the night, 
 
 And pleasures — banish pain. 
 
 There — everlasting spring abides, 
 And never-fading flowers; 
 
 Death, (like a narrow sea,) divides 
 This heavenly land from ours. 
 
 Sweet fields, — beyond the swelling flood, 
 Stand dressed — in living green: 
 
 So to the Jews fair Canaan — stood, 
 While Jordan — rolled between. 
 
 But timorous mortals start — and shrink 
 
 To cross this narrow sea; 
 And linger, — trembling on the brink, 
 
 And fear to launch away. 
 
 Oh ! could we make our doubts remove 
 Those gloomy doubts that rise, 
 
 And see the Canaan that we love 
 With unbeelouded eyes ; — 
 
 Could we — but climb where Moses stood, 
 And view the landscape o'er, 
 
 Not Jordan 's stream — nor deaths cold flood 
 Should fright us from the shore. 
 
 TELL ME, YE WINGED WINDS. Charles Mackay. 
 Tell me, — ye winged winds, 
 
 That round my pathway roar, 
 Do you not know some spot 
 
 Where mortals — weep no more? 
 Some lone — and pleasant — dell, 
 
 Some valley — in the west, 
 Where, — free from toil — and pain, 
 The weary soul may rest? 
 The loud wind softened to a whisper low, 
 And sighed — for pity as it whispered — "No!" 
 Tell me, — thou mighty — deep, 
 
 Whose billows round me — play, 
 Know'st thou some favored spot, 
 
 Some island far away, 
 Where weary man may find 
 
 The bliss — for which he sighs, 
 Where sorrow never — lives 
 And friendship never dies? 
 The loud waves, — rolling in perpetual flow, 
 Stopped for a while, and sighed to answer — "No!

 That with such holy face 
 Dost look upon the earth, 
 
 Asleep — in night 1 s embrace, 
 Tell me, in all thy round, 
 
 Hast thou not seen some spot 
 "Where miserable — man 
 Might find a happier — lot ? 
 Behind a cloud the moon withdrew in woe, 
 And a voice, sweet but sad, responded — "No!" 
 Tell me, — my secret soul, 
 
 Oh ! tell me, — Hope and Faith, 
 Is there no resting--p\sice 
 
 From sorrow, — sin, — and death ? 
 Is there no happy spot 
 
 Where mortals may be blest. 
 Where grief may find a balm 
 And weariness a rest ? 
 Faith, — Hope, and Love, — best boons to mortals given, — 
 Waved their bright wings, and whispered — "Yes! — in heaven!" 
 
 THE EXCELLENCE OF GOD'S LAW. Psalm xix. 
 
 The heavens — declare the glory of God ; and the firmament showeth his 
 handiwork. 
 
 Day — unto day — uttereth speech, and night — unto night — showeth knowledge. 
 
 There is no speech — nor language where their voice is not heard. 
 
 Their line — is gone out through all the earth, — and their words to the end 
 of the world. In them — hath he set a tabernacle for the sun. 
 
 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth (as a 
 strong man) to run a race. 
 
 His going forth — is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit — unto the 
 ends of it ; and there is nothing hid from the heat thereof. 
 
 The law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul: the testimony of the 
 Lord is sure, making wise — the simple. 
 
 The statutes of the Lord — are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment 
 of the Lord — is pure, enlightening the eyes. 
 
 The fear of the Lord — is clean, enduring for ever : the judgments of the 
 Lord — are true and righteous altogether. 
 
 More to be desired are they — than gold, yea, than much. fine gold: sweeter 
 also — than honey — and the honey-comb. 
 
 Moreover — by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them there is 
 great reward. 
 
 Who can understand his errors f cleanse thou me — from secret faults. 
 
 Keep back thy servant also — from presumptuous sins; let them not have 
 dominion over me : then — shall I be upright, and I shall be innocent from the 
 great transgression. 
 
 Let the words — of my mouth, and the meditation— of my heart be accept- 
 able in thy sight, O Lord, my strength, and my redeemer.

 MY PSALM. Jphn G. Whittier. 
 
 I mourn no more my vanished years ; 
 
 Beneath a tender rain, 
 An April rain of smiles and tears, 
 
 My heart is young again. 
 
 The west winds hlow, and, singing low, 
 I hear the glad streams run; 
 
 The windows of my soul I throw 
 Wide open to the sun. 
 
 No longer forward nor behind 
 
 I look in hope and fear; 
 But, grateful, take the good I find, 
 
 The best of now and here. 
 
 I plow no more a desert land 
 To harvest weed and tare; 
 
 The manna dropping from God's hand 
 Rebukes my painful care. 
 
 I break my pilgrim staff, I lay 
 
 Aside the toiling oar; 
 The angel sought so far away 
 
 I welcome at my door. 
 
 The airs of spring may never play 
 
 Among the ripening corn, 
 Nor freshness of the flowers of May 
 
 Blow through the autumn morn ; 
 Yet shall the blue-eyed gentian look 
 
 Through fringed lids to heaven, 
 And the pale aster in the brook 
 
 Shall see its image given. 
 The woods shall wear their robes of praise, 
 
 The south wind softly sigh, 
 And sweet, calm days in golden haze 
 
 Melt down the amber sky. 
 Not less shall manly deed and word 
 
 Rebuke an age of wrong ; 
 The graven flowers that wreathe the sword 
 
 Make not the blade less strong. 
 But smiting hands shall learn to heal, 
 
 To build as to destroy ; 
 Nor less my heart for others feel 
 
 That I the more enjoy. 
 All as God wills, who wisely heeds 
 
 To give or to withhold, 
 And knoweth more of all my needs 
 
 Than all my prayers have told I

 Enough that blessings undeserved 
 
 Have marked my erring track — 
 That wheresoe'er my feet have swerved 
 
 His chastening turned me back. 
 
 That more and more a Providence 
 
 Of love is understood, 
 Making the springs of time and sense 
 
 Sweet with eternal good. 
 
 That death seems but a covered way 
 
 Which opens into light, 
 Wherein no blinded child can stray 
 
 Beyond the Father's sight. 
 
 That care and trial seem at last, 
 
 Through memory's sunset air, 
 Like mountain ranges overpast, 
 
 In purple distance fair. 
 
 That all the jarring notes of life 
 
 Seem blending in a psalm, 
 And all the angles of its strife 
 
 Slow rounding into calm. 
 
 And so the shadows fall apart, 
 
 And so the west winds play ; 
 And all the windows of my heart 
 
 I open to the day. 
 
 CONFIDENCE IN GOD'S PROTECTION. Psalm xxvii. 
 
 The Lord — is my light — and my salvation; whom — shall I fear ? the Lord is 
 the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid? 
 
 When the wicked, — even mine enemies, and my foes, — came upon me — to eat 
 up ray flesh, they stumbled and fell. 
 
 Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear; though 
 war — should rise against me, — in this will I be confident. 
 
 One thing have I desired of the Lord, that — will I seek after; that I may 
 dwell in the house of the Lord — all the days of life, to behold the beauty of the 
 Lord, and to inquire in his temple. 
 
 For in the time of trouble, — he shall hide me in his pavilion : in the secret 
 of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set me up upon a rock. 
 
 And now shall mine head be lifted up — above mine enemies round about me: 
 therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices of joy ; I will sing, yea, I will 
 sing praises unto the Lord. 
 
 Hear, — O Lord, when 1 cry with my voice : have mercy also upon me, and 
 answer me. 
 
 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face ; my heart — said unto thee, Thy face, 
 Lord, will I seek. 
 
 Side not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in anger : thou 
 hast been my help : leave me not, neither forsake me, God of my salvation.

 CHRIST IN THE TEMPEST. J. G. Whittieb. 
 
 Storm — on the heaving waters! The vast sky — 
 Is stooping — with its thunder. Cloud — on cloud 
 Rolls heavily — in the darkness, like a shroud — 
 Shaken by midnight's Angel — from on high; 
 Through the thick sea-mist, faintly — and afar, 
 Chorazin's watch-light — glimmers like a star, 
 And (momently) the ghastly cloud-fires — play 
 On the dark sea-wall of Capernaum' s bay ; 
 And tower — and turret — into light spring forth, 
 Like specters — starting from the storm-swept earth; 
 And vast — and awful, Tabor's mountain form, 
 Its Titan forehead — (naked to the storm,) 
 Towers — for one instant, — full — and clear, — and then — 
 Blends with the blackness — and the cloud again.

 And it is very terrible! The roar — 
 
 Ascendeth unto heaven, and thunders back, 
 
 Like the response of demons, — from the black 
 Rifts — of the hanging tempests, — yawning o'er 
 
 The wild waves — in their torment. Hark ! — the cry — 
 Of the strong man — in his peril, piercing through 
 
 The uproar of the waters — and the sky, 
 As the rent bark — one moment — rides to view — 
 On the tall billows, — with the thunder-cloud 
 Closing around, — above her, like a shroud. 
 
 He stood upon the reeling deck, — His form 
 
 Made visible — by the lightning, and His brow 
 Pale, and uncovered — to the rushing storm, 
 
 Told of a triumph — man — may never know, — 
 Power — underived — and mighty, — a Peace, — be still!" 
 
 The great waves — heard Him, — and the storm's loud tone 
 "Went moaning — into silence, — at His will; 
 
 And the thick clouds, — where yet the lightning shone, 
 And slept the latent thunder, rolled away 
 
 Until no trace of tempest — lurked behind, 
 
 Changing, — upon the pinions of the wind, 
 To stormless wanderers, — beautiful — and gay. 
 
 Dread Ruler — of the tempest! thou — before 
 
 Whose presence — boweth the uprisen storm, — 
 To whom the waves do homage — round the shore 
 
 Of many an island's empire ! — if the form

 Thy Infinite regard, — oh, breathe upon 
 The storm — and darkness — of man's soul — the same 
 Quiet — and peace — and humbleness which came 
 
 O'er the roused waters, where thy voice had gone, — 
 A minister of power, — to conquer — in thy name. 
 
 " STILL WITH THEE." Mks. H. B. Stowe. 
 
 Still, still with thee, when purple morning breaketh; 
 
 When the bird waketh and the shadows flee ; 
 Fairer than morning, lovelier than the daylight, 
 
 Dawns the sweet consciousness, / am with thee. 
 
 Alone with thee amid the mystic shadows, 
 
 The solemn hush of nature newly born ; 
 Alone with thee in breathless adoration, 
 
 In the calm dew and freshness of the morn. 
 
 As in the dawning, o'er the breathless ocean, 
 
 The image of the morning star doth rest, 
 So in this stillness thou beholdest only 
 
 Thine image in the waters of my breast.

 When sinks the soul, subdued by toil, to slumber, 
 Its closing eye looks up to thee in prayer; 
 
 Sweet the repose beneath thy wings o'ershading : 
 But sweeter still to wake, and find thee there. 
 
 So shall it be at last in that bright morning 
 When the soul waketh and life's shadows flee. 
 
 Oh, in that hour, fairer than daylight dawning,

 WHO BY SEARCHING CAN FIND OUT GOD ? E. Scuddee. 
 
 I can not find thee. Still on restless pinion 
 
 My spirit beats the void where thou dost dwell. 
 I wander lost through all thy vast dominion, 
 'And shrink beneath thy light ineffable. 
 
 I can not find thee. Even when most adoring, 
 Before thy throne I bend in lowliest prayer, 
 
 Beyond these bounds of thought my thought upsoaring, 
 From furthest quest comes back, — thou art not there. 
 
 Yet high above the limits of my seeing, 
 And folded far within the inmost heart, 
 
 And deep below the deeps of conscious being, 
 Thy splendor shineth : there, O God ! thou art. 
 
 I can not lose thee. Still in thee abiding, 
 The end is clear, how wide soe'er I roam; 
 
 The law that holds the worlds my steps is guiding, 
 And I must rest at last in thee, my home.

 "Room — for the leper! room!" And as he came 
 The cry passed on — "Room for the leper! room!' 1

 Who met him on his way, and let him pass. 
 And onward — through the open gate he came, 
 A leper, with the ashes — on his brow, 
 Sackcloth — about his loins, and on his lip 
 A covering, — stepping painfully — and slow, 
 And with a difficult utterance, like one 
 Whose heart — is with an iron nerve put down, 
 Crying, " Unclean! unclean!" 
 
 'T was now the first — 
 Of the Judean autumn, — and the leaves, 
 Whose shadows — lay so still — upon his path, 
 Had put their beauty forth — beneath the eye 
 Of Judah's loftiest noble. He was young 
 And eminently beautiful, — and life

 Mantled — in eloquent fullness — on his lip, 
 And sparkled — in his glance ; and in his mien- 
 There was a gracious pride — that every eye 
 Followed with benisons ; and this — was he! 
 With the soft airs of summer — there had come 
 A torpor on his frame, — which not the speed 
 Of his best barb, — nor music, — nor the blast 
 Of the bold huntsman's horn, — nor aught — that stirs 
 The spirit — to its bent, — might drive away. 
 The blood — beat not as wont — within his veins ; 
 Dimness — crept o'er his eye; a drowsy sloth 
 Fettered his limbs — like palsy, and his mien, 
 (With all its loftiness,) seemed struck with eld. 
 Even his voice was changed — a languid moan 
 Taking the place of the clear silver key; 
 And brain — and sense grew faint, as if the light — 
 And very air — were steeped in sluggishness. 
 He strove with it — a while, as manhood — will, 
 Ever too proud — for weakness, — till the rein — 
 Slackened within his grasp, and in its poise 
 The arrowy jereed, — like an aspen, — shook. 
 Day — after day — he lay — as if asleep : ^ 
 
 His skin — grew dry — and bloodless, and white scales, 
 (Circled with livid purple,) — covered him, 
 — And Helon — was a leper ! 
 
 It was noon, 
 
 And Helon knelt — beside a stagnant pool — 
 
 In the lone wilderness, — and bathed his brow, 
 
 Hot with the burning leprosy, — and touched 
 
 The loathsome water — to his fevered lips, 
 
 Praying — that he might be so blest — to die! 
 
 Footsteps approached, — and, with no strength to flee, — 
 
 He drew the covering — closer on his lip, 
 
 Crying, "Unclean! unclean!" and in the folds 
 
 Of the coarse sackcloth — shrouding up his face, 
 
 He fell upon the earth — till they should pass. 
 
 Nearer — the Stranger came, — and — bending o'er 
 
 The leper's prostrate form, — pronounced his name —

 Of a rich instrument — most strangely sweet; 
 
 And the dull pulses of disease — awoke, 
 
 And — for a moment — beat beneath the hot 
 
 And leprous scales — with a restoring thrill. 
 
 " Helon ! arise ! " and he forgot his curse, — 
 
 And rose — and stood before Him. 
 
 He looked on Helon — earnestly — a while, — 
 
 As if his heart were moved, — and — (stooping down) 
 
 He took a little water in his hand,

 And laid it on his brow, — and said, — "Be clean !" 
 And lo ! the scales fell from him, — and his blood 
 Coursed with delicious coolness through his veins, 
 And his dry palms — grew moist, and on his brow — 
 The dewy softness of an infant's stole. 
 His leprosy — was cleansed, — and he fell down 
 Prostrate at Jesus' feet, — and worshiped him. 
 
 IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL. Addison. 
 
 It must be so, — Plato, thou reason est well! — 
 
 Else — whence the pleasing hope, — this fond desire, — 
 
 This longing — after immortality ? 
 
 Or whence — this secret dread, and inward horror, 
 
 Of falling into naught? Why — shrinks the soul 
 
 Back on herself, and startles — at destruction ? 
 
 } T is the divinity — that stirs within us ; 
 
 'T is Heaven itself — that points out a hereafter, 
 
 And intimates eternity — to man. 
 
 Eternity ! thou pleasing, dreadful thought 1 
 
 Through what variety — of untried being, 
 
 Through what new scenes— and changes — must we pass ? 
 
 The wide, — the unbounded prospect, lies before me; 
 
 But shadows, — clouds, — and darkness — rest upon it. 
 
 Here — will I hold. If there 's a power above us, 
 
 (And that there is, all nature cries aloud 
 
 Through all her works,) He — must delight in virtue; 
 
 And that — which He delights in must be happy. 
 
 But when? or where? This world — was made for Ccesar. 
 
 I 'm weary of conjectures. This — must end them. 
 
 [Laying his hand on his sword.] 
 
 Thus — am I doubly armed : — my death — and life, 
 
 My bane — and antidote — are both before me ; — 
 
 This — in a moment — brings me to an end; 
 
 But this — informs me — I shall never die. 
 
 The soul, {secured in her existence,) smiles 
 
 At the drawn dagger, and defies its point. 
 
 The stars — shall fade away, the sun himself 
 
 Grow dim — with age, and nature — sink in years; 
 
 But thou — shalt flourish — in immortal youth, 
 
 Unhurt — amidst the wars of elements, 
 
 The wrecks — of matter — and the crush — of worlds.

 CHAPTER XIX. 
 
 Gesture and Deportment — Arbitrary Kules — Pantomime — Necessity 
 of Gesture — Faults of Orators — Grace and Dignity — Study of 
 the Passions — Observations of Nature — Selections. 
 
 Gesture and deportment, or the position and movement of the body 
 and limbs, under the influence of changing mental condition, are so 
 multiform that we despair of doing them justice in a short essay ; nor 
 can we with any degree of accuracy give rules which will be a safe 
 guide, and by which persons may acquire graceful and at the same 
 time natural attitudes and movements of the body. 
 
 There have been elaborate directions given by authors, copiously 
 illustrated by engravings and characters, indicating the right and left, 
 up and down movements of the arms, etc., which may serve as a pos- 
 sible guide to students in avoiding angular and ungraceful gestures. 
 But the great defect has been in giving arbitrary rules without direct- 
 ing attention to the cause that prompts gesticulation, and without 
 defining the part it is to take in adding force and beauty to decla- 
 mation. 
 
 The strongly accented and emphatic force, and the great modu- 
 lating capacity of our language, gives us a range and copiousness 
 of expression that much lessens the need of the pantomimic action 
 of the limbs, figure, and face which other languages seem to require. 
 Yet deportment and gesture must be included as a part of delivery, 
 and certainly belongs to rhetorical expression. We moderns set too 
 small an estimate on their effective assistance in the pronunciations of 
 oratory, to which the ancient Greeks and Romans attached so much 
 importance. The rhetoricians of those days must have taught the 
 science of gesture as well as of vocality : indeed they were of divided 
 opinion which should take the preference in giving impressive effect. 
 Quintilian's saying is often quoted, that "it is not of so much mo- 
 ment what our compositions are as how they are pronounced ;" while 
 Cicero, Pericles, Demosthenes, Aristotle, and other renowned orators 
 were of the same opinion. 
 
 We must admit that if we were thrown among a race of people, 
 without any knowledge of their vernacular, the pantomimic language

 of the body and face would be the first thing we should resort to to 
 make ourselves understood. The methods of the Chinese, cited by- 
 Fowler in his "English Grammar," is an illustration of the expressive 
 power of this silent but powerful language. He says: "The absence 
 of an alphabet has deprived the Chinese of an important means of 
 preserving a uniformity of spoken language through any part of the 
 empire. A native of China would be altogether unintelligible speak- 
 ing his local patois at a distance of tw^o hundred miles from home ; 
 and yet, like Arabic figures in Europe, the written character is every 
 where the same throughout the whole of China, though in reading 
 and speaking the local pronunciation makes, in fact, separate lan- 
 guages. The Chinese prefer their mode of speaking to the mind 
 through the eye, by means of visible signs, as superior to spoken 
 words addressed to the ear. Indeed, so far do they carry their at- 
 tachment to this mode of communication, that it is not uncommon 
 there to see men conversing rapidly together by tracing characters in 
 the air." 
 
 We must agree therefore with the ancients that there is a power in 
 the proper use of gesture that should not be overlooked by the student 
 who expects to shine in the forum, in the pulpit, or on the stage. For 
 the law has not changed ; gesture is as necessary now as in the days of 
 Demosthenes. The sight as well as the ear needs instruction. It is 
 said that the man who can speak two languages with ease possesses the 
 power of two men. It is equally true that the person who can with 
 fluency and grace speak the two languages of speech and gesture 
 conveys in what he says the force of two men. Such a one truly 
 in earnest is a host in himself, and speaks with an authority that 
 carries its own conviction. Not so the untaught, uncertain speaker : 
 doubtfulness impedes his utterance; his weak, unexpressive move- 
 ments distress us, and awkward and untimely thrusts disgust us. 
 
 We admire the orator who stands up in full possession of himself 
 and his subject. He will require no such accessories as pulling at his 
 watch-chain to keep himself busy, or of resting his hands in his pock- 
 ets to hold himself up, or to fumble a paper to employ his fingers, or 
 take off and put on his spectacles every few minutes to see his own 
 ideas. Nor do we like to see the speaker who is unable to stand alone, 
 and supports his elbows on a desk ; nor one who tosses his body up and 
 down as though it were a spiral spring, elevated by the lightness and 
 depressed by the weight of his ideas. Neither do we fancy the rock- 
 ing to and fro from heel to toe, nor the standing like a wax figure with 
 both pedestals like perpendicular parallel lines, with arms to match.

 Nor is it pleasant to see the arms work with an angular jerk or straight 
 up and down movement, or flying off in such spasmodic efforts as sug- 
 gest internal wires and cog-wheels worked by crank. Nor should a 
 speaker come to the rostrum displaying his manner of cleaning his 
 nose; in appearance saying to his audience, "I am getting ready as 
 fast as possible ; " then crowd his handkerchief back into his pocket in 
 a business-like way, jerk his coat into place with his shoulders, which 
 says, "At last I am ready." All these are significant gestures, but not 
 relevant to the occasion nor respectful to the audience. 
 
 What then is gesture? It is the pathognomy of the passions, senti- 
 ments, and thoughts, or their mode of expressing themselves by panto- 
 mimic movements of the body, limbs, and face. This is its office, which 
 suggests all natural movements, and these can only be effective by per- 
 fectly expressing the passion or sentiment of which they are to be the 
 translators. There must be no "outdoing Termagant;" but "suit the 
 action to the word, the word to the action." Every emotion has its 
 own natural symbol. 
 
 If we wish to make gesture the graceful and dignified assistant to 
 declamation and acting, instead of a system of forced movements and 
 unexpressive motions or painful bodily contortions, we must become 
 close and critical observers of the mute manifestations of different 
 states and conditions of mind, and imitate them. Study persons when 
 under the excitement of combative and destructive passions ; see the 
 clenched hand, the forcible, straight-line movements of the arms, the 
 defensive, defiant position of the body, and the firm bracing of the feet ; 
 and the opposite manifestations of fear — the relaxed and shrinking 
 body, with hands thrown up, palms outward, and the fingers separated 
 and bent as if to w T ard off the danger. Closely akin to these are the 
 signs of horror, with the wild look of the eye. Again, observe the up- 
 lifted hands of devotion and reverence, pointing the upward tendencies 
 of those faculties ; and the broader and more flowing movements of the 
 arms under the excited imagination of the general poetical sentiments ; 
 the outstretched hand and downward palm of the benediction; in 
 love, the soft serenity of countenance, the languishing eyes and sweet- 
 ness of voice; the bright expectant look of hope; the poised and 
 winged appearance of flight ; the joyful clasping of the hands in real- 
 ized desire ; and the frowning brow and furtive and uneasy glances of 
 hatred and revenge. 
 
 These signs, given under the influence and excitement of the pas- 
 sions, are infallible indicators of the uses of gesture, and open to us 
 fully their importance in making declamation expressive and effective :

 and every one who intends to become an orator or an actor should 
 keep his eyes open to this the language of nature. 
 
 It may be argued that gesture should be spontaneous, and so it 
 should. It should be that spontaneity that comes from limbs and 
 muscles that have long been trained in obedience to ease and grace. 
 The speaker's tones of voice should not be uppermost in his mind 
 during the delivery of his oration ; but these must be obedient from 
 previous training to express every shade of thought which the subject 
 and occasion require. It must not be supposed that these matters 
 relate to declamation only; they should be studied with the idea 
 that the more perfectly we express ourselves the better instructors 
 we become, and the greater our influence in the world. A life of 
 noble purposes, ably and artistically given to the world, is a blessing 
 to mankind. We glorify our Maker by the best use of the faculties 
 he has given us for the elevation of ourselves and others. It is not 
 the simple shouting of his name which glorifies it. We should express 
 the beauty, variety, and greatness of his endowments by purest pur- 
 poses and noblest efforts. 
 
 SONG OF THE SHIRT. 
 
 With fingers weary and worn, 
 
 With eyelids heavy and red, 
 A woman sat, in unwomanly rags, 
 
 Plying her needle and thread. 
 Stitch! stitch! stitch! 
 
 In poverty, hunger, and dirt, 
 And still with a voice of dolorous pitch 
 
 She sang the "Song of the Shirt!" 
 
 " Work — work — work 
 
 "While the cock is crowing aloof! 
 And work — work — work 
 
 Till the stars shine through the roof! 
 It 's oh ! to be a slave 
 
 Along with the barbarous Turk, 
 Where woman has never a soul to save, 
 
 If this is Christian work. 
 
 Work — work — work 
 
 Till the brain begins to swim ; 
 Work — work — work 
 
 Till the eyes are heavy and dim ! 
 Seam and gusset and band, 
 
 Band and gusset and seam, 
 Till over the buttons I fall asleep 
 
 And sew them on in a dream !

 Work — work — work ! 
 
 My labor never flags ; 
 And what are its wages? A bed of straw, 
 
 A crust of bread — and rags ; 
 This shattered roof, and this naked floor — 
 
 A table — a broken chair — 
 And a wall so blank, my shadow I thank 
 
 For sometimes falling there ! 
 
 Work — work — work 
 
 From weary chime to chime ; 
 Work — work — work, 
 
 As prisoners work for crime ! 
 Band and gusset and seam, 
 
 Seam and gusset and band, 
 Till the heart is sick, and the brain benumbed, 
 
 As well as the weary hand. 
 
 Work — work — work 
 
 In the dull December light, 
 And work — work — work 
 
 When the weather is warm and bright ; 
 While underneath the eaves 
 
 The brooding swallows cling, 
 As if to show me their sunny backs, 
 
 And twit me with the spring. 
 
 Oh ! but to breathe the breath 
 
 Of the cowslip and primrose sweet — 
 With the sky above my head, 
 
 And the grass beneath my feet ! 
 For only one short hour 
 
 To feel as I used to feel, 
 Before I knew the woes of want 
 
 And the walk that costs a meal I 
 
 Oh ! but for one short hour — 
 
 A respite, however brief! 
 No blessed leisure for love or hope, 
 
 But only time for grief! 
 A little weeping would ease my heart, 
 
 But in their briny bed 
 My tears must stop, for every drop 
 
 Hinders needle and thread ! 
 
 O men with sisters dear! 
 
 O men with mothers and wives ! 
 It is not linen you 're wearing out, 
 
 But human creatures' lives ! 
 Stitch — stitch — stich, — 
 
 In poverty, hunger, and dirt, 
 Sewing at once with a double thread 
 
 A shroud as well as a shirt.

 But why do I talk of Death ? 
 
 That phantom of grisly bone, 
 I hardly fear his terrible shape, 
 
 It seems so like my own — 
 It seems so like my own 
 
 Because of the fasts I keep. 
 O God ! that bread should be so dear, 
 
 And flesh and blood so cheap!" 
 
 HAMLET'S ADVICE TO THE PLAYERS. Shakespeare. 
 
 Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, trippingly on the 
 tongue: but if you mouth it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the 
 /own-crier spoke my linos. Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, — 
 thus: but use all gently: for in the very torrent, — tempest, and (as I may say) 
 whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may 
 give it smoothness. Oh, it offends me to the soul to see a robustious periwig- 
 pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, — to very rags, to split the ears of the 
 groundlings; who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but inexplicable 
 dumb shows and noise: I would have such a fellow whipped for o'erdoing 
 Termagant; it out-herods Herod. Pray you, avoid it. Be not too tame 
 neither; but let your own discretion be your tutor: suit the action to the 
 word, the word to the action; with this special observance, that you o'erstep 
 not the modesty of nature ; for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of 
 playing, whose end, both at the first and now, was and is to hold, as 'twere, 
 the mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, 
 and the very age and body of the time his form and pressure. Now this, 
 overdone or come tardy off, though it make the unskillful laugh, can not but 
 make the judicious grieve; the censure of the which one must, in your allow- 
 ance, o'erweigh a ^hole theater of others. Oh, there be players that I have 
 seen play — and heard others praise, and that highly — not to speak it profanely, 
 that, neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait of Christian, pagan, 
 nor man, have so strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of nature's 
 journeymen had made men, and not made them well, they imitated humanity 
 so abominably. 
 
 MOONBEAMS. 
 Sitting in the dusky light, 
 Watching shadows of the night 
 Darkly fall o'er distant hill 
 While the world is calm and still, 
 Moonbeams come with fairy gleams, 
 Filling all my heart with dreams, 
 Lighting up the days by-gone, 
 Hallowing all the years to come. 
 
 Shimmering through the leaves so bright, 
 Dancing on the casement white, 
 Falling golden on the floor, 
 Beams of radiance round me pour;

 Golden glories glad the gloom, 
 Streams of gold light up the room ; 
 Ever dancing, ever gay, 
 Round me gentle moonbeams play, 
 
 Dancing joyous at my feet, 
 Weaving golden threads so sweet, 
 With dark fancies woof the night, 
 Giving glimmerings of the light 
 That will gild my future years, 
 Making rainbows of my tears. . 
 Then, all ye darker thoughts, away 
 While sweet moonbeams round me play. 
 
 FAIRY BELLS AND BRIDGES. 
 
 Brightly danced the shimmering moonlight over Oberon's fair isle, 
 Hallowing mountain, vale, and river with its mellow, lambent smile j 
 Peering through the moaning forest as it echoed Ocean's roar, 
 Flecking with a wild mosaic all its hidden mossy floor; 
 
 Not more lightly, 
 
 Not more brightly, 
 Than at midnight danced the fairies its bewildering mazes o'er. 
 
 Sweetly fell the tinkling music of their tiny tripping feet, 
 
 As they rose and fell so airily, in low, harmonious beat ; 
 
 And their gem-bespangled garments rustled in the giddy round, 
 
 Blithely whirling out their gladness on the moonlit forest ground; — 
 
 Far more cheerily, 
 
 Far more merrily, 
 Than upon Rinaldo's spirit fell the strange discordant sound ! 
 
 For he sought the lonely forest at the silent midnight hour, 
 That its passion-hushing stillness o'er his spirit might have power, — 
 For the maiden that he worshiped laughed his trembling love to scorn — 
 He was but an humble peasant — she a noble lady born ! 
 
 And the dancing 
 
 Sprites, advancing 
 In their merry whirl, seemed mocking every trembling hope forlorn. 
 
 Suddenly toward Rinaldo they approached in bright array, 
 Closed about the 'wildered lover, and began a dance more gay, 
 Singing blithely to the measure of their tiny tripping feet, 
 As they fell and rose so nimbly in their low harmonious beat ! 
 
 "We can see the lights and shadows play around the hapless lover — 
 We can build our fairy bridges so that love will soon pass over ; 
 We 've a curb and we ' ve a bridle that will fit the proudest maiden, 
 And we've golden bells to grace them — golden bells with true love laden. 
 Oh ! the fairies weave the meshes 
 Of the net which Cupid holds, 
 And the tiny bells they tinkle 
 Are the bait with which he trolls.

 While they throw their curb and bridle 
 
 Over all that he enfolds ! 
 
 Set the fairy bells to ringing ! 
 
 Cure the heart that pride is stinging t 
 
 Build a bridge the slighted lover 
 
 May unto his bride pass over!" 
 
 Oh, the ringing of the bells ! 
 
 How across the heart it swells ! 
 And Kinaldo's spirit dances at the ringing of the bells ; 
 
 Noble pride his heart is filling, 
 
 O'er his breast a joy distilling 
 With the ringing joyous music of the golden fairy bells I 
 
 Then a shaking 
 
 And a quaking, 
 
 Lo, the forest sod is breaking ! 
 And Corilla stands before him, at the ringing of the bells! 
 
 Oh, the ringing of the bells, 
 
 How across the heart it swells ! 
 And Corilla's spirit dances with the ringing of the bells ! 
 
 The scorn that curled her ruby lip — the pride that fired her eye, 
 The fairy-bells had brought them wings, and taught them how to fly; 
 And when the merry music ceased a smile beamed o'er her face, 
 Such as before Kinaldo's eye in vain had sought to trace; 
 
 Then a rustling 
 
 And a bustling, 
 And their ranks the fairies parted : 
 
 Then advancing 
 
 Gaily dancing, 
 Both Corilla and Rinaldo as from out a dream were started. 
 
 Lips had met — and each gay fairy 
 Shouted for the bridge, so airy ! 
 Lips had met — and bells were ringing, 
 And each elfin sprite was singing: 
 " We can crush the pride so hollow, 
 Making room for love to follow ! 
 We can build a bridge the lover 
 May unto his bride pass over ! " 
 
 THE HUMAN BRAIN. 
 
 What a strange thing is the human brain, the seat both of physical sensa- 
 tion and of spiritual perception ! Who shall say how intimately the two are 
 blended — how far their kingdoms are extended over each other! When we 
 reflect upon the fact that nothing is ever entirely forgotten — that although we 
 may not recall at our will the memory of what once was learned or known, 
 yet that every thought we once had is still stored away in those small, strange 
 chambers within our heads, it is enough to inspire us with awe at our own 
 being ; and still more, at the wonderful Power which fashioned us. Eecollec-

 tions of the past called back by the association of the perfume of a flower or a 
 strain of music; the memories which rush through the brain of the drowning 
 or the falling man, showing him every event of his life treasured up within 
 him; the ravings of the old Scotch servant, who talked Hebrew in her de- 
 lirium — all go to prove that nothing is ever wholly lost which once was ours. 
 How strange to think of these silent, unconscious inhabitants slumbering 
 within our brain, which may at any time start up in witness of past pain 
 and pleasure, error and good ! Space they can not occupy, for they are 
 multitudinous beyond expression, yet they are local. Spiritual they are, but 
 indefinitely connected with matter. They belong to us, and not to another. 
 They are in our heads, and not in our feet. What is it that thus chains the 
 material to the immaterial? Secrets hidden away in the keeping of God are 
 many of them mysteries, and vain is the attempt of science and philosophy 
 to expound them. Science may explain all laws of matter, but not the laws 
 of mind; they are of the impenetralia of the spiritual." 
 
 THE KATYDID. O. W. Holmes. 
 I love to hear thine earnest voice 
 
 Wherever thou art hid, 
 Thou testy little dogmatist, 
 
 Thou pretty Katydid! 
 Thou 'mindest me of gentlefolks, — 
 
 Old gentlefolks are they, — 
 Thou say'st an undisputed thing 
 
 In such a solemn way. 
 Thou art a female, Katydid ! 
 
 I know it by the trill 
 That quivers through thy piercing notes, 
 
 So petulant and shrill. 
 I think there is a knot of you 
 
 Beneath the hollow tree, 
 A knot of spinster Katydids; — 
 
 Do Katydids drink tea ? 
 Oh, tell me where did Katy live, 
 
 And what did Katy do ? 
 And was she very fair and young, 
 
 And yet so wicked too? 
 Did Katy love a naughty man, 
 
 Or kiss more cheeks than one ? 
 I warrant Katy did no more 
 
 Than many a Kate has done. 
 Dear me! I'll tell you all about 
 
 My fuss with little Jane 
 And Ann, with whom I used to walk 
 
 So often down the lane, 
 And all that tore their locks of black, 
 
 Or wet their eyes of blue, 
 Pray tell me, sweetest Katydid, 
 
 What did poor Katy do ?

 Ah no ! the living oak shall crash, 
 
 That stood for ages still, 
 The rock shall rend its mossy base, 
 
 And thunder down the hill, 
 Before the little Katydid 
 
 Shall add one word, to tell 
 The mystic story of the maid 
 
 Whose name she knows so well. 
 Peace to the ever-murmuring race ! 
 
 And when the latest one 
 Shall fold in death her feeble wings, 
 
 Beneath the autumn sun, 
 Then shall she raise her fainting voice, 
 
 And lift her drooping lid, 
 And then the child of future years 
 
 Shall learn what Katy did. 
 
 Manhood is disgraced by the consequences of neglected youth. Old age, 
 oppressed by cares that belonged to a former period, labors under a burden 
 not its own. At the close of life the dying man beholds with anguish that 
 his days are finishing, when his preparation for eternity is hardly commenced. 
 Such are the effects of a disorderly waste of time, through not attending to its 
 value. Every thing in the life of such persons is misplaced. Nothing is per- 
 formed aright, from not being performed in due season. 
 
 BEAUTY. De. Channing. 
 
 In looking at our nature we discover among its admirable endowments the 
 sense or perception of Beauty. We see the germ of this in every human being, 
 and there is no power which admits greater cultivation ; and why should it 
 not be cherished in all ? It deserves remark that the provision for this prin- 
 ciple is infinite in the universe. There is but a very minute portion of the crea- 
 tion which we can turn into food and clothes or gratification for the body ; but 
 the whole creation may be used to minister to the sense of beauty. Beauty is 
 an all-pervading presence. It unfolds in the numberless flowers of the spring; 
 it waves in the branches of the trees and the green blades of grass ; it haunts 
 the depths of the earth and sea, and gleams out in the hues of the shell and the 
 precious stone. And not only these minute objects, but the ocean, the moun- 
 tains, the clouds, the heaven, the stars, the rising and setting sun, all overflow 
 with beauty. The universe is its temple ; and those men who are alive to it 
 can not lift their eyes without feeling themselves encompassed with it on every 
 side. Now this beauty is so precious, the enjoyments it gives are so refined and 
 pure, so congenial with our tenderest and noblest feelings, and so akin to worship, 
 that it is painful to think of the multitude of men as living in the midst of it, 
 as if, instead of this fair earth and glorious sky, they were tenants of a dungeon. 
 An infinite joy is lost to the world by the want of culture of this spiritual endow- 
 ment. Suppose that I were to visit a cottage, and to see its walls lined with the 
 choicest pictures of Raphael, and every spare nook filled with statues of the most 
 exquisite workmanship, and that I were to learn that neither man, woman, nor 
 child ever cast an eye at these miracles of art, how should I feel their privation;

 how should I want to open their eyes and to help them to comprehend and feel 
 the loveliness and grandeur which in vain courted their notice! But every hus- 
 bandman is living in sight of the works of a diviner Artist; and how much 
 would his existence be elevated could he see the glory which shines forth in 
 their forms, hues, proportions, and moral expression ! I have spoken only of the 
 beauty of nature; but how much of this mysterious charm is found in the ele- 
 gant arts, and especially in literature ? The best books have most beauty. The 
 greatest truths are wronged if not linked with beauty, and they win their way 
 most surely and deeply into the soul when arrayed in this their natural and fit 
 attire. Now no man receives the true culture of a man in whom the sensibility 
 to the beautiful is not cherished ; and I know of no condition in life from which 
 it should be excluded. Of all luxuries this is the cheapest and most at hand ; 
 and it seems to me to be most important to those conditions where coarse labor 
 tends to give a grossness to the mind. From the diffusion of the sense of beauty 
 in ancient Greece, and of the taste for music in modern Germany, we learn that 
 the people at large may partake of refined gratifications which have hitherto 
 been thought to be necessarily restricted to a few. 
 
 MORNING IN SPRING. Geo. D. Prentice. 
 
 How sweet — the landscape ! Morning — twines 
 
 Her tresses round the brow of Day, 
 And bright mists — o'er the forest pines 
 
 Like happy spirits — float away 
 To revel — on the mountain's crown, 
 Whence the glad stream comes — shouting down 
 Through woods — and rocks — that hang on high, 
 Like clouds — against the deep-blue sky. 
 
 The woven sounds of bird — and stream 
 
 Are falling beautiful and deep 
 Upon the spirit like a dream 
 
 Of music — on the ear of sleep; 
 And sxoeetly — from the dewy bowers 
 Soft murmurs, — like the breath of flowers^ 
 Are winding — through the purple grove 
 And blending — with the notes of love. 
 
 A cloud — is on the sky above, 
 
 And calmly — o'er the young year's blue 
 'Tis coming — like a thing of love 
 
 To gladden — in the rising dew; 
 Its white waves — with the twilight blend, 
 And gentle spirits — seem to bend, 
 From its unrolling folds — to hear 
 The glad sounds — of our joyous sphere. 
 
 The lake, unruffled by the breeze, 
 
 Smiles in its sweet, unbroken rest, 
 As if 't were dreaming — of the trees 
 
 And blossoms — pictured on its — breast

 Its depths — are glowing bright — and fair, 
 And the deep skies — seem hollowed thore, 
 &o/rf-trembling — as they felt the thrill 
 Of music — echoed from the hill. 
 
 The living soul of beauty fills 
 
 The air — with glorious visions — bright, 
 They wander — o'er the far-off hills, — 
 
 And linger — in the clear blue light; 
 Off to the breathing heavens they go, 
 Along the earth — they live — and glow, 
 Shed o'er the lake — their happy smiles, 
 And beckon — to the glittering isles. 
 
 Oh,— at this hour — when air and earth — 
 Gush out — with love — and joy and light, 
 
 And songs of gladness — hail the birth 
 Of all that 's beautiful — and bright, 
 
 Each pulse — beats high, each heart — is blown 
 
 To flame, the spirit — drinks the tone 
 
 Of higher worlds — and melts away 
 
 In visions — of eternal day. 
 
 LOCHIEL'S WARNING. Campbell. 
 
 "Wizard. Lochiel, — Lochiel ! beware of the day — 
 When the lowlands shall meet thee — in battle array! 
 For a field of the dead — rushes red on my sight, 
 And the clans of Culloden — are scattered in flight. 
 They rally, — they bleed — for their kingdom — and crown / 
 Woe, woe — to the riders — that trample them down I 
 Proud Cumberland prances, — insulting the slain, 
 And their hoof-beaten bosoms — are trod — to the plain/ 
 But hark ! through the fast flashing lightning of war, 
 What steed — to the desert — flies frantic — and far? 
 'Tis thine, — oh Glenullin ! whose bride — shall await, 
 Like a love-lighted watch-fire, all night — at the gate. 
 A steed — comes at morning ; no rider is there ; 
 But its bridle — is red — with the sign of despair. 
 Weep, — Albin! to death — and captivity led ! 
 Oh,weep ! but thy tears — can not number the dead. 
 For a merciless sword — on Culloden shall wave, 
 Culloden I that reeks — with the blood of the brave.

 Or, if gory Culloden — so dreadful appear, 
 Draw, — (dotard,) — around thy old wavering sight 
 This mantle — to cover — the phantoms — of flight.

 THE PRISONER OF CHILLON. Byron. 
 
 Eternal Spirit— of the chainless mind! 
 Brightest — in dungeons, liberty, thou art,

 The heart— which love of thee— alone can bind. 
 
 They chained us — each — to a column stone, 
 And we were three, — yet each — alone; — 
 "We could not move — a single pace, 
 "We could not see — each other's face, 
 But — with th&t pale — and livid — light 
 That made us strangers — in our sight. 
 And thus — together, — yet apart, 
 Fettered — in hand, but pined — in heart; 
 'T was still — some solace, in the dearth 
 Of the pure elements of earth, 
 To hearken — to each other's speech, 
 And each — turn comforter — to each, 
 With some new hope, or legend old ; 
 But even these — at length — grew cold.

 Because my mother's brow was given 
 
 To him, — with eyes — as blue — as heaven, 
 For him — my soul was sorely moved ; 
 
 For he was beautiful — as day, 
 
 And in his natural — spirit — gay; 
 
 With tears — for naught — but others' ills, 
 
 And then — they flowed like mountain rills, 
 
 Unless he could assuage the woe — 
 
 Which he abhorr'd— to view below.

 The other — was as pure — of mind, 
 But formed to combat — with his kind; 
 Strong — in his frame, and of a mood 
 Which — 'gainst the world — in war had stood, 
 And perished — in the foremost rank 
 
 With joy: — but not in chains — to pine; — 
 His spirit — withered — with their clank, — 
 
 I saw it silently — decline. 
 
 He loathed — and put away his food, — 
 It was not — that 't was coarse — and rude, 
 For we were used to hunter's fare, 
 And for the like — had little care ; 
 The milk — drawn from the mountain goat, 
 Was changed — for water — from the moat; 
 Our bread — was such as captive's tears 
 Have moistened — many a thousand years 
 Since man — first pent his /e^ow-men 
 Like brutes — within an iron den. 
 But what were these — to us — or him ? 
 These — wasted not his heart — or limb ; 
 My brother's soul — was of that mold, 
 Which in a palace — had grown cold 
 Had his free breathing — been denied 
 The range — of the steep mountain's side ; — 
 But why — delay — the truth ? — he died. 
 
 I saw, and could not hold his head, 
 Nor reach his dying hand, — nor dead, — 
 Though hard I strove, but strove in vain, 
 To rend — and gnash my bonds in twain. 
 He died, — and they unlocked his chain, 
 And scooped for him — a shallow grave, 
 Even from the cold earth — of our cave. 
 
 I begged them, as a boon, to lay 
 His corse — in dust — whereon the day 
 Might shine, — it was a foolish thought, — 
 But then — within my brain — it wrought 
 That even in death — his freeborn breast 
 In such a dungeon could not rest. 
 I might have spared my idle prayer, — . 
 They coldly laughed, — and laid him there; 
 The flat — and turfless earth — above 
 The being — we so much did love; — 
 His empty chain — above it leant, 
 Such murder's fitting monument. 
 
 But he, the favorite — and the flower, 
 Most cherished — since his natal hour,

 His martyred father's dearest thought, 
 My latest care, — for whom I sought 
 To hoard my life, that his might be 
 Less wretched — now, and one — d&y free; 
 He too was struck, and — day — by day 
 Was withered— on the stalk away. 
 
 God! it is & fearful thing — 
 To see the human soul take wing 
 In any shape, in any mood; — 
 I've seen it rushing forth in blood;

 Of sin — delirious — with its dread; — 
 
 But these — were horrors, — this — was woe — 
 Unmixed — with such, — but sure — and slow. 
 
 He faded, — and, so calm — and meek, 
 So softly worn, so sweetly weak, 
 So tearless, yet so tender, — kind, 
 And grieved — for those he left behind; 
 "With all the while — a cheek whose bloom 
 Was as a mockery — of the tomb, 
 Whose tints — as gently sunk away 
 As a departing rainbow's ray; 
 An eye — of most transparent light, 
 That almost made the dungeon — bright. 
 
 And then — the sighs — he would suppress — 
 
 Of fainting nature's feebleness; — 
 
 I listened, but I could not hear; 
 
 I called, for I was wild — with fear: — 
 
 I called, and thought — I heard a sound, — 
 
 I burst my chain — with one strong bound, 
 
 And rushed to -him : I found him not, 
 
 I — only — stirred — in this black spot, 
 
 I — only — lived, — / — only — drew 
 
 The accursed breath — of dungeon-dew, 
 
 The last, — the sole, — the dearest link 
 
 Between me — and the eternal brink, 
 
 Which bound me — to my failing race 
 
 Was broken — in this fatal place. 
 
 What next befell me — then — and there 
 
 I know not well, — I never knew; — 
 First — came the loss of light — and air, 
 
 And then — of darkness too. 
 There were no stars, — no earth, — no time,— 
 No check, — no change, — no good, — no crime, 
 But silence, — and a stirless breath — 
 Which neither was of life — nor death.

 A light — broke in upon my brain, — 
 
 It was the carol — of a bird; 
 It ceased, — and then — it came — again, 
 
 The sweetest song — ear ever heard; 
 And mine — was thankful — till my eyes 
 Ban over — with the glad surprise; 
 But then — by dull degrees — came back 
 My senses — to their wonted track; 
 I saw the dungeon walls — and floor 
 Close slowly round me — as before ; 
 I saw the glimmer — of the — sun, 
 Creeping — as it before had done ; 
 But through — the crevice — where it came — 
 That bird — was perched — as fond — and tae, 
 
 And tamer — than upon the tree, —

 And left me twice — so doubly lone.

 Along my cell, from side to side, 
 Avoiding only, as I trod,

 It was not therefrom to escape, 
 For I had buried one — and all 
 
 Who loved me — in a human shape,

 A wider prison unto me ; 
 But I was curious to ascend 
 To my barr'd icindows, and to bend —

 I saw their thousand years of snow — 
 On high, — their wide long lake — below; 
 And then — there was a little isle, 
 Which — in my very face did smile, 
 The only one — in view. 
 
 The fish swam by the castle wall, 
 And they seemed joyous, each — and all; 
 The eagle — rode the rising blast, — 
 Methought — he never flew so fast 
 As then — to me — he seemed to fly; 
 And then — new tears — came in my eye, 
 And I felt troubled, — and would fain 
 I had not left my recent chain ; 
 And when I did descend again, 
 The darkness — of my dim abode 
 Fell on me — as a heavy load; 
 It was — as is a new-dug grave 
 Closing o'er one — we sought to save. 
 
 At last — men came — to set us free, 
 
 I asked not why, and recked not where. 
 
 It was — at length — the same — to me, 
 
 Fettered — or fetterless — to be ; 
 I learned to love despair. 
 
 And thus, when they appeared — at last, 
 
 And all my bonds — aside were cast, 
 
 These heavy walls — to me — had grown 
 
 A hermitage, — and all — my own! 
 
 And half I felt — as they were come 
 
 To tear me — from a second home ! 
 
 "With spiders — I had friendship made, 
 And watched them — in their sullen frade, —

 And why should /—feel less than they ? 
 We were all inmates — of one place, 
 And I, the monarch — of each race, 
 Had power to kill, — yet, strange to tell ! 
 In quiet — we had learned to dwell ; 
 My very chains — and I — grew friends, 
 So much — a long communion — tends

 MUSIC. 
 
 Of music what shall be said? Some friend and enthusiast says: "Why, it 
 is sound and harmony that please the senses and stir up pleasant emotions ! " 
 But, my friend, hear Lady Eastlake: "It is a strange thing, the subtle form 
 and condition of music. When the composer has conceived it in his mind, 
 the music itself is not there; when he has committed it to paper, it is still not

 there; when he has called together his orchestra and choristers from north and 
 south, it is there — but gone again when they disperse. It has always, as it 
 were, to put on mortality afresh. It is ever being born anew, but to die away, 
 and leave only dead notes and dumb instruments behind." Is the exquisite 
 presence, then, easily definable? We believe both music and poetry are 
 spiritual essences which touch spiritual springs in our being, and that, though 
 we feel and appreciate them, they are too ethereal for outward sense, and must 
 forever be buried in the depths of emotion and sensation, only to be fully un- 
 derstood when this mind bursts its material bonds, and reaches up into the 
 world where poetry and music must be living, visible presences. With this 
 belief, have we not the evidence of the better life constantly within us? 
 
 MUSIC OF THE OCEAN. 
 
 "And the people of this place say that at certain seasons beautiful music is heard from 
 the ocean." — Mavor's Voyages, 
 
 Lonely — and wild — it rose, 
 That strain of solemn music — from the sea, 
 As though the bright air trembled — to disclose 
 An ocean mystery. 
 
 Again — a low, sweet tone, — 
 (Fainting — in murmurs — on the listening day,) 
 Just bade the excited thought — its presence own, — 
 
 Then — died away. 
 
 Once more — the gush of sound, — 
 [Struggling — and swelling — from the heaving plain,) 
 Thrilled a rich peal — triumphantly around, 
 
 And. fled again. 
 
 O boundless deep ! we know 
 Thou hast strange wonders — in thy gloom concealed, 
 Gems,— flashing gems, — from whose unearthly glow — 
 
 Sunlight — is sealed. 
 
 And an eternal spring — 
 Showers her rich colors — with unsparing hand, 
 Where coral trees — their graceful branches fling 
 
 O'er golden sand. 
 
 But tell, — O restless main! 
 Who— are the dwellers — in thy world beneath, 
 That thus — the watery realm — can not contain 
 
 The joy — they breathe ? 
 
 Emblem — of glorious might! 
 Are thy wild children — like thyself arrayed, 
 Strong — in immortal — and unchecked delight, 
 
 Which can not fade ? 
 
 Or — to mankind allied, 
 Toiling with woe — and passion's fiery sting, 
 Like their own homes, — where storms — or peace preside, 
 
 As the winds bring?

 MUSIC OF THE NIGHT. J. Neal. 
 
 There are harps that complain to the presence of night, 
 
 To the presence of night alone — 
 
 In a near and unchangeable tone — 
 Like winds full of sound that go whispering by, 
 As if some immortal had stooped from the sky, 
 
 And breathed out a blessing — and flown ! 
 
 Yes ! harps that complain to the breezes of night, 
 
 To the breezes of night alone ; 
 Growing fainter and fainter, as ruddy and bright 
 The sun rolls aloft in his drapery of light, 
 
 Like a conqueror, shaking his brilliant hair 
 
 And flourishing robe on the edge of the air ! 
 Burning crimson and gold 
 On the clouds that unfold, 
 Breaking onward in flame, while an ocean divides 
 On his right and his left ; — so the Thunderer rides 
 "When he cuts a bright path through the heaving tides, 
 
 Boiling on and erect in a charioting throne ! 
 
 Yes ! strings that lie still in the gushing of day, 
 
 That awake, all alive, to the breezes of night. 
 There are hautboys and flutes too forever at play 
 When the evening is near, and the sun is away, 
 
 Breathing out the still hymn of delight. 
 These strings by invisible fingers are played — 
 
 By spirits unseen and unknown, 
 But thick as the stars, all this music is made; 
 And these flutes alone, 
 In one sweet, dreamy tone, 
 Are ever blown 
 Forever and forever. 
 
 The livelong night ye hear the sound, 
 
 Like distant waters flowing round 
 
 In ringing caves, while heaven is sweet 
 
 With crowding tunes, like halls 
 
 Where fountain-music falls 
 
 And rival minstrels meet.

 VOCAL MUSIC. 
 
 In vocal music there is a union of music and language — the language of 
 affection and thought; which includes the whole man. Poetry and music are 
 sister arts; their relationship being one of heaven-like intimacy. The essence 
 of poetry consists in fine perceptions and vivid expressions of that subtle and 
 mysterious analogy that exists between the physical and moral world; and it 
 derives its power from the correspondence of natural things with spiritual. 
 Its effect is to elevate the thoughts and affections toward a higher state of 
 existence. 
 
 THE MUSIC OF CHILDHOOD. Jean Ingelow. 
 
 When I hear the waters fretting, 
 
 "When I see the chestnut letting 
 All her lovely blossoms falter down, I think, "Alas the day!" 
 
 Once, with magical sweet singing, 
 
 Blackbirds set the woodland ringing, 
 That wakes no more while April hours wear themselves away. 
 
 In our hearts fair hope lay smiling, 
 
 Sweet as air, and all beguiling: 
 And there hung a mist of blue-bells on the slope and down the dell: 
 
 And we talked of joy and splendor 
 
 That the years unborn would render, — 
 And the blackbirds helped us with the story, for they knew it well, 
 
 Piping, fluting, " Bees are humming, 
 
 April 's here and summer 's coming; 
 Do n't forget us when you walk, a man with men, in pride and joy. 
 
 Think on us in alleys shady 
 
 When you step a graceful lady ; 
 For no fairer days have we to hope for, little girl and boy. 
 
 "Laugh and play, O lisping waters, 
 
 Lull our downy sons and daughters ; 
 Come, O wind, and rock thy leafy cradle in thy wanderings coy; 
 
 When they wake, we '11 end the measure 
 
 With a wild sweet cry of pleasure, 
 And a ' Hey down derry, let 's be merry, little girl and boy.' " 
 
 A LADY SINGING. Paksons. 
 Oft as my lady sang for me 
 The song of the lost one that sleeps by the sea, 
 Of the grave on the rock and the cypress tree, 
 Strange was the pleasure that over me stole, 
 For 't was made of old sadness that lives in my soul. 
 
 So still grew my heart at each tender word 
 That the pulse in my bosom scarcely stirred, 
 And I hardly breathed, but only heard : 
 Where was I ? —Not in the world of men, 
 Until she awoke me with silence again.

 Like the smell of the vine in early bloom 
 Sprinkles the green lane with sunny perfume, 
 Such a delicate fragrance filled the room ; 
 Whether it came from the vine without, 
 Or arose from her presence, I dwell in doubt. 
 
 Light shadows played on the pictured wall 
 From the maples that fluttered outside the hall, 
 And hindered the daylight, — yet oh ! not all ; 
 Too little for that all the forest would be, — 
 Such a sunbeam she was and is to me! 
 
 "When my sense returned, as the song was o'er, 
 
 I fain would have said to her, " Sing it once more;" 
 
 But soon as she smiled my wish I forbore: 
 
 Music enough in her look I found, 
 
 And the hush of her lip seemed sweet as the sound.

 The Father spake ! A dream that had been lying, 
 Hushed from eternity — in silence there, 
 
 Heard the pure melody, — and low replying, 
 Grew to that music — in the wondering air. 
 
 Greio to that music; — slowly, grandly waking, 
 Till, bathed in beauty, it became — a world! 
 
 Led by his voice, its spheric pathway taking, 
 
 While glorious clouds — their wings — around it furled. 
 
 Nor yet — has ceased that sound, — his love revealing, 
 Though in response — a universe moves by! 
 
 Throughout eternity — its echo pealing, 
 
 World after world — awakes in glad reply ! 
 
 And wheresoever in his rich creation 
 
 Sweet music breathes, in wave, or earth, or soul, 
 
 'T is but t\ie faint and/ar reverberation 
 
 Of that great — time to which the planets — roll.

 A worthy knight, — (yclept — Sir Peter Pickle, 
 
 By love — was made to look exceeding glumpy;

 This said Sir Peter was,— (as you shall hear,)

 Or mouth— whose width — might shame — the Hoosie Tunnel ?

 Have warmed the bosom — of an anchorite, — 
 The charms — th't made our knight — all milk — and honey 
 Was — that infallible specific — money ! 
 
 Peter,— (whom want of brass — had made more brazen,) 
 In moving terms — began his love — to blazon; 
 Sigh — after sigh — in quick succession — rushes, — 
 
 Nor — are the labors of his lungs — in vain; 
 Her cheeks — soon crimson — with consenting blushes, — 
 
 Red — as the chimney-^ot — just after rain! 
 
 The license — bought, — he marries her — in haste, 
 
 Brings home — his bride, — and gives his friends — a gay day; 
 
 All his relations,— {wondering — at his taste,) 
 
 Yowed — he had better had — " The ^oi^-faced lady!" 
 
 Struck — with this monstrous heap — of woman-kind, 
 
 The thought — of — (money) never crossed their mind. 
 
 The dinner — o'er, — the ladies — and the bride — 
 
 Retired, — and wine — and chat — went round jocosely ; 
 
 Sir Peter's brother — took the knight aside, — 
 And questioned him — about the matter — closely.

 weep thy life away; but be up — and doing, and retrieve the loss — by new ener- 
 gies — and action. If an unfortunate bargain has deranged thy business, — do 
 not fold thy arms, — and give up all — as lost; but stir thyself — and work the 
 more vigorously. 
 
 If those — whom thou hast trusted — have betrayed thee, — do not be dis- 
 couraged, — do not idlyweej), — but "press on!" find others; or, what is better, —

 THE BIG SHOE. Mrs. A. D. T. Whitney. 
 
 " There was an old woman 
 
 Who lived in a shoe ; 
 She had so many children 
 
 She did n't know what to do. 
 To some she gave broth, 
 
 And to some she gave bread, 
 And some she whipped soundly, 
 
 And sent them to bed." 
 
 Do you find out the likeness ? 
 
 A portly old dame, — 
 The mother of millions, — 
 
 Brittania by name : 
 And, — howe'er it may strike you 
 
 In reading the song, — 
 Not stinted in space 
 
 For bestowing the throng, 
 Since the sun can himself 
 
 Hardly manage to go, 
 In a day and a night 
 
 From the heel to the toe. 
 
 On the arch of the instep 
 
 She builds up her throne, 
 And with seas rolling under, 
 
 She sits there — alone ; 
 With her heel at the foot 
 
 Of the Himmalehs planted, 
 And her toe in the icebergs, 
 
 Unchilled and undaunted. 
 
 Yet though justly of all 
 
 Her fine family proud, 
 'T is no light undertaking 
 
 To rule such a crowd ; 
 Not to mention the trouble 
 
 Of seeing them fed, — 
 And dispensing v?\th. justice 
 
 The broth — and the bread. 
 
 Some will seize upon one, — 
 
 Some are left with the other, — 
 And so the whole household 
 
 Gets into a pother. 
 But the rigid old dame 
 
 Has a summary way 
 Of her own when she finds 
 
 There is mischief to pay I

 She just takes up the — rod — 
 
 As she lays down the spoon, 
 And makes their rebellious backs 
 
 Tingle right soon. 
 Then she bids them, while yet 
 
 The sore smarting they feel, 
 To lie down, and go to sleep 
 
 Under her heel! 
 
 Only once was she posed, — 
 
 When the little boy — Sam, — 
 "Who had always before 
 
 Been as meek as a lamb, 
 Refused — to take tea 
 
 As his mother had bid, 
 And returned saucy answers 
 
 Because he was — chid. 
 
 Not content even then, 
 
 He cut loose from the throne, 
 And set about making 
 
 A shoe of his own ; 
 "Which suoceeded so well, 
 
 And was filled up so fast, 
 That the world in amazement 
 
 Confessed at the — last, — 
 Looking on at the work 
 
 With a gasp and a stare,— 
 That 't was hard to tell which 
 
 Would be best of the pair. 
 
 Side by side they are standing 
 
 Together to-day; 
 Side by side may they keep 
 
 Their strong foothold for aye !— 
 And beneath the broad sea, 
 
 Whose blue depths intervene, 
 May the finishing string 
 
 Lie unbroken between I

 Sam continued to sit on the large stone, meditating upon what was best to 
 be done, and revolving in his mind a plan for knocking at all the doors within 
 live miles of Bristol, taking them at a hundred and fifty or two hundred a day, 
 and endeavoring to find Miss Arabella by that expedient, when accident all of 
 a sudden threw in his way what he might have set ttiere for a twelvemonth — 
 and yet not found without it. 
 
 Into the lane where he sat opened three or four garden gates, belonging 
 to as many houses which, though detached from each other, were only sepa- 
 rated by their gardens. As these were large and long, and well planted with 
 trees, the houses were not only at some distance off, but the greater part of 
 them were nearly concealed from view. Sam was sitting with his eyes fixed 
 upon the dust-heap outside the next gate to that by which the groom had 
 disappeared, profoundly turning over in his mind the difficulties of his present 
 undertaking, when the gate opened, and a female servant came out into the 
 lane to shake some bed-side carpets. 
 
 Sam was very busy with his own thoughts, so that it is probable he would 
 have taken no more notice of the young woman than just raising his head and 
 remarking that she had a very neat and pretty figure, if his feelings of gal- 
 lantry had not been most strongly roused by observing that she had no one 
 to help her, and that the carpets seemed too heavy for her single strength. 
 Mr. Weller was a gentleman of great gallantry in his own way, and he no 
 sooner remarked this circumstance than he hastil}- rose from the large stone, 
 and advanced toward her. 
 
 "My dear," said Sam, sliding up with an air of great respect, "you' 11 spile 
 that wery pretty figure out o' all perportion if you shake them carpets by 
 yourself. Let me help you." 
 
 The young lady, who had been coyly affecting not to know that a gentle- 
 man was so near, turned round as Sam spoke — no doubt (indeed she said so 
 afterward) to decline this offer from a perfect stranger — when instead of 
 speaking, she started back, and uttered a half-suppressed scream. Sam was 
 scarcely less staggered, for in the countenance of the well-shaped female

 servant he beheld the very features of his Valentine — the pretty housemaid 
 from Mr. Nupkins's. 
 
 "Wy, Mary my dear! " said Sam. 
 
 " Lauk, Mr. Weller," said M*iry, "how you do frighten one!" 
 
 Sam made no verbal answer to this complaint, nor can we precisely say 
 what reply he did make. We merely know that after a short pause Mary said, 
 " Lor, do adun, Mr. Weller," and that his hat- had fallen off a few moments 
 before — from both of which tokens we should be disposed to infer that one 
 kiss, or more, had passed between the parties. 
 
 "Why, how did you come here?" said Mary, when the conversation, to 
 which this interruption had been offered, was resumed. 
 
 "C course I came to look arter you, my darlin," replied Mr. Weller; for 
 once permitting his passion to get the better of his veracity. 
 
 "And how did you know I was here?" inquired Mary. "Who could have 
 told you that I took another service at Ipswich, — and that they afterward 
 moved all the way here? Who could have told you that, Mr. Weller? " 
 
 "Ah, to be sure," said Sam, with a cunning look, "that's the pint. Who 
 could ha' told me?" 
 
 " It was n't Mr. Muzzle, was it? " inquired Mary. 
 
 " Oh, no," replied Sam, with a solemn shake of the head, " it war n't him." 
 
 "It must have been the cook," said Mary. 
 
 " O' course it must," said Sam. 
 
 "Well, I never heard the like of that?" exclaimed Mary. 
 
 "No more did I," said Sam. "But Mary, my dear — " here Sam's manners 
 grew extremely affectionate — " Mary, my dear, I 've got another affair in hand 
 as is wery pressin'. There 's one o' my governor's friends — Mr. Winkle — you 
 remember him." 
 
 "Him in the green coat?" said Mary. "Oh, yes, I remember him." 
 
 "Well," said Sam, "he's in a horrid state o' love; reg'larly comfoozled, 
 and done over vith it." 
 
 " Lor ! " interposed Mary. 
 
 "Yes," said Sam; "but that's nothin', if we could only find the young 
 'ooraan " — and here Sam, with many digressions upon the personal beauty 
 of Mary, and the unspeakable tortures he had experienced since he last saw 
 her, gave a faithful account of Mr. Winkle's present predicament. 
 
 "Well," said Mary, "I never did! " 
 
 "O' course not," said Sam, "and nobody never did, nor never vill neither; 
 and here am I a walkin' about like the wanderin' Jew — a sportin' character 
 you have perhaps heerd on, Mary, my dear, as wos always doin' a match agin' 
 time, and never vent to sleep — looking arter this Miss Arabella Allen." 
 
 "Miss who?" said Mary, in great astonishment. 
 
 "Miss Arabella Allen," said Sam. 
 
 " Goodness gracious ! " said Mary, pointing to the garden-door which the 
 sulky groom had locked after him. "Why it 's that very house ; she 's been 
 living there these six weeks. Their upper housemaid, which is lady's maid 
 too, told me all about it over the wash-house palins before the family was out 
 of bed, one mornin'." 
 
 "Wot, the wery next door to you?" said Sam. 
 
 " The very next," replied Mary.

 Mr. Weller was so deeply overcome at receiving this intelligence that he 
 found it absolutely necessary to cling to his fair informant for support, and 
 divers little love passages had passed between them before he was sufficiently 
 collected to return to the subject. 
 
 "Veil," said Sam at length, " if this do n't beat cock-fightin', nothin' never 
 vill, as the Lord Mayor said ven the chief secretary o' state proposed his 
 missis's health arter dinner. That wery next house ! Wy, I 've got a message 
 to her as I've been a tryin' all day to deliver." 
 
 "AK," said Mary; "but you can 't deliver it now, because she only walks in 
 the garden in the evening, and then only for a very little time; she never goes 
 out without the old lady." 
 
 Sam ruminated for a few moments, and finally hit upon the following plan 
 of operations : that he should return just at dusk — the time at which Arabella 
 invariably took her walk — and, being admitted by Mary into the garden of the 
 house to which she belonged, contrive to scramble up the wall, beneath the 
 overhanging boughs of a large pear-tree, which would effectually screen him 
 from observation ; there deliver his message, and arrange, if possible, an in- 
 terview on behalf of Mr. Winkle for the ensuing evening at the same hour. 
 Having made this arrangement with great dispatch, he assisted Mary in the 
 long-deferred occupation of shaking the carpets. 
 
 It is not half as innocent a thing as it looks, that shaking little pieces of 
 carpet — at least, there may be no great harm in the shaking, but the folding 
 is a very insidious process. So long as the shaking lasts, and the two parties 
 are kept the carpet's length apart, it is as innocent an amusement as can well 
 be devised, but when the folding begins, and the distance between them gets 
 gradually lessened from one half its former length to a quarter, and then to 
 an eighth, and then to a sixteenth, and then to a thirty-second if the carpet be 
 long enough, it becomes dangerous. We do not know to a nicety how many 
 pieces of carpet were folded in this instance, but we can venture to state that as 
 many pieces as there were, so many times did Sam kiss the pretty housemaid. 
 
 Mr. Weller regaled himself with moderation at the nearest tavern until 
 it was nearly dusk, and then returned to the lane without the thoroughfare. 
 Having been admitted into the garden by Mary, and having received from 
 that lady sundry admonitions concerning the safety of his limbs and neck, Sam 
 mounted into the pear-tree to wait until Arabella should come into sight. 
 
 He waited so long without this anxiously expected event occurring that he 
 began to think it was not going to take place at all, when he heard light foot- 
 steps upon the gravel, and immediately afterward beheld Arabella walking 
 pensively down the garden. As soon as she came nearly below the tree, Sam 
 began, by way of gently indicating his presence, to make sundry diabolical 
 noises, similar to those which would probably be natural to a person who had 
 been afflicted with a combination of inflammatory sore-throat, croup, and 
 hooping-cough from his earliest infancy. 
 
 Upon this the young lady cast a hurried glance toward the spot from 
 whence the dreadful sounds proceeded ; and her previous alarm being not at 
 all diminished when she saw a man among the branches, she would most 
 certainly have decamped, and alarmed the house, had not fear fortunately 
 deprived her of the power of moving, and caused her to sink down on a 
 garden-seat which happened by good luck to be near at hand.

 " She 's a goin off," soliloquized Sam, in great perplexity. "Wot a thing it 
 is. as these here young ereeturs will go a faintin' avay just ven they oughtn't 
 to. Here, young "oonian, Miss Sawbones, Mrs. Vinkle, don't. 
 
 Whether it was the magic of Mr. Winkle's name, or the coolness of the 
 open air, or some recollection of Mr. Weller's voice, that revived Arabella, 
 matters not. She raised her head, and languidly inquired — "Who 's that, and 
 what do you want?" 
 
 " Hush," said Sam, swinging himself on to the wall, and crouching there in 
 as small a compass as he could reduce himself to, " only me, Miss, only me." 
 
 " Mr. Pickwick's servant! " said Arabella, earnestly. 
 
 " The wery same, Miss," replied Sam. " Here 's Mr. Vinkle reg'larly sewed 
 up with desperation, Miss." 
 
 "Ah!" said Arabella, drawing nearer the wall. 
 
 "Ah, indeed," said Sam. "Ve thought ve should ha' been obliged to 
 straight-veskit him last night ; he 's been a ravin' all day, and he says if he 
 can 't see you afore to-morrow night 's over, he vishes he may be — somethin' 
 unpleasanted if he do n't drown hisself." 
 
 " Oh, no, no, Mr. Weller," said Arabella, clasping her hands. 
 
 " That 's wot he says, Miss," replied Sam, coolly. " He 's a man of his 
 word, and it 's my opinion he '11 do it, Miss. He 's heerd about you from the 
 Sawbones in barnacles." 
 
 " From my brother ! " said Arabella, having some faint recognition of Sam's 
 description. 
 
 "I don't rightly know which is your brother," replied Sam. "Is it the 
 dirtiest vun o' the two?" 
 
 " Yes, yes, Mr. Weller," returned Arabella, " go on. Make haste, pray." 
 
 "Yell, Miss," said Sam, "he's heerd all about it from him; and it 's the 
 gov'nor's opinion that if you do n't see him wery quick, the Sawbones as 
 we 've been a speakin' on 'ull get as much extra lead in his head as '11 rayther 
 damage the dewelopment o' the orgins if they ever put it in spirits artevards." 
 
 " Oh, what can I do to prevent these dreadful quarrels ! " exclaimed 
 Arabella. 
 
 " It 's the suspicion of a priory 'tachment as is the cause of it all," replied 
 Sam. "You 'd better see him, Miss." 
 
 "But how? — where?" cried Arabella. "I dare not leave the house. alone. 
 My brother is so unkind, so unreasonable. I know how strange my talking 
 thus to you must appear, Mr. Weller, but I am very, very unhappy — " and 
 here poor Arabella wept so bitterly that Sam grew chivalrous. 
 
 " It may seem wery strange talkin' to me about these here affairs, Miss," 
 said Sam, with great vehemence; "but all I can say is, that I'm not only 
 ready, but villin' to do anythin' as '11 make matters agreeable; and if chuckin' 
 either o' them Sawbones out o' winder 'ull do it, I 'm the man." As Sam 
 Weller said this, he tucked up his wristbands, at the imminent hazard of falling 
 off the wall in so doing, to intimate his readiness to set to work immediately. 
 
 Flattering as these professions of good feeling were, Arabella resolutely 
 declined (most unaccountably, as Sam thought) to avail herself of them. For 
 some time she strenuously refused to grant Mr. Winkle the interview Sam had 
 so pathetically requested ; but at length, when the conversation threatened to 
 be interrupted by the unwelcome arrival of a third party, she hurriedly gave

 him to understand, with many professions of gratitude, that it was barely- 
 possible she might be in the garden an hour later next evening. Sam under- 
 stood this perfectly well, and Arabella, bestowing upon him one of her sweetest 
 smiles, tripped gracefully away, leaving Mr. Weller in a state of very great 
 admiration of her charms, both personal and mental. 
 
 Having descended in safety from the wall, and not forgotten to devote a 
 few moments to his own particular business in the same department, Mr. 
 "Weller then made the best of his way back to the Bush, where his prolonged 
 absence had occasioned much speculation and some alarm. 
 
 "We must be careful," said Mr. Pickwick, after listening attentively to 
 Sam's tale, " not for our own sakes, but for that of the young lady. We must 
 be very cautious." 
 
 " We!" said Mr. Winkle, with marked emphasis. 
 
 Mr. Pickwick's momentary look of indignation at the tone of this remark 
 subsided into his characteristic expression of benevolence as he replied, 
 
 " We, sir ! I shall accompany you." 
 
 "You !" said Mr. Winkle. 
 
 "I" replied Mr. Pickwick mildly. "In affording you this interview the 
 young lady has taken a natural, perhaps, but still a very imprudent step. If 
 I am present at the meeting — a mutual friend, who is old enough to be the 
 father of both parties — the voice of calumny can never be raised against her 
 hereafter." 
 
 Mr. Pickwick's eyes lightened with honest exultation at his own foresight, 
 as he spoke thus. Mr. Winkle was touched at this little trait of his delicate 
 respect for the young protege of his friend, and took his hand with a feeling of 
 regard akin to veneration. 
 
 "You shall go," said Mr. Winkle. 
 
 "I will," said Mr. Pickwick. "Sam, have my great-coat and shawl ready, 
 and order a conveyance to be at the door to-morrow evening rather earlier 
 than is absolutely necessary, in order that we may be in good time." 
 
 Mr. Weller touched his hat as an earnest of his obedience, and withdrew to 
 make all needful preparations for the expedition. 
 
 The coach was punctual to the time appointed, and Mr. Weller, after duly 
 installing Mr. Pickwick and Mr. Winkle inside, took his seat on the box by 
 the driver. They alighted, as had been agreed on, about a quarter of a mile 
 from the place of rendezvous, and desiring the coachman to await their return 
 proceeded the remaining distance on foot. 
 
 It was at this stage of the undertaking that Mr. Pickwick, with many smiles 
 and various other indications of great self-satisfaction, produced from one of 
 his coat-pockets a dark lantern, with which he had specially provided himself 
 for the occasion, and the great mechanical beauty of which he proceeded to 
 explain to Mr. Winkle as they walked along, to the no small surprise of the 
 few stragglers they met. 
 
 " I should have been the better for something of this kind in my last garden 
 expedition at night, eh, Sam ? " said Mr. Pickwick, looking good-humoredly 
 round at his follower, who was trudging behind. 
 
 " Wery nice things if they're managed properly, sir," replied Mr. Weller; 
 "but if you do n't want to be seen I think they 're more useful arter the can- 
 dle 's gone out than ven it 's alight?" 
 


## p. 204 (#210) ############################################

204 MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 
 
 Mr. Pickwick appeared struck by Sam's remark, for he put the lantern into 
 his pocket again, and they walked on in silence. 
 
 " Down here, sir," said Sam. " Let me lead the vay. This is the lane, sir." 
 
 Down the lane they went, and dark enough it was. Mr. Pickwick brought 
 out the lantern once or twice as they groped their way along, and threw a very 
 brilliant little tunnel of light before them, about a foot in diameter. It was 
 very pretty to look at, but seemed to have the effect of rendering surrounding 
 objects rather darker than before. 
 
 At length they arrived at the large stone, and here Sam recommended his 
 master and Mr. Winkle to seat themselves, while he reconnoitred and ascer- 
 tained whether Mary was yet in waiting. 
 
 After an absence of five or ten minutes Sam returned to say that the gate 
 was opened, and all quiet. Following him with stealthy tread, Mr. Pickwick 
 and Mr. Winkle soon found themselves in the garden. Here every body said 
 u Hush ! " a good many times; and that being done no one seemed to have any 
 very distinct apprehension of what was to be done next. 
 
 " Is Miss Allen in the garden yet, Mary ? " inquired Mr. Winkle, much 
 agitated. 
 
 " I do n't know, sir," replied the pretty housemaid. " The best thing to be 
 done, sir, will be for Mr. Weller to give you a hoist up into the tree, and per? 
 haps Mr. Pickwick will have the goodness to see that mobody comes up the 
 lane, while I watch at the other end of the garden. Goodness gracious, what ! s 
 that?" 
 
 "That 'ere blessed lantern 'ill be the death on us all," exclaimed Sam, 
 peevishly. " Take care what you 're a doin' on, sir, you're a sendin' a blaze o' 
 light right into the back parlor vinder." 
 
 "Dear me!" said Mr. Pickwick, turning hastily aside, "I did'nt mean to 
 do that." 
 
 "Now it's in the next house, sir," remonstrated Sam. 
 
 " Bless my heart! " exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, turning round again. 
 
 "Now it's in the stable, and they'll think the place is afire," said Sam. 
 "Shut it up, sir, can 't you? " 
 
 " It 's the most extraordinary lantern I ever met with in all my life ! " 
 exclaimed Mr. Pickwick, greatly bewildered by the effects he had so uninten- 
 tionally produced. " I never saw such a powerful reflector." 
 
 "It'll be vun too powerful for us if you keep blazin' avay in that manner, 
 sir," replied Sam, as Mr. Pickwick, after various unsuccessful efforts, managed 
 to close the slide. "There's the young lady's footsteps. Now, Mr. Yinkle, 
 sir, up vith you." 
 
 "Stop, stop! " said Mr. Pickwick, "I must speak to her first. Help me up, 
 Sam." 
 
 " Gently, sir," said Sam, planting his head against the wall, and making a 
 platform of his back. "Step a top o' that 'ere flower-pot, sir. Now, then, up 
 vith you." 
 
 " I 'm afraid I shall hurt you, Sam," said Mr. Pickwick. 
 
 " Never mind me, sir," replied Sam. " Lend him a hand, Mr. Vinkle, sir. 
 Steady, sir, steady ; that 's the time o' day." 
 
 As Sam spoke, Mr. Pickwick, by exertions almost supernatural in a gentle- 
 man of his years and weight, contrived to get upon Sam's back; and Sam

 gently raising himself up, and Mr. Pickwick holding on fast by the top of the 
 wall, while Mr. Winkle clasped him tight by the legs, they contrived by these 
 means to bring his spectacles just above the level of the coping. 
 
 "My dear," said Mr. Pickwick, looking over the wall, and catching sight 
 of Arabella on the other side, "don't be frightened, my dear, 'tis only me." 
 
 "Oh, pray go away, Mr. Pickwick," said Arabella. "Tell them all to go 
 away, I am so dreadfully frightened. Dear, dear, Mr. Pickwick, do n't stop 
 there ; you '11 fall down and kill yourself, I know you will." 
 
 "Now, pray don't alarm yourself, my dear," said Mr. Pickwick, soothingly. 
 " There is not the least cause for fear, I assure you. Stand firm, Sam," said Mr. 
 Pickwick, looking down. 
 
 " All right, sir," replied Mr. Weller. " Do n't be longer than you can con- 
 weniently help, sir. You're rayther heavy." 
 
 " Only another moment, Sam," replied Mr. Pickwick. 
 
 " I merely wished you to know, my dear, that I should not have allowed my 
 young friend to see you in this clandestine way if the situation in which you 
 are placed had left him any alternative; and lest the impropriety of this step 
 should cause you any uneasiness, my love, it may be a satisfaction to you to 
 know that I am present; that's all, my dear." 
 
 " Indeed, Mr. Pickwick, I am very much obliged to you for your kindness 
 and consideration," replied Arabella, drying her tears with her handkerchief. 
 She would probably have said much more had not Mr. Pickwick's head disap- 
 peared with great swiftness, in consequence of a false step on Sam's shoulder, 
 which brought him suddenly to the ground. He was up again in an instant, 
 however, and bidding Mr. Winkle make haste and get the interview over, ran 
 out into the lane to keep watch with all the courage and ardor of a youth. 
 Mr. Winkle himself, inspired by the occasion, was on the wall in a moment, 
 merely pausing to request Sam to be careful of his master. 
 
 " I '11 take care on him, sir," replied Sam. " Leave him to me." 
 
 "Where is he? What's he doing, Sam?" inquired Mr. Winkle. 
 
 " Bless his old gaiters," rejoined Sam, looking out at the garden door, " he 's 
 a keepin' guard in the lane vith that 'ere dark lantern, like a amiable Guy 
 Pawkes. I never see such a fine creetur in my days. Bless'd if I do n't think 
 his heart must ha' been born five-and-twenty year arter his body, at least! " 
 
 Mr. Winkle stayed not to hear the encomium upon his friend. He had 
 dropped from the wall, thrown himself at Arabella's feet, and by this time was 
 pleading the sincerity of his passion with an eloquence worthy even of Mr. 
 Pickwick himself. 
 
 While these things were going on in the open air, an elderly gentleman of 
 scientific attainments was seated in his library, two or three houses off, writing 
 a philosophical treatise, and ever and anon moistening his clay and his labors 
 with a glass of claret from a venerable-looking bottle which stood by his side. 
 In the agonies of composition the elderly gentleman looked sometimes at the 
 carpet, sometimes at the ceiling, and sometimes at the wall; and when neither 
 carpet, ceiling, nor wall afforded the requisite degree of inspiration he looked 
 out of the window. 
 
 In one of these pauses of invention the scientific gentleman was gazing 
 abstractedly on the thick darkness outside, when he was very much surprised 
 by observing a most brilliant light glide through the air a short distance above

206 MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 
 
 the ground, and almost instantaneously vanish. After a short time the 
 phenomenon was repeated, not once or twice, but several times; at last the 
 scientific gentleman, laying down his pen, began to consider to what natural 
 causes these appearances were to be assigned. 
 
 They were not meteors ; they were too low. They were not glow-worms ; 
 they were too high. They were not will-o'-the-wisps; they were not fire-flies; 
 they were not fire-works. "What could they be? Some extraordinary and 
 wonderful phenomenon of nature, which no philosopher had ever seen before; 
 something which it had been reserved for him alone to discover, and which he 
 should immortalize his name by chronicling for the benefit of posterity. Full 
 of this idea, the scientific gentleman seized his pen again and committed to 
 paper sundry notes of these unparalleled appearances, with the date, day, hour, 
 minute, and precise second at which they were visible; all of which were to 
 form the data of a voluminous treatise of great research and deep learning, 
 which should astonish all the atmospherical wiseacres that ever drew breath in 
 any part of the civilized globe. 
 
 He drew himself back in his easy-chair, wrapt in contemplations of his 
 future greatness. The mysterious light appeared more brilliantly than before; 
 dancing, to all appearance, up and down the lane, crossing from side to side, and 
 moving in an orbit as eccentric as comets themselves. 
 
 The scientific gentleman was a bachelor. He had no wife to call in and 
 astonish, so he rang the bell for his servant. 
 
 "Pruffle," said the scientific gentleman, "there is something very extraor- 
 dinary in the air to-night. Did you see that?" said the . scientific gentleman, 
 pointing out of the window as the light again became visible. 
 
 " Yes, I did, sir." 
 
 "What do you think of it, Pruffle ? " 
 
 "Think of it, sir?" 
 
 "Yes. You have been bred up in the country. What should you say was 
 the cause of those lights now?" 
 
 The scientific gentleman smilingly anticipated Pruffle's reply that he could 
 assign no cause for them at all. Pruffle meditated. 
 
 " I should say it was thieves, sir," said Pruffle at length. 
 
 "You're a fool, and may go down stairs," said the scientific gentle- 
 man. 
 
 "Thank you, sir," said Pruffle. And down he went. 
 
 But the scientific gentleman could not rest under the idea of the ingenious 
 treatise he had projected being lost to the world, which must inevitably be the 
 case if the speculation of the ingenious Mr. Pruffle were not stifled in its 
 birth. He put on his hat and walked quickly down the garden, determined 
 to investigate the matter to the very bottom. 
 
 Now, shortly before the scientific gentleman walked out into the garden, 
 Mr. Pickwick had run down the lane as fast as he could, to convey a false 
 alarm that somebody was coming that way, occasionally drawing back the 
 slide of the dark lantern to keep himself from the ditch. The alarm was no 
 sooner given than Mr. Winkle scrambled back over the wall and Arabella 
 ran into the house ; the garden gate was shut, and the three adventurers were 
 making the best of their way down the lane, when they were startled by the 
 scientific gentleman unlocking his garden gate.

 u Hold hard," whispered Sara, who was of course first of the party. " Show 
 a light for just vun second, sir." 
 
 Mr. Pickwick did as he was desired, and Sam seeing a man's head peeping 
 out very cautiously, within half a yard of his own, gave it a gentle tap with 
 his clenched fist, which knocked it with a hollow sound against the gate. 
 Having performed this feat with great suddenness and dexterity, Mr. Weller 
 caught Mr. Pickwick up on his back, and followed Mr. Winkle down the lane 
 at a pace which, considering the burden he carried, was perfectly astonishing. 
 
 " Have you got your vind back agin, sir ? " inquired Sam, when they had 
 reached the end. 
 
 " Quite — quite now," replied Mr. Pickwick. 
 
 "Then come along, sir," said Sam, setting his master on his feet again. 
 " Come between us, sir. Not half a mile to run. Think you 're vinnin a cup, 
 sir. Now for it." 
 
 Thus encouraged, Mr. Pickwick made the very best use of his legs, and it 
 may be confidently stated that a pair of black gaiters never got over the 
 ground in a better style than did those of Mr. Pickwick on this memorable 
 occasion. 
 
 The coach was waiting, the horses were fresh, the roads were good, and the 
 driver was willing. The whole party arrived in safety at the Bush before Mr. 
 Pickwick had recovered his breath. 
 
 " In vith you at once, sir," said Sam, as he helped his master out. " Do n't 
 stop a second in the street arter that 'ere exercise. Beg your pardon, sir," 
 continued Sam, touching his hat as Mr. Winkle descended. "Hope there 
 war n't a priory 'tachment, sir." 
 
 Mr. Winkle grasped his humble friend by the hand and whispered in his 
 ear, "It's all right, Sam; quite right;" upon which Mr. Weller struck three 
 distinct blows upon his nose in token of intelligence; smiled, winked, and 
 proceeded to put the steps up with a countenance expressive of lively satisfac- 
 tion. As to the scientific gentleman, he demonstrated in a masterly treatise 
 that these wonderful lights were the effect of electricity, and clearly proved 
 the same by detailing how a flash of fire danced before his eyes when he put 
 his head out of the gate, and how he received a shock which stunned him for 
 a full quarter of an hour afterward; which demonstration delighted all the 
 scientific associations beyond measure, and caused him to be considered a light 
 of science ever afterward. 
 
 II.— TEMPEST. 
 
 I now approach an event in my life so indelible, so awful, so bound by an 
 infinite variety of ties to all that has preceded it in these pages, that from the 
 beginning of my narrative I have seen it growing larger and larger as I 
 advanced, like a great tower in a plain, and throwing its fore-cast shadow even 
 on the incidents of my childish days. 
 
 For years after it occurred I dreamed of it often. I have started up 
 so vividly impressed by it, that its fury has yet seemed raging in my quiet 
 room, in the still night. I dream of it sometimes, though at lengthened and 
 uncertain intervals, to this hour. I have an association between it and a 
 stormy wind, or the lightest mention of a sea-shore, as strong as any of which 
 my mind is conscious. As plainly as I behold what happened I will try

 to write it down. I do not recall it, but see it done; for it happens again 
 before me. 
 
 The time drawing on rapidly for the sailing of the emigrant-ship, my good 
 old nurse (almost broken-hearted for me, when we first met) came up to 
 London. I was constantly with her and her brother and the Micawbers 
 (they being very much together) ; but Emily I never saw. 
 
 One evening when the time was close at hand I was alone with Peggotty 
 and her brother. Our conversation turned on Ham. She described to us how 
 tenderly he had taken leave of her, and how manfully and quietly he had 
 borne himself. Most of all, of late, when she believed he was most tried. It 
 was a subject of which the affectionate creature never tired; and our interest 
 in hearing the many examples which she, who was so much with him, had to 
 relate was equal to hers in relating them. 
 
 My aunt and I were at that time vacating the two cottages at Highgate; 
 I intending to go abroad, and she to return to her house at Dover. We had 
 a temporary lodging in Covent Garden. As I walked home to it, after this 
 evening's conversation, reflecting on what had passed between Ham and 
 myself when I was last at Yarmouth, I wavered in the original purpose I 
 had formed, of leaving a letter for Emily when I should take leave of her 
 uncle on board the ship, and thought it would be better to write to her now. 
 She might desire, I thought, after receiving my communication, to send some 
 parting word by me to her unhappy lover. I ought to give her the oppor- 
 tunity. 
 
 I therefore sat down in my room, before going to bed, and wrote to her. 
 I told her that I had seen him, and that he had requested me to tell her what 
 I have already written in its place in these sheets. I faithfully repeated it. 
 I had no need to enlarge upon it,' if I had had the right. Its deep fidelity 
 and goodness were not to be adorned by me or any man. I left it out, to be 
 sent round in the morning ; with a line to Mr. Peggotty, requesting him to 
 give it to her; and went to bed at daybreak. 
 
 I was weaker than I knew then ; and, not falling asleep until the sun was 
 up, lay late, and unrefreshed, next day. I was roused by the silent presence 
 of my aunt at my bedside. I felt it in my sleep, as I suppose we all do feel 
 such things. 
 
 " Trot, my dear," she said, when I opened my eyes, " I could n't make up 
 my mind to disturb you. Mr. Peggotty is here; shall he come up?" I replied 
 yes, and he soon appeared. 
 
 "Mas'r Davy," he said, when we had shaken hands, "I giv Em'ly your 
 letter, sir, and she writ this heer; and begged of me fur to ask you to read it, 
 and if you see no hurt in 't, to be so kind as to take charge on 't." 
 
 "Have you read it?" said I. He nodded sorrowfully. I opened it, and 
 read as follows: 
 
 " I have got your message. Oh, what can I write to thank you for your 
 good and blessed kindness to me! 
 
 " I have put the words close to my heart. I shall keep them till I die. 
 They are sharp thorns, but they are such comfort. I have prayed over them, 
 oh, I have prayed so much. "When I find what you are, and what uncle is, I 
 think what God must be, and can cry to him. 
 
 "Good-bye forever. Now, my dear, my friend, good-bye forever in this

 world. In another world, if I am forgiven, I may wake a child and come to 
 you. All thanks and blessings. Farewell, evermore!" 
 
 This, blotted with tears, was the letter. 
 
 " May I tell her as you doe n't see no hurt in 't, and as you'll be so kind as 
 to take charge on ; t, Mas'r Davy ? " said Mr. Peggotty, when I had read it. 
 
 '• Unquestionably," said I; "but I am thinking — " 
 
 "Yes, Mas'r Davy?" 
 
 "I am thinking," said I, "that I'll go down again to Yarmouth. There's 
 time, and to spare, for me to' go and come back before the ship sails. My mind 
 is constantly running on him, in his solitude; to put this letter of her writing 
 in his hand at this time, and to enable you to tell her, in the moment of part- 
 ing, that he has got it, will be a kindness to both of them. I solemnly accepted 
 his commission, dear, good fellow, and can not discharge it too completely. 
 The journey is nothing to me. I am restless, and shall be better in motion. 
 I'll go down to-night." 
 
 Though he anxiously endeavored to dissuade me, I saw that he was of my 
 mind; and this, if I had required to be confirmed in my intention, would have 
 had the effect. He went round to the coach-office, at my request, and took the 
 box-seat for me on the mail. In the evening I started by that conveyance 
 down the road I had traversed under so many vicissitudes. 
 
 " Do n't you think that," I asked the coachman, in the first stage out of 
 London, " a very remarkable sky ? I do n't remember to have seen one like it." 
 
 "Nor I — not one equal to it," he replied. "That's wind, sir. There'll be 
 mischief done at sea, I. expect, before long." 
 
 It was a murky confusion — here and there blotted with a color like the color 
 of the smoke from damp fuel — of flying clouds, tossed up into most remarkable 
 heaps, suggesting greater heights in the clouds than there were depths below 
 them to the bottom of the deepest hollows in the earth, through which the 
 wild moon seemed to plunge headlong, as if, in a dread disturbance of the 
 laws of nature, she had lost her way and were frightened. There had been a 
 wind all day, and it was rising then with an extraordinary great sound. In 
 another hour it had much increased, and the sky was more overcast, and it 
 blew hard. But, as the night advanced, the clouds closing in and densely 
 overspreading the whole sky, then very dark, it came on to blow harder and 
 harder. It still increased, until our horses could scarcely face the wind. Many 
 times, in the dark part of the night (it was then late in September, when the 
 nights were not short), the leaders turned about or came to a dead stop ; and 
 we were often in serious apprehension that the coach w-ould be blown over. 
 Sweeping gusts of rain came up before this storm like showers of steel; and at 
 those times, when there was any shelter of trees or lee walls to be got, we 
 were fain to stop, in a sheer impossibility of continuing the struggle. 
 
 When the day broke it blew harder and harder. I had been in Yarmouth 
 when the seamen said it blew great guns, but I had never known the like of 
 this, or anything approaching to it. We came to Norwich — very late, having 
 had to fight every inch of ground since we were ten miles out of London — and 
 found a cluster of people in the market-place, who had risen from their beds in 
 the night, fearful of falling chimneys. Some of these, congregating about the 
 inn-yard while we changed horses, told us of great sheets of lead having been 
 ripped off a high church-tower and flung into a by-street, which they then

 blocked up. Others had to tell of country people coming in from neighboring 
 villages, who had seen great trees lying torn out of the earth, and whole ricks 
 scattered about the road? and fields. Still there was no abatement in the storm, 
 but it blew harder. 
 
 As we struggled on, nearer and nearer to the sea, from which this mighty 
 wind was blowing dead on shore, its force became more and more terrific. 
 Long before we saw the sea its spray was on our lips, and showered salt rain 
 upon us. The water was out over miles and miles of the flat country adjacent 
 to Yarmouth ; and every sheet and puddle lashed its banks, and had its stress 
 of little breakers setting heavily toward us. When we came within sight of 
 the sea the waves on the horizon, caught at intervals above the rolling abyss, 
 were like glimpses of another shore, with towers and buildings. "When at last 
 we got into the town the people came out to their doors all aslant and with 
 streaming hair, making a wonder of the mail that had come through such 
 a night. 
 
 I put up at the old inn, and went down to look at the sea; staggering along 
 the street, which was strewn with sand and seaweed and with flying blotches 
 of sea-foam; afraid of falling slates and tiles; and holding by people I met at 
 angry corners. Coming near the beach I saw not only the boatmen but half 
 the people of the town lurking behind buildings, some now and then braving 
 the fury of the storm to look away to sea, and blown sheer out of their course 
 in trying to get zigzag back. 
 
 Joining these groups I found bewailing women whose husbands were away 
 in herring or oyster boats, which there was too much reason to think might 
 have foundered before they could run in anywhere for safety. Grizzled old 
 sailors were among the people, shaking their heads as they looked from w T ater to 
 sky, and muttering to one another; ship-owners excited and uneasy; children 
 huddling together, and peering into older faces ; even stout mariners, disturbed 
 and anxious, leveling their glasses at the sea from behind places of shelter, as if 
 they were surveying an enemy. 
 
 The tremendous sea itself, when I could find suflicient pause to look at it, in 
 the agitation of the blinding wind, the flying stones and sand, and the awful 
 noise, confounded me. As the high watery walls came rolling in, and at their 
 highest tumbled into surf, they looked as if the least would engulf the town. 
 As the receding wave swept back with a hoarse roar it seemed to scoop out 
 deep caves in the beach, as if its purpose were to undermine the earth. "When 
 some white-headed billows thundered on, and dashed themselves to pieces 
 before they reached the land, every fragment of the late whole seemed possessed 
 by the full might of its wrath, rushing to be gathered to the composition of 
 another monster. Undulating hills were changed to valleys, undulating valleys 
 were lifted up to hills; masses of water shivered and shook the beach with a 
 booming sound ; every shape tumultously rolled on, as soon as made, to change 
 its shape and place, and beat another shape and place away; the ideal shore 
 on the horizon, with its towers and buildings, rose and fell; the clouds flew 
 fast and thick; I seemed to see a rending and upheaving of all nature. 
 
 Not finding Ham among the people whom this memorable wind — for it is 
 still remembered down there as the greatest ever known to blow upon that 
 coast — had brought together, I made my way to his house. It was shut; and 
 as no one answered to my knocking I went by back-ways and by-lanes to the

 yard where he worked. I learned there that he had gone to Lowestoft to meet 
 some sudden exigency of ship-repairing in which his skill was required, hut 
 that he would be back to-morrow morning in good time. 
 
 I went back to the inn, and when I had washed and dressed, and tried to 
 sleep, hut in vain, it was five o'clock in the afternoon. I had not sat five 
 minutes by the coffee-room fire when the waiter, coming to stir it as an excuse 
 for talking, told me that two colliers had gone down with all hands, a few 
 miles away, and that some other ships had been seen laboring hard in the 
 Koads, and trying, in great distress, to keep off-shore. Mercy on them and on 
 all poor sailors, said he, if we had another night like the last ! 
 
 I was very much depressed in spirits ; very solitary ; and felt an uneasiness 
 in Ham's not being there disproportionate to the occasion. I was seriously 
 affected, without knowing how much, by late events, and my long exposure to 
 the fierce wind had confused me. There was that jumble in my thoughts and 
 recollections that I had lost the clear arrangement of time and distance. Thus, 
 if I had gone out into the town, I should not have been surprised, I think, to 
 encounter some one who I knew must be then in London. So to speak, there 
 was in these respects a curious inattention in my mind. Yet it was busy too 
 with all the remembrances the place naturally awakened, and they were par- 
 ticularly distinct and vivid. In this state, the waiter's dismal intelligence 
 about the ships immediately connected itself, without any effort of my volition, 
 with my uneasiness about Ham. I was persuaded that I had an apprehension 
 of his returning from Lowestoft by sea and being lost. This grew so strong 
 with me that I resolved to go back to the yard before I took my dinner and ask 
 the boat-builder if he thought his attempting to return by sea at all likely ? 
 If he gave me the least reason to think so, I would go over to Lowestoft and 
 prevent it by bringing him with me. 
 
 I hastily ordered my dinner and went back to the yard. I was none too 
 soon, for the boat-builder, with a lantern in his hand, was locking the yard- 
 gate. He quite laughed when I asked him the question, and said there was no 
 fear; no man in his senses, or out of them, would put off in such a gale of 
 wind, least of all Ham Peggotty, who had been born to seafaring. 
 
 So sensible of this, beforehand, that I had really felt ashamed of doing 
 what I was nevertheless impelled to do, I went back to the inn. If such a 
 wind could rise I think 'it was rising. The howl and roar, the rattling of the 
 doors and windows, the rumbling in the chimneys, the apparent rocking of the 
 very house that sheltered me, and the prodigious tumult of the sea, were more 
 fearful than in the morning. But there was now a great darkness besides, and 
 that invested the storm with new terrors, real and fanciful. 
 
 I could not eat, I could not sit still, I could not continue steadfast to any 
 thing. Something within me, faintly answering to the storm without, tossed 
 up the depths of my memory, and made a tumult in them. Yet in all the 
 hurry of my thoughts — wild running with the thundering sea — the storm and 
 my uneasiness regarding Ham were always in the foreground. 
 
 My dinner went away almost untasted, and I tried to refresh myself with 
 a glass or two of wine. In vain. I fell into a dull slumber before the fire, 
 without losing my consciousness either of the uproar out of doors or of the 
 place in which I was. Both became overshadowed by a new and indefinable 
 horror, and when I awoke — or rather when I shook off the lethargy that

 bound me in my chair — my whole frame thrilled with objectless and unintelli- 
 gible fear. 
 
 I walked to and fro, tried to read an old gazetteer, listened to the awful 
 noises ; looked at faces, scenes, and figures in the fire. At length the steady 
 ticking of the undisturbed clock on the wall tormented me to that degree 
 that I resolved to go to bed. 
 
 It was re-assuring, on such a night, to be told that some of the inn-servants 
 had agreed together to sit up until morning. I went to bed exceedingly weary 
 and heavy, but on my lying down all such sensations vanished as if by magic, 
 and I was broad awake, with every sense refined. 
 
 For hours I lay there, listening to the wind and water; imagining now that 
 I heard shrieks out at sea ; now, that I distinctly heard the firing of signal 
 guns; and now, the fall of houses in the town. I got up several times and 
 looked out, but could see nothing except the reflection in the window-panes of 
 the faint candle I had left burning, and of my own haggard face looking in at 
 me from the black void. 
 
 At length my restlessness attained to such a pitch that I hurried on my 
 clothes and went down stairs. I remained there, I dare say, two hours. Once 
 I opened the yard-gate, and looked into the empty street. The sand, the sea- 
 weed, and the flakes of foam were driving by ; and I was obliged to call for as- 
 sistance before I could shut the gate again, and make it fast against the wind. 
 
 There was a dark gloom in my solitary chamber when I at length returned 
 to it ; but I was tired now, and getting into bed again, fell — off a tower and 
 down a precipice — into the depths of sleep. I have an impression that for a 
 long time, though I dreamed of being elsewhere and in a variety of scenes, it 
 was always blowing in my dream. At length I lost that feeble hold upon 
 reality, and was engaged with two dear friends, but who they were I do n't 
 know, at the siege of some town in a roar of cannonading. 
 
 The thunder of the cannon was so loud and incessant that I could not hear 
 something I much desired to hear, until I made a great exertion and awoke. 
 It was broad day — eight or nine o'clock; the storm raging, in lieu of the 
 batteries ; and some one knocking and calling at my door. 
 
 ,: What is the matter? " I cried. 
 
 "A wreck ! Close by ! " 
 
 I sprang out of bed, and asked what wreck? 
 
 "A schooner from Spain or Portugal, laden with fruit and wine. Make 
 haste, sir, if you want to see her ! It 's thought, down on the beach, she '11 go 
 to pieces every moment." 
 
 The excited voice went clamoring along the staircase; and I wrapped 
 myself in my clothes as quickly as I could and ran into the street. 
 
 Numbers of people were there before me, all running in one direction, to 
 the beach. I ran the same way, outstripping a good many, and soon came 
 facing the wild sea. 
 
 The wind might by this time have lulled a little, though not more sensibly 
 than if the cannonading I had dreamed of had been diminished by the 
 silencing of half-a-dozen guns out of hundreds. But the sea, having upon 
 it the additional agitation of the whole night, was infinitely more terrific than 
 when I had seen it last. Every appearance it had then presented bore the 
 expression of being swelled; and the height to which the breakers rose, and,

 looking over one another, bore one another down, and rolled in, in intermin- 
 able hosts, was most appalling. 
 
 In the difficulty of hearing anything but wind and waves, and in the 
 crowd, and the unspeakable confusion, and my first breathless efforts to stand 
 against the weather, I was so confused that I looked out to sea for the wreck, 
 and saw nothing but the foaming heads of the great waves. A half-dressed 
 boatman, standing next me, pointed with his bare arm (a tattooed arrow on it, 
 pointing in the same direction) to the left. Then, O great Heaven, I saw it, 
 close in upon us ! 
 
 One mast was broken short off, six or eight feet from the deck, and lay over 
 the side, entangled in a maze of sale and rigging ; and all that ruin, as the 
 ship rolled and beat — which she did without a moment's pause, and with a 
 violence quite inconceivable — beat the side as if it would stave it in. Some 
 efforts were even then being made to cut this portion of the wreck away; for, 
 as the ship, which was broadside on, turned toward us in her rolling, I plainly 
 descried her people at work with axes, especially one active figure with long 
 curling hair, conspicuous among the rest. But a great cry, which was audible 
 even above the wind and water, rose from the shore at this moment : the sea, 
 sweeping over the rolling wreck, made a clean breach, and carried men, spars, 
 casks, planks, bulwarks, heaps of such toys, into the boiling surge. 
 
 The second mast was yet standing, with the rags of a rent sail, and a wild 
 confusion of broken cordage flapping to and fro. The ship had struck once, 
 the same boatman hoarsely said in my ear, and then lifted in-and struck again. 
 I understood him to add that she was parting amidships, and I could readily 
 suppose so, for the rolling and beating were too tremendous for any human 
 work to suffer long. As he spoke there was another great cry of pity from 
 the beach; four men arose with the wreck out of the deep, clinging to the 
 rigging of the remaining mast; uppermost, the active figure with the curl- 
 ing hair. 
 
 There was a bell on board ; and as the ship rolled and dashed, like a des- 
 perate creature driven mad, now showing us the whole sweep of her deck, as 
 she turned on her beam-ends toward the shore, now nothing but her keel as she 
 sprung wildly over and turned toward the sea, the bell rang; and its sound, 
 the knell of those unhappy men, was borne toward us on the wind. Again 
 we lost her, and again she rose. Two men were gone. The agony on shore 
 increased. Men groaned, and clasped their hands ; women shrieked, and 
 turned away their faces. Some ran wildly up and down along the beach, 
 crying for help where no help could be. I found myself one of these, franti- 
 cally imploring a knot of sailors whom I knew not to let those two lost 
 creatures perish before our eyes. 
 
 They were making out to me, in an agitated way — I do n't know how, for 
 the little I could hear I was scarcely composed enough to understand — that the 
 life-boat had been bravely manned an hour ago, and could do nothing; and 
 that as no man would be so desperate as to attempt to wade off with a rope 
 and establish a communication with the shore, there was nothing left to try; 
 when I noticed that some new sensation moved the people on the beach, and 
 saw them part, and Ham come breaking through them to the front. 
 
 I ran to him — as well as I know, to repeat my appeal for help. But, dis- 
 tracted though I was by a sight so new to me and terrible, the determination

 in his face, and his look out to sea— exactly the same look as I remembered in 
 connection with the morning after Emily's flight— awoke me to a knowledge 
 of his danger. I held him hack with both arms; and implored the men with 
 whom I had been speaking not to listen to him, not to do murder, not to let 
 him stir from off that sand! 
 
 Another cry arose on shore; and looking to the wreck we saw the cruel 
 sail with blow on blow, beat off the lowest of the two men, and fly up in 
 triumph round the active figure left alone upon the mast. 
 
 Against such a sight, and against such determination as that of the calmly 
 desperate man who was already accustomed to lead half the people present, I 
 might as hopefully have entreated the wind. " Mas'r Davy," he said, cheerily 
 grasping me by both hands, "if my time is come, 'tis come. If 'tan't, I'll 
 bide it. Lord above bless you, and bless all! Mates, make me ready ! I'm 
 a going off ! " 
 
 I was swept aw r ay, but not unkindly, to some distance, where the people 
 around me made me stay; urging, as I confusedly perceived, that he was bent 
 on going, with help or without, and that I should endanger the precautions for 
 his safety by troubling those with whom they rested. I don't know what I 
 answered, or what they rejoined; but I saw hurry on the beach, and men 
 running with ropes from a capstan that was there, and penetrating into a 
 circle of figures that hid him from me. Then I saw him standing alone, in 
 a seaman's frock and trowsers; a rope in his hand, or slung to his wrist; 
 another round his body; and several of the best men holding, at a little 
 distance, to the latter, which he laid out himself, slack upon the shore, at 
 his feet. 
 
 The wreck, even to my unpracticed eye, was breaking up. I saw that she 
 was parting in the middle, and that the life of the solitary man upon the mast 
 hung by a thread. Still he clung to it. He had a singular red cap on, — not 
 like a sailor's cap, but of a finer color; and as the few yielding planks between 
 him and destruction rolled and bulged, and his anticipated death-knell rung, 
 he was seen by all of us to wave it. I saw him do it now, and thought I was 
 going distracted, when his action brought an old remembrance to my mind 
 of a once dear friend. 
 
 Ham watched the sea, standing alone, with the silence of suspended breath 
 behind him and the storm before, until there was a great retiring wave, when, 
 with a backward glance at those who held the rope which was made fast round 
 his body, he dashed in after it, and in a moment was buffeting with the water • 
 rising with the hills, falling with the valleys, lost beneath the foam; then 
 drawn again to land. They hauled in hastily. 
 
 He was hurt. I saw blood on his face, from where I stood; but he took 
 no thought of that. He seemed hurriedly to give them some directions for 
 leaving him m jre free — or so I judged from the motion of his arm — and was 
 gone as before. 
 
 And now he made for the wreck, rising with the hills, falling with the 
 valleys, lost beneath the rugged foam, borne in toward the shore, borne on 
 toward the ship, striving hard and valiantly. The distance was nothing, but 
 the power of the sea and wind made the strife deadly. At length he neared 
 the wreck. He was so near that with one more of his vigorous strokes he 
 would be clinging to it, — when a high, green, vast hill-side of water, moving

 on shoreward, from beyond the ship, he seemed to leap up into it with a 
 mighty bound, and the ship was gone ! 
 
 Some eddying fragments I saw in the sea, as if a mere cask had been 
 broken, in running to the spot where they were hauling in. Consternation 
 was in every face. They drew him to my very feet — insensible — dead. He 
 was carried to the nearest house; and, no one preventing me now, I remained 
 near him, busy, while every means of restoration were tried; but he had been 
 beaten to death by the great wave, and his generous heart was stilled forever. 
 
 As I sat beside the bed, when hope was abandoned and all was done, a 
 fisherman, who had known me when Emily and I were children, and ever 
 since, whispered my name at the door. 
 
 " Sir," said he, with tears starting to his weather-beaten face, which, with 
 his trembling lips, was ashy pale, "will you - come over yonder?" 
 
 The old remembrance that had been recalled to me was in his look. I 
 asked him, terror-stricken, leaning on the arm he held out to support me: 
 "Has a body come ashore?" He said, "Yes." "Do 1 know it?" I asked 
 then. He answered nothing. 
 
 But he led me to the shore. And on that part where she and I had looked 
 for shells, two children — on that part of it where some lighter fragments of 
 the old boat, blown down last night, had been scattered by the wind — among 
 the ruins of the home he had wronged — I saw him lying with his head upon 
 his arm, as I had often seen him lie at school. 
 
 No need, O Steerforth, to have said, when we last spoke together in that 
 hour which I so little deemed to be our parting-hour — no need to have said, 
 "Think of me at my best! " I had done that ever; and could I change now, 
 looking on this sight ! 
 
 They brought a hand-bier and laid him on it, and covered him with a flag, 
 and took him up and bore him on toward the houses. All the men who 
 carried him had known him, and gone sailing with him, and seen him merry 
 and bold. They carried him through the wild roar, a hush in the midst of all 
 the tumult; and took him to the cottage where Death was already. 
 
 But when they sat the bier down on the threshold they looked at one 
 another, and at me, and whispered. I knew why. They felt as if it were 
 not right to lay him down in the same quiet room. 
 
 The following exercise must be carefully studied with regard to 
 the various passions exhibited. It is not to be acted, but presented : 
 
 III.— THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF STEEKFOKTH'S DEATH. 
 
 The house was so still that I heard the girl's light step up stairs. On her 
 return she brought a message to the effect that Mrs. Steerforth was an invalid 
 and could not come down ; but that if I would excuse her being in her chamber, 
 she would be glad to see me. In a few moments I stood before her. 
 
 She was in his room ; not in her otvn. I felt of course that she had taken 
 to occupy it in remembrance of him; and that the many tokens of his old 
 sports and accomplishments, by which she was surrounded, remained there, 
 just as he had left them, for the same reason. She murmured, however, even 
 in her reception of me, that she was out of her own chamber because its aspect

 was unsuitod to her infirmity; and with her stately look repelled the least 
 suspicion of the truth. 
 
 At her chair, as usual, was Rosa Dartle. From the first moment of her dark 
 eyes resting on me I saw she knew I was the bearer of evil tidings. The scar 
 sprung into view that instant. She withdrew herself a step behind the chair 
 to keep her own face out of Mrs. Steerforth's observation; and scrutinized me 
 with a piercing gaze that never faltered, never shrunk. 
 
 M I am sorry to observe you are in mourning, sir," said Mrs. Steerforth. 
 
 " I am unhappily a widower," said I. 
 
 "You are very young to know so great a loss," she replied. " I am grieved 
 to hear it. I am grieved to hear it. I hope Time will be good to you." 
 
 " I hope Time," said I, looking at her, " will be good to all of us. Dear 
 Mrs. Steerforth, we must all trust to that in our heaviest misfortunes." 
 
 The earnestness of my manner and the tears in my eyes alarmed her. 
 The whole course of her thoughts appeared to stop and change. 
 
 I tried to command my voice in gently saying his name, but it trembled. 
 She repeated it to herself, two or three times, in a low tone. Then, addressing 
 me, she said, with enforced calmness : 
 
 *' My son is ill." 
 
 "Very ill." 
 
 "You have seen him ? " 
 
 " I have." 
 
 "Are you reconciled? " 
 
 1 could not say Yes, I could not say No. She slightly turned her head 
 toward the spot where Eosa Dartle had been standing at her elbow, and in 
 that moment I said, by the motion of my lips to Rosa — " Dead ! " 
 
 That Mrs. Steerforth might not be induced to look behind her, and read, 
 plainly written, what she was not yet prepared to know, I met her look 
 quickly; but I had seen Rosa Dartle throw her hands up in the air with 
 the vehemence of despair and horror, and then clasp them on her face. 
 
 The handsome lady — so like, oh, so like ! — regarded me with a fixed look, 
 and put her hand to her forehead. I besought her to be calm, and prepare 
 herself to bear what I had to tell ; but I should rather have entreated her to 
 weep, for she sat like a stone figure. 
 
 "When I was last here," I faltered, "Miss Dartle told me he was sailing 
 here and there. The night before last was a dreadful one at sea. If he were 
 at sea that night, and near a dangerous coast, as it is said he was; and if the 
 vessel that was seen should really be the ship which — " 
 
 " Rosa," said Mrs. Steerforth, " come to me ! " 
 
 She came, but with no sympathy or gentleness. Her eyes gleamed like 
 fire as she confronted his mother, and broke into a frightful laugh. 
 
 "Now," she said, "is your pride appeased, you madwoman? Now has he 
 made atonement to you with his life! Do you hear? — His life!" 
 
 Mrs. Steerforth, fallen back stiffly in her chair and making no sound but a 
 rnoan, cast her eyes upon her with a wide stare. 
 
 "Aye!" cried Rosa, smiting herself passionately on the breast, "look at 
 rnel Moan, and groan, and look at me! Look here!" striking the scar, "at 
 your dead child's handiwork ! " 
 
 The moan the mother uttered from time to time went to my heart. Always

 the same. Always inarticulate and stifled. Always accompanied with an inca- 
 pable motion of the head, hut with no change of face. Always proceeding 
 from a rigid mouth and closed teeth, as if the jaw were locked and the face 
 frozen up in pain. 
 
 " Do you remember when he did this ? " she proceeded. " Do you remember 
 when, in his inheritance of your nature, and in your pampering of his pride 
 and passion, he did this, and disfigured me for life? Look at me, marked 
 until I die with his high displeasure; and moan and groan for what you made 
 him ! " 
 
 "Miss Dartle," I entreated her. "For Heaven's sake — " 
 
 "I will speak," she said, turning on me with her lightning eyes. "Be 
 silent, you! Look at me, I say, proud mother of a proud, false — son! Moan 
 for your nurture of him, moan for your corruption of him, — moan for your 
 loss of him, — moan for mine ! " 
 
 She clenched her hand, and trembled through her spare, worn figure as 
 if her passion were killing her by inches. 
 
 "You, resent his self-will!" she exclaimed. You, injured by his haughty 
 temper! You, who opposed, — when your hair was gray, the qualities which 
 made both when you gave him birth ! You, who — from his cradle reared him 
 to be what he was, — and stunted — what he should have been! Are you re- 
 tvarded now for your years of trouble? " 
 
 " O Miss Dartle, shame ! O cruel ! " 
 
 "I tell you," she returned, "I will speak to her. No power on earth 
 should stop me ! Have I been silent all these years, and shall I not speak 
 now? /loved him better than you ever loved him! " turning on her fiercely. 
 " I could have loved him, — and asked no return. If I had been his wife, I could 
 have been the slave of his caprices for a word of love a year. I should have 
 been. Who knows it better than I ? You were exacting, proud, — punctilious, — 
 selfish. My love would have been devoted — would have trod your paltry 
 whimpering under foot ! " 
 
 "With flashing eyes, she stamped upon the ground as if she actually did it. 
 
 "Look here!" she said, striking the scar again, with a relentless hand. 
 ""When he grew into the better understanding of what he had done he saw it, 
 and repented of it ! I could sing to him, and talk to him, and show the 
 ardor that I felt in all he did, and attain with labor to such knowledge as 
 most interested him ; and I — attracted him. "When he was freshest and truest 
 he loved — me. Yes, he did! Many a time when you — were put ofl* with a 
 slight word he has taken Me to his heart ! " 
 
 She said it with a taunting pride in the midst of her frenzy — for it was 
 little less — yet with an eager remembrance of it, in which the smouldering 
 embers of a gentler feeling kindled for the moment. 
 
 " I descended — as I might have known I should — into a doll, a trifle for the 
 occupation of an idle hour, to be dropped, and taken up, and trifled with, as 
 the inconstant humor took him. "When he grew weary, / grew weary. As 
 his fancy died out, I would no more have tried to strengthen any power I had 
 than I would have married him on his being forced to take me for his wife. 
 We fell away from one another without a word. Perhaps you saw it, and 
 were not sorry. Since then I have been a mere disfigured piece of furniture 
 between you both; having no eyes, no ears, no feelings, no remembrances.

 Moan'.' Moan for what you made him; not for your love. I tell you that the 
 time was when / loved him better than you ever did!" 
 
 She stood with her bright angry eyes confronting the wide stare and the 
 set face; and softened no more when the moaning was repeated than if the 
 face had been a picture. 
 
 '•Miss Dartle," said I, "if you can be so obdurate as not to feel for this 
 Afflicted mother — " 
 
 "Who feels for me f " she sharply retorted. "She has sown this. Let her 
 moan for the harvest that she reaps to-day! " 
 
 "And if his faults—" I began. 
 
 "Faults!" she cried, bursting into passionate tears. "Who dares malign 
 him ? He had a soul worth millions of the friends to whom he stooped!'" 
 
 " No one can have loved him better, no one can hold him in dearer remem- 
 brance, than I," I replied. " I meant to say, if you have no compassion for 
 his afflicted mother; or if his faults — you have been bitter on them — " 
 
 " It 's false" she cried, tearing her black hair; " I loved him ! " 
 
 " — can not," I went on, " be banished from your remembrance in such an 
 hour, look at that figure, even as one you have never seen before, and render it 
 some help I 11 
 
 All this time the figure was unchanged, and looked unchangeable. Motion- 
 less, — rigid, — staring ; moaning in the same dumb way from time to time, with 
 the same helpless motion of the head; but giving no other sign of life. Miss 
 Dartle suddenly kneeled down before it and began to loosen the dress. 
 
 "A curse upon you!" she said, looking round at me, with a mingled ex- 
 pression of rage and grief. " It was in an evil hour that you ever came here! 
 A curse upon you ! Go ! " 
 
 After passing out of the room I hurried back to ring the bell, the sooner 
 to alarm the servants. She had then taken the impassive figure in her arms, 
 and, still upon her knees, was weeping over it, kissing it, calling to it, rocking 
 it to and fro upon her bosom like a child, and trying every tender means to 
 rouse the dormant senses. No longer afraid of leaving her, I noiselessly 
 turned back again ; and alarmed the house as I went out. 
 
 Later in the day I returned, and we laid him in his mother's room. She 
 was just the same, they told me; Miss Dartle never left her; doctors were in 
 attendance; many things had been tried; but she lay like a statue, except for 
 the low sound now and then. 
 
 I went through the dreary house and darkened the windows. The windows 
 of the chamber where he lay I darkened last. I lifted up the leaden hand 
 and held it to my heart ; and all the world seemed death — and silence, broken 
 only by his mother's moaning. 
 
 IV.— A SINGULAR COINCIDENCE. 
 
 The noise and bustle which ushered in the morning were sufficient to dispel 
 from the mind of the most romantic visionary in existence any associations but 
 those which were immediately connected with the rapidly-approaching election. 
 The heating of drums, the blowing of horns and trumpets, the shouting of men, 
 and tramping of horses echoed and re-echoed through the streets from the 
 earliest dawn of day, and an occasional fight between the light skirmishers of

 either party at once enlivened the preparations and agreeably diversified their 
 character. 
 
 " Well, Sam," said Mr. Pickwick, as his valet appeared at his bed-room door 
 just as he was concluding his toilet; "all alive to-day, I suppose?" 
 
 "Keg'lar game, sir," replied Mr. Weller; "our people "s a collecting down 
 at the Town Arms, and they're a hollering themselves hoarse already." 
 
 "Ah," said Mr. Pickwick, "do they seem devoted to their party, Sam?" 
 
 " Never see such dewotion in my life, sir." 
 
 "Energetic, eh?" said Mr. Pickwick. 
 
 " Uncommon," replied Sam ; " I never see men eat and drink so much 
 afore. I wonder they aint afeer'd o' bustin'." 
 
 "That 's the mistaken kindness of the gentry here," said Mr. Pickwick. 
 
 "Wery likely," replied Sam, briefly. 
 
 " Pine, fresh, hearty fellows they seem," said Mr. Pickwick, glancing from 
 the window. 
 
 " Wery fresh," replied Sam ; " me and the two waiters at the Peacock has 
 been a pumpin' over the independent woters as supped there last night." 
 
 " Pumping over independent voters ! " exclaimed Mr. Pickwick. 
 
 " Yes," said his attendant ; " every man slept vere he fell down; we dragged 
 'em out, one by one, this mornin' and put 'em under the pump, and they're in 
 reg'lar fine order now. Shillin' a head the committee paid for that 'ere job." 
 
 "Can such things be?" exclaimed the astonished Mr. Pickwick. 
 
 " Lord bless your heart, sir," said Sam; " why where was you half baptized? 
 That's nothin', that aint." 
 
 "Nothing?" said Mr, Pickwick. 
 
 "Nothin' at all, sir," replied his attendant. "The night afore the day o' 
 the last election here the opposite party bribed the bar-maid at the Town Arms 
 to hocus the brandy and water of fourteen unpolled electors as was a stoppin' 
 in the house." 
 
 "What do you mean by 'hocussing' brandy and water?" inquired Mr. 
 Pickwick. 
 
 " Puttin' laud'num in it," replied Sam. " Blessed if she did n't send 'em all 
 to sleep till twelve hours arter the election was over. They took one man up to 
 the booth in a truck, fast asleep, by way of experiment, but it was no go — 
 they wouldn't poll him; so they brought him back and put him to bed again." 
 
 " Strange practices, these," said Mr. Pickwick, half speaking to himself and 
 half addressing Sam. 
 
 " Not half so strange as a miraculous circumstance as happened to my own 
 father, at an election time, in this wery place, sir," replied Sam. 
 
 " What was that?" inquired Mr. Pickwick. 
 
 "Why, he drove a coach down here once," said Sam; "'lection time came 
 on, and he was engaged by vun party to bring down woters from London. 
 Night afore he was going to drive up, committee on t' other side sends for him 
 quietly, and away he goes vith the messenger, who shows him in — large room — 
 lots of gen'l'm'n — heaps of papers, pens and ink, and all that 'ere. 'Ah, Mr. 
 Waller,' says the gen'l'm'n in the chair, 'glad to see you, sir; how are you?' 
 'Wery well, thank 'ee, sir,' says my father; 'I hopeyow're pretty middlin',' 
 says he. 'Pretty well, thank 'ee, sir,' says the gen'l'm'n; 'sit down, Mr. Weller; 
 pray sit down, sir.' So my father sits down, and he and the gen'l'm'n looks

 wery hard at each other. 'You don't remember me?' says the gen'l'm'n. 
 'Can't say I do,' says my father. 'Oh, I know you,' says the gen'l'm'n; 
 'know d you ven you was a hoy,' says he. 'Well, I don't remember you,' says 
 my father. 'That's w cry odd,' says the gen'l'm'n. ' Wery,' says my father. 
 ' You must have a bad memory, Mr. Weller,' says the gen'l'm'n. ' Well, it 
 is a wery bad 'un,' says my father. 'I thought so,' says the gen'l'm'n. So 
 then they pours him out a glass o' wine, and gammons him about his driving, 
 and gets him into a reg'lar good humor, and at last shoves a twenty-pound 
 note in his hand. ' It 's a wery bad road between this and London,' says 
 the gen'l'm'n. 'Here and there it is a wery heavy road,' says my father. 
 ''Specially near the canal, I think,' says the gen'l'm'n. 'Nasty bit, that 'ere,' 
 says my father. 'Well, Mr. Weller,' says the gen'l'm'n, 'you 're a wery good 
 whip, and can do what you like with your horses, w T e know. We 're all wery 
 fond of you, Mr. Weller, so in case you should have an accident when you 're 
 a bringing these here woters down, and should tip 'em over into the canal with- 
 out hurtin' 'em, this is for yourself,' says he. 'Gen'l'm'n, you're wery kind,' 
 says my father, 'and I'll drink your health in another glass of wine,' says he; 
 vich he did, and then buttons up the money and bows himself out. You 
 wouldn't believe, sir," continued Sam, with a look of inexpressible impudence 
 at his master, " that on the wery day as be came down with them woters his 
 coach was upset on that 'ere wery spot, and ev'ry man on 'em was turned into 
 the canal." 
 
 " And got out again ? " inquired Mr. Pickwick, hastily. 
 
 " Why," replied Sam, very slowly, " I rather think that one old gentleman 
 was missin' ; I know his hat was found, but I aint quite certain whether his 
 head was in it or not. But what I look at is the hextraordinary and won- 
 derful coincidence, that arter what that gen'l'm'n said my father's coach 
 should be upset in that wery place on that wery day ! " 
 
 " It is, no doubt, a very extraordinary circumstance indeed," said Mr. 
 Pickwick. " But brush my hat, Sam, for I hear Mr. Winkle calling me to 
 breakfast." 
 
 With these words Mr. Pickwick descended to the parlor, where he found 
 breakfast laid, and the family already assembled. 
 
 V.-MK PICKWICK AND MBS. BABDELL. 
 
 To any one acquainted with the domestic economy of the establishment, 
 and conversant with the admirable regulation of Mr. Pickwick's mind, his 
 appearance and behavior on the morning previous to that which had been 
 fixed upon for the journey to Eatanswill would have been most mysterious and 
 unaccountable. He paced the room to and fro with hurried steps, popped his 
 head out of the window at intervals of about three minutes each, constantly 
 referred to his watch, and exhibited many other manifestations of impatience 
 very unusual with him. It was evident that something of great importance 
 was in contemplation, but what that something was not even Mrs. Bardell 
 herself had been enabled to discover. 
 
 " Mrs. Bardell," said Mr. Pickwick, as that amiable female approached the 
 termination of a prolonged dusting of the apartment. 
 
 " Sir," said Mrs. Bardell.

 "Tour little boy is a very long time gone." 
 
 " Why, it 's a good long way to the Borough, sir." 
 
 "Ah," said Mr. Pickwick, "very true; so it is." Mr. Pickwick relapsed 
 into silence, and Mrs. Bardell resumed her dusting. "Mrs. Bardell," said Mr. 
 Pickwick, at the expiration of a few minutes. 
 
 "Sir," said -Mrs. Bardell again. 
 
 " Do you think it 's a much greater expense to keep two people — than to 
 keep one? " 
 
 " La, Mr. Pickwick," said Mrs. Bardell, coloring up to the very border of 
 her cap, as she fancied she observed a species of matrimonial twinkle in the 
 eyes of her lodger. " La, Mr. Pickwick, what a question ! " 
 
 "Well, but do you?" 
 
 " That depends," said Mrs. Bardell, approaching the duster very near to 
 Mr. Pickwick's elbow, which was planted on the table, " that depends a good 
 deal upon the person, you know, Mr. Pickwick, and whether it's a saving and 
 careful person, sir." 
 
 "That's very true; but the person I have in my eye (here he looked very 
 hard at Mrs. Bardell) I think possesses these qualities, and has moreover a 
 considerable knowledge of the world, and a great deal of sharpness, Mrs. 
 Bardell, which may be of material use to me." 
 
 " La, Mr. Pickwick," said Mrs. Bardell, the crimson rising to her cap- 
 border again. 
 
 "I do indeed; and to tell you the truth, Mrs. Bardell, I have made up 
 my mind." 
 
 "Dear me, sir," exclaimed Mrs. Bardell. 
 
 "You'll think it not very strange now," said the amiable Mr. Pickwick, 
 with a good-humored glance at his companion, "that I never consulted you 
 about this matter, and never mentioned it till I sent your little boy out this 
 morning, eh?" 
 
 Mrs. Bardell could only reply by a look. She had long worshiped Mr. 
 Pickwick at a distance, but here she was, all at once, raised to a pinnacle to 
 which her wildest and most extravagant hopes had never dared to aspire. Mr. 
 Pickwick was going to propose — a deliberate plan too — sent her little boy to 
 the Borough to get him out of the way; how thoughtful — how considerate! 
 
 "Well," said Mr. Pickwick, "what do you think?" 
 
 "0 Mr. Pickwick," said Mrs. Bardell, trembling with agitation, "you're 
 very kind, sir." 
 
 " It '11 save you a good deal of trouble, won't it? " said Mr. Pickwick. 
 
 "Oh, I never thought any thing of the trouble, sir," replied Mrs. Bardell; 
 "and of course I should take more trouble to please you then than ever; 
 but it is so kind of you, Mr. Pickwick, to have so much consideration for my 
 loneliness." 
 
 " Ah, to be sure ; I never thought of that. When I am in town you '11 
 always have somebody to sit with you. To be sure, so you will." 
 
 " I 'm sure I ought to be a very happy woman." 
 
 " And your little boy," said Mr. Pickwick; "he too will have a companion, 
 a lively one, who '11 teach him, I '11 be bound, more tricks in a week than he 
 would ever learn in a year." And Mr. Pickwick smiled placidly. 
 
 "Oh, you dear — " said Mrs. Bardell.

 Mr. Pickwick started. 
 
 "Oh, you kind, good, playful dear," said Mrs. Bardell; and without more 
 ado she rose from her chair and flung her arms round Mr. Pickwick's neck, 
 with a cataract of tears and a chorus of sobs. 
 
 •• Bless my soul, - ' cried the astonished Mr. Pickwick; "Mrs. Bardell, my 
 good woman — dear me, what a situation— pray consider. Mrs. Bardell, do n't— 
 if any body should come — " 
 
 "Oh, let them come," exclaimed Mrs. Bardell frantically; "I '11 never leave 
 you, dear, kind, good soul;" and with these words Mrs. Bardell clung the 
 tighter. 
 
 ••Mercy upon me,'' said Mr. Pickwick, struggling violently, "I hear some- 
 body coming up the stairs. Do n't, do n't, there 's a good creature, do n't." 
 But entreaty and remonstrance were alike unavailing; for Mrs. Bardell had 
 fainted in Mr. Pickwick's arms; and before he could gain time to deposit her 
 on a chair Master Bardell entered the room, ushering in Mr. Tupman, Mr. 
 "Winkle, and Mr. Snodgrass. 
 
 Mr. Pickwick was struck motionless — and — speechless. He stood with his 
 lovely burden in his arms, gazing vacantly on the countenances of his friends, 
 without the slightest attempt at recognition — or explanation. They, in their 
 turn, stared at him ; and Master Bardell, in his turn, stared — at every body. 
 
 The astonishment of the Pickwickians was so absorbing, and the perplexity 
 of Mr. Pickwick was so extreme, that they might have remained in exactly 
 the same relative situations until the suspended animation of the lady was 
 restored had it not been for a most beautiful and touching expression of filial 
 affection on the part of her youthful son. Clad in a tight suit of corduroy, 
 spangled with brass buttons of a very considerable size, he at first stood at the 
 door astounded and uncertain ; but by degrees the impression that his mother 
 must have suffered some personal damage pervaded his partially developed 
 mind, and, considering Mr. Pickwick as the aggressor, he set up an appalling 
 and semi-earthly kind of howling, and butting forward with his head com- 
 menced assailing that immortal gentleman about the back and legs with such 
 blows and pinches as the strength of his arm and the violence of his excitement 
 allowed. 
 
 "Take this little villain away,'' said the agonized Mr. Pickwick; "he's 
 mad." 
 
 "AVhat is the matter? " said the three tongue-tied Pickwickians. 
 
 "I do n't know," replied Mr. Pickwick, pettishly. "Take away the boy — " 
 (here Mr. Winkle carried the interesting boy, screaming and struggling, to the 
 farther end of the apartment). — " Now help me to lead this woman down stairs." 
 
 "Oh, I am better now," said Mrs. Bardell, faintly. 
 
 " Let me lead you down stairs," said the ever-gallant Mr. Tupman. 
 
 " Thank you, sir — thank you ! " exclaimed Mrs. Bardell, hysterically. And 
 down stairs she was led accordingly, accompanied by her affectionate son. 
 
 " I can not conceive." said Mr. Pickwick, when his friend returned — "I 
 can not conceive — what has been the matter with that woman. I had merely 
 announced to her my intention of keeping a man-servant, when she fell into 
 the extraordinary paroxysm in which you found her. Very extraordinary 
 thing." 
 
 "Very" said his three friends.

 " Placed me in such an extremely awkward situation," continued Mr. 
 Pickwick. 
 
 '-Very ! M was the reply of his followers, as they coughed slightly, and 
 looked dubiously at each other. 
 
 This behavior was not lost upon Mr. Pickwick. He remarked their in- 
 credulity. They evidently suspected him. 
 
 •• There is a man in the passage now,' 7 said Mr. Tupman. 
 
 u It s the man that I spoke to you about," said Mr. Pickwick. " I sent 
 for him to the Borough this morning. Have the goodness to call him up, 
 Snodgrass." 
 
 Mr. Snodgrass did as he was desired; and Mr. Samuel Weller forthwith 
 presented himself. 
 
 With illustration simple, yet profound, and with unfaltering zeal, 
 He spake from a warm heart, and made even cold hearts feel; 
 This is eloquence; 'tis the intense, 
 
 Impassioned fervor of a mind, deep fraught 
 With native energy, when soul, and sense 
 
 Burst forth, embodied in the burning thought; 
 When look, emotion, tone, and all combine; 
 When the whole man is eloquent with mind; 
 A form that comes not to the call or quest, 
 But from the gifted soul, and the deep-feeling breast. 
 
 VI.— MAECO BOZZAKIS. Halleck. 
 
 At midnight, in his guarded tent, 
 
 The Turk was dreaming of the hour 
 When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent, 
 
 Should tremble at his power; 
 In dreams through camp and court he bore 
 The trophies of a conqueror; 
 
 In dreams his song of triumph heard: 
 Then wore his monarch's signet-ring; 
 Then pressed that monarch's throne, — a king; 
 As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing, 
 
 As Eden's garden bird. 
 
 At midnight, in the forest shades, 
 
 Bozzaris ranged his Suliote band, 
 True as the steel of their tried blades, 
 
 Heroes in heart and hand. 
 There had the Persian's thousands stood; 
 There had the glad earth drunk their blood 
 
 On old Platsea's day ; 
 And now there breathed that haunted air 
 The sons of sires who conquered there, 
 With arm to strike, and soul to dare, 
 
 As quick, as far as they.

 An hour passed on — the Turk awoke; 
 
 That bright dream was his last ; 
 He woke to hear his sentries shriek, 
 "To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek! 
 He woke to die midst flame, and smoke, 
 And shout, and groan, and saber-stroke, 
 
 And death-shots falling thick and fast 
 As lightnings from the mountain cloud; 
 And heard, with voice as trumpet loud, 
 
 Bozzaris cheer his band: 
 "Strike — till the last armed foe expires; 
 Strike — for your altars and your fires'; 
 Strike — for the green graves of your sires ; 
 
 God and your native land!" 
 
 They fought — like brave men, long and well; 
 
 They piled that ground with Moslem slain ; 
 They conquered — but Bozzaris fell, 
 
 Bleeding at every vein. 
 His few surviving comrades saw 
 His smile, when rang their proud huzza, 
 
 And the red field was won ; 
 Then saw in death his eyelids close 
 Calmly, as to a night's repose, 
 
 Like flowers at set of sun. 
 
 Come to the bridal-chamber, Death ! 
 
 Come to the mother when she feels 
 For the first time her first-born's breath; 
 
 Come when the blessed seals 
 That close the pestilence are broke, 
 And crowded cities wail its stroke ; 
 Come in consumption's ghastly form, 
 The earthquake's shock, the ocean's storm ; 
 Come when the heart beats high and warm 
 
 With banquet-song and dance and wine; 
 And thou art terrible ! The tear, 
 The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier, 
 And all we know or dream or fear 
 
 Of agony, are thine. 
 
 But to the hero, when his sword 
 
 Has won the battle for the free, 
 Thy voice sounds like a prophet's word; . 
 And in its hollow tones are heard 
 
 The thanks of millions yet to be. 
 Bozzaris ! with the storied brave 
 
 Greece nurtured in her glory's time, ■ 
 Rest thee — there is no prouder grave 
 
 Even in her own proud clime.

 VII.— POEMS UNWKITTEN. Mary H. C. Booth. 
 
 There are poems unwritten and songs unsung 
 Sweeter than any that ever were heard; 
 
 Poems — that wait for an angel tongue, 
 Songs— that but long for a paradise- bird. 
 
 Poems — that ripple through lowliest lives ; 
 
 Poems un worded and hidden away, 
 Down in the soul where the beautiful thrives 
 
 Sweetly as flowers in the airs of May. 
 
 Poems — that only the angels above us, 
 
 Looking down deep in our hearts, may behold ; 
 
 Felt, — though unseen, by the beings who love us, 
 "Written on lives as in letters of gold. 
 
 Sing to my soul the sweet song that thou lovest 
 Bead me the poem that never was penned, — 
 
 The wonderful idyl of life that thou givest 
 Fresh from thy spirit, O beautiful friend ! 
 
 VIII.— THE ANGEL POST. 
 
 I have nothing to say to you, dearest, — 
 
 Nothing that I can write, — 
 For all the word that I had to send 
 
 I sent by the post to-night. 
 
 Not in the form of a letter, 
 
 "With mark and stamp and seal, 
 Did I trust the tender message 
 
 That my soul had to reveal. 
 
 Not in a bunch of blossoms, 
 
 Not in a sweet bouquet, 
 Did I hide the beautiful meaning 
 
 Of the words I dared not say. 
 
 But I sent the sweet heart-music 
 
 No mortal on earth e'er wrote. 
 "What need that the soul's soft melodies 
 
 Be written down by note ? 
 
 So I have nothing to say to you, dearest, 
 
 But to send you my love at most. 
 And the news of my heart that I can not write 
 
 I send by the Angel Post.

 IX.— THE PAUPERS DEATH-BED. Mrs. Southey. 
 
 Tread so/%,— -bow the head,— 
 
 In reverent silence — bow ; — 
 No passing bell — doth toll, — 
 Yet — an immortal soul 
 
 Is passing — now. 
 Stranger! however great, 
 
 With lowly reverence bow; 
 There 's one in that poor shed, — 
 One — by that paltry bed, — 
 
 Greater — than thou. 
 Beneath that beggar's roof, 
 
 Lo! Death — doth keep his state; 
 Enter, — no crowds attend; — 
 Enter, — no guards defend 
 
 This palace gate. 
 That pavement, — damp — and cold, 
 
 No smiling courtiers tread; 
 One silent woman stands 
 Lifting with meager hands 
 
 A dying head. 
 No smiling voices sound ; 
 
 An infant — wail alone; 
 A sob suppressed ; — again 
 That short, deep gasp, and then 
 
 The parting groan I 
 O change! — wondrous — change! 
 
 Burst are the prison-bav^,— 
 This moment — there, so low, 
 So agonized, — and now — 
 
 Beyond the stars. 
 O change! stupendous change! — 
 
 There lies the soulless clod; 
 The sun eternal breaks, 
 The new immortal wakes, 
 
 Wakes — with his God. 
 
 X.— A SLIGHT MISTAKE. 
 
 A fresh gale from the north has sprung up, and carried us off the coast 
 of St. Mary's, where we are to land and take in water ; so I shall have time 
 to speak of one peculiarity of this people, which has been my study, more or 
 less, ever since I came on board. I find, on acquaintance, one redeeming trait, 
 which would go far to atone for many shortcomings, because it may finally 
 prepare the way to arrest and amend them. They are more devout in their 
 common life than any other people I have ever known. Do not infer from 
 this, O Hadgi Hassan, that they waste their time or spend their money in 
 pilgrimages to kiss the holy stone of the Kaaba, or perform its sacred walk. 
 And as to the nine ablutions, appearances do not indicate any very strict

 observances of this sort. But they have certain forms of worship, which they 
 use on almost all occasions. In their work and in their rest, and even in their 
 story-telling, they often call on God in the most earnest and vehement manner, 
 and also sometimes on their prophet. They frequently invoke curses on their 
 enemies; and this I can understand perfectly, for it is in strict accordance 
 with the word of the great Prophet, as written in the Holy Book. But when 
 I hear them pray God to curse themselves, and especially their own eyes, I am 
 perplexed. It may, however, he merely a form of penance or of self-sacrifice 
 which is in use amongst them. There is something in these ejaculations that 
 affects me strangely— I could almost say unpleasantly; yet I have the strongest 
 conviction of their sincerity. They have no particular form for these prayers, 
 neither is their worship confined to stated times. They do not welcome the 
 rising nor dismiss the setting sun with prayer and praise; but every man is 
 permitted to adopt his own forms and times for these exercises. I observe that 
 their ejaculations become more ardent when there is a great pressure of work- 
 but most especially when the work goes wrong. All this is certainly very 
 natural; for at such times we feel more need to call on Allah for his help 
 and guidance. I have also observed that the men moved with much greater 
 celerity while under their influence; Does not this show their sincerity? 
 
 I said that these people have no regular time for prayer ; but there may be 
 a slight mistake in this. A person called a Chaplain — which is, I suppose, a 
 kind of Marabout* — calls all the men together once a week, on the Sabbath 
 of their Prophet, and talks to them awhile. I believe they call these formalities 
 devotions; but they have none of the zeal and heartiness of the spontaneous 
 exercises ; and their gravity might very easily be mistaken for dullness, as both 
 speaker and hearers seem to feel. There is a sensible relief at the close, when I 
 observe they all get a good, long inspiration, and stretch themselves as if they 
 had felt contracted, or had not breathed freely under the imposed restraint. 
 
 1 observe that the Chaplain never makes use of any of these forms of social 
 prayer, which are in common use by every other man on board, from the 
 commodore down to the cabin-boy. He must either be less devout by nature 
 than they, or else he is jealous of a wide diffusion of the religious principle, 
 lest the foundations of his place should be undermined and his profession itself 
 destroyed. Their worship, being spontaneous, is more hearty and sincere; 
 and when they can pray so well for themselves he may reasonably fear that 
 they will hardly employ another to pray for them. I have observed too that 
 these ejaculations are seldom uttered, unless, as it were, from habit or by 
 chance, in the presence of the spiritual teacher. Are they conscious of tres- 
 passing on his rights, or afraid that he will vindicate his prerogative? 
 
 An unexpected opportunity for sending this occurs, and I hasten to improve 
 it. A respectable Arab traveler has just come on board, from an English ship 
 bound for Algiers. I inclose iii this package a volume of the writings of 
 Channing. He was a priest of Jesus, and, I am told, he did great good for 
 his people. His heart is large and deep as the ocean. It embraces the whole 
 race, recognizing the good of the lowest. You will find many an echo to our 
 own thoughts in these volumes. Let them be the companions of your most 
 sacred hours. Let them speak to you as your bosom friend! 
 
 * Priest.

 XI.— OUK FIELD. 
 
 The orator's field is the universe of mind and matter, and his subjects all 
 that is known of God and man. Study the principles of things, and never rest 
 satisfied with the results and applications. All distinguished speakers, whether 
 thev over paid any systematic attention to the principles of elocution or not, 
 in their most successful efforts conform to them; and their imperfections are 
 the results of deviations from these principles. Think correctly— rather than 
 finely; sound conclusions are much better than beautiful conceptions. Be useful 
 rather than showy; and speak to the purpose, or not speak at all. Persons 
 become eminent by the force of mind, — the power of thinking comprehensively, 
 deeply, closely, usefully. Rest more on the thought, feeling, and expression than 
 on any particular style; for language, is like the atmosphere — a medium of 
 vision, intended not to be seen itself, but to make other objects seen; the more 
 transparent, however, the better. 
 
 XII.— PROFANITY. E. H. Chapin. 
 
 You whose blood would boil to hear the venerable names of your earthly 
 parents hurled about in scoffs and jests, abuse without compunction and with- 
 out thought the name of your heavenly Father ! Finally,, profaneness is an 
 awful vice. Once more I ask, whose name is it you so lightly use? That 
 name of God — have you ever pondered its meaning? Have you ever thought 
 what it is that you mingle thus with your passion and your wit? It is the 
 name of Him whom the angels worship and whom the heaven of heavens can 
 not contain ! Profane man ! though habit be ever so stringent with you, when 
 the word of mockery and of blasphemy is about to leap from your lips think 
 of these considerations — think of God, and instead of that rude oath cry out 
 in reverent prayer, "Hallowed be thy name!" 
 
 XIII.— THE ROSE. 
 
 " Rose ! thou art the sweetest flower 
 That ever drank the amber shower ; 
 Rose ! thou art the fondest child 
 Of dimpled Spring, the wood-nymph wild ! " 
 
 The rose is mentioned by the earliest writers of antiquity as an object of 
 culture. Herodotus speaks of the double rose, and Solomon of the Rose of 
 Sharon and of the plantations of roses at Jericho. Theophrastus tells us that 
 the hundred-leaved rose grew in his time on Mount Pangaeus ; and it appears 
 that the Isle of Rhodes (Isle of Roses) received its name from the culture of 
 roses carried on there. Roses were more highly prized by the Romans than 
 any other flowers, and they had even attained to the luxury of forcing them. 
 Under the reign of Domitian the Egyptians thought of offering to that 
 emperor's courts, as a magnificent present, roses in the middle of winter; 
 but this the Romans smiled at, so abundant were roses in Rome at that 
 .season. "In every street," says Martial, "the odor of spring is breathed, and 
 garlands of flowers, freshly gathered, are displayed. Send us corn, Egyptians! 
 and we will send you roses." Roses were employed both by the Greeks and 
 Romans to decorate their tombs. Of the history of the rose from the time of the

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION. 229 
 
 Romans till the time of Tournefort, when botany became a science, very little 
 is known; but there can be no doubt that in the dark ages they were held in 
 esteem by all who could procure them. When Saladin took Jerusalem in 1128 
 he would not enter the mosque of the Temple — then converted to a church 
 by the Christians — till the walls had been thoroughly washed and purified with 
 rose-water. Voltaire says that after the taking of- Constantinople by Mahomet 
 II., in 1453, the church of St. Sophia was washed with rose-water in a similar 
 manner before it was converted into a mosque. 
 
 We read in the History of the Mogul Empire, by Father Catron, that the 
 celebrated Princess Nourmahal filled an entire canal with rose-water, upon 
 which she was in the habit of sailing along with the Great Mogul. The heat 
 of the sun disengaged the essential oil from the rose-water. This was observed 
 floating upon the surface of the water, and thus was made the discovery 
 of the essence, otto or ottar, of roses. Formerly it was the custom to carry 
 large vessels filled with rose-water to baptisms. Bayle relates, upon this 
 subject, that at the birth of Rousard his nurse, on the way to church, let him 
 fall upon a heap of flowers, and that at this instant the woman who held the 
 vessel of rose-water poured it upon the infant. Roses were often, in the days 
 of chivalry, worn by cavaliers at tournaments as an emblem of their devotion 
 to love and beauty. The rose has been a favorite subject with the poets of all 
 countries in all ages. It was dedicated by the Greeks to Aurora as an emblem 
 of youth, from its freshness and revivifying fragrance; to Venus as an emblem 
 of love and beauty, from the elegance of its flowers; and to Cupid as an 
 emblem of fugacity and danger, from the fleeting nature of its charms and 
 the wounds inflicted by its thorns. It was given by Cupid to Harpocrates, the 
 God of Silence, as a bribe to prevent him from betraying the amours of Venus, 
 and was hence adopted as the emblem of silence. The rose was for this reason 
 frequently sculptured on the ceilings of drinking and feasting-rooms as a 
 warning to the guests that what was said in moments of conviviality should 
 hot be repeated, from which what was intended to be kept secret was said to 
 be told "under the rose." The Greek poets say that the rose was originally 
 white, but that it was changed to red, according to some, from the blood of 
 Venus, who lacerated her feet with its thorns when rushing to the aid 
 of Adonis; and according to others, from the blood of Adonis himself. 
 
 The fragrance of the rose is said by the poets to be derived from nectar 
 thrown over it by Cupid, and its thorns to be the stings of the bees with which 
 the arc of his bow was strung. Anacreon makes their birth coeval with those 
 of Venus and Minerva: 
 
 " When then, in strange, eventful hour, 
 The earth produced an infant flower, 
 Which sprang with blushing tinctures drest 
 And wanton'd o'er its parent breast, 
 The gods beheld this brilliant birth, 
 And hail'd the rose — the boon of earth." 
 
 Another fable relating to the birth of the rose is that Flora, having found 
 the dead body of one of her favorite nymphs, whose beauty could only be 
 equaled by her virtue, implored the assistance of all the gods and goddesses 
 to aid her in changing it into a flower which all others should acknowledge 
 to be their queen. Apollo lent the vivifying power of his beams; Bacchus

 bathed it in nectar; Vortumnus gave its perfume; Pomona its fruits; and 
 Flora herself its diadem of flowers. Other mythological writers relate that 
 the beautiful Rhodante, Queen of Corinth, to escape the persecutions of her 
 lovers, attempted to seclude herself in the temple of Diana; but, being forced by 
 the clamor of the people from her sanctuary, prayed to the gods to change her 
 into a rose, which still bears the blushes that dyed her cheeks when forced to 
 expose herself to public gaze, and under which form she is still universally 
 admired. A beetle is often represented on antique gems as expiring sur- 
 rounded by roses; and this is supposed to be an emblem of a man enervated 
 by luxury, the beetle being said to have such an antipathy to roses that the 
 smell of them will cause its death. Pliny tells us that they garnished their 
 dishes with these flowers, and cites the custom of wearing garlands of them 
 at their feasts. Cleopatra received Antony, at one of her banquets, in an 
 apartment covered with rose-leaves to a considerable depth; and Antony him- 
 self when dying begged to have roses scattered on his tomb. 
 
 The Koman generals who had achieved any remarkable victory were per- 
 mitted to have roses sculptured on their shields. Rose-water was the favorite 
 perfume of the Roman ladies, and the most luxurious even used it in their baths. 
 The Turks believe that roses sprang from the perspiration of Mahomet, for 
 which reason they never tread upon a rose-leaf or suffer one to lie on the ground. 
 They also sculpture a rose on the tombstones of females who die unmarried. 
 In an old mosaic in the church of St. Susan, at Rome. Charlemagne is repre- 
 sented kneeling and receiving from St. Peter a standard covered with roses. 
 The custom of blessing the roses is still preserved in Rome, and the day on 
 which the ceremony is performed is called Dominica in Rosa. The seal of 
 Luther was a rose. In 530 St. Medard, Bishop of Noyon, instituted a festival 
 atSalency, his birth-place, for adjudging annually the prize of a crown of roses 
 to the girl who should be acknowledged by all her competitors to be the most 
 amiable, modest, and dutiful in the village; and he had the pleasure of crown- 
 ing his own sister as the first Rose Queen. This custom was continued to the 
 time of Madame de Genlis. In the middle ages the knights at a tournament 
 wore a rose embroidered on their sleeves, as an emblem that gentleness should 
 accompany courage, and that beauty was the reward of valor. The French 
 Parliament had formerly a day of ceremony called Baillee de Roses, because 
 great quantities of roses were distributed. Shakespeare, who no doubt fol- 
 lowed some old legend or chronicle, derives the assumption of the red and the 
 white roses by the rival houses of York and Lancaster from a quarrel in the 
 Temple Gardens between Richard Plantagenet, Duke of York, and the Earl 
 of Somerset, the partisan of Henry of Lancaster. Finding that their voices 
 were getting too loud, Plantagenet proposes that they shall 
 
 " In dumb significance proclaim their thoughts;" 
 adding, 
 
 " Let him who is a true-born gentleman 
 
 Anr] stands upon the honor of his birth, 
 
 If he supposes I have pleaded truth, 
 
 From off this briar pluck a white rose with me." 
 
 To which Somerset replies: t 
 
 ' Let him who is no coward nor no flatterer, 
 But dare maintain the party of the truth, 
 Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me."

 Their respective followers gathered the different-colored roses ; and hence 
 tradition says these flowers were adopted as the badges of the houses of York 
 and Lancaster during the civil wars which afterward desolated the country for 
 more than thirty years. The Eosa Alba is said to have been the one chosen 
 as the badge of the House of York and the Eosa Gallica as that of Lancaster. 
 The York and Lancaster rose, which, when it comes true, has one half of the 
 flower red and the other half white, was named in commemoration of the union 
 of the two houses by the marriage of Henry VII. with Elizabeth of York. 
 
 Among historical reminiscences of the rose is this charming allegory: A 
 Turkish poet, Abdulkadri, had the design of establishing himself at Babylon. 
 The Babylonians were unwilling to receive him ; but they dared not declare 
 it to him openly. To make him comprehend their thoughts they passed before 
 him with a vase filled with water, that he might understand that as the vase 
 was full nothing could be added to it ; also, their city was in the same manner 
 filled with poets and learned men until there was no room left for another. 
 Abdulkadri understood perfectly that enigma, and for his response he stooped, 
 picked up the leaf of a rose that was on the ground, placed it carefully on the 
 surface of the water in the vase, showing them that it kept its place without 
 causing the water to overflow, though the vase was full. That act appeared 
 so marvelous to the Babylonians that they regarded Abdulkadri as a man of 
 superior genius, and they conducted him in triumph to the city. 
 
 XIV.— THE BABOON AT HOME. 
 
 Captain Dayson had gone out one morning to see the sun rise in a very 
 beautiful part of the desert. He says : " Suddenly I heard a hoarse cough, and 
 on turning around saw distinctly in the fog a queer little old man standing 
 near, and looking at me. I instinctively cocked my gun, as the idea of Bush- 
 men and poisoned arrows flashed across my mind. The old man instantly 
 dropped upon his hands, giving another hoarse cough, that evidently told a 
 tale of consumptive lungs, snatched up something behind him, which seemed to 
 leap on his shoulders, and then scampered off up the ravine on all fours. Before 
 half this performance was completed I had discovered my mistake. The little 
 old man turned out to be an ursine baboon, with an infant ditto, which had 
 come down the kloof to drink. A large party of the old gentleman's family 
 were sitting up the ravine, and were evidently in a debate as to the cause of 
 my intrusion. I watched them through my glass, and was much amused at 
 their grotesque and almost human movements. Some of the ladies had their 
 olive branches in their laps, and appeared to be 'doing their hair;' while 
 a patriarchal-looking old fellow paced backward and forward with a sort 
 of fussy look. He was evidently on sentry, and seemed to think himself of no 
 small importance. This estimate of his dignity did not appear to be univer- 
 sally acknowledged, as two or three young baboons sat close behind him 
 watching his proceedings. Sometimes, with the most grotesque movements 
 and expressions, they would stand directly in his path, and hobble away only 
 at the last moment. One daring youngster followed close on the heels of the 
 patriarch during the whole length of his beat, and gave a sharp tug at his tail 
 as he was about to turn. . The old fellow seemed to treat it with the greatest 
 indifference, scarcely turning round at the insult. Master impudence was

 about repeating the performance, when the pater, showing that he was not 
 such a fool as he looked, suddenly sprang round and, catching the young one 
 before he could escape, gave him two or three such cuffs that I could hear the 
 screams that resulted therefrom. The venerable gentleman then chucked the 
 delinquent over his shoulder and continued his promenade with the greatest 
 coolness. This old baboon evidently was acquainted with the practical details 
 of Solomon's proverb. A crowd gathered around the naughty child, which, 
 childlike, seeing commiseration, shrieked the louder. I even fancied I could 
 see the angry glances of the mamma as she took her dear little pet in her 
 arms and removed it from the repetition of such brutal treatment." 
 
 "We are told likewise of a tame baboon whose great delight was in fright- 
 ening the Kafir women. On selecting his victim, he would rush at her as if he 
 intended to devour her, and away she would fly for dear life, dropping her basket 
 or hoe. But he soon caught hold of her, and, seizing her by one leg, stared her 
 in the face, mewing and grinning, and moving his eyebrows at her like an 
 incarnate fiend. When her screams at length brought assistance, in the shape 
 of a Kafir cur, Jocko sprang up a tree, and, resting secure upon an upper 
 branch, gazed upward and around with a quiet contemplative air, as though 
 he had sought this elevated position for the sole purpose of meditating on the 
 weakness of baboon and animal nature generally, but more particularly on 
 the foibles of excited Kafir curs. 
 
 The baboon when tame, however, is sometimes of more use than to frighten 
 women, who he knows will throw down the hoe instead of breaking his head 
 with it. He is made to discover water in the desert when his master would 
 perhaps perish without it. A little salt is rubbed on his tongue to irritate his 
 thirst, and then he is let go. He runs along a bit, scratches himself, shows his 
 teeth, takes a smell up wind, looks all around, picks up a bit of grass, smells 
 or eats it, stands up for another sniff, canters on, and so on. Wherever the 
 nearest water is he is sure to go. 
 
 XV.— WILLIAM PITT. Macaulay. 
 
 Pitt was emphatically the man of parliamentary government, the type 
 of his class, the minion, the child, the spoiled child, of the House of Commons. 
 For the House of Commons he had an hereditary, an infantine love. It was 
 when the House of Commons was to be convinced and persuaded that he put 
 forth all his powers. 
 
 Of those powers we must form our estimate chiefly from tradition ; for of all 
 the eminent speakers of the last age Pitt has suffered most from the reporters. 
 Even while he was still living critics remarked that his eloquence could not be 
 preserved, that he must be heard to be appreciated. There is, however, abun- 
 dant evidence that nature had bestowed on Pitt the talents of a great orator; 
 and those talents had been developed in a very peculiar manner: first, by his 
 education ; and secondly, by the high official position to which he rose early, 
 and in which he passed the greater part of his public life. 
 
 At his first appearance in Parliament he showed himself superior to all his 
 contemporaries in command of language. He could pour forth a long succes- 
 sion of round and stately periods, without premeditation, without ever pausing 
 for a word, without ever repeating a word, in a voice of silver clearness, and

 with a pronunciation so articulate that not a letter was slurred over. His 
 declamation was copious, polished, and splendid. In power of sarcasm he was 
 probably not surpassed by any speaker, ancient or modern; and of this formi- 
 dable weapon he made merciless use. In two parts of the oratorical art which 
 are of the highest value to a minister of state he was singularly expert. No 
 man knew better how to be luminous or how to be obscure. When he wished 
 to be understood he never failed to make himself understood. He could with 
 ease present to his audience, not perhaps an exact or profound, but a clear, 
 popular, and plausible view of the most extensive and complicated subject. 
 Nothing was out of place ; nothing was forgotten. Minute details, dates, 
 sums of money, were all faithfully preserved in his memory. Even intricate 
 questions of finance when explained by him seemed clear to the plainest man 
 among his hearers. On the other hand, when he did not wish to be explicit — 
 and no man who is at the head of affairs always wishes to be explicit — he had 
 a marvelous power of saying nothing in language which left on his audience 
 the impression that he had said a great deal. He was at once the only man 
 who could open a budget without notes, and the only man who, as Wyndham 
 said, could speak that most elaborately evasive and unmeaning of human com- 
 positions, a king's speech, without premeditation. 
 
 XVI.— WAEWICK CASTLE. H. W. Beecher. 
 
 "Walking along a high park wall which forms one part of the town, or 
 rather which stops the town from extending further in that direction — the top 
 covered with ivy, that garment of English walls and buildings — I come to the 
 gateway of the approach. A porter opens its huge leaf. Cut through a solid 
 rock, the road, some twenty feet wide, winds for a long way in the most solemn 
 beauty. The sides, in solid rock, vary from five to twenty feet in height — at 
 least so it seemed to my imagination, the only faculty that I allowed to con- 
 duct me. It was covered on both hands with ivy, growing down from above 
 and hanging in beautiful reaches. Solemn trees on the bank, on either side, 
 met overhead, and cast a delicious twilight down upon my way, and made it 
 yet softer by a murmuring of their leaves. Winding in graceful curves, it at 
 last brings you to the first view of the castle, at a distance of some hundred 
 rods before you. It opens on the sight with grandeur. On either corner is a 
 huge tower, apparently one hundred and fifty feet high. In the center is a 
 square tower, called properly a gateway; and a huge wall connects this central 
 access with the two corner towers. I stood for a little, and let the vision 
 pierce me through. Who can tell what he feels in such a place? Primeval 
 forests, the ocean, prairies, Niagara, I had seen and felt; but never had I seen 
 any pile around which were historic associations blended not only with heroic 
 men and deeds, but savoring of my own childhood. And now too am I to 
 see, and understand by inspection, the things which Scott has made so familiar 
 to all as mere words — moats, portcullises, battlements, keeps or mounds, arrow- 
 slit windows, watch-towers. They had a strange effect upon me. They were 
 perfectly new, and yet familiar old friends. I had never seen them, yet the 
 moment I did see all was instantly plain. I knew name and use, and seemed 
 in a moment to have known them always. 
 
 I came up to the moat, now dry and lined with beautiful shrubs and trees,

 1 the bridge, and entered the outer gateway or arched door, through a 
 solid square tower. The portcullis was drawn up, but I could see the pro- 
 jecting end. Another similar gateway, a few steps further on, showed the 
 care with which the defense was managed. This passed, a large court opened, 
 surrounded on every side with towers, walls, and vast ranges of buildings. 
 Here 1 beheld the pictures which I had seen on paper magnified into gigantic 
 realities. Drawings of many-faced, irregular Gothic mansions, measuring an 
 inch or two, with which my childhood was familiar, here stood before me 
 measuring hundreds and hundreds of feet. It was the first sight of a real 
 baronial castle. It was a historic dream breaking forth into a waking reality. 
 
 It is of very little use to tell you how large the court is by feet and rods, 
 or that Guy's Tower is one hundred and twenty-eight feet high and Caesars 
 Tower one hundred and forty-seven. But it may touch your imagination, 
 and wheel it suddenly backward with long flight and wide vision, to say that 
 Caesar's Tower has stood for eight hundred years, being coeval with the 
 Norman Conquest! I stood upon its mute stones, and imagined the ring 
 of the hammer upon them when the mason was laying them in their bed 
 of ages. When these stones were placed it was yet to be two hundred years 
 before Gower and Chaucer should be born. Indeed since this mortar was 
 wetted and cemented these stones the original people — the Normans, the 
 Danes, the Saxons — have been mixed together into one people. "When this 
 stone on which I lean took its place there was not then a printed book in 
 England. Printing was invented hundreds of years after these foundations 
 went down. When the rude workmen put their shoulders to these stones the 
 very English language lay unborn in the loins of its parent tongues. The 
 men that laughed and jested as they wrought, and had their pride of skill; 
 the architect and the lord for whose praise he fashioned these stones; the 
 villagers that wondered as they looked upon the growing pile; why, they are. 
 now no more to men's memories than the grass they trod on, or the leaves 
 which they cast in felling the oak! 
 
 Against these stones on which I lay my hand have rung the sounds of 
 battle. Yonder, on these very grounds, there raged, in sight of men that 
 stood where I do, fiercest and deadliest conflicts. All this ground has fed 
 on blood. 
 
 I walked across to Guy's Tower, up its long stone stairway, into some of its 
 old soldiers' rooms. The pavements were worn, though of stone, with the 
 heavy grinding feet of men-at-arms. I heard them laugh between their cups. 
 I saw them devouring their gross food. I heard them recite their feats, or tell 
 the last news of some knightly outrage, or cruel oppression of the despised 
 laborer. I stood by the window out of which the archer sent his whistling 
 arrows. I stood by the openings through which scalding water or molten lead 
 were poured upon the heads of assailants; and heard the hoarse shriek of the 
 wretched fellows from below as they got the shocking baptism. I ascended 
 to the roof of the tower, and looked over the wide glory of the scene, still 
 haunted with the same imaginations of the olden time. How many thoughts 
 have flown hence besides mine — here where warriors looked out, or ladies 
 watched for their knights' return! 
 
 Grand and glorious were the trees that waved in the grounds about the 
 castle; but, though some of them had seen centuries, they were juvenile sprouts

 in comparir-on -with these old walls and towers on which William the Con- 
 queror had walked. 
 
 Already the sun was drooping far down the west and sending its golden 
 glow sideways through the trees, and the glades in the park were gathering 
 twilight as I turned to give a last look at these strange scenes. I walked 
 slowly through the gateway, crossed the bridge over the moat, turned and 
 looked back upon the old towers, whose tops reddened yet in the sun, though 
 I was in deep shadow. Then, walking backward, looking still, till I came to 
 the woods, I took my farewell of Warwick Castle. 
 
 XYIL— A SABBATH AT STRATFORD-ON-AVON. 
 
 As I approached the church I perceived that we were to pass through the 
 churchyard for some little distance; and an avenue of lime-trees, meeting 
 overhead, formed a beautiful way, through which my soul exulted to go up 
 to the house of God. The interior was stately and beautiful — it was to me; 
 and I am not describing anything to you as it was, but am describing myself 
 while in the presence of scenes with which, through books, you are familiar. 
 As I sat down in a pew close by the reading-desk and pulpit I looked along 
 to the chancel, which stretched some fifty or sixty feet back of the pulpit and 
 desk, and saw upon the wall the well-known bust of Shakespeare; and I 
 knew that beneath the pavement under that his dust reposed. 
 
 In a few minutes a little fat man, with a red collar and red cuffs, advanced 
 from a side room behind the pulpit, and led the way for the rector, a man of 
 about fifty years, bald, except on the sides of his head, which were covered 
 with white hair. I had been anxious lest some Cowper's ministerial fop should 
 officiate, and the sight of this aged man was good. The form of his face and 
 head indicated firmness, but his features were suffused with an expression of 
 benevolence. He ascended the reading-desk, and the services began. I can 
 not tell you how much I was affected. I had never had such a trance of 
 worship, and I shall never have such another view until I gain the Gate. 
 
 I am so ignorant of the church service that I can not call the various parts 
 by their right names; but the portions which most affected me were the prayers 
 and responses which the choir sang. I had never heard any part of a suppli- 
 cation — a direct prayer — chanted by a choir; and it seemed as though I heard 
 not with my ear, but with my soul. I was dissolved. My whole being seemed 
 to me like an incense wafted gratefully toward God. My soul, then thou did'st 
 magnify the Lord, and rejoice in the God of my salvation! And then came 
 to my mind the many exultations of the Psalms of David; and never before 
 were the expressions and figures so noble and so necessary to express what I 
 felt. I had risen, it seemed to me, so high as to be where David was when his 
 soul conceived the things which he wrote. Throughout the service, and it 
 was an hour and a quarter long, whenever an "Amen" occurred it was given 
 by the choir, accompanied by the organ and the congregation. Oh, that 
 swell and solemn cadence rings in my ear yet! Not once, not a single time, 
 did it occur in that service, from beginning to end, without bringing tears 
 from my eyes. I stood like a shrub in a spring morning — every leaf covered 
 with dew, and every breeze shook down some drops. I trembled so much at 
 times that I was obliged to sit down. Oh, when in the prayers, breathed forth

 in strains of sweet, simple, solemn music, the love of Christ was recognized, 
 how I longed then to give utterance to what that love seemed to me! There 
 was a moment in which the heavens seemed opened to me, and I saw the glory 
 of God! All the earth seemed to me a store-house of images, made to set 
 forth the Redeemer; and I could scarcely be still from crying out. I never 
 knew, I never dreamed before, of what heart there was in that word — amen. 
 Every time it swelled forth, and died away solemnly, not my lips, not my 
 mind, but my whole being said — Savior, so let it be. 
 
 XVIII.— THE FRENCH ASSEMBLY OF 1792. Macaulay. 
 
 They are called the Constituent Assembly. Never was name less appro- 
 priate. They were not constituent, but the very reverse of constituent. They 
 constituted nothing that stood or deserved to last. They had not, and they 
 could not possibly have, the information or the habits of mind which are 
 necessary for the framing of that most exquisite of all machines — a govern- 
 ment. The metaphysical cant with which they prefaced their constitution has 
 long been the scoff of all parties. Their constitution itself — that constitution, 
 which they described as absolutely perfect, and for which they predicted immor- 
 tality — disappeared in a few months, and left no trace behind it. They were 
 great only in the work of destruction. 
 
 The glory of the National Assembly is this, that they were in truth, what 
 Mr. Burke called them in austere irony, the ablest architects of ruin that ever 
 the world saw. They were utterly incompetent to perform any work which 
 required a discriminating eye and a skillful hand. But the work which was 
 then to be done was a work of devastation. They had to deal with abuses so 
 horrible and so deeply rooted that the highest political wisdom could scarcely 
 have produced greater good to mankind than was produced by their fierce and 
 senseless temerity. Demolition is undoubtedly a vulgar task. The highest 
 glory of the statesman is to construct. But there is a time for everything — 
 a time to set up, and a time to pull down. The talents of revolutionary 
 leaders and those of the legislator have equally their use and their season. It 
 is the natural, the almost universal law that the age of insurrections and 
 proscriptions shall precede the age of good government, of temperate liberty, 
 and liberal order. 
 
 And how could it be otherwise? It is not in swaddling-bands that we learn 
 to walk. It is not in the dark that we learn to distinguish colors. It is not 
 under oppression that we learn how to use freedom. The ordinary sophism 
 by which misrule is defended is, when truly stated, this: The people must 
 continue in slavery, because slavery has generated in them all the vices of 
 slaves. Because they are ignorant, they must remain under a power which 
 has made and which keeps them ignorant. Because they have been made 
 ferocious by misgovernment, they must be misgoverned forever. If the 
 system under which they lived were so mild and liberal that under its opera- 
 tion they had become humane and enlightened, it would be safe to venture on 
 a change. The English Revolution, it is said, was truly a glorious revolution. 
 Practical evils were redressed; no excesses were committed; no sweeping 
 confiscations took place; the authority of the laws was scarcely for a moment 
 suspended; the fullest and freest discussion was tolerated in Parliament; the

 nation showed by the calm and temperate manner in which it asserted its 
 liberty that it was fit to enjoy liberty. The French Revolution was, on the 
 other hand, the most horrible event recorded in history, — all madness and 
 wickedness, — absurdity in theory, and atrocity in practice. What folly and 
 injustice in the revolutionary laws! "What fanaticism! What licentiousness! 
 What cruelty! This it is to give freedom to those who have neither wisdom 
 nor virtue. 
 
 It would be impossible even to glance at all the causes of the French Kev- 
 olution within the limits to which we must confine ourselves. One thing is 
 clear. The government, the aristocracy, and the church were rewarded after 
 their works. They reaped that which they had sown. They found the nation 
 such as they had made it. That the people had become possessed of irresist- 
 ible power before they had attained the slightest knowledge of the art of 
 government — that practical questions of vast moment were left to be solved 
 by men to whom politics had been only matter of theory — that a legislature 
 was composed of persons who were scarcely fit to compose a debating society — 
 that the whole nation was ready to lend an ear to any flatterer who appealed 
 to its cupidity, to its fears, or to its thirst for vengeance — all this was the effect 
 of misrule, obstinately continued in defiance of solemn warnings and of the 
 visible signs of an approaching retribution. 
 
 XIX.— DEFEAT OF THE SPANISH AKMADA. J. Lathrop Motley. 
 
 Never, since England was England, had such a sight been seen as now 
 revealed itself in those narrow straits between Dover and Calais. Along that 
 long, low, sandy shore, and quite within the range of the Calais fortifications, 
 one hundred and thirty Spanish ships — the greater number of them the largest 
 and most heavily armed in the world — lay face to face, and scarcely out of 
 cannon shot, with one hundred and fifty English sloops and frigates, the 
 strongest and swiftest that the island could furnish, and commanded by men 
 whose exploits had rung through the world. 
 
 It was a pompous spectacle, that midsummer night, upon those narrow 
 seas. The moon, which Avas at the full, was rising calmly upon a sea of 
 anxious expectation. Would she not be looking by the morrow's night upon 
 a subjugated England, a re-enslaved Holland — upon the downfall of civil and 
 religious liberty? Those ships of Spain, which lay there with their banners 
 waving in the moonlight, discharging salvoes of anticipated triumph, and 
 filling the air with strains of insolent music, would they not by daybreak be 
 moving straight to their purpose, bearing the conquerors of the world to the 
 scene of their cherished hopes? 
 
 That English fleet toe which rode there at anchor, so anxiously on the 
 watch, would that swarm of nimble, lightly-handled, but slender vessels, 
 which had held their own hitherto in hurried and desultory skirmishes, be 
 able to cope with their great antagonist now that the moment had arrived 
 for the death grapple? Would not Howard, Drake, Frobisher, Seymour, 
 Winter, and Hawkins be swept out of the straits at last, yielding an open 
 passage to Medina, Oquendo, Recalde, and Farnese? Would those Hollanders 
 and Zealanders, cruising so vigilantly among their treacherous shallows, dare

 to maintain their post now that the terrible Holofernes with his invincible 
 legions was resolved to come forth? 
 
 Next day, Sunday, August 7, 1588, the two great fleets were still lying 
 but a mile and a half apart, calmly gazing at each other, and rising and 
 falling at their anchors as idly as if some vast summer regatta were the only 
 purpose of that great assemblage of shipping. Nothing as yet was heard of 
 Farnese. Thus far, at least, the Hollanders had held him at bay, and there 
 was still breathing-time before the catastrophe 
 
 On the other hand, upon the decks of the Armada there was an impatience 
 that night which increased every hour. The governor of Calais, M. de 
 Gourdon, had sent his nephew on board the flag-ship of Medina Sidonia with 
 courteous salutations, professions of friendship, and bountiful refreshments. 
 There was no fear — now that Mucio was for the time in the ascendency — 
 that the schemes of Philip would be interfered with by France. The governor 
 had, however, sent serious warning of the dangerous position in w 7 hich the 
 Armada had placed itself. He was quite right. Calais roads were no safe 
 anchorage for huge vessels like those of Spain and Portugal; for the tides 
 and cross-currents to which they were exposed were most treacherous. It was 
 calm enough at the moment; but a westerly gale might in a few hours drive the 
 whole fleet hopelessly among the sand-banks of the dangerous Fleming coast. 
 
 And the impatience of the soldiers and sailors on board the fleet w 7 as equal 
 to that of their commanders. There was London almost before their eyes — 
 a huge mass of treasure, richer and more accessible than those mines beyond 
 the Atlantic which had so often rewarded Spanish chivalry with fabulous 
 wealth. And there were men in those galleons who remembered the sack of 
 Antwerp, a few years before — men who could tell from personal experience 
 how helpless was a great commercial city when once in the clutch of disciplined 
 brigands — men w 7 ho, in that dread "fury of Antwerp," had enriched themselves 
 in an hour with the accumulations of a merchant's life-time, and who had slain 
 fathers and mothers, sons and daughters, brides and bridegrooms before each 
 others' eyes, until the number of inhabitants butchered in the. blazing streets 
 rose to many thousands; and the plunder from palaces and warehouses was 
 counted by millions before the sun had set on the "great fury." Those Spaniards 
 and Italians and Walloons were now thirsting for more gold, for more blood; 
 and as the capital of England was even more wealthy and far more defenseless 
 than the commercial metropolis of the Netherlands had been, so it was resolved 
 that the London "fury" should yield them a richer harvest than that of Ant- 
 werp, at the memory of which the world still shuddered. And these profes- 
 sional soldiers had been taught to consider the English as a pacific, delicate, 
 eifeminate race, dependent on good living, without experience of war, quickly 
 fatigued and discouraged, and even more easily to be plundered and butchered 
 than were the excellent burghers of Antwerp. 
 
 And so these southern conquerors looked down from their great galleons 
 and galliass.es upon the English vessels. More than three quarters of them 
 were merchantmen. There was no comparison whatever between the relative 
 Strength of the fleets. In number they were about equal, being each from one 
 hundred and thirty to one hundred and fifty strong; but the Spaniards had 
 twiee the tonnage of the English, four times the artillery, and nearly three 
 times the number of men.

 As the twilight deepened the moon "became totally ohscured, dark cloud- 
 masses spread over the heavens, the sea grew black, distant thunder rolled, and 
 the sob of an approaching tempest became distinctly audible. Such indications 
 of a westerly gale were not encouraging to those cumbrous vessels, with the 
 treacherous quicksands of Flanders under their lee. 
 
 At an hour past midnight it was so dark that it was difficult for the most 
 practiced eye to pierce far into the gloom. But a faint dip of oars now struck 
 the ears of the Spaniards as they watched from the decks. A few moments 
 afterward the sea became suddenly luminous, and six flaming vessels appeared 
 at a slight distance, bearing steadily down upon them before the wind and tide. 
 
 There were men in the Armada who had been at the siege of Antwerp, 
 only a few years before. They remembered with horror the devil-ships of 
 Gianibelli, those floating volcanoes, which had seemed to rend earth and ocean, 
 whose explosion had laid so many thousands of soldiers dead at a blow, and 
 which had shattered the bridge and floating forts of Farnese as though they 
 had been toys of glass. They knew too that the famous engineer was at that 
 moment in England. 
 
 In a moment one of those terrible panics which .spread with such conta- 
 gious rapidity among large bodies of men seized upon the Spaniards. There 
 was a yell throughout the fleet — " The' fire-ships of Antwerp! the fire-ships 
 of Antwerp ! " and in an instant every cable was cut, and frantic attempts 
 were made by each galleon and galliass to escape what seemed imminent 
 destruction. The confusion was beyond description. Four or five of the 
 largest ships became entangled with each other; two others were set- on 
 fire by the flaming vessels, and were consumed. 
 
 So long as night and darkness lasted the confusion and uproar continued. 
 When the Monday morning dawned several of the Spanish vessels lay disabled, 
 while the rest of the fleet was seen at a distance of two leagues from Calais, 
 driving toward the Flemish coast. The threatened gale had not yet begun to 
 blow, but there were fresh squalls from the W. S. W., which to such awkward 
 sailers as the Spanish vessels were difficult to contend with. On the other 
 hand, the English fleet was all astir and ready to pursue the Spaniards, now 
 rapidly drifting into the North Sea 
 
 The invincible Armada, already sorely crippled, was standing N. N. E., 
 directly before a fresh topsail breeze from the S. S. W. The English came 
 up with them soon after nine o'clock a.m., off Gravelines, and found them 
 sailing in a half-moon, the admiral and vice-admiral in the center, and the 
 flanks protected by the three remaining galliasses and by the great galleons 
 of Portugal. 
 
 The battle lasted six hours long, hot and furious. Keeping within musket- 
 range, the well-disciplined English mariners poured broadside after broadside 
 against the towering ships of the Armada, which afforded so easy a mark; 
 while the Spaniards, on their part, found it impossible, while wasting incredible 
 quantities of powder and shot, to inflict any severe damage on their enemies. 
 Throughout the action not an English ship was destroyed, not a hundred men 
 were killed. On the other hand, all the best ships of the Spaniards were 
 riddled through and through, and with masts and yards shattered, sails and 
 rigging torn to shreds, and a north-west wind still drifting them toward the 
 fatal sand-banks of Holland, they labored heavily in a chopping sea, firing

 wildly, and receiving tremendous punishment at the hands of Howard, Drake, 
 Seymour, Winter, and their followers. 
 
 Up to this period the weather, though occasionally threatening, had been 
 moderate. During the week which succeeded the eventful night otF Calais 
 neither the Armada nor the English ships had been much impeded in their 
 maneuvers by storms of heavy seas. But on the following Sunday (14th of 
 August) there was a change. The wind shifted again to the south-west, and 
 during the whole of that day and the Monday blew a tremendous gale. 
 "T was a more violent storm," said Howard, "than was ever seen before at 
 this time of the year." 
 
 Over the invincible Armada, last seen by the departing English midway 
 between the coasts of Scotland and Denmark, the blackness of night seemed 
 suddenly to descend. A mystery hung for a long time over their fate. Dam- 
 aged, leaking, without pilots, without a competent commander, the great fleet 
 entered that furious storm, and was whirled along the iron crags of Norway, 
 and between the savage rocks of Faroe and the Hebrides. In those regions 
 of tempest the insulted North wreaked its full vengeance on the insolent 
 Spaniards. Disaster after disaster marked their perilous track; gale after 
 gale swept them hither and thither, tossing them on sand-banks or shattering 
 them against granite cliffs. The coasts of Norway, Scotland, Ireland, were 
 strewn with the wrecks of that pompous fleet which claimed the dominion 
 of the seas; with the bones of those invincible legions which were to have 
 sacked London and made England a Spanish viceroyalty. The invincible 
 Armada had not only been vanquished, but annihilated.

 And clang of politics ; — weary of hate, 
 
 And sorrow, and calamity, and crime

 I leaned back in my chair, and dropp'd the page, 
 
 Diurnal, — filled with all the misery, 
 
 And fell asleep, — if sleeping it could be, 
 
 When, in their natural sequence in the brain, 
 
 Thought followed thought, more palpable and plain 
 
 Than when I waked ; when words took music-voice, 
 
 And all my being inly did rejoice. 
 
 And what I saw I sang of at the time 
 
 With ease unparalleled by waking rhyme, 
 
 And to this tune, which, many a day since then, 
 
 A haunting music, has come back again.

 XXI.— THE WING. Michelet. 
 
 Wings ! wings ! to sweep 
 
 O'er mountain high and valley deep. 
 
 Wings, that my heart may rest 
 
 In the radiant morning's breast. 
 
 Wings to hover free 
 
 O'er the dawn — impurpled sea. 
 
 Wings ! 'bove life to soar, 
 
 And beyond death for evermore. 
 
 It is the cry of the whole earth, of the world, of all life ; it is that which 
 every species of animals or plants utters in a hundred diverse tongues — the 
 voice which issues from the very rock and the inorganic creation : " Wings ! 
 we seek for wings, and the power of flight and motion ! " Yea, the most inert 
 bodies rush greedily into the chemical transformations which will make them 
 part and parcel of the current of the universal life, and bestow upon them the 
 organs of movement and fermentation. 
 
 Yea, the vegetables, fettered by their immovable roots, expand their secret 
 loves toward a winged existence, and commend themselves to the winds, the 
 waters, the insects, in quest of a life beyond their narrow limits — of that gift 
 of flight which nature has refused to them. 
 
 We contemplate pityingly those rudimentary animals, the unau and the ai, 
 sad and suffering images of man, which can not advance a step without a 
 groan — sloths or tardigrades. The names by which we identify them we might 
 justly reserve for ourselves. If slowness be relative to the desire of move- 
 ment, to the constantly futile effort to progress, to advance, to act, the true 
 tardigrade is man. His faculty of dragging himself from one point of the 
 earth to another, the ingenious instruments which he has recently invented in 
 aid of this faculty — all this does not lessen his adhesion to the earth; he is not 
 the less firmly chained to it by the tyranny of gravitation. I see upon earth 
 but one order of created beings which enjoy the power of ignoring or beguiling, 
 by their freedom and swiftness of motion, this universal sadness of impotent

 aspiration. I mean those beings which belong to earth, so to speak, only 
 by the tips of their wings; which the air itself cradles and supports, most 
 frequently without being otherwise connected with them than by guiding 
 them at their need and their caprice. 
 
 A life of ease, yet sublime ! With what a glance of scorn may the weakest 
 bird regard the strongest and swiftest of quadrupeds — a tiger, a lion! How it 
 may smile to see them in their utter powerlessness bound, fastened to the earth 
 which they terrify with vain and useless roarings — with the nocturnal wailings 
 that bear witness to the bondage of the so-called king of animals, fettered, as 
 we ail are, in that inferior existence which hunger and gravitation equally 
 prepare for us. 
 
 Oh, the fatality of the appetites ! the fatality of motion which compels us 
 to drag our unwilling limbs along the earth! Implacable heaviness which 
 binds each of our feet to the dull, rude element wherein death will hereafter 
 resolve us, and says: "Son of the earth, to the earth thou belongest! A mo- 
 ment released from its bosom, thou shalt lie there henceforth for ages." Do 
 not let us inveigh against nature. It is assuredly the sign that we inhabit a 
 world still in its first youth — still in a state of barbarism — a world of essay 
 and apprenticeship, in the grand series of stars — one of the elementary stages 
 of the sublime imitation. This planet is the world of a child ; and thou, thou 
 art a child. From this lower school thou shalt be emancipated also. Thy 
 wings shall be majestic and powerful. Thou shalt win and deserve while 
 here, by the sweat of thy brow, a step forward in liberty. 
 
 Let us make an experiment. Ask of the bird while still in the egg what 
 he would wish to be. Give him the option. Wilt thou be- a man, and share 
 in that royalty of the globe which men have won by art and toil? No, he 
 will immediately reply. Without calculating the immense exertion, the labor, 
 the sweat, the care, the life of slavery by which we purchase sovereignty, he 
 will have but one word to say: "A king myself by birth of space and light, 
 why should I abdicate when man, in his loftiest ambitions, in his highest 
 aspirations after happiness and freedom, dreams of becoming a bird and 
 taking unto himself wings?" 
 
 It is in his sunniest time, his first and richest existence, in his day-dreams 
 of youth, that man has sometimes the good fortune to forget that he is a man, 
 a slave to hard fate, and chained to earth. Behold yonder him who flies 
 abroad, who hovers, who dominates over the world, who swims in the sun- 
 beam! He enjoys the ineffable felicity of embracing at a glance an infinity 
 of things which yesterday he could only see one by one. Obscure enigma 
 of detail suddenly made luminous to him who perceives its unity! To see the 
 world beneath one's self, to embrace it, to love it! How divine, how lofty a 
 dream ! Do not wake me, I pray you, never wake me ! But what is this ? 
 Here again are day, uproar, and labor; the harsh iron hammer, the ear-piercing 
 bell with its voice of steel dethrone and dash me headlong ; my wings are rent. 
 Dull earth, I fall to thee ! Bruised and bent I return to the plow. 
 
 When at the close of the last century man formed the daring idea of 
 giving himself up to the winds, of mounting in the air without rudder or 
 oar or means of guidance, he proclaimed aloud that at length he had secured 
 his pinions — had eluded nature and conquered gravitation. Cruel and tragical 
 catastrophes gave the lie to this ambition. He studied the economy of the

 bird's wing; ho undertook to imitate it. Rudely enough he counterfeited its 
 inimitable mechanism. We saw with terror from a column of a hundred feet 
 high a poor human bird armed with wings dart into air, wrestle with it, and 
 dash headlong into atoms. The gloomy and fatal machine in its laborious 
 complexity was a sorry imitation of that admirable arm (far superior to the 
 human arm), that system of muscles which co-operate among themselves in 
 so vigorous and lively a movement. Disjointed and relaxed, the human wing 
 lacked especially that all-powerful muscle which connects the shoulders to the 
 chest, and communicates its impetus to the thunderous flight of the falcon. 
 The instrument acts so directly on the mover, the oar on the rower, and unites 
 with him so perfectly, that the martinet, the frigate-bird, sweeps along at the 
 rate of eighty leagues an hour — five or six times swifter than our most rapid 
 railway trains, outstripping the hurricane, and with no rival but the lightning. 
 But even if our poor imitators had exactly imitated the wing, nothing would 
 have been accomplished. The}- then had copied the form, but not the internal 
 structure. They thought that the bird's power of ascension lay in its flight 
 alone, forgetting the secret auxiliary which nature conceals in the plumage 
 and bones. The mystery, the true marvel, lies in the faculty with which she 
 endows the bird of rendering itself light or heavy at its will, of admitting 
 more or less of air into its expressly constructed reservoirs. Would it grow 
 light, it inflates its dimensions while diminishing its relative weight. By this 
 means it spontaneously ascends in a medium heavier than itself. To descend 
 or drop it contracts itself, grows thin and small, cutting through the air which 
 supported and raised it in its former heavy condition. Here lay the error, the 
 cause of man's fatal mistake. He assumed that the bird was a ship, not a bal- 
 loon. He imitated the wing only; but the wing, however skillfully imitated, 
 if not conjoined with this internal force, is but a certain means of destruction. 
 But this faculty, this rapid inhalation or expulsion of air, of swimming with a 
 ballast variable at pleasure, whence does it proceed? From a unique, unheard- 
 of power of respiration. The man who should inhale a similar quantity of air 
 at once would be suffocated. The bird's lung, elastic and powerful, quaffs it 
 abundantly into his bones, into his aerial cells. Each inspiration is renewed 
 second after second with tremendous rapidity. The blood, ceaselessly vivified 
 with fresh air, supplies each muscle with that inexhaustible energy which no 
 other being possesses, and which belongs only to the elements. The bird does 
 not need to seek the air that he may be reinvigorated by touching it; the air 
 seeks and flows into him. It incessantly kindles within him the burning fires 
 of life. It is this and not the wing which is so marvelous. Take the pinions 
 of the condor, and follow in its track when from the summit of the Andes 
 and their Siberian glaciers it swoops down upon the glowing shore of Peru, 
 traversing in a minute all the temperatures and all the climates of the globe, 
 breathing at one breath the frightful mass of air — scorched, frozen, it matters 
 not. You would reach the earth stricken as by lightning. 
 
 The smallest bird in this matter shames the strongest quadruped. Place, 
 Toussenel, a chained lion in a balloon and his harsh voice will be lost in 
 space. Far more powerful in voice and respiration the little lark mounts up- 
 ward, trilling its song, and makes itself heard when it can be seen no longer. 
 Its light and joyous strain, uttered without fatigue and costing nothing, seems 
 the bliss of an invisible spirit which would fain console the earth.

 Strength makes joy. The happiest of beings is the bird, because it feels 
 itself strong beyond the limits of its action, because cradled, sustained by the 
 breath of heaven, it floats, it rises without effort like — a dream. The boundless 
 strength, the exalted faculty — obscure among inferior beings, in the bird clear 
 and vital — of deriving at will its vigor from the maternal source, of drinking 
 life in at full flood, is a divine intoxication. 
 
 The tendency of every human being — a tendency not arrogant, not im- 
 pious — is to liken itself to nature, the great mother ; to fashion itself after her 
 image; to crave a share of the unwearied wings with which Eternal Love 
 broods over the world. 
 
 Human tradition is fixed in this direction. Man does not wish to be a 
 man, but an angel, a winged deit}\ The winged genii of Persia suggests the 
 cherubims of Judea. Greece endows her Psyche with wings, and discovers 
 the true name of the soul — aspiration. The soul has preserved her pinions; 
 has passed at one flight through the shadowy middle age, and constantly 
 increases in heavenly longings. More spotless and more glowing, she gives 
 utterance to a prayer breathed in the very depths of the prophetic ardor : " Oh, 
 that I were a bird ! " 
 
 "Woman never doubts but her offspring will become an angel. She has 
 seen it so in her dreams. 
 
 Dreams or realities? Winged visions, raptures of the night which we 
 shall weep so bitterly in the morning! If you really were! If indeed you 
 lived! If we had lost some of the causes of our regret! If from stars to 
 stars, reunited and launched on an eternal flight, we all performed in com- 
 panionship a happy pilgrimage through the illimitable goodness! 
 
 At times one is apt to believe it. Something whispers us that these dreams 
 are not all dreams, but glimpses of a world of truth — momentary flashes re- 
 vealing through these lower clouds certain promises to be hereafter fulfilled — 
 w r hile the pretended reality it is that should be stigmatized as a foul delusion. 
 
 XXII.— THE THUNDEE-STOEM. George D. Prentice. 
 
 I never was a man of feeble courage. There are few scenes of either human 
 or elemental strife upon which I have not looked with a brow of daring. I 
 have stood in front of the battle when the swords were gleaming and circling 
 around me like fiery serpents in the air. I have seen these things with a 
 swelling soul that knew not, that recked not of danger. 
 
 But there is something in the thunder's voice that makes me tremble like a 
 child. I have tried to overcome this unmanly weakness. I have called pride 
 to my aid; I have sought for moral courage in the lessons of philosophy; but 
 the effort availed me nothing. At the first low moaning of the distant cloud 
 my heart shrinks and dies within me. 
 
 My involuntary dread of thunder had its origin in an incident that occurred 
 when I was a boy of ten years. I had a little cousin — a girl of the same age 
 with myself — who had been a constant companion of my youth. Strange that 
 after the lapse of many years that occurrence should be so familiar to me. I 
 can see the bright young creature, her eyes flashing like beautiful gems, her free 
 locks streaming as in joy upon the rising gale, and her cheeks glowing like 
 rubies through a wreath of transparent snow. Her voice had the melody and

 joyoosness of a bird's; and when she bounded over the wooded hill or fresh 
 green valley, shouting a glad answer to every voice of nature, and clapping her 
 little hands in the ecstasy of young existence, she looked as if breaking away, 
 like a free nightingale, from the earth, and going off where all things are 
 beautiful like her. 
 
 It was a morning in the middle of August. The little girl had been passing 
 some days at my father's house, and she was now to return home. Her path 
 lay across the fields, and gladly I became the companion of her walk. I never 
 knew a summer morning more beautiful and still. Only one little cloud was 
 visible, and that seemed as pure and white and peaceful as if it had been the 
 incense-smoke of some burning censer of the skies. The leaves hung silent in 
 the woods, the waters in the bay had forgotten their undulations, the flowers 
 were bending their heads as if dreaming of rainbow and dew, and the whole 
 atmosphere was of such a soft and luxurious sweetness that it seemed a cloud 
 of roses scattered down by the hands of Peri from the far-off garden of 
 Paradise. The green earth and the blue sea lay around in their boundlessness, 
 and the peaceful sky bent over and blessed them. 
 
 The little creature at my side was in a delirium of happiness, and her clear 
 sweet voice came ringing upon the air as often as she heard the tones of a 
 favorite bird or found some strange and lovely flower in her frolic wanderings. 
 The unbroken and almost supernatural stillness of the day continued until 
 noon ; then for the first time the indications of an approaching storm became 
 manifest. On the summit of a mountain, at the distance of about a mile, the 
 folds of a dark cloud became suddenly visible, and at the same instant a hollow 
 roar came down upon the winds, as if it had been the sound of waves in a 
 rocky cavern. The clouds rolled out like a banner unfolded upon the air, 
 but still the atmosphere was as calm, the leaves as motionless as before, and 
 there was not even a quiver among the sleeping waters to tell of the coming 
 hurricane. To escape the tempest was impossible. As the only resort we fled 
 to an oak that stood at the foot of a tall and rugged precipice. Here we stood 
 and gazed almost breathlessly upon the clouds marshaling themselves like 
 bloody giants in the sky. The thunder was not frequent, but every burst was 
 so fearful that the young creature who stood by me shut her eyes convul- 
 sively, and clung with desperate strength to my arms, and shrieked as if her 
 heart would break. 
 
 A few minutes and the storm was upon us. During the height of its fury 
 the little girl lifted her finger toward the precipice that towered over us. I 
 looked and saw there a purple light; and instantly the clouds opened, the rocks 
 tottered to their foundations, a roar like the groan of the universe filled the 
 air, and I felt myself blinded and thrown I know not whither. How long I 
 remained insensible I can not tell, but when consciousness returned the violence 
 of the tempest was abating, the roar of the winds was dying in the tree-tops, 
 and the deep tones of the thunder-clouds came in faint murmurs from tho 
 eastern hills. 
 
 I arose and looked tremblingly and almost deliriously around. She was 
 there, the dear idol of my infant love, stretched out upon the green earth. 
 After a moment of irresolution I went up a-nd looked upon her. The handker- 
 chief upon her neck was slightly rent, and a single dark spot upon her bosom 
 told where the pathway of death had been. At first I clasped her to my breast

 with a cry of agony, and then laid her down and gazed upon her face with 
 feelings almost of calmness. Her bright disheveled hair clustered sweetly 
 around her brow; the look of terror had faded from her lips and infant smiles 
 were pictured there; the rose-tinge upon her cheeks was as lovely as in life, 
 and as I pressed them upon my own the fountain of tears was opened, and I 
 wept as if my heart were waters. I have but a dim recollection of what 
 followed; I only know that I remained weeping and motionless till the coming- 
 twilight, and I was taken tenderly by the hand and led away where I saw the 
 countenances of parents and sisters. 
 
 Many years have gone by on the wings of light and shadow, but the scenes 
 I have portrayed still come over me at times with a terrible distinctness. The 
 oak yet stands at the base of the precipice, but its limbs are black and dead, 
 and the hollow trunk, looking up to the sky as if "calling to the clouds for 
 drink," is an emblem of rapid and noiseless decay. 
 
 A year ago I visited the spot, and the thought of by-gone years came 
 mournfully back to me. I thought of the little innocent being who fell at my 
 side, like some beautiful tree of spring rent up by the whirlwind in the midst 
 of blossoming. But I remembered — and. oh, there was joy in the memory — 
 that she had gone where the lightnings slumber in the folds of the rainbow- 
 cloud, and where the sunlight waters are broken only by the storm-breath of 
 Omnipotence.

 Of AmV-breadth 'scapes — i' the imminent deadly breach; 
 Of being taken — by the insolent foe — 
 And sold — to slave?y; — of my redemption thence, 
 And portance. In my traveler's history, 
 ( Wherein — of antres vast — and deserts idle, — 
 Rough quarries, — rocks, — and hills — whose heads — touch heaven, 
 It was my hint to speak, ) — such — was my process ; 
 And of the Cannibals — that each other eat,

 "Would Desdemona — seriously — incline :

 But not intentively : I did consent, 
 And often — did beguile her — of her tears, 
 When I did speak — of some distressful stroke — 
 That my youth suffer'd. My story — being done, 
 She gave me — for my pains — a world of sighs :

 'T was pitiful, — 't was wondrous — pitiful : 
 She wish'd — she had not heard it; yet — she wish'd — 
 Th't Heaven — had made her — such a man : she thank' d me ; 
 And bade me, — if I had a friend — that loved her, 
 I should but teach him — how to tell my story — 
 And that — would woo her. Upon this hint — I spake;

 Deny thy father — and refuse thy name :

 Rom. [aside.'] Shall I hear more, — or shall I speak at this ? 
 
 Jul. 'T is but thy name — th't is my enemy; — 
 Thou art thyself, — though — not a Montague. 
 What's Montague? it is — nor hand, — nor foot, — 
 Nor arms, — nor face, — nor any other part — 
 Belonging — to a man. Oh, be some other name ! 
 What 's — in a name ? that — which we call — a rose 
 By any other name — would smell as sweet: 
 So — Romeo would, — (were he not Romeo — calVd,) 
 Retain — that dear perfection — which he owes, 
 Without — that title. Romeo, doff thy name, 
 And — for that name, — (which is no part of thee,} 
 Take all myself. 
 
 Rom. I take thee — at thy word : 
 
 Call me — but love, — and I'll be new baptized; 
 Henceforth — I never will be Romeo. 
 
 Jul. What man — art thou — th't, [thus — bescreen'd by night,) 
 So stumblest — on my counsel ? 
 
 Rom. By a name — 
 
 I know not — how — to tell thee — who I am : 
 My name, — (dear saint,) is hateful — to myself, 
 Because — it is an enemy — to thee; 
 Had I — it written — I would tear the word. 
 
 Jul. My ears — have not yet — drunk a hundred words — 
 Of thy tongues utterance, — yet — I know — the sound: 
 Art thou — not Romeo, and a Montague ? 
 
 Rom. Neither, — (fair maid,) if either — thee dislike. 
 
 Jul. How — earnest thou hither, tell me? and wherefore? 
 The orchard walls — are high, and hard — to climb; 
 And the place — death, — {considering — who thou art,)

 For stony limits — can not hold love out:

 And I will take thy word; yet — if thou swear' st, — 
 Thou mayst — prove false; — at lovers' perjuries,

 If thou dost love, — pronounce it — faithfully : 
 Or — if thou think' st — I am too quickly won, — 
 I '11 frown, and be perverse, — and say thee — nay, — 
 So — thou wilt woo; but — else — not for the world. 
 In truth, — fair Montague, — I am — too fond, 
 And therefore — thou mayst think — my 'havior light: 
 But trust me, — (gentleman,) — I'll prove more true — 
 Than those — th't have more cunning — to be strange. 
 I — shoidd have been more strange, — I must confess, 
 But — th't thou overheard st, (ere I was 'ware,)

 And not impute this yielding — to light love, 
 Which the dark night — hath so discover 'd. 
 
 Rom. Lady, — by yonder blessed moon — I swear,

 Jul. Oh, swear not — by the moon, — the inconstant moon, 
 Th't monthly — changes — in her circled orb, 
 Lest — th't thy love — prove — (likeivise) — variable.

 Regan. I — am made of that self metal — as my sister,

 Bur. Pardon me, royal sir; 
 
 Election — makes not up — on such conditions. 
 
 Lear. Then — leave her, sir; for, (by the power — th't wade me, 
 I tell you — all her wealth. [To France.'] For you, — great king, 
 I would not — from your love — make such a stray, 
 To match you — where I hate; therefore — beseech you 
 To avert your liking — a more worthier way — 
 Than — on a wretch — whom nature — is ashamed 
 (Almost) — to acknowledge hers. 
 
 France. This — is most strange, 
 
 Th't she, (th't even but now — was your best object, 
 The argument — of your praise, balm — of your age, 
 Most best, most dearest,) should — (in this trice of time) 
 Commit a thing — so monstrous, to dismantle — 
 So many folds — of favor. Sure, her offense — 
 Must be of such unnatural degree 
 Th't monsters it, — or — your /ore-vouch 'd affection — 
 Fall'n into taint: which — to believe — of her 
 Must be a faith — th't reason — (without miracle) — 
 Could never plant in me. 
 
 Cor. I yet — beseech your majesty, — 
 
 (If — for I want — that glib — and oily art, 
 To speak — and purpose not ; since — what I well intend 
 I '11 do 't — before I speak,) — th't you make known — 
 It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness, 
 No unchaste action — or dishonored step, 
 Th't hath deprived me — of your grace — and favor: 
 But — even — for want of that — for which — I am richer, 
 A sfo'W-soliciting eye, and such a tongue — 
 As I am glad — I have not ; though not to have it 
 Hath lost me — in your liking. 
 
 Lear. Better — thou 
 
 Hadst not been born — than — not to have pleas'd me — better. 
 
 France. Is it — but this, — a tardiness — in nature, 
 Which often — leaves the history — unspoke — 
 Th't it intends to do ? My lord of Burgundy, 
 What say you — to the lady ? Love 's — not love — 
 When it is mingled with regards th't stand 
 Aloof — from the entire point. Will you have her? 
 She is herself — a dowry. 
 
 Bur. Royal Lear, 
 
 Give — but that portion — which your selj r — proposed, 
 And here — I take — Cordelia — by the hand, 
 Duchess — of Burgundy. 
 
 Lear. Nothing : I have sworn; I am firm.

 France. Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor; 
 Most choice, [forsaken ;) and most loved, — [despised!) 
 Thee — and thy virtues — here — I seize upon : 
 Be it — lawful, — / take up — what 's cast away. 
 Gods, gods! 'tis strange — th't — from their cold'st neglect —

 Thy dowerless daughter, (king,) thrown to my chance. 
 Is queen — of us, of ours, and our fair France: 
 Not all the dukes — of waterish Burgundy —

 Bid them farewell, — (Cordelia,) — though — unkind: 
 Thou losest — here, a better — where to find.

 France. Coyne, — -my fair Cordelia. [Exeunt. 
 
 Gon. Sister, it is not a little — I have to say — of what nearly — appertains 
 to us both. I think — our father — will hence — to-night. 
 
 Reg. That's most certain, and with you; next month with us. 
 
 Gon. You see how full of changes — his age is ; the observation — we have 
 made of it — hath not been little : he always — loved our sister — most; and 
 with what poor judgment — he hath now — cast her off appears too grossly. 
 
 Reg. 'T is the infirmity — of his age : yet — he hath ever but slenderly — ■ 
 known himself. 
 
 Gon. The best — and soundest of his time — hath been but rash: then — ■ 
 must we look — to receive from his age not alone — the imperfections — of 
 foragr-engraffed condition, but, (therewithal,) the unruly waywardness — th't

 Gent. Contending with the fretful elements. 
 
 Kent. But who — is with him? 
 
 Gent. None — but the fool; who labors — to outjest

 water — out o' door. Good nuncle, — in, and ask thy daughters' blessing: here's 
 a night — pities neither wise men — nor fools. 
 
 Lear. Rumble — thy bellyful ! Spit, fire ! spout, rain 1 
 Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, — are my daughters ; 
 I tax not you, (you elements,) with unkindness ; 
 I never gave you — kingdom, call'd you — children; 
 You — owe me — no subscription : then — let fall — 
 Your horrible pleasure : here I stand, — your slave, 
 A poor, — infirm, — weak, — and despised — old man: 
 But yet — I call you — servile ministers, 
 Th't have — with two — pernicious daughters — joined — 
 Your Ai^A-engender'd battles — 'gainst a head — 
 So — old — and white — as this. Oh! — Oh! 'tis fold! 
 
 Fool. He — th't has a house — to put 's head in — has a good Aeao'-piece. 
 
 Lear. No! I will be the pattern — of all patience: 
 I will say nothing. \_Enter Kent. 
 
 Kent. Who 's there ? 
 
 Fool. Marry, here's grace — and a coc^piece; that's a wise man — and a fool. 
 
 Kent. Alas! sir, are you here? things that love night 
 Love not such nights — as these: the wrathful skies — 
 Gallow the very wanderers — of the dark, 
 And make them keep their eaves: since I was man

 Such groans — of roaring wind — and rain, — I never

 Kent. Alack, bare-headed! 
 
 Gracious my lord, hard by here — is a hovel ; — 
 Some friendship — will it lend you — 'gainst the tempest. 
 
 Lear. My wits — begin to turn. 
 
 Come on, — my boy : how dost, my boy? Art cold 1 ? 
 I am cold — myself. Where is this straw, my fellow ? 
 The art — of our necessities — is strange, 
 Th't can make vile things — precious. Come, your hovel. 
 Poor fool — and knave, I have one part in my heart 
 That 's sorry yet — for thee. Come, — bring us to this hovel. [Exeunt.

 The tyranny — of this open night 's — too rough —

 Lear. Let me alone. 
 
 Kent. Good my lord, enter here. 
 
 Lear. Wilt break my heart ? 
 
 Kent. I'd rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter. 
 
 Lear. Thou — think'st 't is much — th't this contentious storm 
 Invades us — to the skin: so H is — to thee; 
 But — where the greater malady is fix'd 
 The lesser — is scarce felt. Thou'dst shun a bear; 
 But — if thy flight — lay toward the raging sea, — 
 Thou'dst meet the bear — i' the mouth. When the mind 1 s— free 
 The body 's — delicate : the tempest — in my mind — 
 Doth — from my senses — take all feeling — else, —

 Is it not — as this mouth — should tear — this hand — 
 For lifting food to't? But — I will punish — home: 
 No, — I will weep — no — more. In such a night — 
 To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.

 Of quick, cross lightning ? to watch, — (poor perdu !) 
 "With this — thin helm ? Mine enemy's dog, 
 (Though he had bit me,) should have stood — (that night)

 In short — and musty straw ? Alack, alack ! 
 'Tis wonder — th't thy life — and wits — (at once) — 
 Had not concluded all. He wakes! speak to him !

 Growing — about the uncrowned soul ! 
 O God! God! must this — [evermore) — he

 Once more — to drink in — the fo/e-breathing air, 
 
 Lapt — in luxurious flowers — 
 To recall again — the pleasures — that were 
 
 In infancy's — innocent hours, — 
 To wash the ear^A-stains — and the dust — from my soul 
 
 In nature's reviving tears once more; 
 To feast — at her banquet, — and drink — from her bowl — 
 
 Rich dew — for the hearts hot core. 
 Ah me ! ah me ! it is heavenly — then, 
 
 And hints — of the spirit-world, — (near — alway,) 
 Are stirring — and stirred at my heart again, 
 
 Like leaves — to the kiss — of May : 
 It is — but a dream, — yet — 't is passing sweet, 
 
 And when — (from its spells) — my spirit — is waking, 
 Dark — as my heart, and the wild tears start ; 
 
 For I — was not made — (merely) — for money-making. 
 
 My soul — leaneth out — to the whisperings 
 
 Of the mighty, — the marvelous spirits — of old; 
 And heaven-ward soareth — to strengthen her wings, 
 
 When labor — relapseth — its earthly hold; 
 And — (breathless — with awfullest beauty) — it listens —

 At my wearisome task — I oftentimes — turn 
 
 From my bride and my wearisome monitress — (Duty,) 
 Forgetting the strife — and the wrestle of life, 
 
 (To talk — with the spirit of beauty.) 
 The midtitude's hum, and the chinking of gold, 
 
 Grow hush — as the dying day, — 
 For — on wings — (pulsing music,) with joy untold, 
 
 My heart — is up — and away! 
 I fain would struggle — and give to birth; 
 For I would not pass away from earth — 
 
 And make no sign ! 
 I yearn to utter — what might live on 
 In the world's heart when I am gone. 
 I — would not plod on (like these slaves of gold, 
 
 Who shut up their souls in a dusky cave:) 
 I would see the world better and nobler-souVd, 
 
 Ere I dream of heaven — in my green turf-grave. 
 I may toil till my life — is fill'd with dreariness, — 
 Toil — 'till my heart — is a wreck in its iveariness, 
 Toil — for ever for &a?*-steep'd bread, 
 Till I go down — to the silent dead. 
 But — by this yearning, — this hoping, — this achmg, 
 I — was not made merely — for money-making.

 As radiant — of immortal youth — j

 Their garb — is black, — and black — the arras is, — 
 And sad — the general aspect. Yet their looks — 
 Are calm — and cheerful, — nothing there — like grief. 
 Nothing — or harsh — or cruel. Still — that noise, 
 Th't low — and dismal moaning. 
 
 Half withdrawn, — 
 (A little to the left,) — sits one — in crimson, — 
 A venerable man,— fourscore — and five. 
 Cold drops of sweat — stand on his furrowed brow; 
 His hands — are clenched; his eyes — hsdf-shut and glazed; 
 His shrunk — and withered limbs — rigid — as marble. 
 'T is Foscaki, — the Doge. And there is one, — 
 (A young man,) — lying — at his feet, stretched out 
 In torture. 'T is his son. 'T is Giacomo, — 
 His only joy, — (and has he — lived for this?) 
 Accused — of murder. Yesternight — the proofs, — 
 (If proofs — they be,) were in the lion's mouth 
 Dropt — by some hand unseen; and — he — {himself)

 Chased down his last — of four : twice — did he ask

 An oath exacting, — never — more — to ask : 
 And there — he sits, — a spectacle of woe, — 
 Condemned, — (in bitter mockery,) to icear 
 The bauble — he had sighed for. 
 
 Once — again — 
 The screw — is turned ; and as it turns the son 
 Looks up, — and (in a faint — and broken tone) 
 Murmurs — " My father ! " The old man — shrinks back,- 
 And — (in his mantle) muffles up his face. 
 "Art thou not guilty?" says a voice — th't once — 
 "Would greet the sufferer — (long before they met,) — 
 "Art thou — not guilty?" — " No I Indeed, — I am not!" 
 But all — is unavailing. In that court — 
 Groans — are confessions ; patience, — fortitude, — 
 The work of magic: and — released, — revived — 
 For condemnation — from his father's lips, — 
 He hears — the sentence, — "Banishment — to Candia. 
 Death — if he leaves it." And the bark — sets sail, 
 And he is gone — from all he loves — in life! 
 Gone — in the dead of night — unseen — of any, —

 (Day — after day, — year — after year,) — he haunts 
 
 An ancient rampart — th't o'erhangs the sea; 
 
 Gazing on vacancy, — and hourly — there 
 
 (Starting — as from some wild — and uncouth dream) 
 
 To answer to the watch. Alas! how changed —

 Still in that seat — as though he had not stirred; 
 
 Immovable — and muffled in his cloak. 
 
 But now — he comes — convicted of a crime — 
 Great — by the laws of Venice. Night — and day — 
 Brooding — on what he had been, — what he was, — ■

 Thickened upon him. His desire — for home 
 Became a madness; and (resolved to go —

 A letter — to the sovereign prince of Milan,

 Those — where the giants stand, (guarding the ascent,) 
 Monstrous — terrific. At the foot — he stopt, — 
 And (on his staff — still leaning.) turned — and said, — 
 " By mine own merits — did I come. I go — 
 Driven — by the malice — of mine enemies!' 
 Then — to his boat withdrew, — (poor — as he cayne,) — 
 Amid the sighs — of those — th't dared not speak. 
 
 This journey — was his last. "When the bell rang — 
 (At dawn,) — announcing a new Doge to Venice, 
 It found him — on his knees — before the cross, — 
 Clasping his aged hands — in earnest prayer; 
 And there — he died. Ere half its task was done — 
 It rang his knell. 
 
 But whence — the deadly hate 
 Th't caused all this, — the hate of Soredano ? 
 It was a legacy — his father left, — 
 "Who (but — for Foscari) had reigned in Venice, 
 And (like the venom — in the serpents bag) 
 Gathered — and grew ! Nothing — but turned to hate !

 XLIL— LAMENT OF THE PEKI FOR HINDA. 
 
 Farewell ! farewell to thee, — Araby's daughter ! 
 
 (Thus — warbled a Peri — beneath th' dark sea,) 
 No pearl — ever lay — under Oman's green water 
 
 More pure — in its shell — than thy spirit — in thee. 
 
 Oh! fair— as th' sea-flower — close to thee growing, — 
 How light— was thy heart— till Love's witchery came, 
 
 Like th' wind — of the south— o'er a summer lute — blowing,- 
 And husKd— all its music, — and withered— its frame! 
 
 But long (upon Araby's — green — sunny highlands) 
 Shall maids — and their lovers — remember th' doom 
 
 Of her — who lies sleeping — among the Pearl Islands, 
 With naught — but th' sea-star t' light up her tomb. 
 
 And still — when th' merry date-season — is burning, 
 
 And calls t' th' palm^groves — th' young — and th' old, — 
 
 Th' happiest there, — from their pastime returning 
 At sunset, — will weep — when thy story is told.

 And shells his nuts — at liberty. 
 
 In orarc^e-groves — and myrtle-bowers, 
 
 (That breathe a gale — of fragrance round,)

 "With my loved lute's — romantic sound, 
 
 Or crowns — of living laurel weave 
 
 For those — th't win the race — at eve. 
 
 The shepherds horn — (at break of day,) 
 
 The ballet danced (in twilight glade,) 
 The canzonet — and roundelay — 
 
 Sung — in the silent — green-wood shade; 
 Those simple joys — (th't never fail) 
 Shall bind me — to my native vale.

 XLIV.— THE SHIPWRECK. Byron. 
 
 'T was twilight, and the sunless day — went down — 
 
 Over the waste of waters, like a veil, 
 Which — (if withdraion) would but disclose the frown— 
 
 Of one whose hate — is masked — but to assail. 
 Thus — to their hopeless eyes — the night was shown, 
 
 And grimly darkled — o'er the faces pale, 
 And the dim — desolate deep ; twelve days — had Fear — 
 "Been their familiar, — and now — Death — was here ! 
 
 Then — rose — (from the sea) — the wild farewell, — 
 
 Then — shrieked — the timid, — and stood still — the brave, — 
 
 Then — some — leaped overboard — (with dreadful yell,) 
 As eager — to anticipate — their grave ; 
 
 And the sea — yawned around her — (like a hell,) 
 
 And down — she sucked with her — the whirling wave t 
 
 Like one — who grapples — with his enemy, — 
 
 And strives to strangle him — before he die ! 
 
 And first — one universal shriek — there rushed, — 
 Louder — than the loud ocean, like a crash — 
 
 Of echoing thunder; and then — all — was hushed, 
 Save the wild wind — and the remorseless dash 
 
 Of billows; but — (at intervals) there gushed, — 
 (Accompanied — with a convulsive splash,) 
 
 A solitary shriek, the bubbling cry — 
 
 Of some strong swimmer — in his agony. 
 
 There were two fathers — (in this ghastly crew,) — 
 And with them — their two sons, — of whom the one — 
 
 "Was more robust — and hardy — to the view ; 
 But he — died — early ; and when he was gone 
 
 His nearest mess-mate — told his sire, who threw 
 
 One glance on him, — and said, — "Heaven's will — be done I 
 
 I — can do nothing ! " and he saiv him — thrown 
 
 Into the deep, — without a tear — or groan I 
 
 The other father — had a weaklier child, — 
 
 Of a soft cheek — and aspect delicate; 
 But — the boy — bore up — long, — and (with a mild — 
 
 And patient spirit) — held aloof — his fate; 
 Little — he said, — and now — and then — he smiled, — 
 
 As if to win a part — from off the weight — 
 He saw increasing — on his father's heart, 
 With the deep — deadly thought — th't they must parti 
 
 And o'er him — bent his sire, and never raised 
 His eyes — from ofi* his face, — but wiped the foam 
 
 From his pule lips, — and ever — on him gazed! 
 
 And when the wished-for shower — (at length) was come, 
 
 And the boy's eyes, — (which the dull film — hntf-glazcd,) — 
 Brightened, and — (for a moment) seemed to roam,

 He squeezed — (from out a rag) some drops of rain. — 
 Into his dying child's mouth; but — in vain! 
 
 The hoy expired; the father — held the clay, — 
 
 And looked upon it long ; and when (at last) 
 Death — left no doubt, — and the dead burden — lay 
 
 Stiff — on his heart, — and pulse — and hope was past, 
 He watched it — {wistfully,) — until away 
 
 'T was borne — by the rude wave — wherein 'twas cast; 
 Then— he — [himself) sunk down — all dumb — and shivering, 
 And gave no sign — of life, — save his limbs — quivering. 
 
 XLV.— ORIGIN OF FEELINGS, THOUGHTS, AND ACTS. 
 
 The origin of beauty, love, — and truth, — 
 Of light, life, motion, and immortal youth, 
 Of form, of music, sweetnsss, — and delight, 
 Flashes — from God's own image — on my sight. 
 I feel the pidses — of the Eternal Soul — 
 In all my veins. My thoughts — within me — roll 
 Like new-born planets, flushed with happy life; 
 My nature — is at rest. There is no strife, 
 No battle — of contending forms, — above 
 Earth — and its spheres. 
 
 Know ye the land of love ? 
 Its ancient boundaries, the broad extent — 
 Of its illimitable continent? 
 "Where'er worlds bloom — and spirit skies unfold, 
 Outflow its atmospheres — of living gold. 
 The universe — is like a silver bell ; — 
 The tongue of time — such harmony doth tell 
 That worlds — are formed within the widening sea — 
 Of our divine, — perpetual ecstasy. 
 
 XL VI.— THE LUST OF POWER. Pollok. 
 
 One passion — prominent appears : — the lust 
 Of power, — which oft-times — took the fairer name — 
 Of liberty, — and hung the popular flag — 
 Of freedom out. Many, — indeed, its names. 
 "When — on the throne it sat, — and round the neck 
 Of millions — riveted — its iron chain, 
 And on the shoulders of the people — laid 
 Burdens — unmerciful, — it title took — 
 Of tyranny, — oppression, — despotism ; 
 And every tongue — was weary — cursing it. 
 "When in the multitude — it gathered strength, — 
 And, (like an ocean — bursting — from its bounds, — 
 Long beat in vain,) went forth resistlessly, — 
 It bore the stamp — and designation then 
 Of popular fury, — anarchy, — rebellion;

 All laws — annulled; all property — destroyed;

 Jnnumerous — as the shapes — and robes — it wore. 
 
 But — under every name, — in nature — still — 
 
 Invariably — the same, — and always — bad, 
 
 Conflicting cruelly — against itself,

 This — was earth's liberty, — its nature — this,

 To make them do, — undo, — eat, — drink, — stand, — move, 
 Talk, — think, — and feel — exactly — as he chose. 
 Hence — the eternal strife — of brotherhoods, 
 Of individuals, — families, — commonwealths. 
 The root — (from which it grew) — was pride; bad root, — 
 And bad — the fruit it bore. Then wonder not 
 Th't long — the nations — from it — richly reaped 
 Oppression, — slavery, — tyranny, — and war ; 
 Confusion, — desolation, — trouble, — shame. 
 And, marvelous — tho' it seems, — this monster, — (when 
 It took the name — of slavery, — as oft 
 It did,) — had advocates — to plead its cause; 
 Beings th't walked erect, — and spoke — like men 
 Of Christian parentage descended too, 
 And dipped — in the baptismal font, — as sign 
 Of dedication — to the Prince — who bowed — 
 To death — to set the sm-bound prisoner — free. 
 
 ZTircchristian thought! on what pretense — soever — 
 Of right inherited, — or else — acquired; — 
 Of loss, — or ]irofit, — or what plea — you name, — 
 To buy — and sell, — to barter, — whip, — and hold — 
 In chains — a being — of celestial make; 
 Of kindred form, — of kindred faculties, — 
 Of kindred feelings,— passions, — thoughts, — desires; 
 Born—free — and heir — of an immortal hope; 
 Thought — villainous, — absurd, — detestable ! 
 Unworthy to be harbored — in & fiend I

 His withered cheek — and tresses gray — 
 Seemed to have known a better day. 
 The harp, (his sole remaining joy,) 
 "Was carried by an orphan boy. 
 The last of all the bards — was he 
 "Who sung — of Border chivalry. 
 For, well-SL-d&y ! their date — was fled, 
 His tuneful brethren — all were dead; 
 And he, neglected — and oppressed, 
 "Wished to be with them, — and at rest. 
 No more, — on prancing palfrey borne, 
 He caroled, — light as lark — at morn; 
 No longer, courted — and caressed, 
 High placed in hall, a welcome guest, 
 He poured — to lord — and lady gay — 
 The unpremeditated lay. 
 Old times — were changed, old manners — gone; 
 A stranger — filled the Stuarts' 1 throne. 
 A wandering harper, {scorned — and poor,) 
 He begged his bread — from door — to door; 
 And tuned, (to please a, peasant's ear,) 
 The harp — a king — had loved to hear. 
 
 He passed — where NeioarKs stately tower 
 Looks out from Yarrow's birchen bower;

 The Minstrel gazed — with wishful eye; 
 No humbler resting-place — was nigh. 
 "With hesitating step — at last 
 Th' embattled portal-arch he Dassed, 
 Whose ponderous gate — and massy bar 
 Had oft — rolled back the tide of war, 
 But never closed the iron door 
 Against the desolate and poor. 
 The Duchess — marked his weary pace, 
 His timid mien, and reverend face, 
 And bade her page — the menials tell 
 That they should tend the old man — well; 
 For she — had known adversity, 
 Though born — in such a high degree ; 
 In pride of power, in beauty 's bloom, 
 Had wept — o'er Monmouth's bloody tomb. 
 
 • 
 When kindness — had his wants supplied, 
 And the old man — was gratified, 
 Began to rise — his minstrel pride : 
 And he began to talk, anon, 
 Of good Earl Francis, (dead — and gone;) 
 And how full many a tale he knew — 
 Of the old warriors — of Buccleugh ; 
 And would the noble Duchess — deign 
 To listen to an old man's strain, 
 Though stiff — his hand, his voice — though weak, 
 He thought even yet, — the sooth to speak, — 
 That if she loved the harp to hear, 
 He could make music — to her ear. 
 
 The humble boon — was soon obtained ; 
 The aged Minstrel — audience gained. 
 But when he reached the room of state, 
 Where she, with all her ladies, sate, 
 Perchance — he wished his boon denied: 
 For when to tune his harp he tried 
 His trembling hand had lost the ease — 
 Which marks security — to please; 
 And scenes, (long past,) of joy and pain, 
 Came wildering — o'er his aged brain; 
 He tried to tune his harp — in vain. 
 The pitying Duchess — praised its chime, 
 And gave him heart, and gave him time, 
 Till every string's according glee — 
 Was blended — into harmony. 
 And then, (he said,) he would full fain 
 He could recall an ancient strain 
 He never thought to sing again.

 And much he wished, yet feared, to try 
 The long-forgotten melody. 
 
 Amid the strings — his fingers strayed, 
 And an uncertain warbling made; 
 And oft — he shook his hoary head : 
 But when he caught the measure wild, 
 The old man raised his face, and smiled; 
 And lightened up his faded eye 
 "With all a poefs ecstasy! 
 In varying cadence, soft — or strong, 
 He swept the sounding chords along; 
 The present scene, the future lot, 
 His toil, his wants, were all forgot : 
 Cold diffidence, and age's frost, 
 In the full tide of song were lost ; 
 Each blank — in faithless memory void 
 The poet's glowing thought supplied ; 
 And while his harp — responsive rang, 
 'T was thus — the latest Minstrel sang : 
 
 11 Breathes there the man, with soul — so dead, 
 "Who never — to himself — hath said, 
 
 1 This — is my own, — my native land ! ' 
 "Whose heart — hath ne'er within him burned 
 As home — his footsteps he hath turned 
 
 From wandering — on a foreign strand ! 
 If such — there breathe, go, mark him well; 
 Por him — no minstrel raptures swell : 
 High — though his titles, proud — his name, 
 Boundless — his wealth — as ivish can claim, — 
 Despite those titles,— power, and pelf, 
 The wretch, concenter'd all in self, 
 Living — shall forfeit — fair renown, 
 And, doubly dying, shall go down —

 Still, — as I view each well-known scene,

 Still — feel the breeze — down Ettrick break, 
 Although it chill — my withered cheek; 
 Still lay my head — on Teviot stone,

 He had a son : it was a rosy boy, — 
 A little faithful copy — of his sire — 
 In face — and gesture. From infancy — the child 
 Had been his father's solace — and his care. 
 
 "With earliest morn 
 Of that first day — of darkness — and amaze — 
 He came. The iron door — was closed — for them, — 
 Never — to open more! The day, — the night, — 
 Dragged slowly by ; nor did they know the fate — 
 Impending o'er the city. Well they heard 
 The pent-up thunders — in the earth beneath, — 
 And felt its giddy rocking; and the air 
 Grew hot (at length,) and thick. But in his straw 
 The boy — was sleeping : and the father hoped 
 The earthquake — might pass by; nor would he wake— 
 (From his sound rest) the unfearing child, — nor tell 
 The dangers — of their state. On his low couch

 The fettered soldier sunk, — and — (with deep aioe) — 
 
 Listened — 'the fearful sounds : — with upturned eye — 
 
 To the great gods — he breathed a prayer ; — then — strove 
 
 To calm himself, and lose — (in sleep) — awhile 
 
 His useless terrors. But he could not sleep: 
 
 His body — burned with feverish heat; — his chains — 
 
 Clanked loud, — although he moved not ; deep — in earth — 
 
 Groaned unimaginable thunders : — sounds, — 
 
 (Fearfid — and ominous,) arose — and died, 
 
 (Like the sad moanings — of November's wind,) 
 
 In the blank midnight. Deepest horror — chilled 
 
 His blood — that burned — before ; cold, clammy sweats —

 Shot through his veins. Now — on his couch— he shrunk,

 As though he heard the battle-trumpet sound,

 He slept — at last, 
 A troubled, — dreamy sleep. Well — had he slept, 
 Never— to waken more! His hours — are few, — 
 But terrible — his agony. 
 
 Loudly — the father — called upon his child: 
 No voice — replied. Trembling — and anxiously — 
 He searched their couch of straw : — with headlong haste- 
 Trod round his stinted limits, — and, — low bent, — 
 Groped darkling — on the earth: no child — was there. 
 Again he called : again at farthest stretch — 
 Of his accursed fetters, — till the blood — 
 Seemed bursting — from his ears, — and from his eyes 
 Fire flashed : he strained, with arm — extended far. 
 And fingers — widely spread, — greedy — to touch — 
 Though but his idoVs garment. Useless toil! 
 Yet still — renewed: still round — and round he goes, — 
 And strains, — and snatches, — and — (with dreadful cries) — 
 Calls on his boy. Mad frenzy — fires him now : 
 He plants against the wall — his feet; his chain — 
 Grasps; tugs — (with gia,nt strength) to force away — 
 The deep-driven staple : yells — and shrieks — with rage, 
 And, — (like a desert lion — in the snare — 
 Eaging — to break his toils,) — to and fro — bounds. 
 But see ! the ground is opening : a blue light 
 Mounts, — gently waving, — noiseless : thin — and cold — 
 It seems, — and — like a rainbow tint, not flame; 
 But — by its luster, — (on the earth outstretched,) — 
 Behold the lifeless child! His dress is singed, — 
 And o'er his face serene — a darkened line 
 Points out the lightning's track. 
 
 Silent — and pale — 
 The father stands : no tear — is in his eye :

 Through every swift vicissitude

 Ever — th' flowers — that I bedew —

 So get thee back ! Oh, get thee back ! 
 
 Nor touch my golden locks — with gray. 
 Why — should'st thou follow — on my track ? 
 
 Let me be happy — while I way." 
 
 " Good friend, — thou needest — sage advice ; 
 
 I'll keep thy heart — from growing proud; — 
 I'll fill thy mind — with kindly thoughts, — 
 
 And link thy pity — t' the crowd. 
 Would'st have a heart — of pulseless stone ? 
 
 Would'st be too happy — to be good? 
 Nor make a human woe — thine own, — 
 
 For sake — of human brotherhood?" 
 
 " Get thee back, — Sorrow, — get thee back!

 "While the anguish — is festering — yet, 
 None, none — but an angel of God — can declare, — 
 
 " I now — can forgive — and — forget."

 And the lips — are in penitence — steeped, 
 "With the wrong so repented — the wrath — will depart, 
 
 Though scorn or injustice — were heaped; 
 For the best compensation — is paid for all ill

 At once — to forgive — and forget.

 To forget ? It is hard — for a man — with a mind, 
 
 However his heart may forgive, 
 To blot out — all insults — and evils — behind,

 Then how — shall it be? for at every turn 
 
 Recollection — the spirit — will fret, 
 And the ashes — of injury — smolder — and burn,

 And if all thy harms — are forgotten,— forgiven,

 Oh, who would not gladly — take lessons — of heaven. 
 
 Nor learn to forgive — and forget ? 
 
 Yes, yes ; let a man when his enemy — weeps

 For thus — on his head — in kindness he heaps 
 
 Hot coals — to refine — and amend; 
 And hearts — th't are Christian more eagerly yearn,

 LXVII.— PICTURES HANGING ON MEMOKY'S WALL. Carey. 
 
 Among the beautiful pictures th't hang on memory's wall 
 
 Is one — of a dim — old forest, — th't seemeth best — of all: 
 
 Not — for its gnarled oaks — olden, — dark — with th' mistletoe, — 
 
 Nor — for th' violets golden — that sprinkle th' vale — below; 
 
 Not — for th' milk-white lilies — that lean from the fragrant hedge, — 
 
 Coquetting — (all day) with th' sunbeams and stealing — their golden edge; — 
 
 Nor — for th' vines on the upland — where th' bright — red berries rest, — 
 
 Nor th' pinks, — nor th' pale — sweet cowslip — it seemeth to me th' best. 
 
 I once — had a little brother, — with eyes — th't were dark — and deep; — 
 
 In th' lap — of the old — dim forest — he lieth — (in peace) — asleep. 
 
 Light — as the down — of th' thistle, — free — as the winds — th't blow, — 
 
 We roved there th' beautiful summers, — (th' summers — of long ago;) 
 
 But his feet — (on th' hills) — grew weary, — and — (one of th' autumn eves)— 
 
 I made— (for my little brother) a bed — of th' yellow leaves. 
 
 Sweetly — his pale arms — folded my neck — in a meek embrace, — 
 As th' light — of immortal beauty — silently — covered his face: 
 And — (when the arrows of sunset — lodged in the free-top's height) — 
 He fell, — (in his saint-like beauty,) — asleep — by th' gates — of light! 
 Therefore — of all the pictures — th't hang — on memory's wall — 
 The one — of the dim — old forest — seemeth — th' best — of all. 
 
 LXVIIL— THE LAST LEAF, OR THE OLD MAN. Holmes.

 They say — th't in his prime, — ere th' pruning-knife of time — cut him down, 
 Not a better man — was found — by the crier — on his round thro' the town. 
 
 But now — he walks th' streets, — and he looks at all he meets, sad — and wan, — 
 And he shakes — his feeble head, — th't it seems — as if he said, — ("They are 
 
 gone!") 
 Th' mossy marbles — rest — on th' lips — th't he has pressed — in their bloom, 
 And th' names — he loved — to hear — have been carved — for many a year on th' 
 
 tomb. 
 
 My grandmamma — has said — (poor old lady — she is dead-^-long ago) — 
 That he had a Roman nose, — and his cheek — was like a rose — in th' snow. 
 But now — his nose is thin, — and it rests — upon his chin — like a staff, — 
 And a crook — is in his back — and a melancholy crack — in his laugh. 
 
 I know — it is a sin — for me — t' sit — and grin at him — here; 
 
 Yet the old — M?*ee-cornered hat, — and th' breeches, — and all that — are so queer! 
 And if /—should live to be th' last leaf — upon th' tree — in th' spring, — 
 Let them smile — as J do now — at the old forsaken bough — where I cling.

 READERS and SPELLERS 
 
 By NOBLE BUTLER, A. M. 
 
 BUTLER'S FIRST BOOK IN SPELLING AND READING. 72 PP $o 20 
 
 BUTLER'S AMERICAN SPELLING-BOOK, illustrated. ieo PP 20 
 
 The First Book is introductory to Butler's New School Eeaders and to 
 Butler's Goodrich Keaders. It is so arranged that it may be used for teaching 
 by the common method, the phonetic method, or the word method. It is beauti- 
 fully illustrated. 
 
 The American Spelling-Book is arranged on the P rinci P le of presenting 
 one new thing at a time, and repeating until that thing has become familiar. 
 By judicious classification the use of marks and figures is almost entirely 
 avoided, and the P u P il is led in a gradual and easy manner to the correct 
 spelling and pronunciation. "While words are strictly classified according to 
 sound in the body of the work, the author has grouped according to their genus 
 many words that could not be so arranged. These lessons are appropriately 
 illustrated. 
 
 BUTLER'S NEW FIRST SCHOOL READER. 96 PP $0 20 
 
 BUTLER'S NEW SECOND SCHOOL READER. 168 PP 40 
 
 BUTLER'S NEW THIRD SCHOOL READER. 240 PP 55 
 
 In the New First School Header the lessons are so arranged that the 
 child will find but little difficulty in reading them. The language employed 
 in these lessons is simple and natural, such as every child understands. But, 
 though the language is simple, it is accurate. There are no awkward inver- 
 sions — no vulgarisms. 
 
 The New Second School Keader contains a systematic course of exercises 
 on the vowel-sounds, beginning with the short sounds and proceeding regularly 
 through the long and the occasional sounds. By being distributed through the 
 book these exercises present a less formidable appearance than if they were 
 placed all together. In the spirit and beauty of its illustrations, of which there 
 are about seventy, this book is unrivaled. 
 
 The lessons in Butler's New Third School Eeader are such as to excite 
 the interest of the child and make him enter into the spirit of what he reads, 
 so that he will read in a natural manner without being troubled with formal 
 and unmeaning rules. While the main object is to teach the child to read, the 
 tone of this book is intended to be such as to cultivate his moral feelings, to 
 instill into his mind a love of nature, and to train him to think and observe. 
 This Keader contains a well-arranged course of exercises on the consonant- 
 sounds. 
 
 Butler's New Fourth School Eeader is in press. The Fifth and 
 Sixth Beaders of the same series are in preparation. 
 
 * ** These Readers are beautifully illustrated. They may safely be pronounced 
 superior to all others in typography and general merit. They are at once the 
 best and the cheapest. The greater portion of the matter is entirely original.

 ENGLISH GRAMMARS. 
 
 By NOBLE BUTLER, A. M. 
 
 BUTLER'S INTRODUCTORY LESSONS IN ENGLISH GRAMMAR. 
 
 72 pp. Price, 20 cents. 
 
 This little book is designed merely as an introduction to a larger work on the same subject 
 by the same author. Its object is to make the young learner acquainted with the parts 
 or speech and their inflections. More reliance is placed on the exercises than on the 
 definitions. It is recommended to the teacher that, in addition to the examples and illus- 
 trations, he should take some simple reading- book, and give his pupils thorough practice in 
 distinguishing the parts of speech, cases, moods, tenses, etc. The First, Second, and Third 
 School Readers, by Noble Butler, are well adapted to this purpose, all the lessons having been 
 prepared with especial reference to the capacity of very young children, and the words being 
 easy and generally short. 
 
 BUTLER'S PRACTICAL GRAMMAR OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 
 
 254 pp. Price, 85 cents. 
 
 A simple and thorough grammar of the English language. It is the most popular treatise 
 of its kind, and is more generally used in the schools of the South and West than any other 
 similar work. 
 
 The notable features of this Grammar are the mode of treating adjectives, pronouns, 
 verbs, prepositions, and adverbs in the etymology ; the syntax ; and the " Parsing Exercises " 
 at the end of the book. These exercises consist principally of selections from the best 
 writers ; and they are regularly arranged according to the rules and remarks in the syntax. 
 Thus every principle is illustrated by quotations from the best authorities. Difficulties are 
 removed by notes at the bottom of the page. In the first edition new names were given to 
 the tenses,*and an apology was offered therefor ; but these names have found so much favor 
 with the best grammarians that the apology is no longer needed. 
 
 LATIN GRAMMAR: 
 
 A COMPENDIOUS MANUAL FOR SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES. 
 
 By HENRY M. BRUNS, LL. D. 
 
 Professor of Ancient Languages and Classical Literature in the College of Charleston, S. C. 
 
 212 pages, 12mo. 
 
 The result of forty years' experience in teaching the Latin language, this book is 
 confidently claimed to be the completest Manual ever prepared. The arrangement of 
 subjects is philosophical and thorough; the definitions are simple and exact. While the 
 departments of Etymology and Syntax are exceptionally entire, the Prosody treats fully of 
 versification and elaborately discusses all the metres of Horace and other poets ; its mastery 
 makes easy the study of Latin poetry. 
 
 In an Appendix 'are contained convenient Tables of Case and Tense-endings of all the 
 declensions of nouns and adjectives and the conjugations of verbs. Also is found a complete 
 list of all Irregular Verbs, classed according to their termination. Gender Rules are given 
 in verse, which, though it may not possess the polish of a Tennyson or Longfellow, will be 
 found musical, and will greatly assist the pupil in acquiring and retaining a knowledge of the 
 gender of nouns. 
 
 BH5"" The Prosody " will be nicely bound, and may be bought separately at half the price 
 of Bruns's Grammar, by those who can not at once change the "book they are using. 
 
 «...* The publishers offer these books for introduction and use in the schools throughout 
 the country on the most favorable terms. Specimen copies for examination will be sent on 
 receipt of half the respective retail prices.

 BRONSON'S MANUAL OF ELOCUTION: 
 
 EMBRACING THE 
 
 PHILOSOPHY OF VOCALIZATION, 
 
 WITH ILLUSTRATIONS AND EXERCISES FOR DRILL IN ALL THE ARTS OF READING 
 AND DECLAMATION. 
 
 Edited by Mrs. LAURA M. BRONSON. 
 
 Cloth. 330 pages, 8vo. 
 
 The veteran and well-known elocutionist, Professor C. P. Bronson, left at his death a large 
 quantity of manuscript, embracing matter on all the principles involved in voice-culture, 
 reading, and speaking. It was found upon examination that much condensation and arrange- 
 ment of these papers were necessary. This has been a labor requiring time, care, and 
 experience. The result is now before the public. 
 
 The work treats of the principles of Elocution in accordance with Physiological and 
 Mental Science; and contains selections for readings with the emphatic words and rhetorical 
 pauses indicated. It is eminently philosophical, and is a proper text-book for both teacher 
 and pupil. Nothing but what has been proved to be altogether essential has found place in 
 this work. 
 
 BUTLER'S COMMON-SCHOOL SPEAKER. 
 
 360 pages. Price $1.00. 
 
 This book is designed for young pupils. Accordingly the pieces are generally short, and 
 composed of short sentences. The subjects are familiar, and within the scope of the young 
 understanding. The topics are mostly fresh, and the selections varied. The dialogues are of 
 simple structure and moderate length, and are easy of comprehension. Some pieces are in- 
 serted of more elevated character, chiefly on patriotic subjects, from such authors as Webster, 
 Prentiss, Everett, etc. 
 
 For a full and systematic course of instruction and practice in the principles of Elocution, 
 reference is made to Bronson's Elocution, to which this little book is subsidiary. 
 
 ORIGINAL DRAMAS, 
 
 DIALOGUES, DECLAMATIONS, AND TABLEAUX- VIVANS, FOR SCHOOL EXHIBI- 
 TIONS, MAY-DAY CELEBRATIONS, AND PARLOR THEATRICALS. 
 
 By Mrs. RUSSELL KAVANAUGH. 
 
 252 pages. Price, 90 cents. 
 
 The author, during the several years in which she had charge of a school, experienced 
 difficulty in procuring dialogues suitable for the customary annual exhibitions, and therefore 
 fi'om time to time wrote out plays adapted to the tastes and capacities of her pupils. A col- 
 lection of these pieces in their present form is her contribution to the literature of our schools. 
 As the dramas contained in this book are simple, they will be found suitable for home or parlor 
 theatricals. The use of this attractive little work will enliven the dull routine of juvenile 
 instruction with a charm not often enjoyed in the school-room.

 and by Teachers' Associations and Conventions every where throughout the

 electrotype plates, and contains 360 pages, large 12mo. 
 
 "In the preparation of this work it has been no part of the compiler's aim 
 to be original. He has sought rather to select from the various treatises on this 
 subject those rules and exercises which have been approved by the experience 
 of teachers, and to combine them into one consistent whole, arranged with 
 reference to the progressive development of the learner's powers." — Extract 
 from the Preface. 
 
 It is a capital work in plan and execution, and worthy of introduction into our best 
 institutions of learning. — N. Lawrence Lindsley, Lebanon, Tenn. 
 
 It is just the book that is needed in our schools. It is admirable for its conciseness, its 
 comprehensiveness, the accuracy of its definitions, and the appropriateness of its examples. 
 W. Shetton, PresCt West Tennessee' College. 
 
 I consider it an admirable compilation. The arrangement of the whole work is philo- 
 sophical, and the chapters on Invention and Expression are very complete. — Charles Taylor, 
 Pies' t Kentucky Wesley an University. 
 
 A treatise well calculated to serve as a text-book in schools and colleges, and at the same 
 time just such a guide as very many of our young professional and business men greatly 
 need. — F. Berrien Lindsley, Chancellor University of Nashville. 
 
 I am very well pleased with it. The plan is excellent, and I think the execution well 
 sustained.— John N. Waddel, LL. D., Chancellor University of Mississippi. 
 
 I have long wanted just such a help in the school-room.— A. L. Hamilton, Pres't Andrew 
 Female College, Cuthbert, Ga.

 Shelbyville, Ky.
