SCIENCE OF ELOCUTION. 
 
 BY S. S. HAMILL. 
 
 TESTIMONIALS. 
 
 From Andrew D. White, LL.D., President of Cornell University, lak 
 Professor of History and English Literature, Michigan University. 
 
 University op Michigan, Ann Arbor. 
 
 Mr. S. S. Hamill has taught large Elocution classes in this institu- 
 tion, and has given perfect satisfaction. 
 
 His exercises for developing the voice, and inculcating its right 
 tone, cannot, I think, be surpassed. A. D. White. 
 
 From Rev. H. P. Tappan, D.D., LL.D., Chancellor of Michigan Uni- 
 versity. 
 It affords me much pleasure to commend Mr. S. S. Hamill to Col* 
 leges and Schools as a teacher of Elocution. Mr. Hamill is himself 
 an excellent elocutionist, but this would be of small account if he 
 merely taught his pupils to imitate his own manner and tones. His 
 worth as an instructor in this very important, but too much neg- 
 lected, branch consists in the inculcation of correct principles of Elo- 
 cution, and in subjecting his pupils to a proper drill of the voice. 
 His aim is to correct bad habits of pronunciation and intonation, and 
 to bring out the natural power and compass of the human voice. He 
 is, besides, very faithful and diligent, and spares no pains to accom- 
 plish his object. Mr. Hamill succeeds also in winning the esteem 
 and respect of his pupils by his gentlemanly bearing. He has 
 formed voluntary classes in this institution for two successive sea- 
 sons, and has given great satisfaction. Henry P. Tappan. 
 
 From Rev. D. A. Wallace, D.D., LL.D., late President of Monmouth 
 College. 
 Prof. Hamill : I have examined your book, and am prepared to 
 say deliberately, that I like it exceedingly. I expected much : my 
 expectations are more than realized. I see that you are to lead the 
 profession in the United States.

2 Testimonials. 
 
 From William Russell, Professor of Elocution, Lancaster, Mass., 
 Author of Vocal Culture, Pulpit Elocution, etc., etc. 
 
 Professor Hamill Dear Sir : Tour favor of the ninth gave me 
 the rare pleasure of perceiving that Dr. Rush's Philosophy of the 
 Voice, as exemplified in my manual of Orthophony (or Vocal Culture), 
 has led an intelligent and accomplished teacher of Elocution to prose- 
 cute for himself the analysis of vocal expression into its interesting 
 and instructive details. The closeness of your investigations must 
 have been a source of great pleasure, as well as conscious intellectual 
 discipline, to yourself, and I have no doubt that it will greatly en- 
 hance the benefit of your instructions to others. . . .Let me assure 
 you that the ingenuity and thoroughness of your scheme gives me 
 peculiar pleasure, from the attempt to give philosophical complete- 
 ness to a tabular view of the phenomena of vocal expression. 
 
 William Russell. 
 
 From Rev. 0. N. Hartshorn, LL.D., President of Mount Union 
 College. 
 
 Feeling a deep interest in the important subject of Elocution, and 
 being personally acquainted with Professor S. S. Hamill, a scholar 
 and gentleman of high standing, I take the liberty to introduce him 
 to the favorable consideration of all persons interested in this too 
 much neglected branch of education. Mr. Hamill is the most accom- 
 plished, thorough, and systematic teacher of Elocution that I have 
 ever met. He has taught some five classes, composed of students 
 and professors of Mount Union College, with satisfactory results. 1 
 attended three of these classes with great profit and pleasure to my- 
 self. While Mr. Hamill has been here he has arranged a simple dia- 
 gram, which, in my judgment, gives in one view to the eye an accu- 
 rate and comprehensive outline of each style of utterance. I have 
 examined it carefully, and think it highly adapted in its plan and exe- 
 cution to illustrate, when explained by him, that most difficult and 
 important, but too much neglected, department of education, the va. 
 jious qualities, forms, stress, pitch, and movement of voice, to be ex 
 emplified in the utterance of each style of sentiment. 
 
 0. N. Hartshorn. 
 
 From Alexander Campbell, President of Bethany College, Va. 
 Having recently had the pleasure of hearing the distinguished 
 Elocutionist, Mr. S. S. Hamill, deliver himself on the science and the 
 art of Elocution, in doing which he so scientifically and also artistic- 
 ally exhibited the orator in utterance and in action, I cannot but V9-

 ommeud him to all those youth who desire to acquire either the theory 
 or the practice of this most interesting and useful science and art. 
 
 A. Campbell. 
 
 From W. K. Pendleton, President of Bethany College. 
 
 To all who are interested in the attractive art of Elocution we take 
 pleasure in tendering a very cordial introduction of Mr. Hamill. He 
 has made Elocution his special profession, and besides his own very 
 high tJtainments in its practice, is eminently gifted as a teacher of it 
 to others. He has given instruction to a number of voluntary classes 
 in Bethany College, and with the most marked success. His gentle- 
 manly bearing, his accomplished mastery over his subject, his great 
 fidelity and energy as a teacher, and, withal, his genuine enthusiasm 
 in the noble art of Elocution, make Mr. Hamill a welcome instructor 
 to all who take his lessons. 
 
 His method is strictly scientific, and as a teacher he labors to point 
 out and exemplify the principles and exercises by which excellence 
 in oratorical utterance not only may, but must, be reached. We trust 
 that Mr. Hamill will be encouraged and sustained in his generous 
 efforts to elevate the tone of our Elocution, and that in his hands this 
 much-neglected and sometimes-despised element of a polished edu- 
 cation may be invested with new interest, and raised to a noble 
 place in the courses of our colleges. W. K. Pendleton. 
 
 From J. Baldwin, A.M., President State Normal ScJiool, Huntsville, 
 
 Texas. 
 Professor Hamill is the best teacher of Elocution in the United 
 States. 
 
 From The Christian Union {Henry Ward Beecher's paper). 
 
 Prof. Hamill has given us the most valuable matter, with a better 
 classification than we have seen. 
 
 From The Methodist Quarterly Review. 
 " The Science of Elocution," by Prof. Hamill, is without a superior 
 to our scholars, to our ministry, and to our academic, collegiate, and 
 theological classes. 
 
 From The Christian Advocate. 
 " The Science of Elocution," by Prof. Hamill, is the most scien- 
 tific in its methods and complete in its instructions of any on the 
 subject that we remember to have seen.

 scientific. It fully meets the demands of the class-room. 
 
 From J. B. Peaslee, Ph.D., Supt. Public Schools, Cincinnati, Ohio. 
 Prof. Hamill is one of the few who has reduced Elocution to a 
 science. His teaching is thorough and systematic. 
 
 From S. Estabrook, late Principal Michigan State Normal School 
 Prof. Hamill is the most thorough, systematic, and accomplished 
 teacher of Elocution I have ever met. His method is thoroughly 
 scientific, his manner is easy, natural, and inspiring. 
 
 From Datus C. Brooks, Prof, of English, Michigan University. 
 We have had other teachers of Elocution in this university, but 
 none so successful in his instructions. Regretting that we cannot 
 retain Mr. Hamill permanently here, he has my most cordial com- 
 mendation and warmest wishes for his success in the chosen profes- 
 sion of his life. Datus C. Brooks.

 PRE FACE 
 
 In the belief that Elocution should be studied as a 
 science as well as practiced as an art, the following 
 pages are presented to the public. 
 
 That Elocution is a science, that there are certain 
 established principles observed by all good speakers 
 and violated by all bad ones, none will deny who have 
 carefully investigated the subject. To understand and 
 to practically illustrate these principles should be the 
 prominent object of the student of Elocution. 
 
 The design of the work is to unfold the principles of 
 Elocution, to show their application to the different 
 forms of thought and emotion, to classify selections 
 under their appropriate styles, and, in connection there- 
 with, to furnish sufficient exercises for the cultivation 
 of the articulation, the tones of the voice, and the 
 graces of manner. 
 
 Without this all cultivation of the voice and manner 
 will be of little avail. Instances are numerous of stu- 
 dents who have carefully and diligently practiced the 
 exercises for the cultivation of the voice and manner, 
 so abundant in the various works on Elocution, and 
 derived therefrom all the advantages they propose, and 
 yet good readers and speakers are rare.

8 Preface. 
 
 A radical defect exists somewhere, or, contrary to all 
 experience and testimony, the ability to read and speak 
 well is not an acquirement. An experience of nearly 
 twenty years as a teacher in this department has con- 
 vinced the author that the study of Elocution usually 
 ceases where it really should begin, namely, with the 
 adaptation of the tones of the voice and the expression 
 of countenance to the sentiment uttered. 
 
 To correct in some degree this defect, and to awaken 
 a deeper interest in the subject of Elocution, is the 
 hope of the author in the present publication. 
 
 When Elocution shall be studied in our colleges and 
 universities as a science, its principles known and prac- 
 ticed, then, and not till then, will good speaking be the 
 rule, and not, as now, the rare exception.

PREFACE TO THE REVISED EDITION. 
 
 In revising the Science of Elocution the author de- 
 sires to express his sincere thanks to the literary and 
 professional men and women, and to the schools and 
 colleges throughout the country for their generous and 
 complimentary indorsement and adoption of the work, 
 and to hope that the revised edition may be no less 
 acceptable. 
 
 The original design of the work, which was to pre- 
 sent the elements and principles of vocal expression in 
 a plain, simple, scientific manner, is still retained. 
 
 The changes are chiefly in the arrangement of the 
 exercises, the addition of questions and diagrams, and 
 the substitution of new and better selections. The pres- 
 ent plan is to present the explanations, exercises, ele- 
 ments, principles, and the selections for their illustra- 
 tion in systematic lessons, and thus better adapt the 
 work to the wants of the class-room. Instead of pre- 
 senting with each element brief examples to illustrate 
 all the styles of thought and feeling in which the ele- 
 ment may be employed, only one illustration will be 
 given, the others being presented when new elements 
 are introduced. By this arrangement frequent repeti-

 tions will be avoided, and yet all the styles of thought 
 and feeling illustrated. 
 
 No attempt has been made to give instruction in 
 action, further than the exercises in position and 
 movement. Indeed, it is questionable whether grace 
 and propriety of gesture and attitude can be success- 
 fully taught by printed instructions either in words 
 or wood-cuts and dotted lines. Certain it is that the 
 accomplishments of action can be best acquired from 
 the living teacher and the careful study of works of 
 art and natural illustrations. 
 
 The suggestions in the lessons on gesture and atti- 
 tude are on the supposition that the teacher is compe- 
 tent to give such instruction orally and by illustration.

SCIENCE OF ELOCUTION. 
 
 INTKODUCTION. 
 
 ELOCUTION. 
 
 Definition. 
 ^Elocution is the expression of thought and feeling by- 
 voice and action. Ylt is not, as many erroneously think, 
 an accomplishment 1 valuable only in professional life; 
 but a divine gift, a natural endowment, invaluable in 
 every position and condition of life, and susceptible of 
 the highest cultivation. Excellence in expression is 
 as desirable in the family circle as in the pulpit; as 
 pleasing and impressive in the social circle as on the 
 platform; as profitable in business life as on the stage. 
 No organ of the human body is susceptible of so great 
 or so rapid cultivation as the voice. By proper train- 
 ing for a few weeks or months harsh and hard tones 
 may be changed to sweet and silvery ones. 
 
 Science and Art. 
 
 Elocution is both a science and an art./ As a science,

 Province op the Science. 
 
 The science of Elocution deduces the principles of 
 expression from natural sounds animate and inani- 
 mate. It observes in the joyous songs of birds explo- 
 sive form, pure tone, high pitch, and rapid movement. 
 
 It perceives in the low, angry growl of the wild ani- 
 mal the pectoral quality ; in the mutter of the blood- 
 thirsty savage the guttural tone ; in the moaning of 
 the winds the aspirate ; in the roar of the ocean the 
 orotund ; in the tranquil murmur of the stream the 
 pure, clear tone. 
 
 It classifies these principles, adapts them to the com- 
 prehension of man, and thus establishes a system true 
 in theory and natural in practice; a system based not 
 on human rules, but on divine laws. Vlt discovers 
 in every vocal utterance six essential elements: Form, 
 Quality, Force, Stress, Pitch, and Movement ;Vthat 
 by no possibility can there be a continuous vocal 
 utterance in which these elements will not exist in 
 some combination; that they are as essential to vocal 
 expression as are the notes to the tune, the parts of 
 speech to the sentence, the processes addition, sub- 
 traction, multiplication, and division to the solution 
 of problems ; that all other properties of expression, as 
 quantity, inflection, emphasis, cadence, grouping, and 
 even distinct articulation, are simply different combina- 
 tions of these essential elements; that utterance does 
 not depend upon them, but may exist without them ; 
 hence they may be termed simply accidents or ac- 
 complishments of expression. Science perceives that 
 excellence in vocal utterance, whether in conversa- 
 tion, reading, speaking, or recitation, depends on the 
 perfect illustration and correct combination of these

 elements, and that the defects are found in an improp- 
 er use of one or more of them. It determines the 
 combination appropriate for the expression of the dif- 
 ferent styles of thought and feeling, classifies these 
 combinations, and thus renders the art of Elocution as 
 simple and easy as the art of music, mathematics, or 
 language. 
 
 Province of the Art. 
 
 The Art of Elocution cultivates the voice, perfects 
 the articulation, improves the respiration, gives ease 
 and grace to position and movement propriety and 
 power to gesture and attitude. It teaches the practi- 
 cal illustration of the elements and their innumerable 
 combinations. It applies these in the expression of 
 the different styles of thought and feeling, thus em- 
 bodying in delivery every accomplishment both of 
 voice and action. 
 
 Advantages. 
 
 The proper study of Elocution will make the family 
 circle more agreeable, the social circle more desirable, 
 the business man more successful, the teacher more 
 instructive, and the professional man more impressive. 
 Is it so desirable that our musical instruments upon 
 which we occasionally play be sweet-toned and in per- 
 fect tune, and of no importance that our own voices 
 and our children's voices be clear and sweet and musi- 
 cal and pure ? Are easy, graceful positions and at- 
 titudes so important in pictures and statues and not 
 desirable in ourselves? Pleasant tones of voice and 
 agreeable manners gain friends, win confidence, secure 
 customers, inspire pupils, and delight audiences. They 
 are desirable and profitable every-where. It would be 
 difficult to name a subject taught in school or college

 that affords a culture so broad, so thorough, so practi- 
 cal as the study of Elocution. It most happily com- 
 bines the cultivation of the physical, the mental, and 
 the moral powers. 
 
 Physical Culture. 
 
 The exercises in respiration, articulation, and vocal- 
 ization strengthen the lungs, expand the chest, devel- 
 op the muscles of the throat and neck, protecting 
 them against cold and bronchial affections, call into 
 action the abdominal, dorsal, and intercostal muscles, 
 and thus promote digestion and, in fact, invigorate all 
 the physical powers ; they cultivate sweetness, purity, 
 power, and flexibility of voice. The exercises in action 
 give ease and grace to position and movement. If, for 
 its physical culture alone, Elocution were introduced 
 into all our schools and colleges, it would more than 
 compensate for all the expenditure of time and money. 
 But its physical advantages are the least important. It 
 furnishes no ordinary 
 
 Mental Culture. 
 
 To express thought and feeling appropriately and im- 
 pressively they must be clearly comprehended. But 
 the comprehension of the thought is not sufficient. The 
 science of Elocution must be mastered a science exact, 
 abstruse, exhaustless. The elements and principles of 
 this science must be perfectly familiar to the mind. 
 The adaptation of the elements and the application of 
 the principles in the expression of the different styles 
 of thought and feeling cultivate the taste and judg- 
 ment. To recite a selection, or present a scene impress- 
 ively, it must be memorized. This strengthens the 
 memory, that faculty so greatly neglected in our mod- 
 ern methods of education. Each character presented

 must be clearly conceived, must have an ideal existence. 
 This exercises the imagination. In the combination of 
 the elements, the conception of the characters, and the 
 arrangement of the scenes, there must be a constant 
 effort to produce those effects most pleasing both to 
 eye and ear. This cultivates the aesthetic taste and 
 develops the originating faculties. 
 
 But the study of Elocution stops not with the cul- 
 tivation of the physical and mental faculties ; it 
 develops 
 
 The Moral Powers. 
 
 It brings us into intimate communion with the 
 noblest thoughts of the wisest men of all ages. It 
 makes us familiar with the sublimity of Shakespeare, 
 the grandeur of Milton, the imagination of Scott, the 
 pathos of Dickens, the purity of Longfellow, and the 
 inspiration of the Bible. It cannot be but that the 
 study and recitation of such writings will ennoble the 
 moral nature.

 Elementary Sounds. 
 
 An elementary sound is a sound produced by a single 
 impulse of the organs of speech. 
 
 Phonologists generally agree that there are forty- 
 four elementary sounds in the English language. 
 
 These sounds are represented by letters and charac- 
 ters. 
 
 The sounds are divided into vocals, sub-vocals, and 
 aspirates ; the letters into vowels and consonants.

 LESSON I. 
 
 POSITION. 
 
 In beginning a course of lessons in Elocution the at- 
 tention of the student should first be directed to the 
 subject of position. It is the position of the body that 
 first attracts attention. If it be easy and natural, the 
 impression will be favorable ; if stiff and awkward, it 
 will be unfavorable. Again, an easy position promotes 
 freedom of thought and smoothness of expression, 
 while a restrained manner hinders speech and embar- 
 rasses utterance. 
 
 Positions of the Head, Body, Hands, and Feet. 
 
 Stand with the head and body erect, the chest fully 
 expanded, the shoulders well thrown back not rigid 
 and formal, but easy and natural. Let the arms hang 
 easily by the side, or, if there be a table or desk near, 
 let one hand rest gently upon it. If a book or manu- 
 script is used, hold it in the left hand, the thumb and 
 fourth finger in front, the other three fingers back. 
 
 Positions of the Feet. 
 
 First Position. Place the feet so that they will 
 form an angle of nearly ninety degrees, the right a lit- 
 tle in advance, and about three or four inches from the 
 left, the weight of the body resting principally on the 
 left, the center of the heel of the right foot opposite 
 the center of the hollow of the left. 
 
 Second Position. The second position is just the 
 converse of the first the weight of the body rests 
 upon the right foot, the left a little in advance and 
 


## p. 29 (#33) ##############################################

Position. 29 
 
 about three or four inches from the right, the feet 
 forming an angle of nearly ninety degrees. 
 
 Third Position. In the third position the right 
 foot is about six or eight inches obliquely to the right, 
 in advance of the left, and supports the weight of the 
 body ; the toe or ball of the left foot gently rests on 
 the floor, and balances the body, the heel being raised 
 about an inch. The feet in this position should also 
 form a right angle. 
 
 Fourth Position. In the fourth position the 
 weight of the body rests upon the left foot, which is 
 about six or eight inches obliquely to the left, in 
 advance of the right, the toe or ball of the right 
 gently resting on the floor, the heel raised about an 
 inch, the feet forming a right angle. 
 
 Exercises in Position. 
 
 Class rise and take the first position. 
 
 1. Change from the first to the second position by 
 placing the right foot back of the left, and turning the 
 left out a little. 
 
 2. Change from second to first position by placing 
 the left foot back of the right, and turning the toe of 
 the right out a little. 
 
 3. Change from first to third position by stepping 
 forward about six or eight inches with the right foot, 
 inclining the body a little forward, and balancing it 
 with the toe or ball of the left foot the heel of the 
 left raised about an inch from the floor and inclined in 
 toward the heel of the right. 
 
 4. Change from the third to the first position by 
 bringing up the left foot to within about three inches 
 of the right, and allowing the weight of the body to 
 rest upon the left. 
 


## p. 30 (#34) ##############################################

30 Science of Elocution. 
 
 Repeat these changes several times, until the class is 
 perfectly familiar with them. 
 Class may sit. 
 
 RESPIRATION. 
 
 The next exercise to which attention should be di- 
 rected is breathing. Excellence in expression is largely 
 dependent upon appropriate respiration. Without a 
 sufficient supply of breath the vocal organs cannot per- 
 form their functions properly. In ordinary tranquil 
 breathing the process is involuntary and unconscious ; 
 but when strength and force of voice are required, the 
 vocal chords must be swept with a greater volume of 
 air, and art must be called in to the assistance of 
 nature. 
 
 To inhale skillfully and exhale properly, to keep 
 the lungs constantly supplied with breath so that they 
 can furnish to the larynx instantly the requisite supply 
 of air, constitutes the art of breathing, and can be 
 acquired only by practice. Incorrect breathing not 
 only affects the vocal utterance, but produces bronchial 
 trouble and pulmonary diseases. 
 
 The process of respiration includes both inhalation 
 and expiration. In the act of inhaling great care 
 should be taken to fill the lungs quickly and quietly, 
 and at such times as will least inconvenience yourself 
 and least attract the attention of an audience. Always 
 inhale before beginning a sentence or phrase, before 
 every animated or impassioned expression, before and 
 after every emphatic word, and at all pauses. 
 
 In exhaling give out the breath as economically as 
 possible, using no more than is necessary to produce the 
 required tone. 
 


## p. 31 (#35) ##############################################

Articulation. 31 
 
 Exercises in Respiration. 
 
 Class rise. While the teacher slowly elevates his 
 hand the class should inhale quietly, filling the lungs to 
 their utmost capacity. As the teacher lowers his hand 
 exhale slowly and quietly. Repeat this exercise sev- 
 eral times. Class may then sit. 
 
 ARTICULATION. 
 
 Distinctness of articulation, though not essential to 
 expression, is an invaluable accomplishment. It en- 
 ables the speaker to express his thoughts without 
 weariness, and the audience to hear without effort. 
 Every effort to understand the word detracts from the 
 thought. In large assemblies and in the open air dis- 
 tinctness of articulation is indispensable. Loudness is 
 not distinctness. Strong emotion and passion, if not 
 expressed with distinctness, degenerates into rant and 
 vociferation. 
 
 To perfect the articulation, practice the elementary 
 sounds first separately, then in combination. 
 
 In these exercises attention should be given to the 
 position of the body, the breathing, and particularly to 
 the positions and action of the organs of articulation.

 each sound separately.

 2. I believe it every word. 
 
 3. Be not overcome by evil. 
 
 4. Seems, madam ! nay, it is. 
 
 5. Tell them we need no change. 
 
 This exercise should not occupy more than two or three minutes, 
 and all the previous explanation and exercises should be given in 
 less than ten minutes. 
 
 FORMS OF VOICE. 
 
 Before beginning the discussion of the Essential Ele- 
 ments, it will be well to direct the attention of the 
 pupil again to certain axiomatic propositions on which 
 these lessons are based : 
 
 First. In every vocal utterance there are six essential 
 elements. 
 
 Second. Excellence in vocal expression depends on 
 the perfect illustration and correct combination of these 
 elements. 
 
 Third. The defects in vocal utterance are produced by 
 an imperfect illustration or incorrect combination of one 
 or more of these elements. 
 
 If these propositions be true, it follows that a practi- 
 cal and theoretical knowledge of the essential elements 
 will make good readers and speakers. 
 
 The primary object of these lessons is to explain, il- 
 lustrate, and apply the elements and principles of vocal 
 expression. All other exercises and explanations are 
 simply auxiliary. 
 y\ Form is the manner in which the sound is sent forth 
 from the vocal organs. It is to sound what shape is to 
 matter. There are but three forms of Voice; there 
 


## p. 33 (#37) ##############################################

Effusive Form. 33 
 
 are really but three forms of sound, effusive, expulsive, 
 and explosive. K.. 
 
 Every sound, whether produced by the human voice, 
 the voice of bird or beast, by inanimate nature, or me- 
 chanical means, must be in one of these forms. 
 
 * 
 
 EfTuivc Form. 
 
 The Effusive is that form of Voice in which the sound 
 is sent forth gently from the vocal organs without 
 abruptness either in beginning or ending. The breath 
 is not sent forth by a forcible effort, but is gently 
 effused into the surrounding air. 
 
 Advantages of Effusive Form. 
 
 The Effusive Form gives a smoothness to the tone 
 and a mildness to utterance which, in the expression of 
 pathos and solemnity, reverence and devotion, produces 
 one of the most pleasing effects in delivery, calling out 
 at once all the purer and nobler feelings, and fitting 
 the mind for higher and holier contemplations. The 
 absence of this element in the utterance of the sublime 
 passages in prayer and praise gives a harshness to the 
 expression. In the milder forms of awe and horror the 
 effusive gives intensity to the utterance. Owing to 
 our defective methods of elocutionary instruction ths 
 Effusive Form is rarely heard. 
 
 To acquire this form of voice practice the elementary 
 sounds and words in the following manner : 
 
 First inflate the lungs fully, and then exhale the 
 wreath gently in a prolonged clear tone, being careful 
 to expend no more breath than is necessary to produce 
 the tone.

 Principle of Expression, or when the Effusive 
 Form should be used. 
 
 v The Effusive is the appropriate Form of voice for the 
 expression of tranquillity, solemnity, sublimity, pathos, 
 grandeur, reverence, adoration, devotion, awe, and amaze- 
 ment of a quiet and tranquil character. \ 
 
 That the Effusive Form should be so employed is not 
 an empyrical rule, by following which excellence in 
 expression may be acquired, but a divine principle which 
 must be observed by all who excel in reading and 
 speaking, whether they are conscious of it or not. 
 This principle is clearly illustrated wherever God, in 
 nature, expresses by animate sounds or awakens in us 
 by inanimate sounds these thoughts and feelings. 
 
 The dove, lamenting the loss of its mate, always ex- 
 presses its sadness in the Effusive Form. The wind as 
 it moans around the building, awakening in us sad and 
 gloomy thoughts and feelings, always illustrate the

 Effusive Form. The roar of the ocean, awakening 
 grand and sublime thoughts and feelings, is Effusive in

 Suggestions to Teachers. 
 
 In instructing classes it would be well for the 
 teacher to read one line, not for imitation, but to illus- 
 trate the Effusive Form, and then have the class repeat 
 it in concert. After reading one stanza in this manner 
 let the class be seated, and then call upon two or three 
 pupils successively to read the entire stanza. When 
 two or three have read, then read a second stanza in 
 concert, and again call on two or three individually, 
 and so on until the entire selection is read. Both teacher 
 and pupils should bear in mind that the prominent 
 object in this lesson is to cultivate the Effusive Form.

 1. O a wonderful stream is the river Time, 
 As it runs through the realm of tears, 
 With a faultless rhythm and a musical rhyme, 
 And a boundless sweep and a surge sublime,,/ 
 As it blends with the Ocean of Years. 
 
 How the winters are drifting like flakes of snow, 
 
 And the summers like buds between, ^ 
 And the year in the sheaf, so they come and they go, 
 On the river's breast, with its ebb and flow,/ 
 As it glides in the shadow and sheen. 
 
 There's a magical isle up the river Time, 
 Where the softest of airs are playing ; 
 There's a cloudless sky and a tropical clime, 
 And a song as sweet as a vesper chime, 
 And the Junes with the roses are straying.

 Expulsive Form. 39 
 
 Expulsive Form. 
 
 The Expulsive is that form of voice in which the 
 sound is sent forth from the organs in an abrupt and 
 forcible manner. To produce the Expulsive Form the 
 breath must be forced from the lungs to the larynx V 
 by a vigorous inward and upward action of the abdo- 
 minal muscles and diaphragm. 
 
 The larynx is the instrument of sound, the lungs the 
 reservoir of air, and the abdominal muscles and dia- 
 phragm the power for propelling the air. It is the 
 inward and upward action of the abdominal muscles 
 that compresses the lungs, and thus keeps the larynx 
 furnished with a sufficient supply of air. Many cases 
 of speaker's sore throat are caused by an inefficient 
 action of the abdomen. 
 
 Advantages. 
 
 No exercise is more beneficial for strengthening and 
 developing the voice than practice on this form. 
 
 It is the Expulsive that gives life, energy, and spirit 
 to all forcible speaking. The speaker who fails in 
 regard to the effect of this property of utterance solicits 
 our pity rather than commands our respect. Divested 
 of this form of voice, the manly and powerful eloquence 
 of Demosthenes, Webster, Chatham, and Clay would 
 become ridiculous and contemptible. 
 
 In practicing this exercise always stand or sit erect, 
 keep the chest well expanded, and be very careful to 
 maintain a vigorous inward and upward action of the 
 abdominal muscles and diaphragm. 
 
 Repeat the following sounds, words, and sentences 
 in a full, clear, expulsive form :

 Contrasting Effusive and Expulsive Forms. 
 
 Repeat each of the above sounds, words, and sen-

 Expulsive Form When Used. 
 
 It is a principle of expression that the Expulsive 
 Form should always be used in the expression of nar- 
 / r alive, descriptive, didactic, animated, argumentative, 
 and impassioned poetic thought,^ expressed in scientific 
 and literary lectures, doctrinal and practical sermons, 
 senatorial and political speeches, and formal orations. 
 This principle is illustrated in the direct, earnest utter- 
 ances of children, the forcible speech of the savage, the 
 bark of the dog, the lowing of cattle, the bleating of 
 sheep, neighing of horses, the broken sound of the cas- 
 cade, and the deep roar of the thunder, all of which ex-

 WIRT. 
 
 1. In the ancient republics of Greece and Rome oratory was 
 a necessary branch of a finished education. A much smaller 
 proportion of the citizens were educated than among us, but 
 of these a much larger number became orators. No man 
 could hope for distinction or influence and yet slight this art. 
 The commanders of their armies were orators as well as sol- 
 diers, and ruled as well by their rhetorical as by their military 
 skill. There was no trusting with them, as with us, to a nat- 
 ural facility or the acquisition of an accidental fluency by 
 occasional practice. 
 
 2. They served an apprenticeship to the art. They passed 
 through a regular course of instruction in schools ; they sub- 
 mitted to a long and laborious discipline ; they exercised 
 themselves frequently, both before equals and in the presence 
 of teachers, who criticised, reproved, rebuked, excited emula- 
 tion, and left nothing undone which art and perseverance 
 could accomplish. 
 
 3. The greatest orators of antiquity, so far from being fa- 
 vored by natural tendencies, except indeed in their high intel- 
 lectual endowments, had to struggle against natural obstacles, 
 and, instead of growing up spontaneously to their own unri- 
 valed eminence, they forced themselves forward by the most 
 discouraging artificial process. 
 
 4. Demosthenes combated an impediment in speech and an 
 ungainliness of gesture which at first drove him from the 
 forum in disgrace. Cicero failed at first through weakness of 
 lungs and an excessive vehemence of manner which wearied 
 the hearers and defeated his own purpose. These defects were 
 conquered by study and discipline. He exiled himself from 
 home, and during his absence in various lands passed not a 
 day without a rhetorical exercise, seeking the masters who

 were most severe in criticism as the means of leading him to 
 the perfection at which he aimed. 
 
 5. Such, too, was the education of their other great men. 
 They were all, according to their ability and station, orators ; 
 orators, not by nature or accident, but by education, formed in 
 strict process of rhetorical training. 
 
 6. The inference to be drawn from these observations is, that 
 if so many of those who received an accomplished education 
 became accomplished orators, because to become so was one 
 purpose of their study, then it is in the power of a much 
 larger proportion among us to form ourselves into creditable 
 and accurate speakers. The inference should not be denied 
 until proved false by experiment. 
 
 7. Let this art be made an object of attention ; let young 
 men train themselves to it faithfully and long, and if any of 
 competent talents and tolerable science be found at last inca- 
 pable of expressing themselves in continued and connected dis- 
 course, so as to answer the ends of public speaking, then, and 
 not till then, let it be said that a peculiar talent or natural 
 aptitude is requisite, the want of which must render effort 
 vain ; then, and not till then, let us acquiesce in this indolent 
 and timorous notion, which contradicts the whole testimony 
 of antiquity and all the experience of the world.

 Review briefly the Effusive and Expulsive Forms. 
 
 Explosive Form. 
 
 >7 The Explosive is that form of voice in which the 
 sound bursts forth instantaneously from the organs. 
 It resembles in suddenness the crack of a pistol or the 
 report of a rifle. 
 
 This form of voice proceeds from a violent and ab- 
 rupt exertion of the abdominal muscles acting on the 
 diaphragm, and thus discharging a large volume of air 
 previously inhaled. 
 
 "The breath in this process is, as it were, dashed 
 against the glottis or lips of the larynx, causing a 
 loud and instantaneous explosion. Just before the act 
 of explosion the chink of the glottis is for a mo- 
 ment closed, and a resistance offered to the escape of 
 the breath, by a firm compression of the lips of the 
 larynx, and downward pressure of the epiglottis. 
 After this instant pressure and resistance follows the 
 explosion caused by the appulsive act of the abdominal 
 muscles and diaphragm propelling the breath with pow- 
 erful and irresistible force on the glottis and epiglottis, 
 which at length give way, and suffer the breath to 
 escape with a loud and sudden report of a purely ex- 
 plosive character. 
 
 Advantages. 
 
 No exercise is so effectual for imparting energy to 
 the tone, or strengthening weak organs, as practice on 
 the Explosive Form of voice. 
 


## p. 45 (#49) ##############################################

Explosive Form. 45 
 
 Combined with the Expulsive, in argumentative dis- 
 course, it gives life and energy to the utterance. 
 " This form of the human voice (the Explosive) is 
 one of the most impressive in its effects. By a law 
 of our constitution it acts with an instantaneous shock 
 on the sympathetic nerve, and rouses the sensibility 
 of the whole frame ; it summons to instant action 
 all the senses, and in the thrill which it sends from 
 nerve to brain we feel its awakening and inciting 
 power over the mind. 
 
 " With the rapidity of lightning it penetrates every 
 faculty, and sets it instinctively on the alert. 
 
 "It seems designed by nature as the note of alarm 
 to the citadel of the soul." But it must not be prac- 
 ticed too frequently or forcibly. Like all violent ex- 
 ercises it must be used judiciously. 
 
 Practice the following sounds, words, and sentences 
 with all the force and abruptness you can command, 
 being careful, however, not to give too high a pitch to 
 the utterance. 
 
 In connection with these exercises practice the me- 
 chanical act of coughing and laughing.

 Repeat the elements, words, and sentences in the

 Explosive Form When Used. 
 
 The Explosive Form is appropriately employed in 
 the expression of ecstatic joy, the sudden cry of terror 
 and alarm, the quick, sharp command. 
 
 This principle is illustrated in the merry ringing 
 laugh of childhood, the gladsome bark of the dog, the 
 joyous song of birds, the angry yell of the Indian war- 
 rior, the sharp, rapid stroke of the fire bell, the sudden 
 report of the rifle, the startling peal of thunder.

 3 I have passed o'er the hills of the stormy north, 
 And the larch has hung all his tassels forth, 
 The fisher is out on the sunny sea, 
 
 And the reindeer bounds through the pasture free ; 
 
 And the pine has a fringe of softer green, 
 
 And the moss looks bright where my step has been. 
 
 4 I have sent through the wood-paths a gentle sigh, 
 And called out each voice of the deep-blue sky, 
 From the night-bird's lay through the starry time, 
 In the groves of the soft Hesperian clime, 
 
 To the swan's wild note by the Iceland lakes, 
 Where the dark fir-bough into verdure breaks. 
 
 5 From the streams and founts I have loosed the chain; 
 They are sweeping on to the silvery main, 
 
 They are flashing down from the mountain brows, 
 They are flinging spray on the forest boughs, 
 They are bursting fresh from their sparry caves, 
 And the earth resounds with the joy of waves. 
 
 6 Come forth, O ye children of gladness, come ! 
 Where the violets lie may now be your home. 
 Ye of the rose-cheek and dew- bright eye, 
 And the bounding footstep, to meet me fly ; 
 With the lyre, and the wreath, and the joyous lay, 
 Come forth to the sunshine, I may not stay. 
 
 7 Away from the dwellings of careworn men, 
 The waters are sparkling in wood and glen ; 
 Away from the chamber and dusky hearth, 
 The young leaves are dancing in breezy mirth; 
 Their light stems thrill to the wild- wood strains, 
 And youth is abroad in my green domains. 
 
 S The summer is hastening, on soft winds borne ; 
 Ye may press the grape, ye may bind the corn ; 
 For me, I depart to a brighter shore 
 Ye are marked by care, ye are mine no more. 
 I go where the loved who have left you dwell, 
 And the flowers are not Death's fare ye well, farewell I

 QUALITIES OF VOICE. 
 
 Quality is the kind of tone, the purity or impurity 
 of the voice S\ Every vocal utterance must have some 
 quality. This may be Pure Tone, Orotund, Oral, 
 Aspirate, Pectoral, Guttural, Falsetto, or Nasal, or a 
 combination of two or more of these. 
 
 Qualities of voice may be divided according to their 
 use and importance into three classes. To the first 
 


## p. 50 (#54) ##############################################

50 Science of Elocution. 
 
 class belong the Pure Tone, Orotund, and Oral. These 
 qualities are employed in the expression of the higher 
 and nobler styles of thought and feeling. Nature 
 teaches this principle in the pure clear notes of the 
 birds, the grand roar of Niagara, the sad tones of 
 the animals in their expressions of sympathy and suf- 
 fering. To the second class belong the Aspirate, Pec- 
 toral, and Guttural, qualities employed chiefly in the 
 expression of the harsh, repulsive, malignant thoughts 
 and feelings. This we learn from the hiss of the 
 snake, aspirate in quality ; the growl of the lion, tiger, 
 hyena, and all blood-thirsty animals, always more or 
 less guttural or pectoral in character. To the third 
 class belong the Falsetto and Nasal, qualities having 
 but little in common, and the classification not founded 
 in nature. They are simply thrown together here to 
 present the subject in a more systematic order. They 
 are chiefly used in the expression of burlesque and 
 mimicry, though the falsetto is often employed in the 
 expression of the elevating and ennobling. Many 
 teachers and writers upon this subject have divided 
 the qualities of voice into two classes, "Pure" and 
 " Impure," placing under the first class only Pure Tone 
 and Orotund, and under the second class all the others. 
 They have taught that only the qualities termed 
 "Pure" should be cultivated, that they are the only 
 qualities required, that all others are defective, im- 
 proper, and should be avoided. Now, while the Pure 
 Tone and Orotund are the qualities most frequently 
 employed, they are not the only qualities required; 
 Aspirate, Pectoral, Guttural, Oral, Falsetto, and even 
 Nasal being indispensable to the expression of certain 
 styles of thought and feeling. To express fear or awe 
 with Pure Tone is as inappropriate as to express joy 
 


## p. 51 (#55) ##############################################

Pure Tone. 51 
 
 with Aspirate ; to express revenge or hate with 
 Orotund is as incorrect as to utter sublimity with 
 Guttural. 
 
 Appropriate utterance requires the adaptation of the 
 quality of voice to the sentiment expressed. 
 
 To determine the quality appropriate for the expres- 
 sion of the different styles of thought and feeling is an 
 important part of the study of Elocution. Here, as 
 every-where in the study of this science and art, we 
 must " Hold the mirror up to Nature." Her teach- 
 ings are infallible ; her guidance unerring. If we 
 but learn her lessons aright, we will understand the 
 principles of expression; if we but embody her teach- 
 ings in practice, we will correctly illustrate the art of 
 Elocution. 
 
 Upon no element of expression are the teachings of 
 Nature more explicit than upon Quality. In every 
 wind that blows, in every thunder-peal that rolls, in 
 every laughing, dancing brook, and every storm-tossed 
 wave, we find an instructive lesson. 
 
 Each has a quality appropriate to the thought or 
 feeling awakened. 
 
 As quality cannot exist except in some form, and as 
 all the qualities may be given in each of the forms, 
 each quality will be presented in the three forms. 
 
 XPure Tone. 
 Pure Tone is that quality of voice in which all the 
 breath is converted into a clear, round, smooth, musical 
 sound, with the resonance in the back part of the roof of 
 the mouth. It is free from all Aspirate, Oral, Nasal, 
 or other impure qualities. Jl/ 
 
 Owing to our neglect off Voice-culture this quality, 
 so peculiar to childhood, is rarely possessed in more

52 Science of Elocution. 
 
 mature age. The restraining influences of the school- 
 room tend directly to destroy all the natural purity 
 and sweetness of the voice. 
 
 Advantages. 
 
 The advantages of Pure Tone are twofold first, 
 to the speaker ; second, to the hearer. It is produced 
 with less expenditure of breath than any other qual- 
 ity ; its effect upon the vocal organs is beneficial 
 rather than injurious ; with the same effort it is heard 
 at a greater distance than any other quality ; its clear 
 musical properties give a distinctness to articulation 
 and an ease to utterance grateful to the ear; it pro- 
 duces none of the jarring effects experienced in list- 
 ening to a speaker whose voice is harsh, hard, or in 
 any way impure in quality. / 
 
 To cultivate and restore this natural quality, practice 
 daily the following exercises with the strictest atten- 
 tion to the purity of the tone. 
 
 Repeat a number of times each of the following ele-, 
 ments in the Effusive Form with the utmost purity of 
 tone. It will be noticed that the object of the exercise 
 on page 33 was to cultivate Effusive Form without 
 reference to quality or other attributes. The special 
 object of this exercise is to cultivate Pure Tone, and, 
 at the same time, to retain and perfect what was 
 gained by the exercises under Form. It should be con- 
 stantly borne in mind that in connection with each 
 new exercise, attention should be given to all the pre- 
 vious exercises, so that when the exercises in move- 
 ment of Voice are presented (the last exercises under 
 the Essential elements), they will be not only exercises 
 in Movement, but also in Form, Quality, Force, Stress, 
 and Pitch.

 Pure Tone, Effusive Form When Used. 
 
 In the first lesson you were taught that it is a 
 principle of expression that the Effusive Form should 
 always be employed in the expression of pathos, solem- 
 nity, sublimity, grandeur, reverence, adoration, and 
 devotion, of a quiet and tranquil character. 
 
 Now if we limit the Effusive Form to Pure Tone we 
 necessarily exclude many styles of thought and feel- 
 ing, for Effusive Form has greater extension than 
 Effusive Form, Pure Tone ; and each element un- 
 limited will have a wider range in expression than 
 when limited even by one other element. Pure Tone, 
 Effusive Form, is appropriately employed chiefly in 
 the expression of pathetic, solemn, serious, and tranquil 
 thought. This principle is illustrated in the plantive 
 cooing of the dove, the solemn tones of the iEolian 
 harp, and the tranquil murmur of the brocK, all of 
 which are not only Effusive in Form but Pure in 
 Quality.

 2 Nearer my Father's house, 
 
 Where the many mansions be ; 
 Nearer the great white throne, 
 Nearer the crystal sea ; 
 
 3 Nearer the bound of life, 
 
 Where we lay our burdens down; 
 Nearer leaving the cross, 
 Nearer gaining the crown. 
 
 4 But the waves of that silent sea 
 
 Roll dark before my sight, 
 That brightly the other side 
 Break on a shore of light. 
 
 5 O, if my mortal feet 
 
 Have almost gained the brink, 
 If it be I am nearer home 
 Even to-day than I think, 
 
 6 Father, perfect my trust, 
 Let my spirit feel in death 
 That her feet are firmly set 
 On the Rock of a living faith.

 Pure Tone, Expulsive Form When Used. 
 
 Pure Tone, Expulsive Form, is appropriately em-

 scientific and literary lectures, doctrines, and practical 
 sermons. ^C 
 
 This principle is illustrated in the earnest, direct 
 utterances of children, the chattering of birds, and the

 A 
 
 Hamlet's Advice to the Players. 
 
 SHAKESPEARE. 
 
 1. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you, 
 trippingly on the tongue ; but if you mouth it, as many of our 
 players do, I had as lief the town-crier had spoken my lines. 
 And do not saw the air too much with your hands, but use all 
 gently ; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, 
 whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a tem- 
 perance that will give it smoothness. 
 
 2. O it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious, periwig- 
 pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very rags, to split the 
 ears of the groundlings, who (for the most part) are capable 
 of nothing but inexplicable dumb shows and noise. Pray you 
 avoid it. 
 
 3. Be not too tame either, but let your own discretion be your 
 tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action, 
 with this special observance, that you overstep not the modesty 
 of Nature, for any thing so overdone is from the purpose 
 of playing, whose end is to hold, as it were, the mirror up 
 to Nature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn her own 
 image, and the very age and body of the times their form and 
 pressure. 
 
 4. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it may 
 make the unskillful laugh, cannot but make the judicious 
 grieve, the censure of which one must, in your allowance, out- 
 weigh a whole theater of others. O there be players that I 
 have seen play, and heard others praise, and that highly not 
 to speak it profanely that neither having the accent of Chris- 
 tian nor the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so strut- 
 ted and bellowed that I have thought some of Nature's jour- 
 neymen had made men and not made them well, they imi- 
 tated humanity so abominably.

 Suggestions. If the teacher can give instructions in 
 gesticulation, orally and by illustration, it would be well 
 at this lesson to devote one, two, or five minutes to 
 exercises in gesture, beginning with the positions and 
 movement of the fingers, hanl, and arm. As stated in 
 the preface, it is not the purpose of this work to give 
 instruction on gesture, and if the teacher cannot in- 
 struct the class orally, it will be better to omit the sub- 
 ject entirely.

 Orotund. 
 
 The Orotund is that quality of voice in which the 
 breath is converted into a full, round, deep, musical 
 tone, with resonance in the upper part of the chest. 
 
 It is distinguished from the Pure Tone by a fullness, 
 clearness, strength, smoothness, and sub-sonorous qual- 
 ity resembling the resonance of a musical instrument. 
 
 "In the Orotund, volume and purity of tone, to 
 the greatest extent of the one and the highest per- 
 fection of the other, are blended in one vast sphere of 
 sound." 
 
 This quality is possessed naturally by very few. Even 
 among public speakers it is rarely heard, save in a lim- 
 ited degree. Actors and orators of eminence and dis- 
 tinction understand and appreciate the value of the 
 Orotund, and have spared no pains to obtain control 
 of it. It is heard in all their utterances of grand, lofty, 
 and sublime thoughts. 
 


## p. 64 (#68) ##############################################

Science of Elocution. 
 
 Though rarely possessed, it is susceptible of cultiva- 
 tion, and ma}% by judicious practice, be acquired by 
 almost every one. 
 
 Advantages. 
 
 Dr. Rush mentions the Orotund as the highest 
 perfection of the cultivated voice of the public 
 speaker. 
 
 The Orotund is fuller in volume and purer in quality 
 than the common voice ; it is more musical in tone ; it is 
 more efficient in the production of long quantity; it is 
 more under command; it is freer from all impurities; 
 it is, in short, the only quality appropriate for the so- 
 lemnity of the Church service, the grandeur and energy 
 of the oration, and the majesty and sublimity of Shakes- 
 peare and Milton. 
 
 It must not, however, be imagined that the Orotund, 
 when once acquired, is to entirely supersede the com- 
 mon voice. Teachers and students of Elocution and 
 public speakers frequently render themselves ridicu- 
 lous, and the study of Elocution contemptible, by parad- 
 ing their powers of Orotund on all occasions. Such 
 exhibitions suggest 
 
 "Ocean into tempest tossed 
 
 To waft a feather or to drown a fly." 
 
 Except in the expression of grand, lofty, and sublime 
 thought, the Pure Tone should form the basis of utter- 
 ance. 
 
 To acquire control of the Orotund, practice the fol- 
 lowing exercise, with the freest opening of the vocal 
 organs, and the utmost volume and depth of tone. 
 
 Before repeating the sounds, words, and sentences, 
 inhale a large quantity of air.

 Orotund, Effusive Form When Used. 
 
 The Orotund in the Effusive Form is the quality of 
 voice appropriate for the expression of sublimity, grand- 
 eur, reverence, adoration, and devotion. 
 
 This principle is clearly taught in the grand and 
 majestic roar of the lion, the deep tones of the distant 
 thunder, the sublime roar of Niagara and the ocean all

 Being above all beings ! Mighty One. 
 
 Whom none can comprehend and none explore, 
 Who fill'st existence with thyself alone, 
 
 Embracing all, supporting, ruling o'er ; 
 
 Being whom we call God, and know no more ! 
 
 2. Thou from primeval nothingness didst call 
 
 First chaos, then existence ; Lord, on thee 
 Eternity hath its foundation ; all 
 
 Sprung forth from thee of light, joy, harmony. 
 Sole origin all life, all beauty thine ; 
 
 Thy word created all, and doth create ; 
 Thy splendor fills all space with rays divine ; 
 
 Thou art and wert and shalt be ! Glorious ! Great I 
 
 Light-giving, life-sustaining Potentate ! 
 
 3. Thy chains the unmeasured universe surround 
 
 Upheld by thee, by thee inspired with breath ! 
 Thou the beginning with the end hast bound,

 So suns are born, so worlds spring forth from thee ; 
 And as the spangles in the sunny rays 
 
 Shine round the silver snow, the pageantry 
 Of heaven's bright army glitters in thy praise.

 A glorious company of golden streams 
 Lamps of celestial ether burning bright 
 
 Suns lighting systems with their joyous beams? 
 But thou to these art as the noon to night. 
 
 5. Naught ! But the effluence of thy light divine, 
 
 Pervading worlds, hath reached my bosom too ; 
 Yes, in my spirit doth thy spirit shine 
 As shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew.

 Created me. Thou source of life and good. 
 Thou spirit of my spirit, and my Lord,

 Over the abyss of death, and bade it wear 
 The garments of eternal day, and wing 
 
 Its heavenly flight beyond this little sphere, 
 
 Even to its source to thee its Author there. 
 
 7. O thoughts ineffable ! O visions blest ! 
 
 Though worthless our conceptions all of thee, 
 Yet shall thy shadowed image fill our breast, 
 
 And waft its homage to thy Deity. 
 God ! thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar, 
 
 Thus seek thy presence Being wise and good ! 
 'Midst thy vast works admire, obey, adore ; 
 And when the tongue is eloquent no more 
 
 The soul shall speak in tears of gratitude.

 The Rising of 1776. 
 
 T. BUCHANAN READ. 
 
 1. Out of the North the wild news came, 
 Far flashing on its wings of flame, 
 Swift as the boreal light which flies 
 At midnight through the startled skies. 
 
 2. And there was tumult in the air. 
 
 The fife's shrill note, the drum's loud beat, 
 And through the wide land every- where 
 
 The answering tread of hurrying feet ; 
 While the first oath of Freedom's gun 
 Came on the blast from Lexington ; 
 And Concord roused, no longer tame, 
 Forgot her old baptismal name, 
 Made bare her patriot arm of power, 
 And swelled the discord of the hour. 
 
 3. Within its shade of elm and oak 
 
 The church of Berkley Manor stood; 
 There Sunday found the rural folk, 
 And some esteemed of gentle blood. 
 
 In vain their feet with loitering tread 
 Pass'd 'mid the graves where rank is naught ; 
 All could not read the lesson taught 
 
 In that republic of the dead. 
 
 4. How sweet the hour of Sabbath talk, 
 
 The vale with peace and sunshine full, 
 Where all the happy people walk, 
 
 Decked in their homespun flax and wool 1 
 Where youth's gay hats with blossoms bloom, 
 And every maid, with simple art, 
 Wears on her breast, like her own heart,

 5. The pastor came : his snowy locks 
 
 Hallowed his brow of thought and care ; 
 And calmly, as shepherds lead their flocks, 
 He led into the house of prayer. 
 
 6. The pastor rose ; the prayer was strong ; 
 The psalm was warrior David's song ; 
 The text, a few short words of might 
 
 " The Lord of hosts shall arm the right! " 
 He spoke of wrongs too long endured, 
 Of sacred rights to be secured ; 
 Then from his patriot tongue of flame 
 The startling words for Freedom came. 
 The stirring sentences he spake 
 Compelled the heart to glow or quake, 
 And, rising on his theme's broad wing, 
 
 And grasping in his nervous hand 
 
 The imaginary battle-brand, 
 In face of death he dared to fling 
 Defiance to a tyrant king. 
 
 7. Even as he spoke, his frame, renewed 
 In eloquence of attitude, 
 
 Rose, as it seemed, a shoulder higher; 
 Then swept his kindling glance of fire 
 From startled pew to breathless choir ; 
 When suddenly his mantle wide 
 His hands impatient flung aside. 
 And, lo ! he met their wondering eyes 
 Complete in all a warrior's guise. 
 
 8. A moment there was awful pause, 
 
 When Berkley cried, " Cease, traitor! cease! 
 God's temple is the house of peace ! " 
 
 The other shouted, "Nay, not so, 
 When God is with our righteous cause ; 
 His holiest places then are ours, 
 His temples are our forts and towers 
 
 That frown upon the tyrant foe ; 
 In this, the dawn of Freedom's day, 
 There is a time to fight and pray ! "

 9. And now before the open door 
 
 The warrior priest had ordered so 
 Th' enlisting trumpet's sudden roar 
 Rang through the chapel, o'er and o'er, 
 
 Its long reverberating blow, 
 So loud and clear, it seemed the ear 
 Of dusty Death must wake and hear. 
 
 10. And there the startling drum and fife 
 
 Fired the living with fiercer life ; 
 While overhead, with wild increase, 
 Forgetting its ancient toll of peace, 
 
 The great bell swung as ne'er before : 
 It seemed as it would never cease ; 
 And every word its ardor flung 
 From off its jubilant iron tongue 
 
 Was, " War! War! WAR!" 
 
 11. " Who dares " this was the patriot's cry, 
 
 As striding from the desk he came 
 " Come out with me, in Freedom's name, 
 For her to live, for her to die ?" 
 A hundred hands flung up reply, 
 A hundred voices answered "I!"

 The Bells. 
 
 Hear the loud alarum bells 
 Brazen bells ! 
 What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells! 
 In the startled ear of night 
 How they scream out their affright ! 
 Too much horrified to speak, 
 They can only shriek, shriek, 
 Out of tune, 
 In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire, 
 In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire 
 Leaping higher, higher, higher, 
 With a desperate desire, 
 And a resolute endeavor, 
 Now now to sit or never, 
 
 By the side of the pale-faced moon. 
 O the bells, bells, bells, 
 What a tale their terror tells 
 
 Of despair ! 
 How they clang, and clash, and roar I 
 What a horror they outpour 
 
 On the bosom of the palpitating air! 
 Yet the ear, it fully knows, 
 By the twanging 
 And the clanging, 
 How the danger ebbs and flows ; 
 Yet the ear distinctly tells, 
 In the jangling 
 And the wrangling, 
 How the danger sinks and swells,

 Oral. 
 
 Tlie Oral is that quality of voice in which the sound is 
 sent forth from the organs in a thin, feeble tone, with the 
 resonance in the forward part of the mouth* 
 


## p. 78 (#82) ##############################################

78 Science of Elocution. 
 
 It is heard in the utterance of persons in feeble 
 health, and frequently by those who are afflicted with 
 affectation. 
 
 But little difficulty will be experienced in producing 
 this quality of voice sufficiently perfect for practical 
 purposes. 
 
 A greater difficulty will be to avoid its unconscious use. 
 No defect is more common, particularly with ladies, 
 than the too frequent use of the oral tone. 
 
 It is rarely required except in impersonation. To 
 cultivate the oral quality, practice the following sounds, 
 words, and sentences in a thin, feeble tone with the res- 
 onance near the front teeth. Like the Pure Tone and 
 Orotund, it may be given in all the Forms, but there 
 are few selections that will require the oral throughout, 
 and none, so far as known, that will demand the Oral 
 Explosive.

 Oral, Effusive Form When Used. 
 The Oral in the Effusive Form is used in the ex- 
 pression of weakness, feebleness, and languor, and chiefly 
 in the utterances of children. In the following selec- 
 tion the Oral Effusive will be required only in the ut- 
 terances of the dying child, all the other parts of the se- 
 lection should be given with Pure Tone, Expulsive Form.

 The Death of Little Jim. 
 
 1. The cottage was a thatched one, the outside old and mean, 
 But all within that little cot was wondrous neat and clean; 
 The night was dark and stormy, the wind was howling wild, 
 As a patient mother sat beside the death-bed of her child : 
 A little worn-out creature, his once bright eyes grown dim : 
 It was a collier's wife and child, they called him little Jim. 
 
 2. And O ! to see the briny tears fast hurrying down her cheek, 
 As she offered up the prayer, in thought, she was afraid to 
 
 Lest she might waken one loved far better than her life ; 
 For she had all a mother's heart, had that poor collier's wife. 
 With hands uplifted, see, she kneels beside the sufferer's bed, 
 And prays that God would spare her boy, and take herself 
 instead. 
 
 3. She gets her answer from the child ; soft fall the words from 
 
 him. 
 " Mother, the angels do so smile, and beckon little Jim. 
 I have no pain, dear mother, now ; but O ! I am so dry. 
 Just moisten poor Jim's lips again, and, mother, don't you 
 
 cry." 
 With gentle, trembling haste she held the liquid to his lip ; 
 He smiled to thank her as he took each little, tiny sip. 
 
 4. " Tell father, when he comes from work, I said good-night 
 
 to him 
 And, mother, now I'll go to sleep." Alas! poor little Jim!

 She knew that he was dying; that the child she lored so 
 
 dear 
 Had uttered the last words that she might ever hope to hear : 
 The cottage door is opened, the collier's step is heard, 
 The father and the mother meet, yet neither speaks a word. 
 
 5. He felt that all was over, he knew his child was dead ; 
 He took the candle in his hand and walked toward the bed \ 
 His quivering lips gave token of the grief he'd fain conceal, 
 And see, his wife has joined him the stricken couple kneel : 
 With hearts bowed down by sadness, they humbly ask of 
 
 Him, 
 In heaven once more to meet again their own poor little Jim.

 In this and the remaining lessons the particular ex- 
 ercises in Position and Breathing will be omitted, but 
 it is not intended that they should be neglected in the 
 class drill. Exercises, similar to those presented in the 
 previous lessons, should form part of every class exer- 
 cise. It is not the purpose of the work to present 
 every exercise that should be given to pupils; much will 
 be left for the teacher to supply.

 Prone on the soldier's couch, ah, how can I rest, 
 With this shot-shatter'd head and saber-pierced breast? 
 Comrades, at roll-call when I shall be sought,

 O, that last charge ! 
 Right through the dread hell-fire of shrapnel and shell, 
 Through without faltering, clear through with a yell ! 
 Right in their midst, in the turmoil and gloom,

 O, that last charge ! 
 
 It was duty ! 
 Some things are worthless, and some others so good 
 That nations who buy them pay only in blood. 
 For Freedom and Country each man owes his part ; 
 And here I pay my share, all warm from my heart : 
 
 It is duty !

 My mother, dear mother ! with meek tearful eye, 
 Farewell ! and God bless you, for ever and aye !

 Dying at last ! 
 
 Great Heaven! this bullet-hole gapes like a grave; 
 A curse on the aim of the traitorous knave ! 
 Is there never a one of you knows how to pray, 
 Or speak for a man as his life ebbs away?

 Can't you see I am dying? Great God, how I bleed !

 Aspirate. 
 
 The Aspirate is that quality of voice in zchich the 
 breath is sent forth from the organ in a whisper-tone 
 with the resonance in the middle of the mouth. 
 
 Without command of the Aspirate Quality it is im- 
 possible to give appropriate expression to the emotions 
 of fear, awe, horror, dread, amazement, and similar 
 passions. 
 
 The Aspirate, when combined with Orotund, intensi- 
 fies the utterance of deep solemnitj^, sublimity, adora- 
 tion, and profound reverence. 
 
 It is in this combined form that the Aspirate will be 
 of the greatest practical advantage to the general 
 student.

 Like all other elements of utterance, it must be prac-

 Aspirate, Expulsive Form When Used. 
 
 The Aspirate in the Expulsive Form is the quality- 
 appropriate for the expression of suppressed command, 
 sudden fear, alarm, and terror. Combined with the 
 Orotund, it gives intensity to awe, horror, and dread.

 Anon. 
 
 Soldiers, you are now within a few steps of the enemy's 
 outposts! Our scouts report them as slumbering in parties 
 around their watchfires, and utterly unprepared for our ap- 
 proach. A swift and noiseless advance around that projecting 
 rock, and we are upon them we capture them without the 
 possibility of resistance. One disorderly noise or motion may 
 leave us at the mercy of their advanced guard. Let every 
 man keep the strictest silence under the pain of instant death.

 Aspirate, Explosive Form When Used. 
 
 The Aspirate in the Explosive Form is the quality 
 of voice appropriate for the expression of intense fern; 
 horror, awe, and dread. Mingled with the Orotund, 
 it intensifies the expressions excited by sudden terror 
 and alarm. 
 
 There are few selections that will require the As- 
 pirate Explosive throughout. It will be most frequent- 
 ly required in the utterance of two or three words, or 
 a short sentence, as in the words " hush" " hark" 
 " avaunt" etc.

 Macbeth. Scene ii. Act ii. 
 Enter Lady Macbeth. 
 
 Lady M. That which hath made them drunk hath made me 
 bold; 
 What hath quench 1 d them hath given me fire. Hark! Peace! 
 It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman, 
 Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it : 
 The doors are open ; and the surfeited grooms 
 Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd their 
 
 possets, 
 That death and nature do contend about them, 
 Whether they live or die. 
 
 Mad. [ Within,] Who's there ? what, ho ! 
 
 Lady M. Alack, lam afraid they have awaked, 
 And His not done. The attempt and not the deed 
 Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready; 
 He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled 
 My father as he slept, I had done't. 
 
 Enter Macbeth. 
 
 My husband ! 
 
 Macb. I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise f 
 
 Lady M. I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry. 
 Did not you speak ?

 Macb. This is a sorry sight. [Looking on his hands. 
 
 Lady M. A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight. 
 
 Macb. There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried 
 "Murder!" 
 That they did wake each other : I stood and heard them : 
 But they did say their prayers, and address' d them 
 Again to sleep. 
 
 Lady M. There are two lodged together. 
 
 Macb. One cried "God bless us!" and "Amen" the other; 
 As they had seen me with these hangman's hands. 
 Listening their fear, I could not say "Amen," 
 When they did say " God bless us! " 
 
 Lady M. Consider it not so deeply. 
 
 Macb. But wherefore could not I pronounce "Amen ? " 
 I had most need of blessing, and " Amen " 
 Stuck in my throat. 
 
 Lady M. These deeds must not be thought 
 
 After these ways : so, it will make us mad. 
 
 Macb. Methought I heard a voice cry " Sleep no more ! 
 Macbeth does murder sleep," the innocent sleep, 
 Sleep that knits up the raveled sleave of care, 
 The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath, 
 Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course, 
 Chief nourisher in life's feast, 
 
 Lady M. What do you mean ? 
 
 Macb. Still it cried " Sleep no more ! ! " to all the house ; 
 u Glamis hath murdered sleep, and therefore Cawdor 
 Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.' 1 '' 
 
 Lady M. Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane, 
 You do unbend your noble strength, to think 
 So brainsickly of things. Go get some water, 
 And wash this filthy witness from your hand. 
 Why did you bring these daggers from the place? 
 They must lie there : go, carry them ; and smear 
 The sleepy grooms with blood. 
 
 Macb. I'll go no more: 
 
 I am afraid to think what I have done; 
 Look on't again I dare not. 
 
 Lady M. Infirm of purpose! 
 
 Give me the daggers : the sleeping and the dead

 Are but as pictures : His the eye of childhood 
 That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed, 
 I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal ; 
 For it must seem their guilt. [Exit. 
 
 Macb. Whence is that knoching ? 
 
 How is't with me, when every noise appalls me? 
 What hands are here ? ha ! they pluck out mine eyes. 
 Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood 
 Clean from my hand ? No, this my hand will rather 
 The multitudinous seas incarnadine, 
 Making the green one red. 
 
 He-enter Lady Macbeth. 
 
 Lady M. My hands are of your color ; but I shame 
 To wear a heart so white. I hear a knocking 
 At the south entry : retire we to our chamber ; 
 A little water clears us of this deed : 
 How easy is it, then ! Your constancy 
 Hath left you unattended. Hark ! more knocking. 
 Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us, 
 And show us to be watchers. Be not lost 
 So poorly in your thoughts. 
 
 Macb. To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself. 
 Wake Duncan with thy knocking ! I would thou couldst !

 Pectoral Quality. 
 
 The Pectoral is that quality of voice in which the 
 breath is sent forth in a harsh, husky sound, with the 
 resonance in the upper part of the throat. 
 
 This quality of voice is frequently illustrated by per- 
 sons whose organs have been injured by strong drink.

 BYRON. 
 
 I had a dream which was not all a dream : 
 The bright sun was extinguish'd, and the stars 
 Did wander, darkling, in the eternal space, 
 Ray less and pathless ; and the icy earth 
 Swung blind and black'ning in the moonless air. 
 Morn came and went and came, and brought no day ; 
 And men forgot their passions in the dread 
 Of this their desolation; and all hearts 
 Were chill'd into a selfish prayer for light. 
 And they did live by watch-fires; and the thrones, 
 The palaces of crowned kings, the huts, 
 The habitations of all things which dwell, 
 Were burned for beacons; cities were consumed, 
 And men were gather'd round their blazing homes 
 To look once more into each other's face. 
 Happy were those who dwelt within the eye 
 Of the volcanoes and their mountain torch. 
 A fearful hope was all the world contained. 
 Forests were set on fire ; but hour by hour 
 They fell and faded, and the crackling trunks 
 Extinguished with a crash, and all was black. 
 The brows of men, by the despairing light, 
 Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits 
 The flashes fell upon them. Some lay down, 
 And hid their eyes and wept ; and some did rest 
 Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smiled; 
 And others hurried to and fro, and fed 
 Their funeral piles with fuel, and look'd up 
 With mad disquietude on the dull sky, 
 The pall of a past world; and then, again, 
 With curses cast them down upon the dust, 
 And gnash'd their teeth, and howl'd. The wild birds 
 shriek'd,

 And terrified did flutter on the ground, 
 
 And flap their useless wings ; the wildest brutes 
 
 Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawled 
 
 And twined themselves among the multitude, 
 
 Hissing, but stingless they were slain for food. 
 
 And War, which for a moment was no more, 
 
 Did glut himself again ; a meal was bought 
 
 With blood ; and each sat sullenly apart, 
 
 Gorging himself in gloom ; no love was left ; 
 
 All earth was but one thought, and that was death 
 
 Immediate and inglorious ; and men 
 
 Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh : 
 
 The meagre by the meagre were devoured. 
 
 Even dogs assailed their masters ; all save one 
 
 And he was faithful to a corse, and kept 
 
 The birds, and beasts, and famished men at bay 
 
 Till hunger clung them, or the drooping dead 
 
 Lured their lank jaws ; himself sought out no food, 
 
 But with a piteous and perpetual moan, 
 
 And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand 
 
 Which answered not with a caress, he died. 
 
 The crowd was famish'd by degrees ; but two 
 
 Of an enormous city did survive, 
 
 And they were enemies. They met beside 
 
 The dying embers of an altar-place, 
 
 Where had been heaped a mass of holy things 
 
 For an unholy usage ; they raked up, 
 
 And, shivering, scraped with their cold skeleton hands 
 
 The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath 
 
 Blew for a little life, and made a flame 
 
 Which was a mockery ; then they lifted 
 
 Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld 
 
 Each other's aspect saw, and shriek'd, and died. 
 
 Even of their mutual hideousness they died, 
 
 Unknowing who he was upon whose brow 
 
 Famine had written fiend. The world was void ; 
 
 The populous and the powerful was a lump 
 
 Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless 
 
 A lump of death, a chaos of hard clay. 
 
 The rivers, lakes, and ocean all stood still,

 And nothing stirred within their silent depths. 
 
 Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea, 
 
 And their masts fell down piecemeal ; as they dropp'd 
 
 They slept on the abyss without a surge. 
 
 The waves were dead ; the tides were in their grave ; 
 
 The moon, their mistress, had expired before; 
 
 The winds were withered in the stagnant air, 
 
 And the clouds perished. Darkness hath no need 
 
 Of aid from them. She was the universe.

 Contrasting Pure Tone, Aspirate, Orotund, and Pectoral in Effusive and 
 Expulsive Forms. 
 
 Repeat the elements, words, and sentences with 
 
 1. Effusive Pure Tone. 
 
 2. Expulsive Aspirate. 
 
 3. Effusive Orotund.

 5. Expulsive Pure Tone. 
 
 6. Effusive Aspirate. 
 1. Expulsive Orotund. 
 8. Effusive Pectoral. 
 
 Pectoral Expulsive When Used. 
 
 The Pectoral in the Expulsive Form is the quality- 
 appropriate for the expression of the more violent 
 forms of hate, malice, scorn, revenge, etc. 
 
 It will be observed that while the same passions are 
 expressed by different qualities, and sometimes by the 
 same quality in different forms, yet they are always in 
 different degrees. It is the quality of voice that indi- 
 cates the emotion or passion, the form that shows its 
 intensity. Effusive Pectoral and Expulsive Pectoral 
 may both express dread and horror, but not in the 
 same degrees.

 Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days ; 
 
 So full of dismal terror was the time ! 
 
 Methought, that I had broken from the Tower, 
 
 And was embarked to cross to Burgundy, 
 
 And in my company, my brother Gloster : 
 
 Who from my cabin tempted me to walk 
 
 Upon the hatches, thence we looked toward England, 
 
 And cited up a thousand heavy times, 
 
 During the wars of York and Lancaster, 
 
 That had befallen us. 
 
 S. As we paced along 
 
 Upon the giddy footing of the hatches, 
 Methought, that Gloster stumbled; and, in falling, 
 Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard, 
 Into the tumbling billows of the main. 
 
 Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown I 
 What dreadful noise of water in mine ears ! 
 What sights of ugly death within mine eyes ! 
 
 3. Methought, I saw a thousand fearful wrecks ; 
 A thousand men, that fishes gnawed upon; 
 Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl, 
 Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels, 
 
 All scattered in the bottom of the sea : 
 
 Some lay in dead men's skulls ; and in those holes 
 
 Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept 
 
 (As 'twere in scorn of eyes) reflecting gems, 
 
 That wooed the slimy bottom of the deep, 
 
 And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by. 
 
 4. My dream was lengthened after life ; 
 O, then began the tempest to my soul ! 
 
 1 passed, methought, the melancholy flood, 
 With that grim ferryman which poets write of, 
 Unto the kingdom of perpetual night. 
 
 The first that there did greet my stranger-soul, 
 Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick ; 
 Who cried aloud, What scourge for 'perjury 
 Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence ?

 5. And so he vanished : Then came wand'ring by 
 A shadow like an angel, with bright hair 
 Dabbled in blood; and he shrieked out aloud, 
 Clarence is come, false, fleeting, perjured Clarence, 
 That stabbed me in the field of Tewksbury; 
 Seize on him, furies, take him to your torments ! 
 With that, methought, a legion of foul fiends 
 Environed me, and howled in mine ears 
 Such hideous cries, that, with the very noise, 
 I trembling waked, and, for a season after, 
 Could not believe but that I was in hell ; 
 Such terrible impression made my dream!

 t. Conscript Fathers ! 
 
 I do not rise to waste the night in words ; 
 Let that plebeian talk ; 'tis not my trade ; 
 But here I stand for right let him show proofs 
 For Roman right ; though none, it seems, dare stand 
 To take their share with me. Ay, cluster there ! 
 Cling to your master, judges, Romans, slaves ! 
 His charge is false ; I dare him to his proof. 
 You have my answer. Let my actions speak ! 
 
 2. But this I will avow, that I have scorned, 
 And still do scorn, to hide my sense of wrong ! 
 Who brands me on the forehead, breaks my sword, 
 Or lays the bloody scourge upon my back, 
 Wrongs me not half so much as he who shuts 
 The gates of honor on me turning out 
 
 The Roman from his birthright; and, for what? 
 To fling your offices to every slave ! 
 Vipers, that creep where man disdains to climb. 
 And, having wound their loathsome track to the top 
 Of this huge, moldering monument of Rome, 
 Hang hissing at the nobler man below ! 
 Come, consecrated lictors, from your thrones ; 
 Fling down your scepters ; take the rod and ax 
 And make the murder as you make the law !

 From daily contact with the things I loathe ? 
 "Tried and convicted traitor!" Who says this ?

 I held some slack allegiance till this hour; 
 
 But now my sword's my own. Smile on, my lords !

 Guttural Quality. 
 
 The Guttural is that quality of voice in which the 
 sound is sent forth from the organs in a rough, harsh, 
 discordant tone, with the resonance in the lower part of 
 the throat. It resembles in quality the growling utter 
 ance of the lower animals. It differs from the Pectoral 
 only in degree. They are, indeed, one and the same 
 quality, the Pectoral being but a milder form of the 
 Guttural. To cultivate this quality of voice practice 
 the elements, words, and sentences with a muffled, harsh, 
 smothered tone.

 I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him. 
 
 He hates our sacred nation ; and he rails,

 Which he calls interest : Cursed be my tribe

 By wasting pain, till time and toil 
 
 Its iron strength had spent.

 2. "They come around me here, and say 
 
 My days of life are o'er 
 That I shall mount my noble steed 
 
 And lead my band no more : 
 They come, and to my beard they dare 
 
 To tell me now, that I, 
 Their own liege lord and master born 
 
 That I ha! ha! must die! 
 
 3. " And what is Death ? I've dared him oft 
 
 Before the Paynim's spear 
 Think ye he's entered at my gate, 
 
 Has come to seek me here ? 
 I've met him, faced him, scorned him, 
 
 When the fight was raging hot 
 I'll try his might I'll brave his power

 5. A hundred hands were busy then; 
 
 The banquet forth was spread, 
 And rang the heavy oaken floor 
 
 With many a martial tread ; 
 While from the rich, dark tracery, 
 
 Along the vaulted wall, 
 Lights gleamed on harness, plume, and spear, 
 
 O'er the proud Gothic hall. 
 
 6. Fast hurrying through the outer gate, 
 
 The mailed retainers poured, 
 On through the portal's frowning arch, 
 And thronged around the board;

 Up, all ! and shout for Rudiger, 
 
 * Defiance unto Death! ' " 
 
 9. Bowl rang to bowl, steel clang to steel, 
 
 And rose a deafening cry, 
 That made the torches flare around, 
 
 And shook the flags on high : 
 "Ho! cravens! do ye fear him? 
 
 Slaves! traitors! have ye flown? 
 Ho! cowards, have ye left me 
 
 To meet him here alone? 
 
 10. " But I defy him! let him come! " 
 Down rang the massive cup, 
 
 While from its sheath the ready blade 
 Came flashing half-way up; 
 
 And with the black and heavy plumes 
 Scarce trembling on his head, 
 
 There, in his dark, carved, oaken chair, 
 Old Rudiger sat dead !

 Announce Mark Haley's morning rounds. 
 
 Thus all the cold and wintry day 
 He labors much for little*pay; 
 Yet feels no less of happiness 
 Than many a richer man, I guess, 
 When through the shades of eve he spies 
 The light of his own home, and cries, 
 
 "Charco' ! charco'!" 
 And Martha from the door replies, 
 
 "Mark, ho! Mark, ho!" 
 " Charco' ! " " Mark, ho ! " Such joy abounds 
 When he has closed his daily rounds. 
 
 The hearth is warm, the fire is bright ; 
 
 And, while his hand, wash'd clean and white, 
 
 Holds Martha's tender hand once more, 
 
 His glowing face bends fondly o'er 
 
 The crib wherein his darling lies; 
 
 And in a coaxing tone he cries, 
 
 "Charco'! charco'!" 
 And baby with a laugh replies, 
 
 "Ah, go! ah, go!" 
 " Charco' ! " " Ah, go ! "While at the sounds 
 The mother's heart with gladness bounds. 
 
 Then honored be the charcoal man ! 
 Though dusky as an African, 
 'Tis not for you, that chance to be 
 A little better clad than he,

 Although from morn till eve he cries,

 Proclaim Mark Haley's daily rounds !

 The Green Mountain Justice. 
 1 " The snow is deep," the Justice said; 
 "There's mighty mischief overhead." 
 "High talk, indeed! " his wife exclaimed; 
 "What, sir! shall Providence be blamed?" 
 The Justice, laughing, said, " O no ! 
 I only meant the loads of snow 
 Upon the roof. The barn is weak ; 
 1 greatly fear the roof will break. 
 So hand me up the spade, my dear, 
 I'll mount the barn, the roof to clear." 
 " No ! " said the wife; "the barn is high, 
 And if you slip, and fall, and die, 
 How will my living be secured? 
 Stephen, your life is not insured. 
 But tie a rope your waist around, 
 And it will hold you safe and sound." 
 "I will," said he. " Now for the roof 
 All snugly tied, and danger-proof ! 
 Excelsior ! Excel But no ! 
 The rope is not secured below ! " 
 Said Radiol, "Climb, the end to throw 
 Across the top, and I will go 
 And tie that end around my waist." 
 1 ' Well, every woman to her taste ; 
 You always would be tightly laced.

 Rachel, when you became my bride, 
 I thought the knot securely tied ; 
 But lest the bond should break in twain, 
 I'll have it fastened once again." 
 
 2. Below the elbows tied around, 
 She takes her station on the ground, 
 While on the roof, beyond the ridge, 
 He shovels clear the lower edge. 
 But, sad mischance ! the loosened snow 
 Comes sliding down, to plunge below. 
 And as he tumbles with the slide, 
 Up Rachel goes on t'other side. 
 Just half-way down the Justice hung; 
 Just half-way up the woman swung. 
 " Good land o' Goshen! " shouted she; 
 "Why, do you see it?" answered he. 
 
 8. The couple, dangling in the breeze, 
 Like turkeys hung outside to freeze, 
 At their rope's end and wit's end, too, 
 Shout back and forth what best to do. 
 Cried Stephen, " Take it coolly, wife; 
 All have their ups and downs in life." 
 Quoth Rachel, "What a pity 'tis 
 To joke at such a time as this ! 
 A man whose wife is being hung 
 Should know enough to hold his tongue." 
 1 ' Now, Rachel, as I look below, 
 I see a tempting heap of snow. 
 Suppose, my dear, I take my knife, 
 And cut the rope to save my life." 
 She shouted, "Don't! 'twould be my death- 
 I see some pointed stones beneath. 
 A better way would be to call 
 With all our might, for Phebe Hall." 
 "Agreed! " he roared. First he, then she 
 Gave tongue: "O Phebe! Phebe! PJie-e-be 
 Hall ! " in tones both fine and coarse, 
 Enough to make a drover hoarse.

 4. Now Phebe, over at the farm, 
 
 Was sitting, sewing, snug and warm ; 
 But hearing, as she thought, her name, 
 Sprang up, and to the rescue came, 
 Beheld the scene, and thus she thought : 
 "If now a kitchen chair were brought, 
 And I could reach the lady's foot, 
 I'd draw her downward by the boot, 
 Then cut the rope, and let him go ; 
 He cannot miss the pile of snow." 
 He sees her moving toward his wife, 
 Armed with a chair and carving-knife, 
 And, ere he is aware, perceives 
 His head ascending to the eaves ; 
 And, guessing what the two are at, 
 Screams from beneath the roof, " Stop that! 
 You'll make me fall too far, by half ! " 
 But Phebe answers, with a laugh, 
 "Please tell a body by what right 
 You've brought your wife to such a plight l" 
 And then, with well-directed blows, 
 She cuts the rope and down he goes. 
 
 5. The wife untied, they walk around, 
 When lo ! no Stephen can be found. 
 They call in vain, run to and fro ; 
 They look around, above, below ; 
 No trace or token can they see, 
 And deeper grows the mystery. 
 Then Rachel's heart within her sank ; 
 But, glancing at the snowy bank, 
 She caught a little gleam of hope, 
 A gentle movement of the rope. 
 They scrape away a little snow; 
 What's this? A hat! Ah! he's below. 
 Then upward heaves the snowy pile, 
 And forth he stalks in tragic style, 
 Unhurt, and with a roguish smile ; i 
 And Rachel sees, with glad surprise, 
 The missing found, the fallen rise.

 Nasal Quality. 
 
 The Nasal is a dull, heavy quality of voice, having 
 the resonance in the nasal passage. It is not, as is gen- 
 erally supposed, a speaking through the nose, for the 
 tone may be produced as well with nostrils closed as 
 with them open, but simply placing the resonance in the 
 nasal passage. As this quality is rarely used, except in 
 ludicrous impersonation, it will be presented only in one 
 form, the Expulsive.

 Nasal Expulsive When Used. 
 
 The Nasal Quality will rarely be required except in the 
 personation of peculiar characters, in which the object is 
 to burlesque and render more ludicrous. In the fol- 
 lowing selection the utterances of Darius should be 
 given with the Nasal Expulsive.

 Darius Green and his Flying-Machine. 
 
 J. T. TBOWBBIDGE. 
 
 1. If ever there lived a Yankee lad, 
 Wise or otherwise, good or bad, 
 Who, seeing the birds fly. didn't jump 
 With flapping arms from stake or stump, 
 Or, spreading the tail of his coat for a bail, 
 Take a soaring leap from post or rail, 
 And wonder why he couldn't fly, 
 And flap and flutter and wish and try, 
 If ever you knew a country dunce 
 Who didn't try that as often as once, 
 All I can say is, that's a sign 
 He never would do for a hero of mine.

 An aspiring genius was Dary Green; 
 The son of a farmer, age fourteen, 
 His body was long and lank and lean, 
 Just right for flying, as will be seen ; 
 He had two eyes as bright as a bean, 
 And a freckled nose that grew between, 
 A little awry ; for I must mention 
 That he had riveted his attention 
 Upon his wonderful invention, 
 Twisting his tongue as he twisted the strings, 
 And working his face as he work'd the wings, 
 And with every turn of gimlet or screw 
 Turning and screwing his mouth round too, 
 Till his nose seem'd bent to catch the scent, 
 Around some corner, of new-baked pies, 
 And his wrinkled cheeks and his squinting eyes 
 Grew puckered into a queer grimace, 
 That made him look very droll in the face, 
 And also very wise. 
 
 And wise he must have been, to do more 
 Than ever a genius did before, 
 Excepting Daedalus of yore 
 And his son Icarus, who wore 
 Upon their backs those wings of wax 
 He had read of in the old almanacs. 
 Darius was clearly of the opinion, 
 That the air is also man's dominion, 
 And that, with paddle or fin or pinion, 
 We soon or late shall navigate 
 The azure as now we sail the sea. 
 'lite thing looks simple enough to me; 
 
 And, if you doubt it, 
 Hear how Darius reason'd about it : 
 
 " The birds can fly, an' why can't I? 
 
 Must we give in," says he with a grin, 
 
 " That the bluebird an' phoebe are smarter'n we be? 
 
 Jest fold our hands, an' see the swaller 
 
 An' black-bird an' cat-bird beat us holler?

 Does the little chatterin', sassy wren, 
 
 No bigger'n my thumb, know more than men? 
 
 Jest show me that ! ur prove 't the bat 
 
 Hez got more brains than's in my hat, 
 
 An' I'll back down, an' not till then ! " 
 
 He argued further: " Nur I can't see 
 
 What's th' use o' wings to a bumble-bee, 
 
 Fur to git a livin' with, more'n to me ; 
 
 Aint my business important's his'n is? 
 
 That Icarus made a pretty muss, 
 
 Him an' his daddy Daedalus ; 
 
 They might 'a' know'd that wings made o' wax 
 
 Wouldn't stand sun-heat an' hard whacks : 
 
 I'll make mine o' luther, ur suthin' ur other. " 
 
 And he said to himself, as he tinker'd and plann'd, 
 
 " But I aint goin' to show my hand 
 
 To nummies that never can understand 
 
 The fust idee that's big an' grand." 
 
 So he kept his secret from all the rest, 
 
 Safely buttoned within his vest ; 
 
 And in the loft above the shed 
 
 Himself he locks, with thimble and thread 
 
 And wax and hammer and buckles and screws, 
 
 And all such things as geniuses use ; 
 
 Two bats for patterns, curious fellows ! 
 
 A charcoal-pot and a pair of bellows ; 
 
 Some wire, and several old umbrellas ; 
 
 A carriage-cover, for tail and wings; 
 
 A piece of harness ; and straps and string ; 
 
 And a big strong box, in which he locks 
 
 These and a hundred other things. 
 
 His grinning brothers, Reuben and Burke 
 
 And Nathan and Jotham and Solomon, lurk 
 
 Around the corner to see him work, 
 
 Sitting cross-legged, like a Turk, 
 
 Drawing the wax'd-end through with a jerk, 
 
 And boring the holes with a comical quirk 
 
 Of his wise old head, and a knowing smirk.

 But vainly they mounted each other's backs, 
 
 And poked through knot-holes and pried through cracks ; 
 
 With wood from the pile and straw from the stacks 
 
 He plugg'd the knot-holes and calk'd the cracks ; 
 
 And a dipper of water, which one would think 
 
 He had brought up into the loft to drink 
 
 When he chanced to be dry, 
 
 Stood always nigh, for Darius was sly ! 
 
 And, whenever at work he happen'd to spy 
 
 At chink or crevice a blinking eye, 
 
 He let the dipper of water fly : 
 
 " Take that! an', ef ever ye git a peep, 
 
 Guess ye'll ketch a weasel asleep ! " 
 
 And he sings as he locks his big strong box : 
 
 5. " The weasel's head is small an' trim, 
 An' he is little an' long an' slim, 
 
 An' quick of motion an' nimble of limb, 
 
 An' ef you'll be advised by me, 
 
 Keep wide-awake when ye're ketchin' him! " 
 
 6. So day after day 
 
 He stitch'd and tinker'd and hammer'd away, 
 
 Till at last 'twas done, 
 The greatest invention under the sun ! 
 " An' now," says Darius, "hooray for some fun ! " 
 
 7. 'Twas the Fourth of July, and the weather was dry, 
 And not a cloud was on all the sky, 
 
 Save a few light fleeces, which here and there 
 
 Half-mist, half-air, 
 Like foam on the ocean went floating by, 
 Just as lovely a morning as ever was seen 
 For a nice little trip in a flying-machine. 
 Thought cunning Darius, " Now I sha'n't go 
 Along 'ith the fellers to see the show: 
 I'll say I've got sich a terrible cough! 
 An' then when the folks 'ave all gone off, 
 I'll hev full swing fur to try the thing, 
 An' practice a little on the wing."

 8. " Aint goin' to see the celebration? " 
 Says Brother Nate. " No ; botheration ! 
 I've got sich a cold a toothache I 
 
 My gracious ! feel's though I should fly ! " 
 Said Jotham, " Sho! guess ye better go." 
 
 .But Darius said, "No! 
 Shouldn't wonder 'f you might see me, though, 
 'Long 'bout noon, ef I git red 
 O' this jumpin', thumpin' pain in my head." 
 
 9. For all the while to himself he said, 
 
 " I tell ye what! 
 I'll fly a few times around the lot, 
 To see how it seems, then soon's I've got 
 The hang o' the thing, ez likely's not, 
 "I'll astonish the nation, an' all creation, 
 By flyin' over the celebration ! 
 Over their heads I'll sail like an eagle ; 
 I'll balance myself on my wings like a sea-gull ; 
 I'll dance on the chimbleys ; I'll stand on the steeple ; 
 I'll flop up to winders an' scare the people ! 
 I'll light on the liberty -pole, an' crow ; 
 An' I'll say to the gawpin' fools below, 
 ' What world's this 'ere that I've come near ? ' 
 Fur I'll make 'em b'lieve I'm a chap f 'm the Moon ; 
 An' I'll try a race 'ith their oV balloon ! " 
 
 10. He crept from his bed ; 
 
 And, seeing the others were gone, he said, 
 "I'm gittin' over the cold 'n my head." 
 
 And away he sped, 
 To open the wonderful box in the shed. 
 
 11. His brothers had walk'd but a little way, 
 When Jotham to Nathan chanced to say, 
 "What is the feller up to, hey?" 
 
 " Don'o', the's suthra' ur other to pay, 
 Ur he wouldn't 'a' stay'd to hum to-day." 
 Says Burke, "His toothache's all 'n his eye! 
 He never'd miss a Fo'th-o'-July, 
 Ef he hedn't got some machine to try."

 Then Sol, the little one, spoke : ' ' By darn 
 
 Le's hurry back, an' hide 'n the barn, 
 
 An' pay him fur tellin' us that yarn! " 
 
 "Agreed ! " Through the orchard they creep back, 
 
 Along by the fences, behind the stack, 
 
 And one by one, through a hole in the wall, 
 
 In under the dusty barn they crawl, 
 
 Dress'd in their Sunday garments all ; 
 
 And a very astonishing sight was that, 
 
 "When each in his cobwebb'd coat and hat 
 
 Came up through the floor like an ancient rat. 
 
 And there they hid ; and Reuben slid 
 
 The fastenings back, and the door undid. 
 
 ''Keep dark ! " said he, 
 "While I squint an' see what the' is to see." 
 
 12. As knights of old put on their mail, 
 From head to foot an iron suit, 
 
 Iron jacket and iron boot, 
 
 Iron breeches, and on the head 
 
 No hat, but an iron pot instead, 
 
 And under the chin the bail 
 
 (I believe they call'd the thing a helm), 
 
 Then sallied forth to overwhelm 
 
 The dragons and pagans that plagued the realm ; 
 
 So this modern knight prepared for flight, 
 
 Put on his wings and strapp'd them tight, 
 
 Jointed and jaunty, strong and light, 
 
 Buckled them fast to shoulder and hip, 
 
 Ten feet they measured from tip to tip ! 
 
 And a helm had he, but that he wore, 
 
 Not on his head, like those of yore, 
 
 But more like the helm of a ship. 
 
 13. " Hush !" Reuben said, "he's up in the shedi 
 He's open'd the winder, I see his head ! 
 
 He stretches it out, an' pokes it about, 
 Lookin' to see ">f the coast is clear, 
 
 An' nobody near; 
 Guess he don'o' who's hid in here !

 He's riggin' a spring-board over the sill ! 
 
 Stop laffin', Solomon ! Burke, keep still ! 
 
 He's a clim'in' out now Of all the things ! 
 
 What's he got on? I van, it's wings! 
 
 An' that t'other thing? I vum, it's a tail! 
 
 "An' there he sets like a hawk on a rail ! 
 
 Steppin' careful, he travels the length 
 
 Of his spring-board, an' teeters to try its strength, 
 
 Now he stretches his wings, like a monstrous bat : 
 
 Peeks over his shoulder, this way an' that, 
 
 Fur to see 'f the' 's any one passin' by, 
 
 But the' 's on'y ca'f an' a goslin' nigh. 
 
 They turn up at him wonderin' eye, 
 
 To see The dragon ! he's goin' to fly ! 
 
 Away he goes ! Jimminy ! what a jump ! 
 
 Flop flop an' plump to the ground with a thump ! 
 
 Flutt'rin' an flound'rin', all'n a lump ! " 
 
 14. As a demon is hurl'd by an angel's spear, 
 Heels over head, to his proper sphere, 
 Heels over head, and head over heels, 
 Dizzily down the abyss he wheels, 
 So fell Darius. Upon his crown, 
 In the midst of the barn-yard, he came down, 
 In a wonderful whirl of tangled strings, 
 Broken braces and broken springs, 
 Broken tail and broken wings, 
 Shooting-stars and various things, 
 Barn-yard litter of straw and chaff. 
 Away with a bellow fled the calf, 
 And what was that? Did the gosling laugh? 
 'Tis a merry roar from the old barn-door, 
 And he hears the voice of Jotham crying: 
 " Say, D'rius! how do you like flyin'? " 
 Slowly, ruefully, where he lay, 
 Darius just turn'd and look'd that way, 
 As he stanch'd his sorrowful nose with his cuff. 
 " Wal, I like flyin' well enough," 
 He said; " but the' aint sich a thunderin' sight 
 O' fun in't when ye come to light. "

 FORCE OF VOICE. 
 
 Force is the degree of intensity with which sound is 
 sent forth from the vocal organs. 
 
 Volume and loudness, though not identical with force, 
 are dependent upon it. A full volume is produced by- 
 energetic or impassioned force with Pure Tone, or Oro- 
 tund Quality in all forms; great loudness by impassioned 
 force, Pure Tone, or Orotund, High Pitch, and in all 
 forms. 
 
 No amount of force can give great volume or loud- 
 ness to Aspirate Quality in any of its forms. 
 
 Volume relates to the amount of space filled with the 
 sound; loudness to the distance at which a sound can be 
 heard. The low, deep tones of the organ fill a vast 
 space, though they would not be heard at a long dis- 
 tance. The high, shrill notes of the fife can be heard at 
 a long distance, yet they do not have great volume of 
 sound. 
 
 Force may be divided into Subdued, Moderate, En- 
 ergetic, and Impassioned. 
 
 These may again be subdivided at pleasure. 
 
 For convenience three subdivisions will be given 
 under each general division, though they may be in- 
 creased indefinitely. 
 
 Advantages of Force. 
 
 Perfect command of every degree of force is indis 
 pensable to excellence in expression. 
 
 In the expression of pathos, the force must be re- 
 duced to Subdued ; in the utterance of bold and lofty 
 thought, it rises to Impassioned; in the delivery of di- 
 dactic thought, it is pleasingly modulated to Moderate; 
 speaking in a small room, the degree of force should be 
 


## p. 137 (#141) ############################################

Subdued Force. 137 
 
 so modulated as not to be painful to the hearers; ad- 
 dressing a vast assembly in the open air, the voice 
 should be perfectly audible to the most distant hearer; 
 speaking under the influence of strong excitement, the 
 intensity of feeling should not hinder utterance, nor 
 degenerate into ranting and vociferation. 
 
 Such are some of the advantages of perfect command 
 of Force of Voice. 
 
 Exercises for cultivating Force of Voice will be pre- 
 sented with the lessons on the different divisions. 
 
 Subdued Force. 
 
 Subdued is that degree of Force which ranges from 
 the slightest sound which can be uttered in Pure Tone to 
 the milder tones of ordinary conversation. To cultivate 
 Subdued Force repeat each of the following elements, 
 words, and sentences three times, beginning with the 
 most subdued sound that can be uttered in Pure Tone, 
 Effusive Form, increasing the force with each repeti- 
 tion, but retaining as nearly as possible the same pitch. 
 After practicing for a few minutes on one pitch, change 
 to a key two or three notes lower or higher.

 EXERCISES 
 Combining Form, Quality, and Subdued Force. 
 Repeat each of the above sounds, words, and senten- 
 ces with 
 
 1. Effusive Form, Aspirate Quality, Subdued Force. 
 (First Degree.) 
 
 2. Effusive Form, Oral Quality, Subdued Force. 
 (Second Degree.) 
 
 3. Effusive Form, Pure Tone, Subdued Force. 
 (Third Degree.) 
 
 Subdued Foece When Used. 
 
 Subdued Force is appropriately employed chiefly in 
 the expression of pathetic, solemn, serious, and tranquil 
 thought. 
 
 It is generally used in connection with Pure Tone, 
 Effusive Form, but may be given with Oral, Aspirate, 
 and Falsetto Qualities. It is doubtful whether Orotund, 
 Pectoral, and Guttural can be given with Subdued 
 Force, as a greater degree of force than Subdued will 
 be required to produce those qualities.

 2. So silently we seemed to speak, 
 
 So slowly moved about, 
 As we had lent her half our powers 
 To eke her living out. 
 
 3. Our very hopes belied our fears, 
 
 Our fears our hopes belied ; 
 We thought her dying when she slept, 
 And sleeping when she died.

 And chill with early showers, 
 Her quiet eyelids closed she had 
 Another morn than ours.

 1. Ye've gathered to your place of prayer 
 
 With slow and measured tread : 
 Your ranks are full, your mates all there ! 
 
 But the soul of one has fled. 
 He was the proudest in his strength, 
 
 The manliest of ye all ; 
 Why lies he at that fearful length, 
 
 And ye around his pall ? 
 
 2. Ye reckon it in days since he 
 
 Strode up that foot-worn aisle, 
 With his dark eye flashing gloriously, 
 
 And his lip wreathed with a smile. 
 O had it been but told you then 
 
 To mark whose lamp was dim, 
 From out yon rank of fresh-lipped men, 
 
 Would ye have singled him ? 
 3. Whose was the sinewy arm which flung 
 
 Defiance to the ring ? 
 Whose laugh of victory loudest rung 
 
 Yet not for glorying ? 
 Whose heart, in generous deed and thought, 
 
 No rivalry might brook, 
 And yet distinction claiming not ? 
 
 There lies he go and look !

 4. On now, his requiem is done, 
 
 The last deep prayer is said ; 
 On to his burial, comrades, on, 
 
 With the noblest of the dead. 
 Slow, for it presses heavily ; 
 
 It is a man ye bear! 
 Slow, for our thoughts dwell wearily 
 
 On the noble sleeper there. 
 
 5. Tread lightly, comrades, ye have laid 
 
 His dark locks on his brow ; 
 Like life, save deeper light and shade, 
 
 We'll not disturb them now. 
 Tread lightly, for 'tis beautiful, 
 
 That blue-veined eyelid's sleep, 
 Hiding the eye death left so dull, 
 
 Its slumber we will keep. 
 
 6. Rest now, his journeying is done, 
 
 Your feet are on his sod ; 
 Death's chain is on your champion, 
 
 He waiteth here his God. 
 Ay, turn and weep, 'tis manliness 
 
 To be heart-broken here, 
 For the grave of earth's best nobleness 
 
 Is watered by the tear.

 moderate Force. 
 
 Moderate is the degree of Force ranging from the 
 mild to the more earnest conversational tones. To 
 cultivate the Moderate Force practice the following 
 sounds, words, and elements, repeating each six times, 
 beginning with the most Subdued Force and gradually 
 increasing, but retaining the pitch with which each is 
 begun. It is not necessary to begin each separate ex- 
 ercise with the same pitch, but simply to retain the 
 pitch throughout with which you begin. It would be 
 well to vary the key with each sound or word or sen- 
 tence, so as to widen the compass of voice as much 
 as possible. The primary object of the exercise is to 
 increase the force on any key without changing the 
 pitch. Every voice should have power to increase force 
 at pleasure on two octaves at least.

 Moderate is the appropriate degree of Force com- 
 bined with Pure Tone, Expulsive Form, for the expres 
 sion of narrative, descriptive, didactic, imimpassioned 
 thought; combined with the Orotund, Effusive Form, 
 for the expression of the milder forms of sublimity, 
 reverence, devotion, and adoration ; with the Orotund, 
 Expulsive Form, for introductory and unimpassioned 
 parts of speeches, sermons, and orations.

 Modulation. 
 
 LLOYD. 
 
 1. 'Tis not enough the voice be sound and clear, 
 'Tis modulation that must charm the ear. 
 That voice all modes of passion can express 
 Which marks the proper word with proper stress ; 
 But none emphatic can that speaker call 
 
 Who lays an equal emphasis on all. 
 Some o'er the tongue the labored measures roll, 
 Slow and deliberate as the parting toll; 
 Point every stop, mark every pause so strong, 
 Their words, like stage processions, stalk along. 
 
 2. All affectation but creates disgust, 
 
 And e'en in speaking we may seem too just. 
 In vain for them the pleasing measure flows 
 Whose recitation runs it all to prose; 
 Repeating what the poet sets not down, 
 The verb disjointing from its favorite noun, 
 While pause and break and repetition join 
 To make a discord in each tuneful line. 
 
 3. Some placid natures fill the allotted scene 
 With lifeless drawls, insipid and serene ; 
 While others thunder every couplet o'er, 
 And almost crack your ears with rant and roar 
 More nature oft, and finer strokes are shown 
 In the low whisper than tempestuous tone; 
 And Hamlet's hollow voice and fixed amaze 
 More powerful terror to the mind conveys 
 Than he who, swollen with impetuous rage, 
 Bullies the balky phantom of the stage. 
 
 4. He who in earnest studies o'er his part, 
 Will find true nature cling about his heart. 
 The modes of grief are not included all 
 
 In the white handkerchief and mournful drawl ;

 A single look more marks the internal woe 
 Than all the windings of the lengthened O ! 
 Up to the face the quick sensation flies, 
 And darts its meaning from the speaking eyes : 
 Love, transport, madness, anger, scorn, despair, 
 And all the passions of the soul are there.

 Appeal in Behalf of Ireland. 
 
 S. S. PRENTISS. 
 
 1. Fellow-citizens: It is no ordinary cause that has brought 
 together this vast assemblage on the present occasion. We 
 have met, not to prepare ourselves for political contests ; we 
 have met, not to celebrate the achievements of those gallant 
 men who have planted our victorious standards in the heart of 
 an enemy's country; we have assembled, not to respond to 
 shouts of triumph from the West ; but to answer the cry of 
 want and suffering which comes from the East. The Old 
 World stretches out her arms to the New. The starving par- 
 ent supplicates the young and vigorous child for bread. 
 
 2. There lies upon the other side of the wide Atlantic a 
 beautiful island, famous in story and in song. Its area is not 
 so great as that of the State of Louisiana, while its population 
 is almost half that of the Union. It has given to the world 
 more than its share of genius and of greatness. It has been 
 prolific in statesmen, warriors, and poets. Its brave and gen- 
 erous sons have fought successfully all battles but their own. 
 In wit and humor it has no equal ; while its harp, like its his- 
 tory, moves to tears by its sweet but melancholy pathos. 
 
 3. Into this fair region God. has seen fit to send the most 
 terrible of all those fearful ministers that fulfill his inscrutable 
 decrees. The earth has failed to give her increase. The com- 
 mon mother has forgotten her offspring, and she no longer 
 affords them their accustomed nourishment. Famine, gaunt 
 and ghastly famine, has seized a nation with its strangling 
 grasp. Unhappy Ireland, in the sad woes of the present, for- 
 gets, for a moment, the gloomy history of the past.

 4. O it is terrible, that in this beautiful world which the 
 good God has given us, and in which there is plenty for us all, 
 men should die of starvation ! When a man dies of disease he 
 alone endures the pain. Around his pillow are gathered sym- 
 pathizing friends, who, if they cannot keep back the deadly 
 messenger, cover his face and conceal the horrors of his visage 
 as he delivers his stern mandate. In battle, in the fullness of 
 his pride and strength, little recks the soldier whether the 
 hissing bullet sings his sudden requiem, or the cords of life 
 are severed by the sharp steel. 
 
 5. But he who dies of hunger wrestles alone, day by day, 
 with his grim and relentless enemy. He has no friends to 
 cheer him in the terrible conflict ; for if he had friends, how 
 could he die of hunger? He has not the hot blood of the sol- 
 dier to maintain him ; for his foe, vampire-like, has exhausted 
 his veins. Famine comes not up, like a brave enemy, storming, 
 by a sudden onset, the fortress that resists. Famine besieges. 
 He draws his lines round the doomed garrison. He cuts off all 
 supplies. He never summons to surrender, for he gives no 
 quarter. 
 
 6. Alas, for poor human nature! how can it sustain this 
 fearful warfare? Day by day the blood recedes, the flesh de- 
 serts, the muscles relax, and the sinews grow powerless. At 
 last the mind, which at first had bravely nerved itself against 
 the contest, gives way under the mysterious influences which 
 govern its union with the body. Then the victim begins to 
 doubt the existence of an overruling Providence. He hates 
 his fellow-men, and glares upon them with the longing of a 
 cannibal ; and, it may be, dies blaspheming. 
 
 7. This is one of those cases in which we may without im- 
 piety assume, as it were, the function of Providence. Who 
 knows but that one of the very objects of this calamity is to 
 test the benevolence and worthiness of us upon whom unlim- 
 ited abundance is showered? In the name, then, of common 
 humanity, I invoke your aid in behalf of starving Ireland. He 
 who is able, and will not aid such a cause, is not a man, and 
 has no right to wear the form. He should be sent back to 
 Nature's mint, and re-issued as a counterfeit on humanity of 
 Nature's baser metal.

 1. O Thou who driest the mourner's tear, 
 
 How dark this world would be, 
 If, when deceived and wounded here,

 2. The friends who in our sunshine live

 And he who has but tears to give 
 Must weep those tears alone.

 Which, like the plants that throw 
 Their fragrance from the wounded part, 
 Breathes sweetness out of woe.

 And e'en the hope that threw

 The Energetic is the appropriate degree of Force, 
 combined with Orotund, Effusive Form, for the expres- 
 sion of profound sublimity, grandeur, reverence, adora- 
 tion, and devotion; with Pure Tone, Expulsive and 
 Explosive Forms, for the expression of Joy, gladness, and 
 mirth ; with Orotund, Expulsive Form, for the delivery 
 of strong, forcible, argumentative, senatorial, political, 
 and judicial speeches, orations, and sermons. 
 
 In the following selection the passages expressing 
 sublimity, grandeur, and awe require a blending of the 
 Orotund and Aspirate.

 Of the departed year. No funeral train 
 Is sweeping past ; yet, on the stream and wood, 
 "With melancholy light, the moonbeams rest 
 Like a pale, spotless shroud ; the air is stirred 
 As by a mourner's sigh; and on yon cloud, 
 That floats so still and placidly through heaven, 
 The spirits of the seasons seem to stand,

 Young Spring, bright Summer, Autumn's solemn form, 
 
 And Winter, with his aged locks, and breathe, 
 
 In mournful cadences, that come abroad 
 
 Like the far wind-harp's wild and touching wail, 
 
 A melancholy dirge o'er the dead year, 
 
 Gone from the earth forever. 
 
 2. Tis a time 
 For memory and for tears. Within the deep, 
 Still chambers of the heart, a specter dim, 
 Whose tones are like the wizard voice of Time, 
 Heard from the tomb of ages, points its cold 
 And solemn finger to the beautiful 
 
 And holy visions that have passed away, 
 
 And left no shadow of their loveliness 
 
 On the dead waste of life. That specter lifts 
 
 The coffin-lid of Hope and Love 
 
 And, bending mournfully above the pale, 
 
 Sweet forms, that slumber there, scatters dead flowers 
 
 O'er what has passed to nothingness. 
 
 3. The year 
 
 Has gone, and with it many a glorious throng 
 Of happy dreams. Its mark is on each brow, 
 Its shadow in each heart. In its swift course 
 It waved its scepter o'er the beautiful 
 And they are not. It laid its pallid hand 
 Upon the strong man and the haughty form 
 Is fallen, and the flashing eye is dim. 
 It trod the hall of revelry, where thronged 
 The bright and joyous and the tearful wail 
 Of stricken ones is heard, where erst the song 
 And reckless shouts resounded. 
 
 4. It passed o'er 
 
 The battle-plain, where sword and spear and shield 
 Flashed in the light of midday and the strength 
 Of serried hosts is shivered, and the grass, 
 Green from the soil of carnage, waves above 
 The crushed and moldering skeleton. It came, 
 And faded like a wreath of mist at eve ; 
 


## p. 152 (#156) ############################################

 Yet, ere it melted in the viewless air, 
 It heralded its millions to their home 
 In the dim land of dreams. 
 
 5. Remorseless Time ! 
 Fierce spirit of the glass and scythe! what power 
 Can stay him in his silent course, or melt 
 
 His iron heart to pity? On, still on 
 
 He presses, and forever. The proud bird, 
 
 The condor of the Andes, that can soar 
 
 Through heaven's unfathomable depths, or brave 
 
 The fury of the northern hurricane, 
 
 And bathe his plumage in the thunder's home, 
 
 Furls his broad wings at night-fall, and sinks down 
 
 To rest upon his mountain crag; but Time 
 
 Knows not the weight of sleep or weariness, 
 
 And night's deep darkness has no chain to bind 
 
 His rushing pinions. 
 
 6. Revolutions sweep 
 O'er earth, like troubled visions o'er the breast 
 Of dreaming sorrow ; cities rise and sink, 
 
 Like bubbles on the water; fiery isles 
 Spring blazing from the ocean, and go back 
 To their mysterious caverns ; mountains rear 
 To heaven their bald and blackened cliffs, and bow 
 Their tall heads to the plain; new empires rise, 
 Gathering the strength of hoary centuries, 
 And rush down like the Alpine avalanche, 
 Startling the nations, and the very stars, 
 Yon bright and burning blazonry of God, 
 Glitter awhile in their eternal depths, 
 And like the Pleiad, loveliest of their train, 
 Shoot from the glorious spheres, and pass away, 
 To darkle in their glorious spheres, and pass away. 
 Time, the tomb-builder, holds his fierce career, 
 Dark, stern, all-pitless, and pauses not 
 Amid the mighty wrecks that strew his path, 
 To sit and muse, like other conquerors, 
 Upon the fearful ruin he has wrought.

 1. The old world has already revealed to us, in its unsealed 
 books, the beginning and end of all its own marvelous strug- 
 gles in the cause of liberty. Greece, lovely Greece, "the 
 land of scholars and the nurse of arms," where sister republics 
 in fair procession chanted the praises of liberty and the gods, 
 where and what is she ? For two thousand years the oppres- 
 sion has bound her to the earth. Her arts are no more. The 
 last sad relics of her temples are but the barracks of a ruthless 
 soldiery; the fragments of her columns and her palaces are in 
 the dust, yet beautiful in ruin. She fell not when the mighty 
 were upon her. Her sons were united at Thermopylae and 
 Marathon, and the tide of her triumph rolled back upon the 
 Hellespont. She was conquered by her own factions. She fell 
 by the hands of her own people. The man of Macedonia did 
 not the work of destruction. It was already done, by her own 
 corruptions, banishments, and dissensions.

 2. Rome, republican Rome, whose eagles glanced in the ris- 
 ing and setting sun, where and what is she ? The Eternal 
 City yet remains, proud even in her desolation, noble in her 
 decline, venerable in the majesty of religion, and calm as in 
 the composure of death. The malaria has but traveled in the 
 patlr worn by her destroyers. More than eighteen centuries 
 have mourned over the loss of her empire. A mortal disease 
 was upon her vitals before Csesar had crossed the Rubicon. 
 The Goths and Vandals and Huns, the swarms of the North, 
 completed only what was already begun at home. Romans 
 betrayed Rome. The legions were bought and sold, but the 
 people offered the tribute-money. When we reflect on what 
 has been and is, how is it possible not to feel a profound sense 
 of the responsibleness of this republic to all future ages! 
 What vast motives press upon us for lofty efforts! What 
 brilliant prospects invite our enthusiasm ! What solemn warn- 
 ings at once demand our vigilance and moderate our confidence !

 Impassioned Force. 
 
 Impassioned is the degree of Force heard in the ex- 
 pression of violent and impetuous emotion. 
 
 To cultivate Impassioned Force repeat each of the 
 elements, words, and sentences twelve times, beginning 
 with the mildest sound that can be given in Effusive 
 Form, Pure Tone, Subdued Force, and gradually in- 
 creasing with each repetition, retaining the same pitch 
 as nearly as possible.

 Impassioned, when combined with Pure Tone or Oro- 
 tund, Effusive or Expulsive Form, is the degree of 
 force appropriate for calling and commanding ; with 
 the Orotund, Expulsive and Explosive Forms, it is em- 
 ployed in the utterance of rousing and exciting appeals ; 
 with the Aspirate, Pectoral, and Guttural, Expulsive 
 and Explosive Forms, in the expression of fear, anger \ 
 threatening, scorn, defiance, revenge, etc.

 Again. O sacred forms, how proud you look ! 
 How high you lift your heads into the sky ! 
 How huge you are ! how mighty, and how free ! 
 Ye are things that tower, that shine, whose smile 
 Makes glad, whose frown is terrible, whose forms, 
 Robed or unrobed, do all the impress wear

 With all my voice ! I hold my hands to you, 
 To show they still are free. I rush to you 
 As though I could embrace you.

 The Polish Boy. 
 
 MRS. ANN S. STEPHENS. 
 
 1. Whence came those shrieks, so wild and shrill, 
 
 That like an arrow cleave the air, 
 Causing the blood to creep and thrill 
 
 With such sharp cadence of despair ? 
 Once more they come ! as if a heart 
 
 Were cleft in twain by one quick blow, 
 And every string had voice apart 
 
 To utter its peculiar woe ! 
 
 2. Whence came they ? From yon temple, where 
 An altar raised for private prayer, 
 
 Now forms the warrior's marble bed, 
 Who Warsaw's gallant armies led. 
 The dim funereal tapers threw 
 A holy luster o'er his brow, 
 And burnish with their rays of light 
 The mass of curls that gather bright 
 Above the haughty brow and eye 
 Of a young boy that's kneeling by.

 3. What hand is that whose icy press 
 
 Clings to the dead with death's own grasp, 
 But meets no answering caress 
 
 No thrilling fingers seek its clasp ? 
 It is the hand of her whose cry 
 
 Rang wildly late upon the air, 
 When the dead warrior met her eye, 
 
 Outstretched upon the altar there. 
 
 4. Now with white lips and broken moan 
 She sinks beside the altar stone ; 
 
 But hark ! the heavy tramp of feet 
 
 Is heard along the gloomy street. 
 
 Nearer and nearer yet they come, 
 
 With clanking arms and noiseless drum. 
 
 They leave the pavement. Flowers that spread 
 
 Their beauties by the path they tread, 
 
 Are crushed and broken. Crimson hands 
 
 Rend brutally their blooming bands. 
 
 Now whispered curses, low and deep, 
 
 Around the holy temple creep. 
 
 The gate is burst. A ruffian band 
 
 Rush in and savagely demand, 
 
 With brutal voice and oath profane, 
 
 The startled boy for exile's chain. 
 
 5. The mother sprang with gesture wild, 
 And to her bosom snatched the child ; 
 Then with pale cheek and flashing eye, 
 Shouted with fearful energy 
 
 "Back, ruffians, back! nor dare to tread 
 Too near the body of my dead ! 
 Nor touch the living boy I stand 
 Between him and your lawless band ! 
 No traitor he. But listen I I 
 Have cursed your master's tyranny. 
 I cheered my lord to join the band 
 Of those who swore to free our land, 
 Or fighting die ; and when he pressed 
 Me for the last time to his breast,

 I knew that soon his form would be 
 
 Low as it is, or Poland free. 
 
 He went and grappled with the foe, 
 
 Laid many a haughty Russian low ; 
 
 But he is dead the good the brave 
 
 And I, his wife, am worse a slave ! 
 
 Take me, and bind these arms, these hands, 
 
 With Russia's heaviest iron bands, 
 
 And drag me to Siberia's wild 
 
 To perish, if 'twill save my child ! " 
 
 6. "Peace, woman, peace!" the leader cried, 
 Tearing the pale boy from her side ; 
 
 And in his ruffian grasp he bore 
 His victim to the temple door. 
 
 7. "One moment!" shrieked the mother, "one. 
 Can land or gold redeem my son? 
 
 If so, I bend my Polish knee, 
 And, Russia, ask a boon of thee. 
 Take palaces, take lands, take all, 
 But leave him free from Russian thrall. 
 Take these," and her white arms and hands 
 She stripped of rings and diamond bands, 
 And tore from braids of long black hair 
 The gems that gleamed like star-light there; 
 Unclasped the brilliant coronal 
 And carcanet of Orient pearl ; 
 Her cross of blazing rubies last 
 Down to the Russian's feet she cast. 
 
 8. He stooped to seize the glittering store; 
 Upspringing from the marble floor, 
 The mother with a cry of joy 
 Snatched to her leaping heart the boy! 
 But no the Russian's iron grasp 
 Again undid the mother's clasp. 
 Forward she fell, with one long cry 
 
 Of more than mother's agony.

 9. But the brave child is roused at length, 
 And breaking from the Russian's hold, 
 He stands, a giant in the strength 
 Of his young spirit, fierce and bold. 
 
 10. Proudly he towers ; his flashing eye, 
 
 So blue and fiercely bright, 
 Seems lighted from the eternal sky, 
 
 So brilliant is its light. 
 His curling lips and crimson cheeks 
 Foretell the thought before he speaks. 
 With a full voice of proud command 
 He turns upon the wondering band. 
 
 11. " Ye hold me not! no, no, nor can; 
 This hour has made the boy a man. 
 The world shall witness that one soul 
 Fears not to prove itself a Pole. 
 
 12. "I knelt beside my slaughtered sire, 
 Nor felt one throb of vengeful ire ; 
 
 I wept upon his marble brow 
 
 Yes, wept I was a child ; but now 
 
 My noble mother on her knee, 
 
 Has done the work of years for me. 
 
 Although in this small tenement 
 
 My soul is cramped unbowed, unbent, 
 
 I've still within me ample power 
 
 To free myself this very hour. 
 
 This dagger in my heart ! and then, 
 
 Where is your boasted power, base men? " 
 
 He drew aside his broidered vest, 
 
 And there, like slumbering serpent's crest, 
 
 The jeweled haft of a poniard bright, 
 
 Glittered a moment on the sight. 
 
 "Ha! start ye back? Fool! coward! knave! 
 
 Think ye my noble father's glave 
 
 Could drink the life-blood of a slave? 
 
 The pearls that on the handle flame 
 
 Would blush to rubies in their shame ;

 The blade would quiver in thy breast, 
 Ashamed of such ignoble rest ! 
 No ; thus I rend thy tyrant's chain, 
 And fling him back a boy's disdain ! " 
 
 13. A moment, and the funeral light 
 
 Flashed on the jeweled weapon bright; 
 Another, and his young heart's blood 
 Leaped to the floor a crimson flood. 
 Quick to his mother's side he sprang, 
 And on the air his clear voice rang 
 * ' Up, mother, up ! I'm free ! I'm free ! 
 The choice was death or slavery ; 
 Up, mother, up ! look on my face, 
 I only wait for thy embrace. 
 One last, last word a blessing, one, 
 To prove thou knowest what I have done ; 
 No look ! no word ! Canst thou not feel 
 My warm blood o'er thy heart congeal ? 
 Speak, mother, speak lift up thy head. 
 What, silent still? Then thou art dead! 
 Great God, I thank thee ! Mother, I 
 Rejoice with thee, and thus to die." 
 Slowly he falls. The clustering hair 
 Rolls back and leaves that forehead bare. 
 One long, deep breath, and his pale head 
 Lay on his mother's bosom } dead.

 STRESS. 
 
 Stress is the application of the force of the voice to 
 the different parts of the word or sound. 
 
 The divisions of Stress are Median, Radical, Final, 
 Compound, Thorough, and Intermittent.

Median Stress. 163 
 
 median Stress. 
 
 Median Stress is the application of the force of the 
 voice to the ?niddle of the word or sound. 
 
 It is a gradual increase of force and elevation of 
 pitch through the concrete movement to the middle of 
 the word, and then as gradual a diminution and lower- 
 ing to the close. Median Stress can be given only in 
 connection with the Effusive Form. 
 
 DIAGRAM 
 
 OP 
 
 MEDIAN STRESS. 
 
 Advantages of Median Stress. 
 
 The Median Stress is one of the greatest beauties in 
 expression. It prevents the drawling and lifeless style 
 so prevalent in the reading of the Bible and the Church 
 service, and gives a most impressive beauty, power, 
 and grandeur to the utterance of pathos, sublimity, 
 reverence, devotion, and adoration. 
 
 Destitute of its ennobling effect, the reading of many 
 passages in prose and poetry sinks into a monotonous 
 and tedious utterance. 
 
 Like every element, it must be judiciously used. Car- 
 ried to excess it becomes a fault. The habit of mouth- 
 ing, so prevalent on the stage, has for one of its prin- 
 cipal elements an excessive Median Stress. 
 
 To cultivate this Stress practice the following ele- 
 ments, words, and sentences, beginning each with very 
 subdued force, which gradually increase in force and 
 raise in pitch to the middle, and then as gradually 
 diminish and lower.

 Combining Form, Quality, Force, and Median Stress. 
 
 Repeat each of the above sentences with

 2. Effusive Form, Aspirate, Moderate Force, Median 
 Stress. 
 
 3. Effusive Form, Orotund, Moderate Force, Median

 Median Stress When Used. 
 Median is the appropriate stress for the utterance of 
 pathos, solemnity, sublimity, reverence, grandeur, and 
 devotion. It is heard in different degrees, varying with 
 the depth and power of the emotion. Serious, solemn, 
 and tranquil thought require only the milder forms of 
 the Median; while reverence, grandeur, sublimity, and 
 devotion require the fullest form.

 Radical Stress. 
 
 Hadical Stress is the application of the force of the 
 voice to the first part of a vocal sound (vocal as dis- 
 tinguished from ubvocal or Aspirate), or the first vocal 
 


## p. 167 (#171) ############################################

Eadical Stress. 167 
 
 part of the accented syllable of a word. It is heard 
 only in connection with the Expulsive or Explosive 
 Form of voice. 
 
 The clear and forcible Radical Stress can take place 
 only after an interruption of the voice. It would seem 
 as if there is some momentary occlusion in the larynx, 
 by which the breath is barred and accumulated for the 
 purpose of a full and sudden discharge. This occlusion 
 is most under command, and the explosion is most 
 powerful, on syllables beginning with a tonic element, 
 or with an abrupt one preceding a tonic, for in this last 
 case an obstruction in the organs of articulation is com- 
 bined with the function of the larynx. 
 
 Advantages of Radical Stress. 
 
 Radical Stress is one of the most important proper- 
 ties of utterance. Without it reading and speaking of 
 a didatic, narrative, descriptive, argumentative, and 
 impassioned poetic style become dull and lifeless. 
 
 The argumentative speaker who has not this property 
 at command fails to produce conviction in the minds of 
 his hearers. 
 
 Dr. Rush says of the Radical Stress: "It is this 
 which draws the cutting edge of words across the ear, 
 and startles even stupor into attention; this which less- 
 ens the fatigue of listening, and outvoices the stir and 
 rustle of an assembly." 
 
 Murdoch and Russell say: "The utter absence of 
 Radical Stress bespeaks timidity and indecision, confu- 
 sion of thought, and feebleness of purpose. The speaker 
 who fails in regard to the effect of this property of 
 utterance solicits our pity rather than commands our 
 respect. The right degree of this function indicates 
 the manly, self-possessed speaker."

 Radical Stress When Used. 
 The Radical Stress is heard in various degrees. In 
 its milder form it is the Stress appropriate for the de- 
 livery of narrative, descriptive, and didatic thought in 
 the style of essays, lectures, and sermons; in a more en- 
 ergetic form it is appropriate for the utterance of argu- 
 mentative speeches and orations ; and in its most im- 
 passioned form for the expression of intense feeling and 
 emotion, as anger, scorn, defiance, etc.

 In a cottage cozy, and all their own, 
 She and her mother lived alone. 
 Safe were the two, with their frugal store, 
 From all the many who pass'd their door ; 
 For Jennie's mother was strange to fears, 
 And Jennie was large for fifteen years : 
 With vim her eyes were glistening, 
 Her hair was the hue of a blackbird's wing, 
 And, while her friends who knew her well 
 The sweetness of her heart could tell, 
 A gun that hung on the kitchen wall 
 Look'd solemnly quick to heed her call ; 
 And they who were evil-minded knew 
 Her nerve was strong and her aim was true. 
 So all kind words and acts did deal 
 To generous, black-eyed Jennie McNeal. 
 
 3. One night, when the sun had crept to bed, 
 And rain-clouds linger'd overhead, 
 
 And sent their surly drops for proof 
 To drum a tune on the cottage roof, 
 Close after a knock at the outer door 
 There enter'd a dozen dragoons or more. 
 Their red coats, stain'd by the muddy road, 
 That they were British soldiers show'd: 
 The captain his hostess bent to greet, 
 Saying, " Madam, please give us a bit to eat; 
 We will pay you well, and, it may be, 
 This bright-eyed girl for pouring our tea; 
 Then we must dash ten miles ahead, 
 To catch a rebel colonel a-bed. 
 He is visiting home, as doth appear ; 
 We will make his pleasure cost him dear." 
 And they fell on the hasty supper with zeal, 
 Close-watch'd the while by Jennie McNcal. 
 
 4. For the gray hair'd colonel they hover'd near 
 Had been her true friend, kind and dear; 
 And oft, in her younger days, had he 
 Right proudly perch'd her upon his knee,

 And told her stories many a one 
 Concerning the French war lately done. 
 And oft together the two friends were, 
 And many the arts he had taught to her ; 
 She had hunted by his fatherly side, 
 He had shown her how to fence and ride; 
 And once had said, " The time may be, 
 Your skill and courage may stand by me." 
 So sorrow for him she could but feel, 
 Brave, grateful-hearted Jennie MdSTeal. 
 
 With never a thought or a moment more, 
 Bare-headed she slipp'd from the cottage door, 
 Ran out where the horses were left to feed, 
 Unhitch'd and mounted the captain's steed, 
 And down the hilly and rock-strewn way 
 She urged the fiery horse of gray. 
 Around her slender and cloakless form 
 Patter'd and moan'd the ceaseless storm : 
 Secure and tight a gloveless hand 
 Grasp'd the reins with stern command; 
 And full and black her long hair stream'd, 
 Whenever the ragged lightning gleam'd. 
 And on she rush'd for the colonel's weal, 
 Brave, lioness-hearted Jennie McNeal. 
 
 Hark ! from the hills, a moment mute, 
 Came a clatter of hoofs in hot pursuit ; 
 And a cry from the foremost trooper said, 
 "Halt ! or your blood be on your head ! " 
 She heeded it not, and not in vain 
 She lash'd the horse with the bridle rein ; 
 So into the night the gray horse strode ; 
 His shoes hew'd fire from the rocky road ; 
 And the high-born courage that never dies 
 Flash'd from his rider's coal-black eyes ; 
 The pebbles flew from the fearful race ; 
 The rain-drops grasp'd at her glowing face. 
 " On, on, brave beast! " with loud appeal, 
 Cried eager, resolute Jennie MoNeal.

 " Halt! " once more came the voice of dread; 
 
 " Halt! or your blood be on your head ! " 
 
 Then, no one answering to the calls, 
 
 Sped after her a volley of balls. 
 
 They pass'd her in her rapid flight, 
 
 They scream'd to her left, they scream'd to her right; 
 
 But, rushing still o'er the slippery track, 
 
 She sent no token of answer back, 
 
 Except a silvery laughter peal, 
 
 Brave, merry-hearted Jennie McNeal. 
 
 7. So on she rush'd at her own good will, 
 Through wood and valley, o'er plain and hill : 
 The gray horse did his duty well, 
 
 Till all at once he stumbled and fell, 
 Himself escaping the nets of harm, 
 But flinging the girl with a broken arm. 
 Still undismay'd by the numbing pain, 
 She clung to the horse's bridle rein, 
 And gently bidding him to stand, 
 Petted him with her able hand ; 
 Then sprung again to the saddle bow, 
 And shouted, u One more trial now ! " 
 As if ashamed of the heedless fall, 
 He gather'd his strength once more for all, 
 And, galloping down a hill-side steep, 
 Gain'd on the troopers at every leap ; 
 No more the high-bred steed did reel, 
 But ran his best for Jennie McNeal. 
 
 8. They were a furlong behind or more, 
 
 When the girl burst through the colonel's door, 
 Her poor arm helpless hanging with pain, 
 And she all drabbled and drench'd with rain, 
 But her cheeks as red as fire-brands are, 
 And her eyes as bright as a blazing star, 
 And shouted, " Quick! be quick, I say! 
 They come ! they come ! away ! away ! " 
 Then sunk on the rude white floor of deal 
 Poor, brave, exhausted Jennie McNeal.

 The startled colonel sprung, and press'd 
 
 The wife and children to his breast, 
 
 And turn'd away from his fireside bright, 
 
 And glided into the stormy night ; 
 
 Then soon and safely made his way 
 
 To where the patriot army lay. 
 
 But first he bent in the dim fire-light, 
 
 And kiss'd the forehead broad and white, 
 
 And blessed the girl who had ridden so well 
 
 To keep him out of a prison cell. 
 
 The girl roused up at the martial din, 
 
 Just as the troopers came rushing in, 
 
 And laugh'd e'en in the midst of a moan, 
 
 Saying, "Good sirs, your bird has flown: 
 
 'Tis I who have scared him from his nest ; 
 
 So deal with me now as you think best. " 
 
 But the grand young captain bow'd, and said, 
 
 " Never you hold a moment's dread: 
 
 Of womankind I must crown you queen ; 
 
 So brave a girl I have never seen : 
 
 Wear this gold ring as your valor's due; 
 
 And when peace comes I will come for you." 
 
 But Jennie's face an arch smile wore, 
 
 As she said, ' ' There's a lad in Putnam's corps, 
 
 Who told me the same, long time ago; 
 
 You two would never agree, I know : 
 
 I promised my love to be true as steel," 
 
 Said good, sure-hearted Jennie McNeal.

Final Stbess. 175 
 
 Final Stress. 
 
 The Final Stress is the application of the force of the 
 voice to the last part of the word or sound. 
 
 The force, at first but slight, is gradually increased, 
 until it closes in an abrupt and violent sound. In its 
 effect on the ear it is not unlike the report of a pistol 
 when it hangs fire. 
 
 DIAGRAM 
 
 OF 
 
 FINAL STRESS. 
 
 Advantages op Final Stress. 
 
 It is the Final Stress that gives intensity to deter- 
 mined purpose, earnest resolve, stern rebuke, and manly 
 protest. Without this element they become feeble 
 and contemptible. 
 
 To acquire control of this style of Stress practice the 
 elements and words as directed. Repeat each of the ele- 
 ments, beginning with a slight sound, which gradually 
 increase, and close with an abrupt and forcible utterance.

 termined purpose, earnest resolve, stern rebuke, contempt, 
 astonishment, horror, revenge, hate and similar passions. 
 It is always combined with the Expulsive or Explosive 
 Form of Voice, and, in the expression of violent passion, 
 with the Aspirate, Pectoral, or Guttural Quality.

 Hate of the Bowl. 
 
 1. Go, feel what I have felt ; 
 
 Go, bear what I have borne ; 
 Sink 'neath the blow a father dealt, 
 
 And the cold world's proud scorn: 
 Then suffer on from year to year, 
 Thy sole relief the scalding tear. 
 
 2. Go, kneel as I have knelt ; 
 
 Implore, beseech, and pray; 
 Strive the besotted heart to melt, 
 
 The downward course to stay; 
 Be dashed with bitter curse aside, 
 Your prayers burlesqued, your tears defied. 
 
 3. Go, weep as I have wept 
 
 O'er a loved father's fall, 
 See every promised blessing swept, 
 
 Youth's sweetness turned to gall ; 
 Life's fading flowers strewed all the way 
 That brought me up to woman's day. 
 
 4. Go, see what I have seen ; 
 
 Behold the strong man bow, 
 "With gnashing teeth, lips bathed in blood, 
 
 And cold and livid brow. 
 Go catch his withering glance, and see 
 There mirrored, his soul's misery. 
 
 5. Go to thy mother's side, 
 
 And her crushed bosom cheer; 
 Thine own deep anguish hide ; 
 
 Wipe from her cheek the bitter tear; 
 Mark her wan cheek and pallid brow, 
 The gray that streaks her dark hair now,

 Her failing frame and trembling limb ; 
 And trace the ruin back to him 
 Whose plighted faith, in early youth, 
 Promised eternal love and truth ; 
 But who, forsworn, hath yielded up 
 That promise to the cursed cup; 
 And led her down, through love and light, 
 And all that made her prospects bright; 
 And chained her there, 'mid want and strife, 
 That lowly thing, a drunkard's wife ; 
 And stamped on childhood's brow so mild, 
 That withering blight, a drunkard's child ! 
 
 6. Go, hear and feel and see and know 
 
 All that my soul hath felt and known; 
 Then look upon the wine-cup's glow,

 When all proclaim, 'Tis drink and die ! 
 
 7. Tell me I hate the bowl 
 
 Hate is a feeble word ; 
 I loathe, abhor ; my very soul 
 
 With strong disgust is stirred 
 Whene'er I see, or hear, or tell 
 Of the dark beverage of hell.

 Compound Stress. 
 
 Compound Stress is the application of the force to the 
 first and last parts of the word, passing over the inter- 
 mediate parts lightly. 
 
 Advantages of Compound Stress. 
 The Compound Stress gives intensity to the utterance 
 of surprise, contempt, mockery, railery, and sarcasm. 
 "The use of this style of Stress belongs appropriately

 to feelings of peculiar force or acuteness; but on this 
 very account it becomes an indispensable means of nat- 
 ural expression and true effect in many passages of 
 reading and speaking. The difference between vivid 
 and dull or flat utterance will often turn on the exact- 
 ness with which this expressive function of voice is 
 exerted." 
 
 To cultivate this form of Stress practice the following 
 words and sentences, giving the force of the voice to 
 the first and last parts of each word.

 The Compound is appropriately employed in the ex- 
 pression of surprise, contempt, and mockery, and some- 
 times of sarcasm and railery. 
 
 There are few if any selections that will require Com- 
 pound Stress throughout. The following scene from 
 Hamlet is presented as containing several fine examples.

 Scene from Hamlet. Act iii. Scene iv. 
 
 SHAKESPEARE. 
 
 Pol. He will come straight. Look, you lay home to him : 
 Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with ; 
 And that your grace hath screened and stood between 
 Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here. 
 Pray you, be round with him. 
 
 Queen. I'll warrant you 
 Fear me not. Withdraw, I hear him coming. 
 
 Enter Hamlet. 
 
 17am. Now, mother, what's the matter ? 
 
 Queen. Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended. 
 
 Earn. Mother, you have my father much offended. 
 
 Queen. Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue. 
 
 Ham. Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue. 
 
 Queen. Why, how now, Hamlet ? 
 
 Ham. What's the matter now ? 
 
 Queen. Have you forgot me ? 
 
 Ham. No, by the rood, not so ; 
 You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife ; 
 And would it were not so ! you are my mother. 
 
 Queen. Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak. 
 
 Ham. Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge; 
 You go not, till I set you up a glass 
 Where you may see the inmost part of you. 
 
 Queen. What wilt thou do ? Thou wilt not murder me ! 
 Help, help, ho! 
 
 Pol. What, ho! help! 
 
 Ham. How now ! a rat ? 
 Dead, for a ducat, dead 
 
 Pol. O ! O ! O ! I am slain. 
 
 Queen. O, me ! what hast thou done ? 
 
 Ham. Nay, I know not : 
 Is it the king ?

 Queen. O, what a rash and bloody deed is this ! 
 
 Ham. A bloody deed; almost as bad, good mother, 
 As kill a king, and marry with his brother. 
 
 Queen. As kill a king t 
 
 Ham. Ay, lady, 'twas my word. 
 Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell ! 
 I took thee for thy better. 
 
 Leave wringing of your hands : Peace sit you down, 
 And let me wring your heart : for so I shall, 
 If it be made of penetrable stuff; 
 If damned custom have not brazed it so, 
 That it be proof and bulwark against sense. 
 
 Queen. What have I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tongue 
 In noise so rude against me ? 
 
 Ham. Such an act, 
 That blurs the blush and grace of modesty ; 
 Calls virtue, hypocrite ; takes off the rose 
 From the fair forehead of an innocent love, 
 And sets a blister there ; makes marriage vows 
 As false as dicers' oaths. O ! such a deed, 
 As from the body of contraction plucks 
 The very soul ; and sweet religion makes 
 A rhapsody of words 
 Ah, me ! that act ! 
 
 Queen. Ah, me ! what act ? 
 
 Ham. Look here, upon this picture, and on this ; 
 The counterfeit presentment of two brothers. 
 See, what a grace was seated on this brow 
 Hyperion's curls ; the front of Jove himself ; 
 An eye like Mars, to threaten and command ; 
 A station like the herald Mercury, 
 New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill; 
 A combination, and a form, indeed, 
 Where every god did seem to set his seal, 
 To give the world assurance of a man : 
 This was your husband. Look you now, what follows : 
 Here is your husband ; like a mildewed ear, 
 Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes ? 
 Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed, 
 And batten on this moor ? Ha ! have you eyes ?

 You cannot call it love : for, at your age, 
 The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble, 
 And waits upon the judgment and what judgment, 
 Would step from this to this ? 
 O, shame ! where is thy blush ? 
 
 Queen. O, Hamlet, speak no more ; 
 Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul ; 
 And there I see such black and grained spots, 
 As will not leave their tinct. 
 No more, sweet Hamlet. 
 
 Ham. A murderer, and a villain : 
 A slave, that is not twentieth part the tythe 
 Of your precedent lord : a vice of kings ; 
 A cutpurse of the empire and the rule ; 
 That from a shelf the precious diadem stole, 
 And put it in his pocket ! 
 
 Enter Ghost. 
 
 A king of shreds and patches : 
 
 Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings, 
 
 You heavenly guards! what would your gracious figure? 
 
 Queen. Alas ! he's mad. 
 
 Ham. Do you not come your tardy son to chide, 
 That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by 
 The important acting of your dread command ? 
 O, say ! 
 
 Ghost. Do not forget : this visitation 
 Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose. 
 But, look ! amazement on thy mother sits : 
 O, step between her and her fighting soul. 
 Speak to her, Hamlet. 
 
 Ham. How is it with you, lady ? 
 
 Queen. Alas ! how is't with you ? 
 That you do bend your eye on vacancy, 
 And with the incorporal air do hold discourse ! 
 O, gentle son, 
 
 Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper 
 Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look ? 
 
 Ham. On him ! on him ! Look you, how pale he glares ! 
 His form and cause conjoined, preaching to stones,

 Would make them capable. Do not look upon me ; 
 
 Lest, with this piteous action, you convert 
 
 My stern effects : then what I have to do 
 
 Will want true color ; tears, perchance, for blood. 
 
 Queen. To whom do you speak this ? 
 
 Ham, Do you see nothing there ? 
 
 Queen. Nothing at all ; yet all that is I see. 
 
 Ham. Nor did you nothing hear ? 
 
 Queen. No, nothing, but ourselves. 
 
 Ham. Why, look you there ! look how it steals away ! 
 My father, in his habit as he lived ! 
 Look where he goes, even now, out at the portal ! 
 
 Queen. This is the very coinage of your brain ; 
 This bodiless creation ecstasy 
 Is very cunning in. 
 
 Ham. Ecstasy ! 
 My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time, 
 And makes as healthful music : it is not madness 
 That I have uttered : bring me to the test, 
 And I the matter will re-word ; which madness 
 Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace, 
 Lay not that flattering unction to your soul, 
 That not your trespass, but my madness, speaks: 
 It will but skin and film the ulcerous place ; 
 Whiles rank corruption, mining all within, 
 Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven ; 
 Repent what's past ; avoid what is to come. 
 
 Queen. O, Hamlet! thou hast cleft my heart in twain. 
 
 Ham. O ! throw away the worser part of it, 
 And live the purer with the other half. 
 Good night! 
 
 And when you are desirous to be blessed, 
 I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord, 
 I do repent. 
 
 I will bestow him, and will answer well 
 The death I gave him. So, again, good-night ! 
 I must be cruel, only to be kind: 
 Thus bad begins, and worse remains behind.

 Thorough Stress. 
 
 Tliorough Stress is the application of the force of the 
 voice equally to all parts of the word or sound. It can 
 be given with both Effusive and Expulsive Forms. 
 
 Advantages of Thorough Stress. 
 Thorough Stress is one of the most powerful weapons 
 of oratory. Its effect, when judiciously used with Ex- 
 pulsive Form, Orotund Quality, Impassioned Force, is 
 magical. It rouses the feelings, kindles the emotions,

186 Science of Elocution. 
 
 and stirs the very soul of an audience. With Effusive 
 Form, Pectoral Quality, it intensifies the expression of 
 awe and dread. 
 
 To cultivate this element of expression practice the 
 elements, words, and sentences with all the force you 
 can command in the Orotund Expulsive.

 Repeat the above sentences with 
 
 1. Expulsive Form, Pure Tone, Energetic Force, 
 Thorough Stress. 
 
 2. Expulsive Form, Orotund, Impassioned Force, 
 Thorough Stress. 
 
 Thorough Stress When Used. 
 
 Thorough Stress is appropriately employed in the ex- 
 pression of rapture, joy \ exultation, lofty command, in- 
 dignant emotion, oratorical apostrophe, and virtuous 
 indignation ; and sublimity and grandeur when mingled 
 with awe and dread.

 utterance would be monotonous ; but as the sentiment 
 changes so the combination must be varied. It is this 
 constant change of combinations that requires the exer- 
 cise of taste and judgment. Much of this selection 
 will require Expulsive Form, Pure Tone, Moderate or 
 Energetic Force, and Radical Stress. Only the last two 
 stanzas require the combination given below.

 2. The merchant's word, 
 Delighted, the master heard ; 
 
 For his heart was in his work, and the heart 
 Giveth grace unto every art : 
 And, with a voice that was full of glee, 
 He answered, " Ere long we will launch 
 A vessel as goodly and strong and stanch 
 As ever weathered a wintry sea ! " 
 
 3. All is finished ! and at length 
 Has come the bridal day 
 
 Of beauty and of strength : 
 
 To-day the vessel shall be launched ! 
 
 With fleecy clouds the sky is blanched; 
 
 And o'er the bay, 
 
 Slowly, in all his splendors dight, 
 
 The great Sun rises to behold the sight. 
 
 4. The ocean old, 
 Centuries old, 
 
 Strong as youth, as uncontrolled, 
 
 Paces restless to and fro,

 His beating heart is not at rest ; 
 
 And far and wide, 
 
 With ceaseless flow, 
 
 His beard of snow 
 
 Heaves with the heaving of his breast : 
 
 He waits impatient for his bride. 
 
 5. There she stands, 
 
 With her foot upon the sands, 
 
 Decked with flags and streamers gay, 
 
 In honor of her marriage-day, 
 
 Her snow-white signals fluttering, blending, 
 
 Round her like a veil descending, 
 
 Ready to be 
 
 The bride of the gray old sea. 
 
 6. Then the master, 
 
 With a gesture of command, 
 
 Waved his hand ; 
 
 And at the word 
 
 Loud and sudden there was heard, 
 
 All around them and below, 
 
 The sound of hammers, blow on blow, 
 
 Knocking away the shores and spurs : 
 
 And see ! she stirs ! 
 
 She starts she moves she seems to feel 
 
 The thrill of life along her keel, 
 
 And, spurning with her feet the ground, 
 
 With one exulting, joyous bound, 
 
 She leaps into the ocean's arms ! 
 
 7. And, lo ! from the assembled crowd 
 There rose a shout, prolonged and loud, 
 That to the ocean seemed to say, 
 
 " Take her, O bridegroom, old and gray ; 
 
 Take her to thy protecting arms, 
 
 With all her youth and all her charms! " 
 
 8. How beautiful she is! how fair 
 
 She lies within those arms that press 
 Her form with many a soft caress 
 Of tenderness and watchful care!

 The Intermittent Stress gives a vivid and touching 
 expression to utterance, for the absence of which nothing 
 can atone. " Without its appeal to sympathy, and its 
 peculiar power over the heart, many of the most beau- 
 tiful and touching passages of Shakespeare and Milton 
 become dry and cold."

 PITCH. 
 
 Pitch is the place on the musical scale on which sound 
 is uttered. Every sound, whether produced by the vocal 
 organs of man, bird, or beast, or by natural or mechan- 
 ical means, has some Pitch. We speak of the low tones 
 of the organ, the high notes of the fife, the low growl 
 of the wild animal, the high notes of the birds, as famil- 
 iarly as of the deep base or the high tenor tones. 
 
 Pitch in elocution differs materially from Pitch in 
 music. In the former it is relative, in the latter abso- 
 lute; that is, if two persons read the same selection, they 
 need not have the same Pitch upon the musical scale, 
 and yet both be correct ; but if they sing the same tune, 
 they must illustrate the same notes. In music the Pitch 
 is fixed by the scale, and the notes must be given with 
 the utmost accuracy; in elocution each individual's voice 
 is his own guide. To require pupils in elocution to read 
 on the same Pitch would be as incorrect as to require 
 the pupils of a music class to sing in different keys. 
 


## p. 196 (#200) ############################################

196 Science of Elocution. 
 
 Teachers of elocution make no greater mistake than 
 that of requiring all pupils to take the same key. Voices 
 differ so much that what is Low Pitch for one may be 
 simply middle for another. Nothing in the practice of 
 elocution is more offensive to a cultivated taste than the 
 ridiculous efforts of pupils to imitate some favorite 
 ieacher's tones. It cannot be too firmly impressed upon 
 the minds of pupils that in Pitch each voice is its own 
 guide. If, however, the voice, from some external cause, 
 has been changed from its natural key, it should as soon 
 as possible be restored. 
 
 Again, Pitch in elocution differs from Pitch in music 
 in the manner of passing from one division or note to 
 another. In elocution the changes are generally by the 
 concrete movement or glides, in music by the discrete 
 or steps. That which is an excellence in elocution is 
 an error in music; that which is an accomplishment in 
 singing is a fault in reading or recitation. To pass with 
 measured accuracy from one word to another in elocu- 
 tionary efforts is drawling and intolerable ; to glide into 
 the notes in singing is dragging and disagreeable. 
 Hence persons who sing a great deal are not likely to 
 read or speak well, because they have become accus- 
 tomed to the discrete movement; and those who prac- 
 tice elocution are rarely successful singers. Music and 
 elocution, though not incompatible, are rarely combined 
 in a high degree of excellence in the same person. 
 Indeed, it is a significant fact that in all ages of the 
 world those who have excelled as readers, actors, or 
 orators have been singularly deficient in musical tal- 
 ents and attainments, and those who have been dis- 
 tinguished singers have not been applauded for 
 their oratorical efforts. Exercises in elocution may 
 strengthen the singing voice, and practice in vocal 
 


## p. 197 (#201) ############################################

Pitch. 197 
 
 music may give sweetness and purity to the speaking 
 tones, but further than this they are not mutual helpers. 
 No one should be deterred from the study of elocution 
 because he cannot illustrate the notes of the scale or 
 distinguish Yankee Doodle from Old Hundred. To read 
 well it is not necessary that you should sing even the 
 simplest tune. 
 
 Advantages op Pitch. 
 
 Both in music and elocution perfect control of Pitch 
 is essential. Without it there can be no natural, pleas- 
 ing, or impressive utterance. More public speakers fail 
 from an incorrect use of Pitch than from any other 
 cause. Often the voice rises to a high, unnatural tone, 
 nearly an octave above the natural key or that which 
 the sentiment demands, and upon this unpleasant tone 
 the utterance is continued until the voice is injured and 
 the hearers wearied. But again, control of Pitch is 
 important because different tones express and awaken 
 different thoughts and emotions. The Author of our 
 being has so attuned our natures that a low, deep tone 
 suggests reverence or devotion, High Pitch joyous 
 feelings, the middle key unimpassioned thought, and 
 the lowest tones awe and dread. To properly express 
 these emotions the Pitch must be varied at pleasure. 
 
 Divisions of Pitch. 
 
 Instead of the eight exact notes in music, elocution 
 presents five general divisions of Pitch: Very High, 
 High, Middle, Low, and Very Low. These divisions 
 are not limited to any particular notes of the scale, but 
 vary in compass with different voices, some being lim- 
 ited to a single octave, while others range over three or 
 four. Each voice is its own guide, and from the Middle 
 Pitch all the other divisions are determined.

 Middle Pitch. 
 
 Middle Pitch may be defined as the three, four, or five 
 notes over which the voice naturally and easily ranges 
 in ordinary conversation. To cultivate Middle Pitch 
 practice the following sounds, words, and sentences 
 upon the conversation or natural key.

 the form of scientific and literary lectures, introductions 
 to speeches, orations, and sermons.

 Cheerfulness. 
 1. There is no one quality that so much attaches man to his 
 fellow-man as cheerfulness. Talents may excite more respect, 
 and virtue more esteem, but the respect is apt to be distant 
 


## p. 199 (#203) ############################################

Middle Pitch. 199 
 
 and the esteem cold. It is far otherwise with cheerfulnesss. 
 It endears a man to the heart, not the intellect or the imagina- 
 tion. There is a kind of reciprocal diffusiveness about this 
 quality that recommends its possessor by the very effect it 
 produces. There is a mellow radiance in the light it sheds 
 on all social intercourse which pervades the soul to a depth 
 that the blaze of intellect can never reach. 
 
 2. The cheerful man is a double blessing a blessing to 
 himself and to the world around him. In his own character 
 his good nature is the clear blue sky of his own heart, on 
 which every star of talent shines out more clearly. To others 
 he carries an atmosphere of joy and hope and encouragement 
 wherever he moves. His own cheerfulness becomes infectious, 
 and his associates lose their moroseness and their gloom in 
 the amber-colored light of the benevolence he casts around 
 him. 
 
 3. It is true that cheerfulness is not always happiness. The 
 face may glow in smiles while the heart "runs in coldness and 
 darkness below," but cheerfulness is the best external indica- 
 tion of happiness that we have, and it enjoys this advantage 
 over almost every other good quality, that the counterfeit is 
 as valuable to society as the reality. It answers as a medium 
 of public circulation fully as well as the true coin. 
 
 4. A man is worthy of all praise, whatever may be his pri- 
 vate griefs, who does not intrude them on the happiness of his 
 friends, but constantly contributes his quota of cheerfulness 
 to the general public enjoyment. " Every heart knows its 
 own bitterness," but let the possessor of that heart take heed 
 that he does not distill it into his neighbor's cup, and thus 
 poison his felicity. 
 
 5. There is no sight more commendable and more agreeable 
 than a man whom we know fortune has dealt with badly 
 smothering his own peculiar griefs in his own bosom, and 
 doing his duty in society with an unruffled brow and a cheer- 
 ful mien. It is duty which society has a right to demand a 
 portion of that great chain which binds humanity together, 
 the links of which every one should preserve bright and 
 unsullied. 
 
 6. It may be asked, what shall that man do whose burdens 
 of grief are heavy, and made still heavier by the tears he has

 shed over them in private ; shall he leave society ? Certainly, 
 until he has learned to bear his own burden. Shall he not 
 seek the sympathy of his friends ? He had better not. Sym- 
 pathy would only weaken the masculine strength of mind 
 which enables us to endure. Besides, sympathy unsought for 
 is much more readily given, and sinks deeper in its healing 
 effects into the heart. No, no, cheerfulness is a duty which 
 every man owes. Let him faithfully discharge the debt.

 For a star hath gone out from the night of our sky, 
 On whose brightness we gazed as the war-cloud rolled by ; 
 So tranquil and steady and clear were its beams, 
 That they fell like a vision of peace on our dreams. 
 
 2. A heart that we knew had been true to our weal, 
 And a hand that was steadily guiding the wheel ; 
 A name never tarnished by falsehood or wrong, 
 
 That had dwelt in our hearts like a soul-stirring song ; 
 Ah, that pure, noble spirit has gone to its rest, 
 And the true hand lies nerveless and cold on his breast: 
 But the name and the memory, these never will die, 
 But grow brighter and dearer as the ages go by. 
 
 3. Yet the tears of a nation fall over the dead. 
 Such tears as a nation before never shed ; 
 
 For our cherished one fell by a dastardly hand, 
 
 A martyr to truth and the cause of the land ; 
 
 And a sorrow has surged, like the waves to the shore, 
 
 When the breath of the tempest is sweeping them o'er; 
 
 And the heads of the lofty and lowly have bowed 
 
 As the shaft of the lightning sped out from the cloud.

 With the fair land of promise spread out to his eye ; 
 His work is accomplished, and what he has done 
 Will stand as a monument under the sun ; 
 And his name, reaching down through the ages of time, 
 Will still through the years of eternity shine, 
 Like a star sailing on through the depths of the blue, 
 On whose brightness we gaze every evening anew. 
 
 8. His white tent is pitched on the beautiful plain, 
 Where the tumult of battle comes never again,

 Where the smoke of the war-cloud ne'er darkens the air, 
 Nor falls on the spirit a shadow of care. 
 The songs of the ransomed enrapture his ear, 
 And he heeds not the dirges that roll for him here ; 
 In the calm of his spirit, so strange and sublime, 
 He is lifted far over the discords of time. 
 
 7. Then bear him home gently, great son of the West ! 
 'Mid her fair blooming prairies lay Lincoln to rest, 
 From the nation who loved him she takes to her trust, 
 And will tenderly garner the consecrate dust. 
 A Mecca his grave to the people shall be, 
 And a shrine evermore for the hearts of the free.

 Marco Bozzaris. 
 
 FITZ GREENE HALLECK. 
 
 1. At midnight, in his guarded tent, 
 
 The Turk lay dreaming of the hour 
 When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent, 
 
 Should tremble at his power ; 
 In dreams, through camp and court he bore 
 The trophies of a conqueror ; 
 
 In dreams, his song of triumph heard ; 
 Then wore his monarch's signet ring ; 
 Then pressed that monarch's throne a king : 
 As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing, 
 
 As Eden's garden bird.

 2. At midnight, in the forest shades, 
 
 Bozzaris ranged his Suliote band, 
 True as the steel of their tried blades, 
 
 Heroes in heart and hand. 
 There had the Persian's thousands stood ; 
 There had the glad earth drunk their blood, 
 
 On old Plataea's day; 
 And now there breathed that haunted air 
 The sons of sires who conquered there, 
 With arm to strike, and soul to dare, 
 
 As quick, as far, as they. 
 
 3. An hour passed on : the Turk awoke : 
 
 That bright dream was his last. 
 He woke to hear his sentries shriek, 
 " To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek! " 
 He woke, to die 'midst flame and smoke, 
 And shout, and groan, and saber stroke, 
 
 And death-shots falling thick and fast 
 As lightnings from the mountain cloud, 
 And heard, with voice as trumpet loud, 
 
 Bozzaris cheer his band : 
 "Strike! till the last armed foe expires; 
 Strike ! for your altars and your fires ; 
 Strike ! for the green graves of your sires ; 
 
 God, and your native land ! " 
 
 4. They fought like brave men, long and well ; 
 
 They piled that ground with Moslem slain; 
 They conquered but Bozzaris fell, 
 
 Bleeding at every vein. 
 His few surviving comrades saw 
 His smile when rang their loud hurrah, 
 
 And the red field was won; 
 Then saw in death his eyelids close, 
 Calmly as to a night's repose, 
 
 Like flowers at set of sun. 
 
 5. Com to the bridal chamber, Death ! 
 
 Come to the mother, when she feels, 
 For the first time, her first-born's breath; 
 Come when the blessed seals

 That close the pestilence are broke, 
 And crowded cities wail its stroke ; 
 Come in consumption's ghastly form, 
 The earthquake shock, the ocean storm ; 
 Come when the heart beats high and warm 
 
 With banquet song and dance and wine ; 
 And thou art terrible : the tear, 
 The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier, 
 And all we know, or dream, or fear, 
 
 Of agony, are thine. 
 But to the hero when his sword 
 
 Hath won the battle for the free, 
 Thy voice sounds like a prophet's word. 
 And in its hollow tones are heard 
 
 The thanks of millions yet to be.

 "The Life-Boat." 
 
 Quick ! man the life-boat ! See yon bark, 
 
 That drives before the blast ! 
 There's a rock ahead, the night is dark, 
 
 And the storm comes thick and fast. 
 Can human power, in such an hour, 
 
 Avert the doom that's o'er her ? 
 Her mainmast's gone, but she still drives on 
 
 To the fatal reef before her.

 Quick ! man the life-boat ! hark ! the gun

 That forked flash, that pealing crash, 
 
 Seemed from the wave to sweep her ; 
 She's on the rock, with a terrible shock 
 
 And the wail comes louder and deeper. 
 
 The life-boat ! Man the life-boat ! 
 
 Quick ! man the life-boat ! See the crew 
 
 Gaze on their watery grave : 
 Already some, a gallant few, 
 
 Are battling with the wave ; 
 And one there stands, and wrings his hands, 
 
 As thoughts of home come o'er him ; 
 For his wife and child, through the tempest wild, 
 
 He sees on the heights before him. 
 The life-boat ! Man the life-boat ! 
 Speed, speed the life-boat ! Off she goes ! 
 
 And, as they pulled the oar, 
 From shore and ship a cheer arose 
 
 That startled ship and shore. 
 Life-saving ark! yon fated bark 
 
 Has human lives within her ; 
 And dearer than gold is the wealth untold 
 
 Thou'lt save if thou canst win her. 
 On life-boat! Speed the life-boat! 
 Hurrah! The life-boat dashes on, 
 
 Though darkly the reef may frown; 
 The rock is there the ship has gone 
 
 Full twenty fathoms down. 
 But, cheered by hope, the seamen cope 
 
 With billows single-handed: 
 They are all in the boat! hurrah! They're afloat! 
 
 And now they are safely landed 
 By the life-boat. 
 
 Cheer the life-boat ! 
 
 Hurrah ! Hurrah for the life-boat !

 MOVEMENT. 
 
 Movement is the rate with which words and sentences 
 are uttered. It includes not only the length of time 
 occupied in the utterance of words, but the pauses 
 between the words and sentences. It is really a com- 
 bination of quantity and pauses. 
 
 Advantages. 
 
 Movement is an element of immense power and 
 wonderful effect when properly employed. But it 
 must be skillfully used. Every mood of mind, every 
 variety of emotion, every burst of passion has its 
 appropriate movement. Solemnity must move slowly, 
 joy rapidly, argument moderately, and excitement 
 hurriedly. This is indicated by the slow and measured 
 step of the funeral march, the rapid movement of the 
 merry dance, the firm but moderate step of the deter- 
 mined army. 
 


## p. 217 (#221) ############################################

Moderate Movement. 217 
 
 No defect sooner wearies the hearer or more cer- 
 tainly kills the effect of expression than a drawling, 
 lifeless movement, and continuous rapidity as certainly 
 destroys all deep and impressive utterance. No ele- 
 ment should be more carefully practiced than move- 
 ment. The general divisions of this element are Very 
 Rapid, Rapid, Moderate, Slow, and Very Slow. 
 
 moderate Movement. 
 
 Moderate is that rate used in ordinary conversation by 
 persons who have not fallen into incorrect habits. 
 
 It must not be understood that Moderate Movement 
 is a fixed rate to which all persons must conform, but 
 one that will vary with different temperaments. That 
 which would be moderate for one may be slow for 
 another. From Moderate Movement all the other divi- 
 sions are determined. Exercise in movement may be 
 practiced on sounds and words, but they can be better 
 illustrated with sentences. Practice each of the fol- 
 lowing sentences a number of times with a Moderate 
 Movement in the following combination. 
 
 Exercises in Moderate Movement. 
 Middle Pitch, Radical Stress, Moderate Force, Pure Tone, Expulsive Form. 
 
 1. We will have rain to-night. 
 
 2. The true American patriot is ever a worshiper. 
 
 3. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to 
 you. 
 
 4. I have been accused of ambition in presenting 
 this measure. 
 
 Moderate Movement When Used. 
 Moderate Movement is appropriate for the delivery of 
 narrative, didactic, and unimpassioned thought in the 
 form of scientific and literary lectures and introductions 
 to speeches.

 An Order for a Picture. 
 
 Alice Cary. 
 
 1. O, good painter, tell me true, 
 
 Has your hand the cunning to draw 
 Shapes of things that you never saw ? 
 Ay? Well, here is an order for you. 
 
 2. Woods and cornfields, a little brown 
 
 The picture must not be over-bright, 
 
 Yet all in the golden and gracious light 
 Of a cloud when the summer sun is down. 
 
 Alway and alway, night and morn, 
 
 Woods upon woods, with fields of corn 
 Lying between them, not quite sear, 
 And not in the full, thick, leafy bloom, 
 When the wind can hardly find breathing room 
 
 Under their tassels cattle near, 
 Biting shorter the short green grass, 
 And a hedge of sumach and sassafras, 
 With bluebirds twittering all around, 
 (Ah, good painter, you can't paint sound !) 
 
 These, and the house where I was born, 
 Low and little, and black and old, 
 With children, many as it can hold, 
 All at the windows, open wide 
 Heads and shoulders clear outside, 
 And fair young faces all ablush : 
 
 Perhaps you may have seen, some day, 
 
 Roses crowding the self-same way, 
 Out of a wilding, way-side bush. 
 
 3. Listen closer : When you have done 
 
 With w T oods and cornfields and grazing herds, 
 A lady, the loveliest ever the sun 
 Looked down upon, you must paint for me; 
 if I only could make you see

 The clear blue eyes, the tender smile, 
 The sovereign sweetness, the gentle grace, 
 The woman's soul, and the angel's face, 
 
 That are beaming on me all the while, 
 I need not speak these foolish words: 
 
 Yet one word tells you all I would say 
 She is my mother : you will agree 
 
 That all the rest may be thrown away. 
 
 4. Two little urchins at her knee 
 You must paint, sir ; one like me, 
 The other with a clearer brow, 
 
 And the light of his adventurous eyes 
 
 Flashing with boldest enterprise: 
 At ten years old he went to sea 
 
 God knoweth if he be living now: 
 
 He sailed in the good ship Commodore ; 
 Nobody ever crossed her track 
 To bring us news, and she never came back. 
 
 Ah, 'tis twenty long years and more 
 Since that old ship went out of the bay 
 
 With my great-hearted brother on her deck : 
 
 I watched him till he shrank to a speck, 
 And his face was toward me all the way. 
 Bright his hair was, a golden brown, 
 
 The time we stood at our mother's knee : 
 That beauteous head, if it did go down, 
 
 Carried sunshine into the sea! 
 
 5. Out in the fields one summer night 
 We were together, half afraid 
 Of the corn-leaves' rustling, and of the shade 
 Of the high hills, stretching so still and far- 
 Loitering till after the low little light 
 
 Of the candle shone through the open door ; 
 And over the haystack's pointed top, 
 All of a tremble, and ready to drop, 
 
 The first half-hour, the great yellow star, 
 That we, with staring, ignorant eyes, 
 Had often and often watched to see, 
 
 Propped and held in its place in the skies

 By the fork of a tall red mulberry-tree, 
 
 Which close in the edge of our flax field grew > 
 
 Dead at the top just one branch full 
 
 Of leaves notched round, and lined with wool, 
 From which it tenderly shook the dew 
 
 Over our heads, when we came to play 
 
 In its handbreadth of shadow, day after day. 
 Afraid to go home, sir ; for one of us bore 
 
 A nest full of speckled and thin-shelled eggs ; 
 
 The other a bird held fast by the legs, 
 
 Not so big as a straw of w r heat : 
 
 The berries we gave her she wouldn't eat, 
 
 But cried and cried, till we held her bill, 
 
 So slim and shining, to keep her still. 
 
 6. At last we stood at our mother's knee. 
 
 Do you think, sir, if you try, 
 
 You can paint the look of a lie ? 
 
 If you can, pray have the grace 
 
 To put it solely in the face 
 Of the urchin that is likest me : 
 
 I think 'twas solely mine indeed : 
 
 But that's no matter paint it so; 
 
 The eyes of our mother (take good heed), 
 Looking not on the nestful of eggs, 
 Nor the fluttering bird held so fast by the legs, 
 But straight through our faces down to our lies, 
 And O, with such injured, reproachful surprise! 
 
 I felt my heart bleed where that glance went as though 
 
 A sharp blade stuck through it.

 That you on the canvas are to repeat 
 
 Things that are fairest, things most sweet 
 
 Woods and cornfields and mulberry-tree

 But O, that look of reproachful woe! 
 High as the heavens your name I'll shout, 
 If you paint me the picture and leave that out.

 Slow movement. 
 
 Slow Movement may be defined as that rate in which 
 words are uttered but little more than half as rapidly as 
 Moderate Movement. Like the Moderate, it will vary 
 greatly. It gives dignity, gravity, and solemnity to 
 utterance. It can be given with various combinations.

 God's First Temples. 
 
 W. C. BRYANT. 
 
 The groves were God's first temples. Ere man learned 
 
 To hew the shaft, and lay the architrave, 
 
 And spread the roof above them, ere he framed 
 
 The lofty vault, to gather and roll back 
 
 The sound of anthems, in the darkling wood, 
 
 Amidst the cool and silence, he knelt down 
 
 And offered to the Mightiest solemn thanks 
 
 And supplication. For his simple heart 
 
 Might not resist the sacred influences 
 
 That, from the stilly twilight of the place, 
 
 And from the gray old trunks, that high, in heaven, 
 
 Mingled their mossy boughs, and from the sound 
 
 Of the invisible breath, that swayed at once 
 
 All their green tops, stole over him, and bowed 
 
 His spirit with the thought of boundless Power 
 
 And inaccessible Majesty. Ah, why 
 
 Should we, in the world's riper years, neglect 
 
 God's ancient sanctuaries, and adore 
 
 Only among the crowd, and under roofs 
 
 That our frail hands have raised ? Let me, at least, 
 
 Here, in the shadow of the ancient wood, 
 
 Offer one hymn ; thrice happy if it find 
 
 Acceptance in his ear.

 2. Father, thy hand 
 Hath reared these venerable columns : thou 
 
 Didst weave this verdant roof. Thou didst look down 
 Upon the naked earth, and forthwith rose 
 All these fair ranks of trees. They in thy sun 
 Budded, and shook their green leaves in thy breeze, 
 And shot toward heaven. The century-living crow, 
 Whose birth was in their tops, grew old and died 
 Among their branches, till at last they stood, 
 As now they stand, massy and tall and dark, 
 Fit shrine for humble worshiper to hold 
 Communion with his Maker. 
 
 3. Here are seen 
 No traces of man's pomp or pride ; no silks 
 Rustle, no jewels shine, nor envious eyes 
 Encounter ; no fantastic carvings show 
 
 The boast of our vain race to change the form 
 Of thy fair works. But thou art here ; thou fill'st 
 The solitude. Thou art in the soft winds 
 That run along the summits of these trees 
 In music ; thou art in the cooler breath, 
 That, from the inmost darkness of the place, 
 Comes, scarcely felt ; the barky trunks, the ground, 
 The fresh, moist ground, are all instinct with thee. 
 
 Here is continual worship ; Nature here, 
 In the tranquillity that thou dost love, 
 Enjoys thy presence. Noiselessly around, 
 From perch to perch the solitary bird 
 Passes; and yon clear s]3ring, that, 'midst its herbs, 
 Wells softly forth, and visits the strong roots 
 Or half the mighty forest, tells no tale 
 Of all the good it does. 
 
 4. Thou hast not left 
 Thyself without a witness, in these shades, 
 
 Of thy perfections. Grandeur, strength, and grace 
 Are here to speak of thee. This mighty oak 
 By whose immovable stem I stand, and seem 
 Almost annihilated not a prince, 
 In all the proud old world beyond the deep,

 Ere wore his crown as loftily as he 
 
 Wears the green coronal of leaves with which 
 
 Thy hand has graced him. Nestled at its root 
 
 Is beauty such as blooms not in the glare 
 
 Of the broad Sun. That delicate forest flower, 
 
 With scented breath, that looks so like a smile, 
 
 Seems, as it issues from the shapeless mold, 
 
 An emanation of th' indwelling life, 
 
 A visible token of the upholding love, 
 
 That is the soul of this wide universe. 
 
 fi. My heart is awed within me when I think 
 Of the great miracle that still goes on, 
 In silence round me the perpetual work 
 Of thy creation, finished, yet renewed 
 Forever. Written on thy works I read 
 The lesson of thy own eternity. 
 Lo! all grow old and die; but see, again, 
 How, on the faltering footsteps of decay, 
 Youth presses ever gay and beautiful Youth 
 In all its beautiful forms. These lofty trees 
 Wave not less proudly that their ancestors 
 Molder beneath them. 
 
 6. O there is not lost 
 One of earth's charms : upon her bosom yet, 
 After the flight of untold centuries, 
 
 The freshness of her far beginning lies, 
 And yet shall lie. Life mocks the idle hate 
 Of his arch enemy, Death ; yea, seats himself 
 Upon the sepulcher, and blooms and smiles, 
 And of the triumphs of his ghastly foe 
 Makes his own nourishment. For he came forth 
 From thine own bosom and shall have no end. 
 
 7. There have been holy men who hid themselves 
 Deep in the woody wilderness, and gave 
 
 Their lives to thought and prayer, till they outlived 
 The generation born with them, nor seemed 
 Less aged than the hoary trees and rocks 
 Around them ; and there have been holy men 
 Who deemed it were not well to pass life thus.

 But let me often to these .solitudes 
 Retire, and, in thy presence, re-assure 
 My feeble virtue. Here, its enemies, 
 The passions, at thy plainer footstep, shrink, 
 And tremble, and are still. 
 
 8. O God, when thou 
 
 Dost scare the world with tempests, set on fire 
 The heavens with falling thunderbolts, or fill, 
 With all the waters of the firmanent, 
 The swift, dark whirlwind, that uproots the woods 
 And drowns the villages; whe*n, at thy call, 
 Uprises the great deep, and throws himself 
 Upon the continent, and overwhelms 
 Its cities ; who forgets not, at the sight 
 Of these tremendous tokens of thy power, 
 His pride, and lays his strifes and follies by? 
 O, from these sterner aspects of thy face 
 Spare me and mine; nor let us need the wrath 
 Of the mad, unchained elements, to teach 
 Who rules them. Be it ours to meditate, 
 In these calm shades, thy milder majesty, 
 And to the beautiful order of thy works 
 Learn to conform the order of our lives.

 Young Lochinvar. 
 
 SCOTT. 
 
 1. O, young Lochinvar is come out of the west! 
 Through all the wide border his steed was the best; 
 And save his good broadsword he weapon had none; 
 He rode all unarmed, and he rode all alone. 
 
 So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war, 
 There never was knight like the young Lochinvar. 
 
 2. He stayed not for brake, and he stopped not for stone ; 
 He swam the Eske River, where ford there was none ; 
 But ere he alighted at Netherby gate 
 
 The bride had consented, the gallant came late; 
 For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war, 
 Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar. 
 
 3. So boldly he entered the Netherby hall, 
 
 'Mong bridesmen, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all.

 Then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his sword 
 (For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word), 
 " O come ye in peace here, or come ye in war, 
 Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar? " 
 
 i. " I long wooed your daughter, my suit you denied; 
 Love swells like the Sol way, but ebbs like its tide ; 
 And now am I come, with this lost love of mine, 
 To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine. 
 There be maidens in Scotland, more lovely by far, 
 That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar." 
 
 5. The bride kissed the goblet, the knight took it up, 
 He quaffed" off the wine, and he threw down the cup ; 
 She looked down to blush, she looked up to sigh, 
 With a smile on her lips and a tear in her eye. 
 
 He took her soft hand ere her mother could bar, 
 11 Now tread we a measure," said young Lochinvar. 
 
 6. So stately his form, and so lovely her face, 
 That never a hall such a galliard did grace, 
 
 While her mother did fret, and her father did fume, 
 And the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume, 
 And the bride-maidens whispered, " 'Twere better by far 
 To have matched our fair cousin with young Lochinvar." 
 
 7. One touch to her hand, and one word in her ear 
 
 When they reached the hall-door, and the charger stood 
 
 near; 
 So light to the croup the fair lady he swung, 
 So light to the saddle before her he sprung. 
 " She is won! we are gone over bank, bush, and scaur 
 They'll have swift steeds that follow," quoth young 
 Lochinvar. 
 
 8. There was mounting 'mong Graemes of the Netherby clan, 
 Forsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they 
 
 ran; 
 There was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lee, 
 But the lost bride of Netherby ne'er did they see. 
 So daring in love, and so dauntless in war, 
 Have ye e'er heard of a gallant like young Lochinvar ?

 Very Slow movement. 
 
 Very Slow Movement is that rate in which toords are 
 uttered very deliberately and with very long pauses. Not 
 more than one fourth as many words can be spoken 
 with Very Slow as with Moderate Movement. It is 
 the Very Slow Movement that gives solemnity, awe, 
 and dread to utterance. To cultivate this rate prac- 
 tice the sentences with the utmost deliberation and 
 very long pauses.

 A trampling troop I see them come ; 
 A thousand horse, and none to ride ; 
 With flowing tail and flying mane, 
 Wide nostrils, never stretched by pain, 
 Mouths bloodless to the bit or rein, 
 And feet that iron never shod, 
 And flanks unscarred by spur or rod : 
 A thousand horse the wild, the free, 
 Like waves that follow o'er the sea, 
 
 Came thickly thundering on. 
 They stop, they start, they snuff the air, 
 Gallop a moment here and there, 
 Approach, retire, wheel round and round, 
 Then plunging back with sudden bound,

 The Two Boot-Blacks. 
 
 1. A day or two ago, during a lull in business, two little boot- 
 blacks, one white and one black, were standing on the street 
 corner doing nothing, when the white boot- black agreed to 
 black the black boot-black's boots. The black boot-black 
 was, of course, willing to have his boots blacked by his fellow 
 boot blacK, and the boot- black who had agreed to black the 
 black boot- black's boots went to work. 
 
 2. When the boot-black had blacked one of the black boot- 
 black's boots till it shone in a manner that would make any 
 boot-black proud, this boot-black who had agreed to black 
 the black boot-black's boots refused to black the other boot 
 of the black boot-black until the black boot-black, who had 
 consented to have the white boot-black black his boots, 
 should add five cents to the amount the white boot-black 
 had made blacking other men's boots. This the boot-black 
 whose boot had been blacked refused to do, saying it was 
 good enough for a black boot-black to have one boot blacked, 
 and he didn't care whether the boot that the boot-black 
 hadn't blacked was blacked or not. 
 
 3. This made the boot-black who had blacked the black boot- 
 black's boot as angry as a boot-black often gets, and he 
 vented his black wrath by spitting upon the blacked boot 
 of the black boot-black. This roused the latent passions of 
 the black boot-black, and he proceded to boot the white 
 boot-black with the boot which the white boot-black had 
 blacked. A fight ensued, in which the white boot-black who 
 had refused to black the unblacked boot of the black boot- 
 black, blacked the black boot-black's visionary organ, and 
 in which the black boot-black wore all the blacking off his 
 blacked boot in booting the white boot-black.

 HiESSOIST XLV. 
 GROUPING. 
 
 While it is impossible to express thought and feel- 
 ing appropriately and impressively without the perfect 
 illustration and correct combination of the Essential 
 Elements, yet it does not follow that, because they are 
 so given, excellence of expression will be the nec- 
 essary result. An utterance may combine the elements 
 correctly, it may illustrate them perfectly and yet be 
 monotonous, wearisome, and even positively unpleasant. 
 Something more than correct combination and illustra- 
 tion is necessary. They are essential, but not sufficient. 
 
 The elements are to expression what the processes, 
 Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division, are 
 to the solution of problems, or the notes of the scale 
 to a tune. Problems cannot be solved without the 
 processes, tunes cannot be composed without the notes. 
 But the mere fact that the processes are employed 
 does not assure the correctness of the result ; the ar- 
 rangement of a certain number of notes does not con- 
 stitute a pleasing and impressive tune. It is the cor- 
 rectness of the processes, the skillful arrangement of 
 the notes, that is as important as the processes and 
 the notes themselves. So it is in utterance; there must 
 be a skillful blending of the elements, a pleasing va- 
 riety, a happy adjustment of light and shade. This, for 
 want of a better name, has been termed 
 
 Grouping. 
 
 Grouping may be defined as the modulation of the 
 voice in the same combination or in diffei*ent combiner

Grouping. 239 
 
 tiona which renders the utterance both pleasing and im- 
 pressive. It consists of slight changes generally 
 (though occasionally of marked ones), not of Pitch 
 chiefly, as is the case in music, but of Force, Quality, 
 Stress, Movement, and sometimes Form. It is to Elo- 
 cution what the composition of the tune is to music, 
 the originating, the creating, the divine part. It is 
 the all- important part of expression, the highest, the 
 most difficult attainment. To know the Essential Ele- 
 ments, in their illustration and application, is child's 
 play (and every child should know them thoroughly) 
 as compared with the mastery of Grouping. After 
 all that has been presented in the previous passes 
 has been thoroughly mastered, then the real study of 
 Elocution begins. It were easy to sing after one has 
 learned to illustrate the notes of the scale and some 
 one else has composed the tune ; but to compose the 
 tune, and compose it, too, while you sing, " Ay, there's 
 the rub ! " And yet this is just what excellence in 
 reading, in speaking, in recitation, in acting, in conver- 
 sation implies. He who excels in vocal expression 
 illustrates in every utterance the combined power of 
 the musical composer and the singer. When Edwin 
 Booth reads Hamlet, recites it, acts it (what you will, 
 they are all the same), he illustrates in every persona- 
 tion the genius of Verdi* when he composed, and the 
 artistic skill of Patti when she sings. He groups 
 while he recites to borrow the language of music, he 
 composes as he sings. 
 
 Elocution would be a comparatively easy study if, in 
 addition to the explanation, illustration, and application 
 of the elements, there could be arranged and set down, 
 as a tune in music for each and every selection, a pleas- 
 ing and impressive Grouping. But this cannot be done. 
 


## p. 240 (#244) ############################################

240 Science of Elocution. 
 
 Grouping is so multiform that no particular grouping 
 can be said to be the best, nor could it be reproduced 
 if it were. No one groups the same selection twice in 
 the same way. The same general outline may be re- 
 tained, but the shading will always be different. 
 Grouping is, as it were, a kaleidoscope in which Form, 
 Quality, Force, Stress, Pitch, and Movement are the 
 bits of glass which never twice present the same com- 
 bination, and the effects of which are never twice pre- 
 cisely alike. However excellently we may recite a 
 selection, that rendition is lost as soon as uttered. It 
 cannot be recalled. We may improve it, but our best 
 groupings, like " the thoughts that most thrill our ex- 
 istence ere we can frame them into language, are gone." 
 Booth's last night's Hamlet was not like the one of the 
 night before, and no two were the same. 
 
 Again, no two persons group alike. They may read 
 the same selection equally well, but their groupings 
 will differ and cannot be exchanged. Grouping is sus- 
 ceptible of cultivation, but not of imitation. For a 
 pupil to copy his teacher's grouping, or a fawner his 
 favorite's, is simply to give a feeble echo, a parrot-like 
 performance, a copy, a chromo of an artist's production. 
 In the study of grouping, more than anywhere else in 
 Elocution, the pupil must rely on his own native talent, 
 his aesthetic taste, his originality. In grouping, Elocu- 
 tion rises to a divine- art and soars above human imita- 
 tion, and one flash of originality kindles expression into 
 a flame that thrills like an electric shock. 
 
 All instruction on this subject must be more or less 
 vague, it can only be suggestive ; illustrative, not abso- 
 lute. There are no rules to guide, no principles to decide. 
 
 Some illustrations will be given, but even they can- 
 not be followed with unerring certainty.

 Exercises in Grouping. 
 
 The following stanza requires 
 
 Effusive Form, Orotund Quality, Moderate Force, Median Stress, Low 
 Pitch, and Slow Movement. 
 
 Break, break, break, 
 
 On thy cold gray stones, O sea ! 
 And I would that my tongue could utter 
 
 The thoughts that arise in me. 
 
 Now, if the same degree of each of the elements in 
 the above combination be given, the delivery will be 
 correct, but unpleasantly monotonous. To group it, give 
 the first word " break " with Effusive Form, Orotund, 
 the second degree of Moderate Force, a moderately 
 prolonged Median Stress, about the second note of 
 Low Pitch, and Slow Movement. Give the second 
 word " break " with Effusive Form, Orotund Quality, 
 the third or even a fourth degree of Moderate Force, 
 Median Stress, but more prolonged than on the first 
 word; Low Pitch, but not so low as on the first 
 word, and Slow Movement, but a little faster than the 
 first. Give the third word " break " with Effusive Form, 
 Orotund Quality, Moderate Force, but the first and 
 mildest degree of Moderate Force, Median Stress; but 
 less prolonged than the first ; Low Pitch, the lowest of 
 the low division, and the slowest of the Slow Move- 
 ment. The second line should be given with the regu- 
 lar combination, gradually increasing to the words 
 " seal" On the " " the Median Stress should be 
 unusually prolonged, the Movement Very Slow. The 
 word " sea " should be given in the same way, only in 
 a less degree. " And I would that my tongue could 
 utter the thoughts that arise in me," should be given 
 
 with lower Pitch than the last, with more Force, and 
 16

 less Effusive Form. It should gradually increase in 
 force to the word " thoughts" and then the pitch should 
 be lowered and the movement slower. 
 
 It must not be understood that the above is a group- 
 ing tnat must be given to the stanza, but that may be 
 given to it. It may be given in a dozen different 
 ways, all better. But it must be varied in some way. 
 Take another example, a selection requiring an entirely 
 different combination. 
 
 Expulsive Form, Pure Tone, Moderate Force, Radical Stress, Low Pitch, 
 and Moderate Movement. 
 
 It is a religion by which to live, a religion by which to die ; 
 a religion which cheers in darkness, relieves in perplexity, 
 supports in adversity, keeps steadfast in prosperity, and 
 guides the inquirer to that blessed land where " the wicked 
 cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest." 
 
 The words, " It is a religion by which to live" should 
 be given with the above combination slightly climactic; 
 " a religion by which to die" with lower pitch, slower 
 movement, and greater force; " a religion which cheers 
 in darkness" with higher pitch, more force, and an 
 increased movement ; " relieves inperplexity" with lower 
 pitch, about the same force as the last, and slower 
 movement. On the words, "supports in adversity" 
 slightly raise the pitch, and increase the force ; lower 
 the pitch and reduce the force on " keeps steadfast in 
 prosperity; " on " and guides the inquirer to that blessed 
 land" gradually raise the pitch and increase the force 
 and movement ; and on " where the wicked cease from 
 troubling, and the weary are at rest" lower the pitch 
 several notes, reduce the force, and slow the move- 
 ment. In a hundred different ways this may be 
 grouped. 
 
 One more example will suffice.

 The following requires 
 
 Effusive and Expulsive Forms, Pure Tone, Subdued and Moderate Force, 
 Median and Thorough Stress, Low Pitch, aud Slow Movement. 
 
 The departed! the departed! 
 
 They visit us in dreams, 
 And they glide above our memories 
 
 Like shadows over streams. 
 
 Give the first " The departed " with Expulsive Form, 
 first degree of Moderate Force, Thorough Stress, Low 
 Pitch, and Slow Movement ; the second " the de- 
 parted" with Effusive Form, Pure Tone, Subdued 
 Force, Median Stress, Low Pitch, and Very Slow 
 Movement ; " They visit us in dreams" with more 
 force than the last, higher pitch, and less Slow Move- 
 ment, Expulsive Form, Pure Tone ; " And they glide 
 above our memories" with Effusive Form, Pure Tone, 
 Moderate Force, Low Pitch, and Moderate Movement ; 
 " Like shadows over streams" with less force, blower 
 movement, and lower pitch. 
 
 It must not be inferred that every line must be as 
 slowly and systematically analyzed and grouped as the 
 examples given. After a little practice the pupil will 
 group almost without a thought of the elements. 
 But the daily careful study of a few sentences will 
 richly compensate, and only in this way can the high- 
 est attainments be made. To trust to the inspiration 
 of the moment for results is to make a score of failures 
 for every success. The highest and best inspiration in 
 Elocution, as in every thing else, is the result of the 
 closest study and practice, not the gift of the gods. 
 
 Practice the following selection with special refer- 
 ence to Grouping. It will require the following com 
 bination except in the personations.

 Maud Muller. 
 
 J. G. WHITTIEK. 
 
 1. Maud Muller, on a summer's day, 
 Raked the meadow sweet with hay. 
 Beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth 
 Of simple beauty and rustic health. 
 
 2. Singing, she wrought, and her merry glee 
 The mock-bird echoed from his tree. 
 But, when she glanced to the far-off town, 
 White from its hill-slope looking down, 
 
 3. The sweet song died, and a vague unrest 
 And a nameless longing filled her breast 
 A wish, that she hardly dared to own, 
 For something better than she had known. 
 
 4. The Judge rode slowly down the lane, 
 Smoothing his horse's chestnut mane. 
 He drew his bridle in the shade 
 
 Of the apple-trees, to greet the maid, 
 
 5. And ask a draught from the spring that flowed 
 Through the meadow across the road. 
 
 She stooped where the cool spring bubbled up, 
 And filled for him her small tin cup, 
 
 6. And blushed as she gave it, looking down 
 On her feet so bare, and her tattered gown. 
 
 " Thanks!" said the Judge, " a sweeter draught 
 From a fairer hand was never quaffed." 
 
 7. He spoke of the grass and flowers and trees, 
 Of the singing birds and the humming bees ; 
 Then talked of the haying, and wondered whether 
 The cloud in the west would bring foul weather.

 8. And Maud forgot her briar-torn gown, 
 And her graceful ankles bare and brown ; 
 And listened, while a pleased surprise 
 Looked from her long-lashed hazel eyes. 
 
 9. At last, like one who for delay 
 Seeks a vain excuse, he rode away. 
 
 Maud Muller looked and sighed; "Ah, me! 
 That I the Judge's bride might be ! 
 
 10. " He would dress me up in silks so fine, 
 And praise and toast me at his wine. 
 
 My father should wear a broadcloth coat ; 
 My brother should sail a painted boat. 
 
 11. "I'd dress my mother so grand and gay; 
 And the baby should have a new toy each day. 
 And I'd feed the hungry and clothe the poor, 
 And all should bless me who left our door." 
 
 12. The Judge looked back as he climbed the hill, 
 And saw Maud Muller standing still. 
 
 " A form more fair, a face more sweet, 
 Ne'er hath it been my lot to meet. 
 
 13. "And her modest answer and graceful air 
 Showed her wise and good as she is fair. 
 Would she were mine, and I to-day, 
 Like her, a harvester of hay : 
 
 14. ' ' No doubtful balance of rights and wrongs, 
 Nor weary lawyers with endless tongues, 
 But low of cattle and song of birds, 
 
 And health and quiet and loving words." 
 
 15. But he thought of his sisters proud and cold, 
 And his mother vain of her rank and gold. 
 So, closing his heart, the Judge rode on, 
 And Maud was left in the field alone. 
 
 16. But the lawyers smiled that afternoon, 
 When he hummed in court an old love-tune, 
 And the young girl mused beside the well, 
 Till the rain on the unraked clover fell.

 17. He wedded a wife of richest dower. 
 Who lived for fashion, as he for power. 
 Yet oft, in his marble hearth's bright glow. 
 He watched a picture come and go ; 
 
 18. And sweet Maud Muller's hazel eyes 
 Looked out in their innocent surprise. 
 Oft, when the wine in his glass was red, 
 He longed for the way-side well instead; 
 
 19. And closed his eyes on his garnished rooms, 
 To dream of meadows and clover-blooms. 
 And the proud man sighed, with a secret pain, 
 
 "Ah, that I were free again! 
 
 20. ' ' Free as when I rode that day, 
 
 Where the barefoot maiden raked her hay." 
 She wedded a man unlearned and poor, 
 And many children played round her door. 
 
 21. And oft, when the summer sun shone hot 
 On the new-mown hay in the meadow lot, 
 And she heard the little spring brook fall 
 Over the roadside, through the w r all, 
 
 22. In the shade of the apple-tree again 
 She saw a rider draw his rein, 
 And, gazing down with timid grace, 
 She felt his pleased eyes read her face. 
 
 23. Sometimes her narrow kitchen walls 
 Stretched away into stately halls; 
 The weary wheel to a spinnet turned, 
 The tallow candle an astral burned, 
 
 24. And for him who sat by the chimney lug, 
 Dozing and grumbling o'er pipe and mug : 
 A manly form at her side she saw, 
 
 And joy was duty and love was law. 
 
 25. Then she took up her burden of life again, 
 Saying only, " It might have been." 
 Alas for maiden, alas for Judge, 
 
 For rich repiner and household drudge !

 LESSON XLVI. 
 Accidents of Vocal Expression. 
 
 The Accidents of 'Vocal Expression are those elements 
 which are not absolutely essential in every utterance. 
 
 They are, Quantity, Inflection, Circumflex, Cadence, 
 Emphasis, Pauses, Climax, and are simply special, un- 
 usual, peculiar combinations of two or more of the 
 Essential Elements. An utterance may be given, or at 
 least it may be conceived of, in which there will be no 
 special Emphasis, Pauses, Cadence, Inflection, or Quan- 
 tity, but we cannot even conceive of an utterance, 
 much less illustrate it, in which there will not be 
 Form, Quality, Forced Stress, Pitch, Movement, in some 
 combination. 
 
 The Accidents are to utterance what vibrates or 
 trills are to music, important, but not essential. 
 
 QUANTITY. 
 
 Quantity is the length of time occupied in the utter- 
 ance of syllables and words. It is a special combina- 
 tion of Form and Stress. Expulsive or Explosive 
 Form, Radical Stress, will give Short Quantity ; 
 Effusive Form, Median or Thorough Stress, will inva- 
 riably produce Long Quantity. 
 
 The power and beauty of vocal expression are 
 dependent, to a great extent, on the proper use of 
 Quantity. The music of the verse is sacrificed unless 
 the nicest regard be paid to prolongation ; without the 
 observance of Long Quantity the grand and majestic 
 passages of poetry and prose become flat and dry. 
 


## p. 249 (#253) ############################################

Long Quantity. 249 
 
 Long Quantity. 
 
 Long Quantity is a prolongation of syllables and 
 words greater than that in ordinary conversation. 
 This prolongation will vary with the sentiment and 
 emotion and the skill and power of the speaker. 
 
 To illustrate Long Quantity practice the following 
 sounds, words, and sentences, prolonging each as much 
 as possible, but being careful not to drawl the utterance.

 Long Quantity should be given in the expression of 
 pathos, solemnity, sublimity, grandeur, reverence, adora- 
 tion, shouting, calling, commanding, and other similar 
 emotions and passions.

 Part we in friendship from your land, 
 And, noble earl, receive my hand." 
 
 2. But Douglas round him drew his cloak, 
 Folded his arms, and thus he spoke : 
 
 " My manors, halls, and towers shall still 
 
 Be open, at my sovereign's will, 
 
 To each one whom he lists, howe'er 
 
 Unmeet to be the owner's peer. 
 
 My castles are my king's alone 
 
 From turret to foundation-stone; 
 
 The hand of Douglas is his own, 
 
 And never shall in friendly grasp 
 
 The hand of such as Marmion clasp." 
 
 3. Burned Marmion's swarthy cheek like fire, 
 And shook his very frame for ire, 
 
 And, " This to me! " he said; 
 " An t'were not for thy hoary beard, 
 Such hand as Marmion's had not spared 
 
 To cleave the Douglas' head ! 
 And, first, I tell thee, haughty peer, 
 He who does England's message here, 
 Although the meanest in her State, 
 May well, proud Angus, be thy mate : 
 And, Douglas, more I tell thee here 
 
 Even in thy pitch of pride, 
 Here in thy hold, thy vassals near

 And lay your hands upon your sword), 
 
 I tell thee, thou'rt defied ! 
 And, if thou said'st I am not peer 
 To any lord in Scotland here, 
 Lowland or Highland, far or near, 
 
 Lord Angus, thou hast lied ! "

 5. Lord Marmion turned well was his need ! 
 And dashed the rowels in his steed, 
 
 Like arrow through the archway sprung; 
 The ponderous gate behind him rung : 
 To pass there was such scanty room, 
 The bars, descending, razed his plume. 
 
 6. The steed along the draw-bridge flies, 
 Just as it trembled on the rise; 
 
 Not lighter does the swallow skim 
 Along the smooth lake's level brim ; 
 And, when Lord Marmion reached his band, 
 He halts, and turns with clenched hand, 
 And shout of loud defiance pours, 
 And shook his gauntlet at the towers.

 LESSON XL VIII. 
 
 INFLECTIONS. 
 
 Inflections are changes in Pitch either upward or 
 downward through the concrete movement. 
 
 They are special combinations of Pitch and Move- 
 ment, and vary in degree according to the sentiment. 
 
 No element of utterance is more important in giving 
 significance to speech than Inflections. 
 
 The Inflection alone often renders expression ad- 
 dressed to the understanding intelligible. 
 
 In the reading and recitation of verse it is the proper 
 management of the Inflections that prevents monotony, 
 on the one hand, and chanting on the other. 
 
 " So important is a just mixture of Inflections that 
 the moment they are neglected our pronunciation be- 
 comes meaningless and monotonous. If the sense of a 
 sentence require the voice to adopt the rising Inflection 
 on any particular word, either in the middle or at the 
 end of the phrase, variety and harmony demand the 
 falling Inflection on one of the preceeding words; and, 
 on the other hand, if emphasis, harmony, or a comple- 
 tion of sense require the falling Inflection on any 
 word, the word immediately preceding almost always 
 demands the rising Inflection, so that these Inflections 
 of voice are in an order nearly alternate." 
 
 Rising Inflection. 
 
 A Rising Inflection is a rapid change in the pitch of 
 the voice from a lower to a higher tone through the con- 
 crete movement.

Rising Inflection. 255 
 
 The Inflection will vary in degree according to the 
 sentiment. 
 
 Rising Inflection When Used. 
 
 A Rising Inflection of a second, that is, running 
 through the interval of the second on the musical 
 scale, will indicate a suspensio7i of the sense or incom- 
 pleteness in the utteratice. 
 
 The rising Inflection of the Third and Fifth are 
 used, to ask a definite question, or one that may be 
 answered by yes or no; to express suspense, astonish- 
 ment, wonder, amazement, etc. ; to express lively, joyous 
 thought; to petition, beg, fawn, and flatter. 
 
 The Rising Inflection of the octave expresses intense 
 surprise, wonder, and astonishment. These are by no 
 means all the cases in which the different Inflections 
 will be required.

 I was on the lower step, 
 
 Molly on the next above ; 
 Gave me her bouquet to hold 
 
 Asked me to draw off her glove. 
 Then, of course, I squeezed her hand, 
 
 Talked about my wasted life ; 
 Said my sole salvation must 
 
 Be a true and gentle wife. 
 Takes a girl, that kind of talk.

 But old Gray said I must stop, 
 
 And I'd promised ma I would ; 
 So I looked up sweet and said 
 
 That I'd rather talk with him. 
 Hope he did not see my face ; 
 
 Luckily the lights were dim. 
 Then how he did squeeze my hand 
 
 And he looked up in my face 
 With his lovely, great big eyes

Falling Inflection. 259 
 
 LESSON XLIX. 
 
 Falling Inflection. 
 
 A Falling Inflection is a rapid change in the pitch 
 of the voice from a higher to a lower one through the con- 
 crete movement. 
 
 Like the Rising Inflection, it admits of various 
 degrees. 
 
 If a person in reply to a question utters the word no, 
 expressing a mild dissent, the voice will pass from the 
 middle pitch downward, exhibiting a Falling Inflection 
 of a second or third ; when uttered so as to express 
 stronger dissent it will commence on a higher pitch, 
 and end in a downward slide of a fifth ; and when 
 uttered in a very strong or passionate dissent, the 
 downward slide will run through a whole octave. 
 
 Falling Inflection When Used. 
 
 The Falling Inflection is used 
 
 To express completion of thought. 
 
 To express, in different degrees, positiveness, firm- 
 ness, confidence, authority, declaration, determination, 
 command, defiance, indignation, etc. 
 
 To answer questions. 
 
 To ask indefinite questions, or those beginning with 
 relative pronouns or adverbs, and not admitting of an 
 answer by yes or no. 
 
 To give emphasis to words which otherwise would 
 have the Rising Inflection.

 3. He does not love me for my birth, 
 
 Nor for my lands so broad and fair ; 
 He loves me for my own true worth, 
 And that is well," said Lady Clare. 
 
 4. In there came old Alice the nurse, 
 
 Said, " Who was this that went from thee ? " 
 " It was my cousin," said Lady Clare, 
 " To-morrow he weds with me." 
 
 5. " O God be thanked! " said Alice the nurse, 
 
 " That all comes round so just and fair; 
 Lord Ronald is heir of all your lands, 
 And you are not the Lady Clare." 
 
 6. "Are ye out of your mind, my nurse, my nurse,'

 9. " Nay, now, my child," said Alice the nurse. 
 
 But keep the secret for your life, 
 And all you have will be Lord Ronald's, 
 When you are man and wife." 
 
 10. " If I'm a beggar born," she said, 
 
 " I will speak out, for I dare not lie, 
 Pull off, pull off the brooch of gold,

 " But keep the secret all ye can." 
 She said, " Not so; but I will know 
 If there be any faith in man."

 12. " Nay, now, what faith ? " said Alice the nurse, 
 
 " The man will cleave unto his right." 
 " And he shall have it," the lady replied, 
 " Though I should die to-night." 
 
 13. " Yet give one kiss to your mother dear!

 " O Lady Clare, you shame your worth! 
 Why come you drest like a village maid,

 I am but as my fortunes are : 
 
 I am a beggar born, " she said, 
 
 " And not the Lady Clare."

 " For I am yours in word and in deed ;

 CIRCUMFLEX. 
 
 The Circumflex is a rapid movement of the voice either 
 upward and downward or downward and upward. It 
 is a combination of the rising and falling Inflections on 
 a waved tone. It may be given in various combina- 
 tions. Dr. Rush has presented more than one hun- 
 dred and fifty different degrees of the Circumflex. An 
 explanation and illustration of the different varieties 
 would be of but little practical advantage to the 
 student. 
 
 Circumflex When Used. 
 
 The Circumflex is appropriately used chiefly in the 
 expression of irony, sarcasm, sneering, railery, drollery, 
 etc.

 Pitt's Reply to Walpole. 
 
 1. Sir: The atrocious crime of being a young man, which 
 the honorable gentleman has, with such spirit and decency, 
 charged upon me, I shall neither attempt to palliate nor deny ; 
 but content myself with wishing that I may be one of those 
 whose follies may cease with their youth, and not of that 
 number who are ignorant in spite of experience. Whether 
 youth can be imputed to any man as a reproach, I will not, 
 sir, assume the province of determining; but surely age may 
 become justly contemptible, if the opportunities which it 
 brings have passed away without improvement, and vic& 
 appears to prevail when the passions have subsided. 
 
 2. The wretch who, after having seen the consequences of a 
 thousand errors, continues still to blunder, and whose age has 
 only added obstinacy to stupidity, is surely the object either 
 of abhorrence or contempt, and deserves not that his gray

 "hairs should secure him from insult. Much more, sir, is he to 
 be abhorred who, as he has advanced in age, has receded 
 from virtue, and become more wicked with less temptation ; 
 who prostitutes himself for money which he cannot enjoy, and 
 spends the remains of his life in the ruin of his country. 
 
 3. But youth, sir, is not my only crime; I have been 
 accused of acting a theatrical part. A theatrical part may 
 either imply some peculiarities of gesture, or a dissimulation of 
 my real sentiments, and an adoption of the opinions and lan- 
 guage of another man. 
 
 4. In the first sense, sir, the charge is too trifling to be con- 
 fronted, and deserves only to be mentioned, that it may be 
 despised. I am at liberty, like every other man, to use my 
 own language ; and though perhaps I may have some ambi- 
 tion to please this gentleman, I shall not lay myself under any 
 restraint, nor very solicitously copy his diction or his mien, 
 however matured by age or modeled by experience. 
 
 5. But if any man shall, by charging me with theatrical 
 behavior, imply that I utter any sentiments but my own, I 
 shall treat him as a calumniator and a villain ; nor shall any 
 protection shelter him from the treatment he deserves. I 
 shall, on such an occasion, without scruple, trample upon all 
 those forms with which wealth and dignity intrench them- 
 selves ; nor shall any thing but age restrain my resentment 
 age, which always brings one privilege, . that of being insolent 
 and supercilious, without punishment. 
 
 6. But with regard, sir, to those whom I have offended, 
 I am of opinion that, if I had acted a borrowed part, I should 
 have avoided their censure; the heat that offended them is 
 the ardor of conviction, and that zeal for the service of my 
 country which neither hope nor fear shall influence me to sup- 
 press. I will not sit unconcerned while my liberty is invaded, 
 nor look in silence upon public robbery. I will exert my 
 endeavors, at whatever hazard, to repel the aggressor, and 
 drag the thief to justice, whoever may protect him in his vil- 
 lainy, and whoever may partake of his plunder.

Cadence. 267 
 
 LESSON LI. 
 
 CADENCE. 
 
 Cadence is a smooth, gradual closing of the line in 
 poetry or the sentence in prose which gives a pleasing 
 and impressive effect to utterance. It is not like the 
 Inflection, a simple change in Pitch through the Concrete 
 Movement of the voice, but a diminution of the Force 
 also, and a change of Pitch sometimes through the 
 Concrete, sometimes through the Discrete Movement. 
 These changes occur on the last three, four, or five 
 syllables of the line or sentence. 
 
 A graceful, pleasing Cadence is one of the most 
 impressive elements in the reading or recitation of 
 solemn, serious, pathetic, sublime, and devotional 
 thought and feeling. 
 
 It is difficult to acquire and more difficult to explain. 
 
 Practice the following sentences with special refer- 
 ence to the Cadence.

 Over the River. 
 
 MISS PRIEST. 
 
 1. Over the river they beckon to me ; 
 
 Loved ones, who have passed to the farther side ; 
 The gleam of their snowy robes I see 
 
 But their voices are lost in the dashing tide. 
 There was one with ringlets of sunny gold, 
 
 And eyes the reflection of heaven's own blue ; 
 He passed in the twilight gray and cold, 
 
 And the pale mist hid him from mortal view. 
 We saw not the angels who met him there, 
 
 The gates of the city we could not see 
 Over the river, over the river, 
 
 My brother stands waiting to welcome me. 
 
 2. Over the river the boatman pale 
 
 Carried another, our household pet ; 
 Her brown curls waved in the gentle gale, 
 
 Darling Minnie ! I see her yet. 
 She crossed on her bossom her dimpled hands, 
 
 And fearlessly entered the phantom bark ; 
 We felt it glide from the silver sands, 
 
 And all our sunshine grew strangely dark. 
 We know she is safe on the farther side, 
 
 Where all the angels and ransomed be 
 Over the river, the mystic river, 
 
 Our household pet is waiting for me.

 3. For none return from those quiet shores 
 
 Who pass with the boatman cold and pale ; 
 We hear the dip of the golden oars, 
 
 We catch a glimpse of their snowy sail ; 
 And, lo ! they have passed from our yearning heart, 
 
 They have crossed the stream, and are gone for aye- 
 We may not sunder the vail apart, 
 
 That hides from our vision the gates of day. 
 We only know that their barks no more 
 
 Will glide with us o'er life's stormy sea ; 
 But somewhere, I know, on that unseen shore, 
 
 They watch and beckon and wait for me. 
 
 4. And I sit and think, when the sunset's gold 
 
 Is flushing river and hill and shore, 
 I shall one day stand by the water cold 
 
 And list to the sound of the boatman's oar. 
 I shall catch a gleam of the snowy sail, 
 
 I shall hear the boat as it nears the strand, 
 I shall pass with the boatman cold and pale 
 
 To the better shore of the spirit-land. 
 I shall know the loved who have gone before, 
 
 And joyfully sweet will the meeting be 
 When over the river, the peaceful river, 
 
 The angel of Death shall carry me.

 LESSON LII. 
 
 EMPHASIS. 
 
 Emphasis is special prominence given to words and 
 phrases. This may be done by an increase or decrease 
 of Force, a change of Stress, Form, Quality, Pitch, or 
 Movement, or a change in the combination of two or 
 more of these elements. The kind and degree of 
 Emphasis can be determined only by the speaker and 
 the sentiment. Two persons may emphasize the same 
 sentiment in an entirely different way and yet both be 
 correct. 
 
 " Emphasis is to speech what coloring is to painting." 
 It admits of all possible degrees and must, to indicate a 
 particular degree of distinction, be mild or intense, 
 according to the ground-work or general utterance of 
 the discourse. 
 
 Emphasis of Force. 
 
 Emphasis of Force is the utterance of certain words 
 or phrases with an increase or decrease of the prevail- 
 ing force. 
 
 This style of Emphasis is usually employed in 
 unimpassioned discourse to direct special attention to 
 certain words' and phrases. 
 
 Exercises in Emphasis of Force. 
 
 1. I come not here to talk. 
 
 2. Study to show thyself a man. 
 
 3. Ignorance is the mother of error. 
 
 4. The repose of the soul is exercise, not rest.

 The Painter of Seville. 
 
 SUSAN WILSON. 
 
 'Twas morning in Seville ; and brightly beamed 
 The early sunlight in one chamber there ; 
 
 Showing where'er its glowing radiance gleamed, 
 Rich, varied beauty. 'Twas the study where 
 
 Murillo, the famed painter, came to share, 
 With young aspirants, his long-cherished art, 
 
 To prove how vain must be the teacher's care, 
 Who strives his unbought knowledge to impart, 
 The language of the soul, the feeling of the heart. 
 
 The pupils came, and glancing round, 
 Mendez upon his canvas found, 
 Not his own work of yesterday, 
 But, glowing in the morning ray, 
 A sketch, so rich, so pure, so bright, 
 
 It almost seemed that there were given 
 To glow before his dazzled sight, 
 
 Tints and expression warm from heaven. 
 'Twas but a sketch the Virgin's head 
 Yet was unearthly beauty shed 
 Upon the mildly beaming face ; 
 The lip, the eye, the flowing hair, 
 Had separate, yet blended grace 
 
 A poet's brightest dream was there ! 
 
 Murillo entered, and amazed, 
 
 On the mysterious painting gazed ; 
 
 " Whose work is this? speak, tell me! he 
 
 Who to his aid such power can call," 
 Exclaimed the teacher eagerly, 
 " Will yet be master of us all ; 
 18

 Would I had done it ! Ferdinand ! 
 Isturitz ! Mendez ! say, whose hand 
 Among ye all?" With half -breathed sigh, 
 Each pupil answered, " 'Twas not I! " 
 
 "How came it then?" impatiently 
 Murillo cried; " but we shall see, 
 Erelong into this mystery. 
 Sebastian ! " 
 
 At the summons came 
 
 A bright-eyed slave, 
 Who trembled at the stern rebuke 
 
 His master gave. 
 For, ordered in that room to sleep, 
 And faithful guard o'er all to keep, 
 Murillo bade him now declare 
 What rash intruder had been there, 
 And threatened if he did not tell 
 The truth at once the dungeon-cell. 
 
 "Thou answerest not," Murillo said; 
 (The boy had stood in speechless fear.) 
 
 "Speak on! " At last he raised his head 
 And murmured, "No one has been here." 
 " 'Tis false ! " Sebastian bent his knee, 
 
 And clasped his hands imploringly, 
 And said, "I swear it, none but me!" 
 
 1 ' List ! " said his master. ' ' I would know 
 Who enters here there have been found 
 Before, rough sketches strewn around, 
 
 By whose bold hand, 'tis yours to show; 
 See that to-night strict watch you keep, 
 Nor dare to close your eyes in sleep. 
 
 If on to-morrow morn you fail 
 To answer what I ask, 
 
 The lash shall force you do you hear? 
 Hence! to your daily task."

 Twas midnight in Seville ; and faintly shone 
 
 From one small lamp, a dim uncertain ray 
 Within Murillo's study all were gone 
 
 Who there, in pleasant tasks or converse gay, 
 Passed cheerfully the morning hours away. 
 
 'Twas shadowy gloom, and breathless silence, save, 
 That to sad thoughts and torturing fear a prey, 
 
 One bright-eyed boy was there Murillo's little slave. 
 
 Almost a child that boy had seen 
 
 Not thrice five summers yet, 
 But genius marked the lofty brow, 
 
 O'er which his locks of jet 
 Profusely curled ; his cheek's dark hue 
 Proclaimed the warm blood flowing through 
 Each throbbing vein, a mingled tide, 
 To Africa and Spain allied. 
 
 "Alas! what fate is mine!" he said, 
 
 "The lash, if I refuse to tell 
 Who sketched those figures if I do, 
 
 Perhaps e'en more the dungeon-cell! " 
 He breathed a prayer to Heaven for aid ; 
 It came for soon in slumber laid, 
 He slept, until the dawning day 
 Shed on his humble couch its ray. 
 
 "I'll sleep no more! " he cried; "and now 
 
 Three hours of freedom I may gain, 
 Before my master comes ; for then 
 
 I shall be but a slave again. 
 Three hours of blessed freedom ! how 
 Shall I employ them? ah! e'en now 
 The figure on that canvas traced 
 Must be yes, it must be effaced." 
 
 He seized a brush the morning light 
 
 Gave to the head a softened glow ; 
 Gazing enraptured on the sight, 
 
 He cried, " Shall I efface it? No ! 
 That breathing lip ! that burning eye ! 
 Efface them? I would rather die! " 
 


## p. 276 (#280) ############################################

276 Science of Elocution. 
 
 The terror of the humble slave 
 
 Gave place to the o'erpowering flow 
 Of the high feelings nature gave 
 
 Which only gifted spirits know. 
 He touched the brow the lip it seemed 
 
 His pencil had some magic power ; 
 The eye with deeper feeling beamed 
 
 Sebastian then forgot the hour ! 
 Forgot his master, and the threat 
 
 Of punishment still hanging o'er him ; 
 For, with each touch, new beauties met 
 
 And mingled in the face before him. 
 
 At length 'twas finished ; rapturously 
 He gazed could aught more beauteous be !- 
 Awhile absorbed, entranced he stood, 
 Then started horror chilled his blood ! 
 His master and the pupils all 
 
 Were there e'en at his side ! 
 The terror stricken slave was mute 
 
 Mercy would be denied, 
 E'en could he ask it so he deemed, 
 And the poor boy half lifeless seemed. 
 
 Speechless, bewildered for a space 
 They gazed upon that perfect face, 
 
 Each with an artist's joy ; 
 At length Murillo silence broke, 
 And with affected sternness spoke 
 
 " Who is your master, boy? " 
 " You, senor," said the trembling slave. 
 " Nay, who, I mean, instruction gave, 
 Before that Virgin's head you drew? " 
 Again he answered, " Only you." 
 u I gave you none," Murillo cried I 
 " But I have heard," the boy replied, 
 
 "What you to others said." 
 "And more than heard," in kinder tone, 
 The painter said ; " tis plainly shown 
 
 That you have profited."

 " What (to his pupils) is his meed? 
 
 Reward or punishment? " 
 "Reward, reward! " they warmly cried. 
 
 (Sebastian's ear was bent 
 To catch the sounds he scarce believed, 
 But with imploring look received.) 
 " What shall it be? " They spoke of gold 
 
 And of a splendid dress ; 
 But still unmoved Sebastian stood, 
 
 Silent and motionless. 
 
 " Speak ! " said Murillo, kindly ; " choose 
 
 Your own reward what shall it be? 
 Name what you wish, I'll not refuse : 
 
 Then speak at once and fearlessly." 
 "01 if I dared ! "Sebastian knelt, 
 
 And feelings he could not control, 
 (But feared to utter even then) 
 
 With strong emotion, shook his soul. 
 
 11 Courage ! " his master said, and each 
 Essayed, in kind, half- whispered speech, 
 To soothe his overpowering dread. 
 He scarcely heard, till some one said, 
 
 "Sebastian ask you have your choice, 
 Ask for your freedom ! " At the word, 
 
 The suppliant strove to raise his voice : 
 At first but stifled sobs were heard, 
 And then his prayer breathed fervently 
 
 " O ! master, make my father free ! " 
 "Him and thyself, my noble boy! " 
 
 Warmly the painter cried ; 
 Raising Sebastian from his feet, 
 
 He pressed him to his side. 
 "Thy talents rare, and filial love, 
 
 E'en more have fairly won ; 
 Still be thou mine by other bonds 
 
 My pupil and my son."

 Murillo knew, e'en when the words 
 
 Of generous feeling passed his lips, 
 Sebastian's talents soon must lead 
 
 To fame, that would his own eclipse ; 
 And constant to his purpose still, 
 
 He joyed to see his pupil gain, 
 Beneath his care, such matchless skill 
 
 As made his name the pride of Spain.

 LESSON LITE. 
 
 PAUSES. 
 
 Pauses are suspensions of the voice between words and 
 sentences. No definite rules can be given to guide the 
 reader or speaker in the use of Pauses. Their length 
 and frequency can be determined only by the sen- 
 timent. 
 
 Unimpassioned, didactic thought demands but mod- 
 ate Pauses ; gay, lively, and joyous thought, very short 
 Pauses ; solemnity, sublimity, grandeur, and reverence, 
 long Pauses ; while impassioned thought may demand 
 long or short Pauses. 
 


## p. 279 (#283) ############################################

Pauses. 279 
 
 A Pause should always be made before and after an 
 emphatic word. 
 
 It will hardly be necessary to say that the marks of 
 punctuation do not indicate the rhetorical Pauses. 
 They may or may not harmonize. 
 
 EXAMPLE: JOYOUS THOUGHT. 
 
 Very Short Pauses, Expulsive and Explosive Forms, Pure Tone, Ener-

 Mercutio's Description of Queen Mab. 
 
 SHAKESPEARE. 
 
 O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you ! 
 
 She comes 
 In shape no bigger than an agate stone 
 On the forefinger of an alderman, 
 Drawn by a team of little atomies 
 Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep : 
 Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs ; 
 The cover of the wings of grasshoppers ; 
 The traces of the smallest spider's web; 
 The collars of the moonshine's watery beams ; 
 Her whip of cricket's bone ; the lash of film ; 
 Her wagoner a small gray-coated gnat, 
 Not half so big as a round little worm 
 Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid ; 
 Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, 
 Made by the joiner squirrel, or old grub, 
 Time out of mind the fairies' coach-makers. 
 And in this state she gallops night by night 
 Through lover's brains, and then they dream of love; 
 On courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight. 
 O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees ; 
 O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream. 
 Sometimes she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, 
 And then dreams he of smelling out a suit; 
 And sometimes comes she with a tithe-pig's tail, 
 Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep, 
 Then dreams he of another benefice ;

 Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, 
 And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, 
 Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, 
 And healths five fathoms deep ; and then anon 
 Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes ; 
 And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two, 
 And sleeps again.

 Hamlet's Soliloquy. 
 
 SHAKESPEARE. 
 
 To be, or not to be : that is the question : 
 
 Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer 
 
 The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, 
 
 Or to take arms against a sea of troubles, 
 
 And, by opposing, end them? To die; to sleep; 
 
 No more : and, by a sleep, to say we end 
 
 The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks 
 
 That flesh is heir to 'tis a consummation 
 
 Devoutly to be wished. To die ; to sleep ; 
 
 To sleep ! perchance to dream ; ay, there's the rub ; 
 
 For in that sleep of death what dreams may come, 
 
 When we have shuffled off this mortal coil, 
 
 Must give us pause. There's the respect, 
 
 That makes calamity of so long life : 
 
 For who would bear the whips and scorns of time, 
 
 The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely, 
 
 The pangs of despised love, the law's delay, 
 
 The insolence of office, and the spurns 
 
 That patient merit of the unworthy takes, 
 
 When he himself might his quietus make 
 
 With a bare bodkin? Who'd these fardels bear, 
 
 To grunt and sweat under a weary life, 
 
 But that the dread of something after death 
 
 The undiscovered country, from whose bourn 
 
 No traveler returns puzzles the will, 
 
 And makes us rather bear those ills we have,

 Than fly to others that we know not of? 
 Thus conscience does make cowards of us all ; 
 And thus the native hue of resolution 
 Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought ; 
 And enterprises of great pith and moment, 
 With this regard, their currents turn awry, 
 And lose the name of action. 
 
 Questions. 
 
 1. What are Pauses ? 
 
 2. What rules can be given for our guidance in their use ?

 CLIMAX. 
 Climax is an utterance gradually increasing in Force, 
 rising in Pitch, and increasing the rate of Movement, 
 Sometimes a Climax will be reached by lowering the 
 Pitch or changing the Quality, increasing the Force, 
 and reducing the rate of Movement.

 living light, blazing on all its ample folds, as they

 7. I scorn to count what feelings, withered hopes, 
 strong provocations, bitter, burning wrongs, I have 
 within my heart's hot cells shut up to leave you in 
 your lazy dignities. 
 
 LESSON LV. 
 
 ACTION. 
 
 Though it is not the object of this volume to give 
 instruction on Action or Attitude, yet it may be well 
 to present some suggestions on the position and move- 
 ments of the hands and arm in gesture, and some hints 
 on the expression of countenance in the illustration of 
 the emotions and passions. 
 
 Action embraces all that part of delivery which ad- 
 dresses itself to the eye as distinguished from the voice, 
 which appeals alone to the ear. It has always been con- 
 sidered an essential part of expression. Among the 
 ancients Action was regarded as even more important 
 than Vocal Utterance. It was a question in Rome 
 whether Cicero could express more by his voice than 
 


## p. 283 (#287) ############################################

Action. 283 
 
 Roscius could by his action. Demosthenes gave 
 Action as the first, second, and third qualifications for 
 an orator* Action is nature's language of expression, 
 it is the spontaneous utterance of the heart, the true 
 revelation of the soul. The voice may be trained to 
 deceive, words framed to disguise or conceal our 
 thoughts, but the glance of the eye, the movement of 
 the hand, the shrug of the shoulder, reveal our real 
 feelings. 
 
 Action is a universal language, it is the same among 
 all nations, understood by all peoples. It has survived 
 the confounding of tongues, it admits of no idiom, and 
 is not marred by accent or brogue. The joyous greet- 
 ing is the same with the Malay as the American. The 
 savage understands the expression of anger as well as 
 the civilized. The infant recognizes the mother's 
 smile as quickly as the sage. Nature teaches us to use 
 this language when influenced by emotion or passion, 
 but art must be summoned when we wish to express a 
 passion we do not feel. The school-boy on the play- 
 ground can express anger which he feels better than 
 Booth on the stage that which he does not feel ; the 
 mother, in her bereavement, illustrates grief better than 
 Mary Anderson in the play ; but it requires the genius 
 of a Booth or an Anderson, cultured by art, to portray 
 the passions they do not feel. Action is a most express- 
 ive language. It is impossible to translate a look, a 
 gesture, an attitude, into words. The eye defies more 
 than the tongue the lip scorns more than language 
 the hand repels as words cannot. 
 
 Positions of the Hand. 
 The expressiveness of Gesture depends largely on the 
 hand. Next to the tones of the voice and the expres- 
 


## p. 284 (#288) ############################################

284 Science of Elocution. 
 
 sions of countenance, the hand has the greatest variety 
 and power of expression. Sheridan says : " Every one 
 knows that with the hands we can demand or promise, 
 call, dismiss, threaten, supplicate, ask, deny, show joy, 
 sorrow, detestation, fear, confession, penitence, admira- 
 tion, respect, and many other things now in common use." 
 
 The hand is prone when the palm is turned downward. 
 
 It is supine when the palm is turned upward. 
 
 It is vertical when the plane of the palm is perpen- 
 dicular to the horizon, the fingers pointing upward. 
 
 The natural state of the fingers, when the arm is 
 hanging freely by the side, or employed in unimpas- 
 sioned gesture, is that in which the hand is fully open, 
 with the forefinger nearly straight, and slightly separat- 
 ed from the middle finger ; the middle finger is more 
 bent, and rests partly on the third finger, which it 
 gently touches ; the little finger is still more bent, and 
 slightly separated from the third finger ; the thumb is 
 withdrawn about an inch from the palm, and so placed 
 that a line from the top of it will be a little above the 
 line of the forefinger. 
 
 Gesture. 
 
 The position of the hand, as regards the palm, most 
 suitable to be adopted by the public speaker in unim 
 passioned gesticulation, is that which presents an incli 
 nation from the supine of an angle of forty-five degrees 
 and accompanied with a slight bend of the wrist down 
 ward, in the direction of the little finger. 
 
 In emphatic or impassioned Gesture, the hand may 
 be closed as it is brought down. 
 
 Positions of the Arms in Repose. 
 When the arms are not employed in Gesture they 
 should hang naturally by the side. 
 


## p. 285 (#289) ############################################

Gesture. 285 
 
 This position, however, too long sustained, becomes 
 tiresome and monotonous, and requires change. Where 
 the circumstances are favorable the left hand may rest 
 gently on a table or stand, the fingers may be placed 
 between the buttons of the vest, or occasionally the 
 left arm may be thrown behind the body. In various 
 ways, the eye of the audience as well as the monotony 
 of the position may be relieved by a nice adjustment 
 of the body and arms. 
 
 Positions and Movement of the Arms in Gesture. 
 
 First. In gesticulation, the arm should be free and 
 unconstrained, the action proceeding from the shoulder 
 rather than the elbow. The elbow should be slightly 
 curved and flexible. 
 
 Second. The arm should be so moved that the hand 
 will always describe curved lines instead of those which 
 are straight and angular, except in the expression of 
 the malignant passions when the hand moves in straight 
 lines and the arm illustrates angles. The curve is the 
 line of beauty, and grace in the action of the arm 
 depends materially on the observance of this principle. 
 
 Tliird. The arm should not remain stationary even 
 for a moment while out in gesticulation. It should 
 either be kept moving preparatory to another gesture, 
 or return to the side. 
 
 Fourth. Gestures ordinarily should not be made at 
 a greater angle than forty-five degrees back from a 
 horizontal line passing directly forward from the center 
 of the breast. 
 
 Fifth. The ease and grace of the motion of the arm 
 and hand will depend on the free use of the joints of 
 the shoulder, elbow, and wrist. Without the free use 
 of the wrist-joint there can be no grace: 
 


## p. 286 (#290) ############################################

286 Science of Elocution. 
 
 Sixth. Preference in gesticulation should be given 
 to the right arm. As a general rule, when the right 
 hand is employed in Gesture, the weight of the body 
 should be on the left foot, the right advanced. 
 
 Seventh. Every act of gesture consists of two parts : 
 preparation and termination. The former is the pre- 
 liminary movement that is, the elevation of the 
 hand before it is brought down the latter for which 
 the Gesture is made. In emphatic gesticulation this 
 will be upon the word that demands the Gesture and 
 just at the instant of the utterance of the accented part 
 of the word. The expression of it will just a little pre- 
 cede the vocal utterance. 
 
 Qualities of Gesture. 
 
 The Qualities on which excellence of gesture depends 
 are Simplicity, Propriety, Boldness, Variety, Grace. 
 
 1. Simplicity of Gesture is a perfectly free and seem- 
 ingly unstudied movement. It appears to be the natural 
 result of the situation and sentiments of the speaker. 
 
 Propriety of Gesture is an obvious connection between 
 the sentiment and action ; it is the use of such gestures 
 as are best suited to the sentiments and emotions. Di- 
 dactic thought will require mild gestures, argumentative 
 utterance, bolder and more forcible, impassioned feel- 
 ing, violent action. 
 
 Holdness of Gesture is the firmness and decision of 
 the action the striking and unexpected movements and 
 transitions. 
 
 Variety of Gesture is a frequent change of action so 
 as to avoid the too frequent recurrence of the same 
 Gesture or even the same set of Gestures. 
 
 Grace of Gesture is that easy, poetic movement 
 of hand and arm, free from angles, jars, and 
 


## p. 287 (#291) ############################################

Gesture. 287 
 
 discords. It is the embodiment of nature in art, that 
 which is exhibited in the movement of every blade of 
 grass, of every field of ripening grain, of every floating 
 cloud and rolling wave. 
 
 Accompaniments op Gesture, 
 the body and countenance. 
 The movement of the hands and arms, however per- 
 fect, will not of themselves be sufficient. The head, 
 the body, the lower limbs, and even the expression of 
 countenance, must be in harmony with the Gesture. If 
 they remain unmoved and unexecuted, the action of 
 the hands and arms will be simply that of a well con- 
 trived automaton. But with all the physical powers 
 in harmony with the voice there will be nothing want- 
 ing for the impressive expression of thought and feeling. 
 
 Significant Gestures, 
 the head and face.

 THE ARMS. 
 
 The placing of the hand on the head indicates pain 
 or distress. 
 
 On the eyes, shame or sorrow. 
 
 On the lips, an injunction of silence. 
 
 On the breast, an appeal to conscience. 
 
 The hand is waved or flourished in joy or contempt. 
 
 Both hands are held supine, or they are applied or 
 clasped in prayer. 
 
 Both are held prone in blessing. 
 
 They are clasped or wrung in affliction. 
 
 They are held forward and received in friendship. 
 
 THE BODY. 
 
 The body, held erect, indicates steadiness and cour- 
 age. 
 
 Thrown back, pride. 
 
 Stooping forward, condescension or compassion. 
 
 Bending, reverence or respect. 
 
 Prostrate, the utmost humility or abasement. 
 
 THE LOWER LIMBS. 
 
 The firm position of the lower limbs signifies cour- 
 age or obstinacy. 
 
 Bended knees indicate timidity or weakness. 
 
 The lower limbs advance in desire or courage. 
 
 They retire in aversion or fear. 
 
 Start, in terror. 
 
 Stamp, in authority or anger. 
 
 Kneel, in submission and prayer. 
 
 These are a few of the simple Gestures which may be 
 termed significant. 
 
 THE COUNTENANCE. 
 
 The countenance has the greatest power of expres- 
 sion. With it we supplicate, we threaten, we soothe,

Gesture. 289 
 
 we rouse, we rejoice, we mourn, we triumph, we 
 express submission. Upon the countenance the au- 
 dience hangs, upon it their eyes are fixed. They ex- 
 amine and study the face, and often, before a word is 
 spoken, they are impressed favorably or unfavorably. 
 " Whitefield's face was, as it were, a canvas upon which 
 he painted every passion that stirs the human heart. It 
 was at one moment terrific, as if all the Furies were 
 enthroned on that dark brow ; the next, as by a dis- 
 solving view, there would come forth a sweetness that 
 savored of heaven itself." 
 
 THE EYE. 
 
 The eye is the most expressive of all the features. Its 
 power is so great that it determines in a great degree 
 the expression of the whole countenance. Through it 
 the soul makes its most clear and vivid manifesta- 
 tions. Joy, grief, anger, love, hatred, affection, pity, 
 contempt, all the passions, all the emotions of the 
 human heart, express themselves with the utmost power 
 in the eye. Even the lower animals recognize and 
 acknowledge its power. The dog watches his master's 
 eye and learns from it whether to expect a caress or 
 chastisement. The lion quails beneath the steady glare 
 of the human eve. 
 
 The orator should avail himself of this power and 
 keep his eye fixed upon the audience. He should not 
 allow it to wander from his audience, except when by a 
 glance he indicates the direction of a Gesture.

 LESSON LVI. 
 
 THE PASSIONS. 
 
 It now remains to say something of those expressions 
 of countenance which indicate the passions and emotions 
 of the speaker. A full description of each would far 
 transcend the bounds of a work of this kind. Only a 
 few can be noticed, and these but briefly. 
 
 " It should be remarked in passing that feeling cannot 
 be expressed by words alone, or even by the tones of the 
 voice. It finds its best, and oftentimes its only, expres- 
 sion in the flash of passion on the cheek, in the speak- 
 ing eye, the contracted brow, the compressed lip, the 
 heaving breast, the trembling frame, in the rigid muscle 
 and the general bearing of the entire body; and whefi

The Passions. 291 
 
 emotion or passion thus speaks, its language is often 
 confined to no particular part of the body, but the 
 living frame as a whole sympathizes in the action." 
 
 TRANQUILLITY. 
 
 Tranquillity appears by the composure of the counte- 
 nance and general repose of the whole body, without 
 the exertion of any one muscle. The countenance open, 
 the forehead smooth, the eyebrows arched, the mouth 
 not quite shut, and the eyes passing with an easy mo- 
 tion from object to object, but not dwelling long upon 
 
 any one. 
 
 Night. 
 
 SHELLEY 
 
 How beautiful this night ! The balmiest sigh, 
 
 Which vernal zephyrs breathe in Evening's ear, 
 
 Were discord to the speaking quietude 
 
 That wraps this moveless scene. Heaven's ebon vault, 
 
 Studded with stars unutterably bright, 
 
 Through which the moon's unclouded grandeur rolls, 
 
 Seems like a canopy which love has spread 
 
 To curtain her sleeping world. Yon gentle hills, 
 
 Robed in a garment of untrodden snow ; 
 
 Yon darksome rocks, whence icicles depend 
 
 So stainless, that their white and glittering spires 
 
 Tinge not the moon's pure beam ; yon castled steep, 
 
 Whose banner hangeth o'er the time-worn tower 
 
 So idly, that rapt fancy deemeth it 
 
 A metaphor of peace ; all form a scene 
 
 Where musing solitude might love to lift 
 
 Her soul above this sphere of earthlinesss; 
 
 Where silence, undisturbed, might watch alone, 
 
 So cold, so bright, so still. 
 
 CHEERFULNESS. 
 
 When joy is settled into a habit, or flows from a 
 placid temper of mind, desiring to please and be pleased, 
 it is called gayety, good humor, or cheerfulness. Cheer'

 fulness adds a smile to tranquillity, and opens the mouth 
 a little more. 
 
 Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile, 
 Hath not old custom made this life more sweet 
 Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods 
 More free from peril than the envious court? 
 Here feel we but the penalty of Adam, 
 The season's difference ; as the icy fang 
 And churlish chiding of the winter's wind, 
 Which, when it bites and blows upon my body 
 Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say, 
 This is no flattery ; these are counselors 
 That feelingly persuade me what I am. 
 Sweet are the uses of adversity, 
 That like a toad, ugly and venomous, 
 Wears yet a precious jewel in its head ; 
 And this our life exempt from public haunts, 
 Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks, 
 Sermons in stones, and good in every thing. 
 
 As You Like It. 
 
 MIRTH. 
 
 When joy arises from ludicrous or fugitive amuse- 
 ments in which others share with us it is called merri- 
 ment or mirth. 
 
 Mirth or laughter opens the mouth horizontally, raises 
 the cheeks high, lessens the aperture of the eyes, and, 
 when violent, shakes and convulses the whole frame, 
 fills the eyes with tears, and causes holding the sides 
 from the pain the convulsive laughter gives them. 
 
 Jaq. A fool, a fool 1 I met a fool i' the forest, 
 A motley fool ; a miserable world ! 
 As I do live by food, I met a fool ; 
 Who laid him down and basked him in the sun, 
 And railed on Lady Fortune, in good terms, 
 In good set terms, and yet a motley fool. 
 "Good-morrow, fool," quoth I: "No, sir," quoth he, 
 "Oall me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune."

 And then he drew a dial from his poke : 
 
 And looking on it with lack-luster eye, 
 
 Says, very wisely, " It is ten o'clock. 
 
 Thus may we see," quoth he, "how the world wags. 
 
 'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine, 
 
 And after an hour more 'twill be eleven ; 
 
 And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe, 
 
 And then from hour to hour we rot and rot, 
 
 And thereby hangs a tale." "When I did hear 
 
 The motley fool thus moral on the time, 
 
 My lungs began to crow like chanticleer, 
 
 That fools should be so deep contemplative ; 
 
 And I did laugh, sans intermission, 
 
 An hour by his dial. O noble fool ! 
 
 A worthy fool ! Motley's the only wear. 
 
 JOY. 
 
 A pleasing elation of mind on the actual or assured 
 attainment of good, or deliverance from evil, is called 
 
 joy- 
 Joy, when moderate, opens the countenance with 
 smiles, and throws, as it were, a sunshine of delectation 
 over the whole frame. When it is sudden and violent 
 it expresses itself by clapping the hands, raising the 
 eyes toward heaven, and giving such a spring to the 
 body as to make it attempt to mount up as if it could 
 fly. When joy is extreme, and goes into transport, 
 rapture, and ecstasy, it has a wildness of look and gest- 
 ure that borders on folly, madness, and sorrow. 
 
 Joy Expected. 
 Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy 
 Be heaped like mine, and that thy skill be more 
 To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath 
 This neighbor air, and let rich Music's tongue 
 Unfold the imagined happiness that both 
 Receive in either by this dear encounter. 
 
 Romeo and Juliet. 
 


## p. 294 (#298) ############################################

 Joy Approaching to Transport. 
 O! Joy, thou welcome stranger, twice three years 
 I have not felt my vital beam, but now 
 It warms my veins, and plays about my heart; 
 A fiery instinct lifts me from the ground, 
 And I could mount. Dr. Young 's Revenge. 
 
 PITY. 
 
 Pity is benevolence to the afflicted. It is a mixture 
 of love for an object that suffers, and a grief that we 
 are not able to remove those sufferings. It shows itself 
 in a compassionate tenderness of voice, a feeling of pain 
 in the countenance, and a gentle raising and falling of 
 the hands and eyes, as if mourning over the unhappy 
 object. The mouth is open, the eyebrows are drawn 
 down, and the features contracted or drawn together. 
 
 Pity for a Departed Friend. 
 Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio; a fellow of infi- 
 nite jest, of most excellent fancy. He hath borne me on his 
 back a thousand times, and now how abhorred in my imagi- 
 nation it is; my gorge rises at it. Here hung those lips that I 
 have kissed I know not how oft. Where be your gibes now? 
 your gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment, that 
 were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one now to mock 
 your own grinning! Quite chop-fallen ! Now get thee to my 
 lady's chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thick, to 
 this favor she must come; make her laugh at that. Hamlet. 
 
 HOPE. 
 
 Hope is a mixture of desire and joy agitating the 
 mind and anticipating its enjoyment. It erects and 
 brightens the countenance, spreads the arms and hands 
 open as to receive the object of its wishes. The voice 
 is plaintive and inclined to eagerness, the breath drawn 
 inward more forcibly than usual in order to express our 
 desire more strongly, and our earnest expectation of 
 receiving the object of them. 
 


## p. 295 (#299) ############################################

The Passions. 
 
 Collins, in his " Ode on the Passions," gives us a 
 beautiful picture of 
 
 But thou, O Hope ! with eyes so fair, 
 
 What was thy delighted measure? 
 
 Still it whispered promised pleasure, 
 And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail. 
 
 Still would her touch the strain prolong, 
 And from the rocks, the woods, the vale, 
 
 She called on Echo still through all her song ; 
 And, where her sweetest theme she chose, 
 A soft responsive voice was heard at every close, 
 And Hope, enchanted, smiled, and waved her golden hair. 
 
 Hatred or Aversion draws back the body as if to 
 avoid the hated object, the hands at the same time 
 thrown outspread as if to keep it off. The face is 
 turned away from that side toward which the hands are 
 thrown out, the eyes looking angrily and obliquely the 
 same way the hands are directed; the eyebrows are 
 contracted, the upper lip disdainfully drawn up, and 
 the teeth set ; the pitch of the voice is low, but loud 
 and harsh, the tone chiding, unequal, surly, and vehe- 
 ment. 
 
 Hatred and Rtvenge. 
 How like a fawning publican he looks' 
 I hate him, for he is a Christian : 
 But more, for that in low simplicity, 
 He lends out money gratis, and brings down 
 The rate of usance here with us in Venice : 
 If I can catch him once upon the hip, 
 I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him. 
 He hates our sacred nation ; and he rails, 
 Even there where merchants most do congregate, 
 On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift, 
 Which he calls interest ; Cursed be my tribe, 
 If I forgive him ! Merchant of F

 Hatred Cursing the Object Bated. 
 Poison be their drink, 
 Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest meat they taste : 
 Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress-trees, 
 Their sweetest prospects murdering basilisks, 
 Their softest touch as smart as lizards' stings, 
 Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss, 
 And boding screech-owls make the concert full ; 
 All the foul terrors of dark-seated hell. Henry VI. 
 
 ANGER, RAGE, FURY. 
 
 When hatred and displeasure rise high suddenly from 
 an apprehension of injury received, and perturbation of 
 mind in consequence of it, it is called anger ; and ris- 
 ing to a very high degree, and extinguishing humanity, 
 it becomes rage and fury. 
 
 Anger, when violent, expresses itself with rapidity, 
 noise, harshness, and sometimes with interruption and 
 hesitation, as if unable to utter itself with sufficient 
 force. It wrinkles the brow, enlarges and heaves the 
 nostrils, strains the muscles, clenches the fist, stamps 
 with the foot, and gives a violent agitation to the whole 
 body. The voice assumes the highest tone it can adopt 
 consistently with force and loudness, though some- 
 times, to express anger with uncommon energy, the 
 voice assumes a low and forcible tone. 
 Anger and Scorn. 
 
 Thou den of drunkards with the blood of princes ! 
 
 Gehenna of the waters ! thou sea Sodom ! 
 
 Thus I devote thee to the infernal gods ! 
 
 Thee and thy serpent seed! Slave, do thine office! 
 
 Strike as I struck the foe ! Strike as I would 
 
 Have struck those tyrants ! Strike deep as my curse ! 
 
 Strike, and but once. 
 
 Scorn and Violent Anger, Reproving. 
 Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle ; 
 I am no traitor's uncle ; and that word grace,

 In an ungracious mouth is but profane, 
 
 Why have those banished and forbidden legs 
 
 Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground ? 
 
 But more than why why have they dared to march 
 
 So many miles upon her peaceful bosom ; 
 
 Frightening her pale-faced villages with war, 
 
 And ostentation of despised arms? 
 
 Comest thou because the anointed king is hence? 
 
 Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind, 
 
 And in my loyal bosom lies his power. 
 
 Were I but now the lord of such hot youth 
 
 As when, brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself 
 
 Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men, 
 
 From forth the ranks of many thousand French ; 
 
 O, then, how quickly should this arm of mine, 
 
 Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee, 
 
 And minister correction to thy fault ! Richard II. 
 
 REVENGE. 
 
 Revenge is a propensity and endeavor to injure the 
 offender, which is attended with triumph and exulta- 
 tion when the injury is accomplished. It expresses 
 itself like malice, but more openly, loudly, and tri- 
 umphantly. 
 
 Eager Revenge. 
 
 O I could play the woman with mine eyes, 
 
 And braggart with my tongue ! But, gentle heaven, 
 
 Cut short all intermission : front to front, 
 
 Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself ; 
 
 Within my sword's length set him : if he 'scape, 
 
 Heaven forgive him too ! Macbeth. 
 
 Intense Revenge. 
 If it will feed nothing else, it will feed my revenge. He 
 hath disgraced me, and hindered me of half a million : laughed 
 at my losses, mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, 
 thwarted my bargains, cooled my friends, heated my enemies ; 
 and what's his reason ? I am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes ? 
 hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affection*.

 passions ? fed with the same food, hurt with the same weap- 
 ons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, 
 warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as a 
 Christian is ? If you prick us, do we not bleed ? If you 
 tickle us, do we not laugh ? If you poison us, do we not die? 
 and if you wrong us, shall we not revenge ? If we are like 
 you in the rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong 
 a Christian, what is his humility ? revenge ! If a Christian 
 wrong a Jew what should his sufferance be by Christian 
 example ? why, revenge ! The villainy you teach me, I will 
 execute, and it shall go hard, but I will better the instruction. 
 Merchant of Venice. 
 
 BEPEOACH. 
 
 Reproach is settled anger or hatred, chastising the 
 object of dislike by casting in his teeth the severest 
 censures upon his imperfections or misconduct. The 
 brow is contracted, the lip turned up with scorn, the 
 head shaken, the voice low, as if abhorring, and the 
 whole body expressive of aversion. 
 
 Reproaching with Want of Friendship. 
 You have done that you should be sorry for. 
 There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats ; 
 For I am armed so strong in honesty, 
 That they pass me by as the idle wind 
 Which I respect not. I did send to you 
 For certain sums of gold, which you denied me. 
 For I can raise no money by vile means : 
 By heaven, I had rather coin my heart, 
 And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring 
 From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash 
 By any indirection. I did send 
 To you for gold to pay my legions, 
 Which you denied me. Was that done like Cassius ? 
 Should I have answered Caius Cassius so ? 
 When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous, 
 To lock such rascal counters from his friends, 
 Be ready, gods, with all your thunder-bolts, 
 Dash him to pieces !

 Reproach with Want of Courage and Spirit. 
 
 Thou slave ! thou wretch ! thou coward ! 
 Thou little valiant, great in villainy ! 
 Thou ever strong upon the stronger side ! 
 Thou fortune's champion, thou dost never fight 
 But when her humorous ladyship is by 
 To teach thee safety ! Thou art perjured, too, 
 And sooth'st up greatness. What a fool art thou, 
 A ramping fool, to brag, and stamp, and sweat, 
 Upon my party ! Thou cold-blooded slave, 
 Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side ? 
 Been sworn my soldier ? bidding me depend 
 Upon thy stars, thy fortune, and thy strength ? 
 And dost thou now fall over to my foes ? 
 Thou wear'st a lion's hide. Doff it for shame, 
 And hang a calf's skin on those recreant limbs. 
 
 FEAR AND TERROR. 
 
 Fear is a mixture of aversion and sorrow, discompos- 
 ing and debilitating the mind upon the approach or an- 
 ticipation of evil. When this is attended with surprise 
 and much discomposure it grows into terror and con- 
 sternation. 
 
 Fear, violent and sudden, opens wide the eyes and 
 mouth, shortens the nose, gives the countenance an air 
 of wildness, covers it with deadly paleness, draws back 
 the elbows parallel with the sides, lifts up the open 
 hands, with the fingers spread, to the height of the 
 breast, at some distance before it, so as to shield it from 
 the dreadful object. One foot is drawn back behind 
 the other, so that the body seems shrinking from the 
 danger, and putting itself in a posture for flight. The 
 heart beats violently, the breath is quick and short, and 
 the whole body is thrown into a general tremor. The 
 voice is weak and trembling, the sentences are short 
 and the meaning confused and incoherent.

 Terror of Evening and Night Described 
 
 Light thickens; and the crow 
 
 Makes wing to the rooky wood : 
 
 Good things of day begin to droop and drouse; 
 
 While Night's black agents to their prey do rouse, 
 
 Thou marvelest at my words ; but hold thee still ; 
 
 Things bad begun, make strong themselves by ill.

 Fear from a Dreadful Object. 
 Angels and ministers of grace, defend us ! 
 Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damned, 
 Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell, 
 Be thy intents wicked or charitable,

 That I will speak to thee : I'll call thee Hamlet, 
 King, father, royal Dane : O answer me ! 
 Let me not burst in ignorance. Hamlet. 
 
 Fear of Being Discovered in Murder.

 SORROW. 
 
 Sorrow is a painful depression of spirit upon the dep- 
 rivation of good or arrival of evil. When it is silent 
 and thoughtful, it is sadness; when long indulged, so 
 as to prey upon and possess the mind, it becomes habit- 
 ual, and grows into melancholy ; when tossed by hopes 
 and fears, it is distraction ; when these are swallowed up, 
 it settles into despair. 
 
 In moderate sorrow the countenance is dejected, the 
 eyes are cast downward, the arms hang loosely, some- 
 times a little raised, suddenly to fall again; the hands 
 open, the fingers spread, and the voice plaintive, fre-

 quently interrupted by sighs. But when this passion 
 is in excess it distorts the countenance, as if in agonies 
 of pain ; it raises the voice to the loudest complainings, 
 and sometimes even to cries and shrieks ; it wrings the 
 hands, beats the head and breast, tears the hair, and 
 throws itself on the ground, and, like other passions in 
 excess, seems to border on frenzy. 
 
 Sadness. 
 In sooth, I know not why I am so sad. 
 It wearies me ; you say it wearies you : 
 But how I caught it, found it, or came by it, 
 What stuff 'tis made of, whereof 'tis born, 
 I am to learn. 
 
 And such a want- wit sadness makes of me, 
 That I have much ado to know myself. 
 
 Silent Grief. 
 Seems, madam ! nay, it is ; I know not seems. 
 'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother, 
 Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage, 
 No, nor the fruitful river in the eye, 
 Together with all forms, modes, shows of grief, 
 That can denote me truly; these, indeed, seem, 
 For they are actions that a man might play ; 
 But I have that within which passeth show; 
 These but the trappings and the suits of woe. 
 
 SNEER. 
 
 Sneer is ironical approbation, where, with a voice and 
 countenance of mirth somewhat exaggerated, we cast 
 tfie severest censures ; it is hypocritical mirth and good 
 humor, and differs from the real by the satirical tone of 
 voice, look, and gesture which accompany it. 
 
 Satire, Irony. 
 What should I say to you ? Should I not say, 
 1 ' Hath a dog money ? Is it possible 
 A cur can lend three thousand ducats ? " or

 Shall I bend low, and, in a bondman's key, 
 With 'bated breath, and whispering humbleness, 
 Say this, 
 
 "Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last; 
 You spurned me such a day ; another time 
 You called me dog ; and for these courtesies 
 I'll lend you thus much moneys." 
 
 SURPRISE, WONDER, AMAZEMENT, ASTONISHMENT. 
 
 Wonder or amazement opens the eyes and makes 
 them appear very prominent. It sometimes raises them 
 to the skies, but more frequently fixes them on the ob- 
 ject. The mouth is open, and the hands are held up 
 nearly in the attitude of fear. The voice is at first low, 
 but so emphatic that every word is pronounced slowly 
 and with energy. When, by the discovery of some- 
 thing excellent in the object of wonder, the emotion 
 may be called admiration, the eyes are raised, the hands 
 lifted up or clasped together, and the voice elevated 
 with expressions of rapture. 
 
 Surprise at Unexpected Events. 
 
 Gone to be married? gone to swear a peace? 
 
 False blood to false blood joined? gone to be friends? 
 
 Shall Lewis have Blanche, and Blanche those provinces?

 Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again : 
 
 It cannot be ! thou dost but say 'tis so ! 
 
 What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head? 
 
 Why dost thou look so sadly on my son? 
 
 What means that hand upon that breast of thine? 
 
 Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum, 
 
 Like a proud river x>eering o'er his bounds? 
 
 Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words? 
 
 Then speak again ; not all thy former tale, 
 
 But this one word, whether thy tale be true. King John.

 vexation. 
 Vexation, besides expressing itself by the looks, gest- 
 ures, tone, and restlessness of perplexity, adds to these 
 complaint, fretting, and remorse. 
 
 Vexation at Neglecting One's Duty. 
 O what a rogue and peasant slave am I ! 
 Is it not monstrous, that this player here, 
 But in a fiction, in a dream of passion, 
 Could force his soul so to his own conceit, 
 That, from her working, all his visage wann'd ; 
 Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect, 
 A broken voice, and his whole function suiting 
 "With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing? 
 For Hecuba ! 
 
 What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, 
 That he should weep for her? Hamlet. 
 
 SHAME. 
 
 Shame turns away the face from the beholders, 
 covers it with blushes, hangs the head, casts down 
 the eyes, draws down and contracts the eyebrows. It 
 either strikes the person dumb, or, if he attempts to 
 say any thing in his own defense, causes his tongue to 
 falter, confounds his utterance, and puts him upon mak- 
 ing a thousand gestures and grimaces to keep himself in 
 countenance ; all which only heighten his confusion and 
 embarrassment. 
 
 Shame at Being Convicted of a Crime. 
 O my dread lord, 
 I should be guiltier than my guiltiness, 
 To think I can be undiscernible 
 When I perceive your grace, like power divine, 
 Hath looked upon my passes ; then, good prince, 
 No longer session hold upon my shame, 
 But let my trial be mine own confession : 
 Immediate sentence, then, and sequent death, 
 Is all the grace I beg. Measure for Measure.

 gravity. 
 Gravity, or seriousness, as when the mind is fixed, or 
 deliberating on some important subject, smooths the 
 countenance, and gives it an air of melancholy; the eye- 
 brows are lowered, eyes cast downward, the mouth al- 
 most shut, and sometimes a little contracted. The post- 
 ure of the body and limbs is composed, and without 
 much motion; the speech slow and solemn, the tone 
 without much variety. 
 
 Grave Deliberation on War and Peace. 
 Fathers, we once again are met in council: 
 Caesar's approach has summoned us together, 
 And Rome attends her fate from our resolves. 
 How shall we treat this bold aspiring man? 
 Success still follows him and backs his crimes. 
 Pharsalia gave him Rome. Egypt has since 
 Received his yoke, and the whole Nile is Caesar's. 
 Why should I mention Juba's overthrow, 
 Or Scipio's death? Numidia's burning sands 
 Still smoke with blood ; 'tis time we should decree 
 What course to take : our foe advances on us, 
 And envies us even Libya's sultry deserts. 
 Fathers, pronounce your thoughts ; are they still fixed, 
 To hold it out and fight it to the last? 
 Or are your hearts subdued at length, and wrought, 
 By time and ill-success, to a submission? 
 Sempronius, speak. Addisorts Cato. 
 
 Commanding. 
 Commanding requires peremptory air, with a look 
 a little severe or stern. The hand is held out and 
 moved toward the person to whom the order is 
 given, and sometimes it is accompanied by a nod of 
 the head to the person commanded. If the com- 
 mand be absolute, and to a person unwilling to obey,

 toward the person commanded. 
 
 Commanding Combatants to Fight. 
 We were born not to sue, but to command ; 
 Which since we cannot do to make you friends, 
 Be ready, as your lives shall answer it, 
 At Coventry, upon St. Lambert's day ; 
 There shall your swords and lances arbitrate 
 The swelling difference of your settled hate. 
 Since we cannot atone you, you shall see 
 Justice decide the victor's chivalry. 
 Lord Marshal, command our officers at arms 
 Be ready to direct these home alarms. Richard II.

 Duty of Literary Men to their Country. 
 
 GRIMKE. 
 
 1. We cannot honor our country with too deep a reverence ; 
 we cannot love her with an affection too pure and fervent ; we 
 cannot serve her with an energy of purpose or a faithfulness of 
 zeal too steadfast and ardent. And what is our country ? It 
 is not the East, with her hills and her valleys, with her count- 
 less sails and the rocky ramparts of her shores ; it is not the 
 North, with her thousand villages, and her harvest-home, 
 with her frontiers of the lake and the ocean; it is not the 
 West, with her forest-sea and her inland isles, with her luxu- 
 riant expanses, clothed in the verdant corn, with her beautiful 
 Ohio and her majestic Missouri ; nor is it yet the South, opu- 
 lent in the mimic snow of the cotton, in the rich plantations 
 of the rustling cane and in the golden robes of the rice-field. 
 What are these but the sister families of one greater, better, 
 holier family our country ? 
 
 2. I come not here to speak the dialect or to give the coun- 
 sels of the patriot-statesman ; but I come, a patriot scholar, to 
 vindicate the rights and to plead for the interests of American 
 literature. And be assured that we cannot, as patriot-schol- 
 ars, think too highly of that country, or sacrifice too much for 
 her. And let us never forget let us rather remember with a 
 religious awe that the union of these States is indispensable to 
 our national independence and civil liberties, to our prosperity, 
 happiness, and improvement. 
 
 3. If, indeed, we desire to have a literature like that which 
 has sculptured with such energy of expression, which has 
 painted so faithfully and vividly, the crimes, the vices, the 
 follies of ancient and modern Europe if we desire that our 
 land should furnish for the orator and the novelist, for the

 painter and the poet, age after age, the wild and romantic 
 scenery of war ; the glittering march of armies and the revelry 
 of the camp ; the shrieks and blasphemies and all the horrors 
 of the battle-field ; the desolation of the harvest and the burn- 
 ing cottage ; the storm, the sack, and the ruin of cities if we 
 desire to unchain the furious passions of jealousy and selfish- 
 ness, of hatred, revenge, and ambition, those lions that now 
 sleep harmless in their dens ; if we desire that the lake, the 
 river, the oceans should blush with the blood of brothers; 
 that the wind should waft from the land to the sea, from the 
 sea to the land, the roar and the smoke of the battle, that the 
 very mountain-tops should become altars for the sacrifice of 
 brothers ; if we desire that these and such as these the ele- 
 ments to a certain extent of the literature of the Old "World 
 should be the elements of our literature ; then, but then only, 
 let us hurl from its pedestal the majestic statue of our Union, 
 and scatter its fragments over all our land. 
 
 4. But if we covet for our country the noblest, purest, 
 holiest literature the world has ever seen, such a literature as 
 shall honor God and bless mankind a literature whose smiles 
 might play upon an angel's face, whose tears " would not stain 
 an angel's cheek," then let us cling to the union of these States 
 with a patriot's love, with a scholar's enthusiasm, with a 
 Christian's hope. In her heavenly character, as a holocaust 
 self- sacrificed to God; at the height of her glory, as the orna- 
 ment of a free, educated, peaceful, Christian people. American 
 literature will find that the intellectual spirit is her very tree 
 of life, and the Union her garden of paradise. 
 
 Napoleon Bonaparte. 
 
 1. He is fallen! We may now pause before that splendid 
 prodigy which towered among us like some ancient ruin, 
 whose frown terrified the glance its magnificence attracted. 
 Grand, gloomy, and peculiar, he sat upon his throne, a scep- 
 tered hermit, wrapt in the solitude of his own originality. A 
 mind bold, independent and decisive ; a will despotic in its 
 dictates; an energy that distanced expedition and a con-

 science pliable to every touch of interest marked the outline 
 of this extraordinary character; the most extraordinary, per- 
 haps, that in the annals of this world ever rose or reigned or fell. 
 
 2. Flung into life in the midst of a revolution that quick- 
 ened every energy of a people who acknowledge no superior, he 
 commenced his course, a stranger by birth, and a scholar by 
 charity. With no friend but his sword, and no fortune but his 
 talents, he rushed into the lists where rank and wealth and 
 genius had arrayed themselves, and competition fled from him 
 as from the glance of destiny. He knew no motive but inter- 
 est, acknowledged no criterion but success, worshiped no God 
 but ambition, and, with an Eastern devotion, he knelt at 
 the shrine of his idolatry. 
 
 3. Subsidiary to this there was no creed that he did not 
 profess there was no opinion that he did not promulgate. 
 In the hope of a dynasty he upheld the Crescent ; for the sake 
 of a divorce he bowed before the Cross; the orphan of St. 
 Louis, he became the adopted child of the Republic, and with 
 a parricidal ingratitude, on the ruins both of the throne and 
 tribune, he reared the throne of his despotism. A professed 
 Catholic, he imprisoned the pope; a pretended patriot, he 
 impoverished the country; and, in the name of Brutus, he 
 grasped without remorse and wore without shame the diadem 
 of the Caesars ! Through this pantomime of policy fortune 
 played the clown to his caprices. At his touch crowns 
 crumbled, beggars reigned, systems vanished, the wildest 
 theories took the color of his whim, and all that was venerable 
 and all that was novel changed places with the rapidity of a 
 drama. 
 
 4. Even apparent defeat assumed the appearance of victory; 
 his flight from Egypt confirmed his destiny; ruin itself only 
 elevated him to empire. But if his fortune was great, his 
 genius was transcendent. Decision flashed upon his counsels, 
 and it was the same to decide and to perform. To inferior 
 intellects his combinations appeared perfectly impossible, his 
 plans perfectly impracticable ; but in his hands simplicity 
 marked their development and success vindicated their adop- 
 tion. His person partook the character of his mind; if the 
 one never yielded in the cabinet, the other never bent in the 
 field. Nature had no obstacle that he did not surmount,

Oratorical Style. 309 
 
 space no opposition that he did not spurn, and, whether amid 
 Alpine rocks, Arabian sands, or Polar snows, he seemed proof 
 against peril, and empowered with ubiquity ! 
 
 5. The whole continent trembled at beholding the audacity 
 of his designs and the miracle of their execution. Skepticism 
 bowed to the prodigies of his performance ; romance assumed 
 the air of history; nor was there aught too incredible for 
 belief or too fanciful for expectation when the world saw a 
 subaltern of Corsica waving his imperial flag over her most 
 ancient capitals. All the visions of antiquity became common- 
 places in his contemplation. Kings were his people, nations 
 were his outposts, and he disposed of courts and crowns and 
 camps and churches and cabinets as if they were titular digni- 
 taries of the chess-board. Amid all these changes he stood 
 immutable as adamant. 
 
 6. It mattered little whether in the field or in the drawing- 
 room, with the mob or the levee, wearing the Jacobin bonnet 
 or the iron crown, banishing a Braganza or espousing a Haps- 
 burg, dictating peace on a raft to the Czar of Russia or con- 
 templating defeat at the gallows of Leipsic, he was still the 
 same military despot. 
 
 7. In this wonderful combination his affectation of litera- 
 ture must not be omitted. The jailer of the press, he 
 affected the patronage of letters ; the proscriber of books, he 
 encouraged philosophy; the persecutor of authors and the 
 murderer of printers, he yet pretended to the protection of 
 learning. Such a medley of contradictions, and at the same 
 time such an individual consistency, were never united in the 
 same character. A royalist, a republican, and an emperor, a 
 Mohammedan, a Catholic, and a patron of the synagogue, a 
 subaltern and a sovereign, a traitor and a tyrant, a Christian 
 and an infidel, he was, through all his vicissitudes, the same 
 stern, impatient, inflexible original, the same mysterious, in- 
 comprehensible selfthe man without a model and without a 
 shadow.

 Rienzi's Address to the Romans. 
 
 MISS MITFOBD. 
 
 i. Friends, I come not here to talk. You know too well 
 The story of our thraldom. We are slaves ! 
 The bright sun rises to his course and lights 
 A race of slaves ! He sets, and his last beams 
 Fall on a slave ; not such as, swept along 
 By the full tide of power, the conqueror led 
 To crimson glory and undying fame, 
 But base, ignoble slaves ; slaves to a horde 
 Of petty tyrants, feudal despots, lords, 
 Rich in some dozen paltry villages ; 
 Strong in some hundred spearmen ; only great 
 In that strange spell a name. 
 
 2. Each hour, dark fraud, 
 
 Or open rapine, or protected murder, 
 
 Cries out against them. But this very day 
 
 An honest man, my neighbor there he stands 
 
 Was struck struck like a dog by one who wore 
 
 The badge of Ursini; because, forsooth, 
 
 He tossed not high his ready cap in air, 
 
 Nor lifted up his voice in servile shouts 
 
 At sight "of that great ruffian ! Be we men, 
 
 And suffer such dishonor ? men, and wash not 
 
 The stain away in blood ? Such shames are common, 
 
 I have known deeper wrongs ; I, that speak to ye. 
 
 I had a brother once a gracious boy, 
 
 Full of gentleness, of calmest hope, 
 
 Of sweet and quiet joy; there was the look 
 
 Of heaven upon his face, which limners give 
 
 To the beloved disciple. 
 
 3. How I loved 
 That gracious boy! Younger by fifteen years, 
 Brother at once, and son! He left my side; 
 A summer bloom on his fair cheek, a smile 
 Parting his innocent lips. In one short hour 
 That pretty, harmless boy was slain ! I saw

 The corse, the mangled corse, and then I cried 
 For vengeance ! Rouse, ye Romans ! rouse, ye slaves ! 
 Have ye brave sons ? Look in the next fierce brawl 
 To see them die. Have ye fair daughters ? Look 
 To see them live, torn from your arms, distained, 
 Dishonored ; and if ye dare call for justice, 
 Be answered by the lash ! 
 
 4. Yet this is Rome, 
 
 That sat on her seven hills, and from her throne 
 Of beauty ruled the world ! Yet we are Romans! 
 Why, in that elder day, to be a Roman 
 Was greater than a king ! and once again 
 Hear me, ye walls, that echoed to the tread 
 Of either Brutus ! once, again, I swear 
 The eternal city shall be free ! 
 
 Death of Alexander Hamilton. 
 
 1. A short time since and he who is the occasion of our 
 sorrows was the ornament of his country. He stood on an 
 eminence, and glory covered him. From that eminence he 
 has fallen suddenly, forever fallen. His intercourse with the 
 living world is now ended ; and those who would hereafter 
 find him must seek him in the grave. There, cold and lifeless, 
 is the heart which just now was the seat of friendship. There, 
 dim and sightless, is the eye whose radiant and enlivening orb 
 beamed with intelligence ; and there, closed forever, are those 
 lips on whose persuasive accents we have so often and so 
 lately hung with transport. 
 
 2. From the darkness which rests upon his tomb there pro- 
 ceeds, methinks, a light in which it is clearly seen that those 
 gaudy objects which men pursue are only phantoms. In this 
 light how dimly shines the splendor of victory how humble 
 appears the majesty of grandeur ! The bubble which seemed 
 to have so much solidity has burst, and we again see that all 
 below the sun is vanity. 
 
 3. True, the funeral eulogy has been pronounced; the sad 
 and solemn procession has moved ; the badge of mourning has

 already been decreed; and presently the sculptured marble 
 will lift up its front, proud to perpetuate the name of Hamil- 
 ton, and rehearse to the passing traveler his virtues. Just 
 tributes of respect, and to the living useful; but to him, 
 moldering in his narrow and humble habitation, what are 
 they ? How vain ! How unavailing ! 
 
 4. Approach and behold, while I lift from his sepulcher its 
 covering. Ye admirers of his greatness, ye emulous of his 
 talents and his fame, approach and behold him now. How 
 pale ! how silent ! No martial bands admire the adroitness of 
 his movements; no fascinated throng weep and melt and 
 tremble at his eloquence. Amazing change ! a shroud ! a coffin ! 
 a narrow subterraneous cabin ! This is all that now remains 
 of Hamilton. And is this all that remains of him ? During a 
 life so transitory, what lasting monument, then, can our 
 fondest hopes erect ? My brethren, we stand on the borders 
 of an awful gulf which is swallowing up all things human. 
 And is there, amid this universal wreck, nothing stable, noth- 
 ing abiding, nothing immortal, on which poor, frail, dying 
 man can fasten ? 
 
 6. Ask the hero, ask the statesman, whose wisdom you have 
 been accustomed to revere, and he will tell you. He will tell you, 
 did I say ? He has already told you from his death-bed, and 
 his illumined spirit still whispers from the heavens, with well- 
 known eloquence, the solemn admonition: " Mortals, hasten- 
 ing to the tomb, and once the companions of my pilgrimage, 
 take warning and avoid my errors ; cultivate the virtues I 
 have recommended ; choose the Saviour I have chosen. Live 
 disinterestedly live for immortality. And would you rescue 
 any thing from final dissolution, lay it up in God."

 Bringing to "Winchester fresh dismay, 
 The affrighted air with a shudder bore,

 The terrible grumble, and rumble, and roar, 
 Telling the battle was on once more, 
 And Sheridan twenty miles away. 
 
 2. And wilder still those billows of war 
 Thundered along the horizon's bar; 
 And louder yet into Winchester rolled 
 The roar of that red sea uncontrolled, 
 Making the blood of the listener cold, 
 
 As he thought of the stake in that fiery fray, 
 And Sheridan twenty miles away. 
 
 3. But there is a road from Winchester town, 
 A good, broad highway leading down : 
 
 And there through the flush of the morning light, 
 
 A steed, as black as the steeds of night, 
 
 Was seen to pass, as with eagle flight ; 
 
 As if he knew the terrible need, 
 
 He stretched away with his utmost speed ; 
 
 Hills rose and fell ; but his heart was gay, 
 
 With Sheridan fifteen miles away. 
 
 4. Still sprung from those swift hoofs, thundering south, 
 The dust, like smoke from the cannon's mouth; 
 
 Or the trail of a comet, sweeping faster and faster, 
 
 Foreboding to traitors the doom of disaster. 
 
 The heart of the steed, and the heart of the master 
 
 Were beating like prisoners assaulting their walls, 
 
 Impatient to be where the battle-field calls ; 
 
 Every nerve of the charger was strained to full play 
 
 With Sheridan only ten miles away, 
 
 5. Under his spurning feet, the road 
 Like an arrowy Alpine river flowed, 
 And the landscape sped away behind 
 Like an ocean flying before the wind, 
 
 And the steed, like a bark fed with furnace ire, 
 Swept on, with his wild eye full of fire. 
 But, lo ! he is nearing his heart's desire : 
 He is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray, 
 With Sheridan only five miles away.

 6. The first that the general saw were the groups 
 Of stragglers, and then the retreating troops ; 
 What was done? what to do? a glance told him both, 
 Then striking his spurs, with a terrible oath, 
 
 He dashed down the line, 'mid a storm of huzzas, 
 And the wave of retreat checked its course there, becau 
 The sight of the master compelled it to pause. 
 With foam and with dust the black charger was gray ; 
 By the flash of his eye, and his red nostril's play, 
 He seemed to the whole great army to say, 
 "I have brought you Sheridan all the way 
 From Winchester, down to save the day." 
 
 7. Hurrah ! hurrah for Sheridan ! 
 Hurrah ! hurrah for horse and man ! 
 
 And when their statues are placed on high 
 
 Under the dome of the Union sky, 
 
 The American soldiers' Temple of Fame, 
 
 There with the glorious general's name 
 
 Let it be said in letters both bold and bright :

 By carrying Sheridan into the fight, 
 
 Froi Winchester, twenty miles away!"

 Sabering the gunners there, 
 Charging an army, while 
 
 All the world wondered : 
 Plunged in the battery-smoke, 
 Right through the line they broke ; 
 Cossack and Russian 
 Reeled from the saber-stroke 
 
 Shattered and sundered. 
 Then they rode back, but not, 
 
 Not the six hundred.

 Cannon to left of them, 
 Cannon behind them

 Came through the jaws of Death 
 Back from the mouth of Hell, 
 All that was left of them, 
 
 Left of six hundred.

 1. There's a beautiful face in the silent air, 
 
 Which follows me ever and near ; 
 With smiling eyes and amber hair, 
 With voiceless lips, yet with breath of prayer, 
 
 That I feel but cannot hear. 
 
 2. The dimpled hand and ringlet of gold 
 
 Lie low in a marble sleep : 
 I stretch my hand for a clasp of old, 
 But the empty air is strangely cold, 
 
 And my vigil alone I keep. 
 
 3. There's a sinless brow with a radiant crown, 
 
 And a cross laid down in the dust ; 
 There's a smile where never a shade comes now, 
 And tears no more from those dear eyes flow, 
 
 So sweet in their innocent trust. 
 
 4. There's a beautiful region above the skies, 
 
 And I long to reach its shore, 
 For I know I shall find my treasure there, 
 The laughing eyes and amber hair, 
 
 Of the loved one gone before.

 LEIGH HUNT. 
 
 Abou Ben-Adhem (may his tribe increase!) 
 Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace, 
 And saw, within the moonlight in his room, 
 Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom, 
 An angel, writing in a book of gold. 
 Exceeding peace had made Ben-Adhem bold ;

 And to the presence in the room he said, 
 " What writest thou ? " The vision raised its head, 
 And, with a look made all of sweet accord, 
 Answered, "The names of those who love the Lord." 
 "And is mine one ? " said Abou. "Nay, not so," 
 Replied the angel. Abou spake more low, 
 But cheerily still, and said, ' ' I pray thee, then, 
 Write me as one that loves his fellow-men." 
 
 2. The angel wrote and vanished. The next night 
 It came again, with a great wakening light, 
 And showed the names whom love of God had blessed, 
 And lo, Ben-Adhem's name led all the rest. 
 
 Curfew must not Ring To-Night. 
 
 ROSA A. HARTWIOK. 
 
 1. England's sun was slowly setting o'er the hills so far 
 away. 
 
 Filling all the land with beauty at the close of one sad day ; 
 
 And the last rays kissed the forehead of a man and maiden 
 fair, 
 
 He with step so slow and weakened, she with sunny, float- 
 ing hair ; 
 
 He with sad, bowed head, and thoughtful ; she with lips so 
 cold and white, 
 
 Struggling to keep back the murmur, " Curfew must not 
 ring to-night." 
 
 2. " Sexton," Bessie's white lips faltered, pointing to the 
 
 prison old, 
 With its walls so tall and gloomy walls so dark and 
 
 damp and cold 
 I've a lover in that prison, doomed this very night to die 
 At the ringing of the Curfew, and no earthly help is nigh. 
 Cromwell will not come till sunset," and her face grew 
 
 strangely white, 
 As she spoke in husky whispers, "Curfew must not ring 
 
 to-night."

 3. " Bessie," calmly spoke the sexton every word pierced 
 
 her young heart 
 Like a thousand gleaming arrows, like a deadly poisoned 
 
 dart; 
 "Long, long years I've rung the Curfew from that gloomy 
 
 shadowed tower ; 
 Every evening, just at sunset, it has told the twilight 
 
 hour; 
 I have done my duty ever, tried to do it just, and right; 
 Now I'm old, I will not miss it; girl, the Curfew rings 
 
 to-night!" 
 
 4. Wild her eyes and pale her features, stern and white her 
 
 thoughtful brow, 
 And within her heart's deep center, Bessie made a solemn 
 
 vow; 
 She had listened while the judges read, without a tear or 
 
 sigh, 
 " At the ringing of the Curfew Basil Underwood must die." 
 And her breath came fast and faster, and her eyes grew 
 
 large and bright 
 One low murmur, scarcely spoken "Curfew must not 
 
 ring to-night ! " 
 
 5. She with light step bounded forward, sprang within the 
 
 old church door. 
 Left the old man coming slowly paths he'd trod so oft 
 
 before ; 
 Not one moment paused the maiden, but with cheek and 
 
 brow aglow 
 Staggered up the gloomy tower, where the bell swung to 
 
 and fro : 
 Then she climbed the slimy ladder, dark, without one ray 
 
 of light, 
 Upward still, her pale lips saying: "Curfew shall not 
 
 ring to-night." 
 
 6. She has reached the topmost ladder; o'er her hangs the 
 
 great dark bell ; 
 And the awful gloom beneath her, like the pathway down 
 to hell:

 See, the ponderous tongue is swinging; tis the hour of 
 Curfew now 
 
 And the sight has chilled her bossom, stopped her breath, 
 and paled her brow. 
 
 Shall she let it ring ? No, never I her eyes flash with sud- 
 den light, 
 
 As she springs and grasps it firmly "Curfew shall not 
 ring to-night." 
 
 7. Out she swung, far out, the city seemed a tiny speck 
 
 below; 
 There 'twixt heaven and earth suspended, as the bell 
 
 swung to and fro ; 
 And the half-deaf sexton ringing (years he had not heard 
 
 the bell), 
 And he thought the twilight Curfew rang young Basil's 
 
 funeral knell: 
 Still the maiden clinging firmly, cheek and brow so pale 
 
 and white, 
 Still'd her frightened heart's wild beating " Curfew shall 
 
 not ring to-night." 
 
 B. It was o'er the bell ceased swaying, and the maiden 
 
 stepped once more 
 Firmly on the damp old ladder, where for hundred years 
 
 before 
 Human foot had not been planted; and what she this 
 
 night had done 
 Should be told in long years after as the rays of setting 
 
 sun 
 Light the sky with mellow beauty, aged sires, with heads 
 
 of white, 
 Tell their children why the Curfew did not ring that one 
 
 sad night. 
 
 9. O'er the distant hills came Cromwell ; Bessie saw him, and 
 her brow, 
 Lately white with sickening terror, glows with sudden 
 beauty now;

 At his feet she told her story, showed her hands all bruised 
 
 and torn ; 
 And her sweet young face, so haggard, with a look so sad 
 
 and worn, 
 Touched his heart with sudden pity lit his eyes with 
 
 misty light ; 
 "Go, your lover lives !" cried Cromwell; " Curfew must 
 
 not ring to-night." 
 
 10. Wide they flung the massive portals, led the prisoner forth 
 to die, 
 
 All his bright young life before him. 'Neath the dark- 
 ening English sky, 
 
 Bessie came with flying footsteps, eyes aglow with love- 
 light sweet ; 
 
 Kneeling on the turf beside him, laid his pardon at his 
 feet. 
 
 In his brave, strong arms he clasped her, kissed the face 
 upturned and white, 
 
 Whispered, ''Darling, you have saved me ; Curfew mus* 
 not ring to-night." 
 
 John Burns of Gettysburg. 
 
 F. BRET HARTE. 
 
 1. Have you neard the story that gossij>s tell 
 Of Burns of Gettysburg ? No ? Ah, well! 
 Brief is the glory that hero earns, 
 Briefer the story of poor John Burns : 
 He was the fellow who won renown 
 The only man who didn't back down 
 When the rebels rode through his native town r 
 But held his own in the fight next day, 
 When all his townsfolk ran away. 
 That was in July, sixty- three, 
 The very day that General Lee, 
 The flower of Southern chivalry, 
 Baffled and beaten, backward reeled 
 From a stubborn Meade and a barren field.

 I might tell how, but the day before, 
 
 John Burn3 stood at his cottage-door, 
 
 Looking down the village street, 
 
 Where in the shade of his peaceful vine, 
 He heard the low of his gathered kine, 
 
 And felt their breath with incense sweet ; 
 
 Or, I might say, when the sunset burned 
 
 The old farm gable, he thought it turned 
 
 The milk that fell in a babbling flood 
 
 Into the "milk-pail, red as blood ; 
 
 Or, how he fancied the hum of bees 
 
 Were bullets buzzing among the trees. 
 
 But all such fanciful thoughts as these 
 
 Were strange to a practical man like Burns, 
 
 Who minded only his own concerns, 
 
 Troubled no more by fancies fine 
 
 Than one of his calm-eyed, long tailed kine 
 
 Quite old-fashioned and matter-of-fact, 
 
 Slow to argue, but quick to act. 
 
 That was the reason, as some folks say, 
 
 He fought so well on that terrible day. 
 
 3. And it was terrible. On the right 
 Raged for hours the heavy fight, 
 Thundered the battery's double bass 
 Difficult music for men to face ; 
 While on the left where now the graves 
 Undulate like the living waves 
 That all the day unceasing swept 
 Up to the pits the rebels kept 
 Round shot plowed the upland glades, 
 Sown with bullets, reaped with blades : 
 Shattered fences here and there 
 Tossed their splinters in the air ; 
 The very trees were stripped and bare ; 
 The barns that once held yellow grain 
 Were heaped with harvests of the slain ; 
 The cattle bellowed on the plain, 
 The turkeys screamed with might and main.

 And brooding barn-fowl left their rest 
 With strange shells bursting in each nest. 
 
 4. Just where the fide of battle turns, 
 Erect and lonely stood old John Burns. 
 How do you think the man was dressed ? 
 He wore an ancient, long buff vest, 
 Yellow as saffron, but his best ; 
 And buttoned over his manly breast 
 Was a bright blue coat with a rolling collar, 
 And large gilt buttons size of a dollar 
 With tails that country folk called "swaller. w 
 He wore a broad-brimmed bell-crowned hat, 
 White as the locks on which it sat. 
 Never had such a sight been seen 
 For forty-years on the village green, 
 Since old John Burns was a country beau, 
 And went to the " quilting " long ago. 
 
 6. Close at his elbows all that day 
 Veterans of the Peninsula, 
 Sunburnt and bearded, charged away. 
 And striplings, downy of lip and chin, 
 Clerks that the Home Guard mustered in, 
 Glanced as they passed at the hat he wore, 
 Then at the rifle his right hand bore ; 
 
 And hailed him from out their youthful lore, 
 
 With scraps of a slangy repertoire : 
 
 " How are you, White Hat ? " u Put her through! " 
 
 " Your head's level ! " and, " Hurrah for you ! " 
 
 Called him " Daddy," and begged he'd disclose 
 
 The name of the tailor who made his clothes, 
 
 And what was the value he set on those ; 
 
 While Burns, unmindful of jeer and scoff, 
 
 Stood there picking the rebels off 
 
 With his long, brown rifle and bell-crown hat, 
 
 And the swallow-tails they were laughing at. 
 
 7. 'Twas but a moment, for that respect 
 
 Which clothes all courage their voices checked;

 And something the wildest could understand, 
 
 Spake in the old man's strong right hand, 
 
 And his corded throat, and the lurking frown 
 
 Of his eyebrows under his old bell-crown, 
 
 Until, as they gazed, there crept an awe 
 
 Through the ranks in whispers, and some men saw 
 
 In the antique vestments and long white hair, 
 
 The Past of the Nation in battle there. 
 
 And some of the soldiers since declare 
 
 That the gleam of his old white hat afar, 
 
 Like the crested plume of the brave Navarre, 
 
 That day was their oriflamme of war. 
 
 Thus raged the battle. You know the rest, 
 
 How the rebels beaten, and backward pressed, 
 
 Broke at the final charge and ran. 
 
 At which John Burns, a practical man, 
 
 Shouldered his rifle, unbent his brows, 
 
 And then went back to his bees and cows. 
 
 7. That is the story of old John Burns; 
 And this is the moral the listener learns; 
 In fighting life's battle the question's whether 
 You'll show a hat that's white, or a feather. 
 
 Creeds of the Bells. 
 
 GEORGE W. BUNGAY. 
 
 How sweet the chime of Sabbath bells! 
 Each one its creed in music tells, 
 In tones that float upon the air, 
 As soft as song, and pure as prayer ; 
 And I will put in simple rhyme 
 The language of the golden chime. 
 My happy heart with rapture swells 
 Responsive to the bells sweet bells. 
 
 "In deeds of love excel excel," 
 Chimed out from ivied towers a bell :

 " This is the church not built ou sands, 
 Emblem of one not built with hands ; 
 Its forms and sacred rites revere ; 
 Come worship here come worship here ; 
 Its rituals and faith excel excel," 
 Chimed out the Episcopalian bell. 
 
 3. " O, heed the ancient landmarks well," 
 In solemn tones exclaimed a bell ; 
 
 " No progress made by mortal man 
 Can change the just, eternal plan. 
 With God there can be nothing new; 
 Ignore the false, embrace the true ; 
 While all is well is well is well," 
 Pealed out the good old Dutch Church bell. 
 
 4. " O swell, ye purifying waters, swell," 
 In mellow tones rang out a bell ; 
 
 " Though faith alone in Christ can save, 
 Man must be plunged beneath the wave, 
 To show the world unfaltering faith 
 In what the sacred Scripture saith. 
 O swell, ye rising waters, swell," 
 Pealed out the clear-toned Baptist bell. 
 
 5. " In after life there is no hell ! " 
 In raptures rang a cheerful bell ; 
 "Look up to heaven this holy day, 
 Where angels wait to lead the way ; 
 There are no fires, no fiends, to blight 
 The future life ; be just, do right. 
 
 No hell ! no hell ! no hell ! no hell ! " 
 Rang out the Universalist bell. 
 
 6. " Not faith alone, but works as well, 
 Must test the soul," said a soft bell; 
 "Come here, and cast aside your load, 
 And work your way along the road, 
 With faith in God, and faith in man, 
 And hope in Christ, where hope began : 
 Do well do well do well do well," 
 Pealed forth the Unitarian bell.

 7. "Farewell! farewell! base world, farewell I" 
 In touching tones exclaimed a bell ; 
 
 " Life is a boon to mortals given, 
 To fit the soul for bliss in heaven. 
 Do not invoke the avenging rod ; 
 Come here, and learn the way to God. 
 Say to the world farewell! farewell!" 
 Pealed out the Presbyterian bell. 
 
 8. " To all the truth we tell we tell," 
 Shouted in ecstasies a bell ; 
 
 " Come, all ye weary wanderers, see! 
 Our Lord has made salvation free. 
 Repent ! believe ; have faith ! and then 
 Be saved, and praise the Lord. Amen. 
 Salvation's free, we tell we tell,"

 Roger's my dog. Come here, you scamp ! 
 Jump for the gentlemen mind your eye ! 
 
 Over the table look out for the lamp ! 
 The rogue is growing a little old ; 
 
 Five years we've tramped through wind and weather 
 And slept out-doors when nights were cold, 
 
 And ate and drank and starved together. 
 
 2. We've learned what comfort is, I tell you! 
 
 A bed on the floor, a bit of rosin. 
 A fire to thaw our thumbs (poor fellow ! 
 
 The paw he holds up there's been frozen), 
 Plenty of catgut for my fiddle 
 
 (This out- door business is bad for strings), 
 Then a few nice buckwheats hot from the griddle, 
 
 And Roger and I set up for kings !

 Roger and I are exceedingly moral 
 Aren't we, Roger? See him wink ! 
 
 Well, something hot, then we wont quarrel. 
 He's thirsty, too see him nod his head ! 
 
 What a pity, sir, that dogs can't talk ! 
 He understands every word that's said 
 
 And he knows good milk from water-and-chalk. 
 
 4. The truth is, sir, now I reflect, 
 
 I've been so sadly given to grog, 
 I wonder I've not lost the respect 
 
 (Here's to you, sir !) even of my dog. 
 But he sticks by, through thick and thin ; 
 
 And this old coat, with its empty pockets, 
 And rags that smell of tobacco and gin, 
 
 He'll follow while he has eyes in his sockets. 
 
 5. There isn't another creature living 
 
 Would do it, and prove, through every disaster, 
 So fond, so faithful, and so forgiving 
 
 To such a miserable, thankless master! 
 No, sir ! see him wag his tail and grin ! 
 
 By George! it makes my old eyes water! 
 That is, there's something in this gin 
 
 That chokes a fellow. But no matter ! 
 
 6. We'll have some music if you're willing, 
 
 And Roger (hem ! what a plague a cough is, sir !) 
 Shall march a little. Start, you villain ! 
 
 Stand straight ! 'Bout face ! Salute your officer ! 
 Put up that paw ! Dress ! Take your rifle ! 
 
 (Some dogs have arms, you see!) Now hold your 
 Cap while the gentlemen give a trifle 
 
 To aid a poor old patriot soldier ! 
 
 7. March! Halt! Now show how the rebel shakes 
 
 When he stands up to hear his sentence. 
 Now tell us how many drams it takes 
 To honor a jolly new acquaintance.

 Five yelps that's five; lie's mighty knowing!

 Quick, sir! I'm ill my brain is going I

 8. Why not reform! That's easily said; 
 
 But I've gone through such wretched treatment, 
 Sometimes forgetting the taste of bread, 
 
 And scarce remembering what meat meant, 
 That my poor stomach's past reform; 
 
 And there are times when, mad with thinking, 
 I'd sell out heaven for something warm 
 
 To prop a horrible inward sinking. 
 
 9. Is there a way to forget to think? 
 
 At your age, sir, home, fortune, friends, 
 A dear girl's love but I took to drink ; 
 
 The same old story; you know how it ends. 
 If you could have seen these classic features 
 
 You needn't laugh, sir ; they were not then 
 Such a burning libel on God's creatures : 
 
 I was one of your handsome men ! 
 
 10. If you had seen her, so fair and young, 
 
 Whose head was happy on this breast ! 
 If you could have heard the songs we sung 
 
 When the wine went round, you wouldn't have guessed 
 That ever I, sir, should be straying 
 
 From door to door, with fiddle and dog, 
 Ragged and penniless, and playing 
 
 To you to-night for a glass of grog ! 
 
 11. She's married since a parson's wife: 
 
 'Twas better for her that we should part 
 Better the soberest, prosiest life 
 
 Than a blasted home and a broken heart. 
 Have I seen her? Once : I was weak and spent 
 
 On a dusty road : a carriage stopped ; 
 But little she dreamed, as on she went, 
 
 Who kissed the coin that her fingers dropped !

 It makes me wild to think of the change ! 
 What do you care for a beggar's story? 
 
 Is it amusing? you find it strange? 
 I had a mother so proud of me ! 
 
 'Twas well she died before Do you know 
 If the happy spirits in heaven can see 
 
 The ruin and wretchedness here below? 
 
 13. Another glass, and strong, to deaden 
 
 This pain ; then Eoger and I will start. 
 I wonder, has he such a lumpish, leaden, 
 
 Aching thing, in place of a heart ? 
 He is sad sometimes, and would weep, if he could, 
 
 No doubt, remembering things that were 
 A virtuous kennel, with plenty of food, 
 
 And himself a sober, respectable cur. 
 
 14. I'm better now ; that glass was warming. 
 
 You rascal ! limber your lazy feet ! 
 We must be fiddling and performing 
 
 For supper and bed, or starve in the street 
 Not a very gay life to lead, you think? 
 
 But soon we shall go where lodgings are free, 
 And the sleepers need neither victuals nor drink ; 
 
 The sooner, the better for Roger and me !

 Silver bells 
 What a world of merriment their melody foretells! 
 How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, 
 
 In the icy air of night ! 
 While the stars that oversprinkle 
 All the heavens seem to twinkle 
 
 With a crystalline delight ; 
 Keeping time, time, time, 
 In a sort of Runic rhyme,

 To the tintinnabulation that so musically swells 
 From the bells, bells, bells, bells, 
 Bells, bells, bells 
 From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells. 
 
 2. Hear the mellow wedding-bells, 
 
 Golden bells ! 
 What a world of happiness their harmony foretells 
 Through the balmy air of night 
 How they ring out their delight ! 
 From the molten-golden notes, 
 
 And all in tune, 
 What a liquid ditty floats 
 To the turtle dove that listens while she gloats 
 On the moon ! 
 O, from out the sounding cells, 
 What a gush of euphony voluminously wells ! 
 How it swells ! 
 How it dwells 
 On the future ! how it tells 
 Of the rapture that impels 
 To the swinging and the ringing 
 Of the bells, bells, bells- 
 Bells, bells, bells 
 To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells ! 
 
 3. Hear the loud alarum bells 
 
 Brazen bells ! 
 What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells ! 
 In the startled ear of night 
 How they scream out their affright ! 
 Too much horrified to speak, 
 They can only shriek, shriek, 
 Out of tune. 
 In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire, 
 In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic firt, 
 Leaping higher, higher, higher, 
 With a desperate desire, 
 And a resolute endeavor, 
 Now now to sit or never, 
 By the side of the pale-faced moon.

 O the bells, bells, bells! 
 What a tale their terror tells 
 Of despair ! 
 How they clang, and clash, and roar! 
 What a horror they outpour 
 On the bosom of the palpitating air ! 
 Yet the ear it fully knows, 
 By the twanging 
 And the clanging, 
 How the danger ebbs and flows: 
 Yet the ear distinctly tells, 
 In the jangling 
 And the wrangling, 
 How the danger sinks and swells, 
 By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells.

 Iron bells! 
 What a world of solemn thought their monody compels. 
 In the silence of the night, 
 How we shiver with affright 
 At the melancholy menace of their tone! 
 For every sound that floats 
 From the rust within their throats 
 
 Is a groan. 
 And the people ah, the people 
 They that dwell up in the steeple, 
 
 All alone, 
 And who tolling, tolling, tolling, 
 
 In that muffled monotone, 
 Feel a glory in so rolling 
 
 On the human heart a stone 
 They are neither man nor woman 
 They are neither brute nor human 
 
 They are Ghouls : 
 And their king it is who tolls ; 
 And he rolls, rolls, rolls, rolls,

 Count Candespina's Standard. 
 
 GEORGE H. B0KER. 
 
 " The King of Aragon now entered Castile, by way of Soria and Osma, witfc 
 a powerful array ; and, having been met by the queen's forces, both parties 
 encamped near Sepulveda, and prepared to give battle. 
 
 " This engagement, called, from the field where it took place, de la Espina, 
 is one of the most famous of that age. The dastardly Count of Lara fled at 
 the first shock, and joined the queen at Burgos, where she was anxiously 
 awaiting the issue; but the brave Count of Candespina (Gomez Gonzalez) 
 stood his ground to the last, and died on the field of battle. His standard- 
 bearer, a gentleman of the house of Olea, after having his horse killed under 
 him, and both hands cut off by saber strokes, fell beside his master, still 
 clasping the standard in his arms, and repeating his war-cry of l Olea ! ' " 
 Annate of the Queens of Spain.

 1. Scarce were the splintered lances dropped, 
 
 Scarce were the swords drawn out, 
 Ere recreant Lara, sick with fear, 
 Had wheeled his steed about ; 
 
 2. His courser reared and pluuged and neighed, 
 
 Loathing the fight to yield ; 
 But the coward spurred him to the bone, 
 And drove him from the field. 
 
 ' 3. Gonzalez in his stirrups rose : 
 
 " Turn, turn, thou traitor knight! 
 Thou bold tongue in a lady's bower, 
 Thou dastard in a fight ! " 
 
 4. But vainly valiant Gomez cried 
 
 Across the waning fray : 
 Pale Lara and his craven band 
 To Burgos scoured away. 
 
 5. " Now, by the God above me, sirs, 
 
 Better we all were dead, 
 Than a single knight among ye all 
 Should ride where Lara led ! 
 
 6. ' ' Yet ye who fear to follow me, 
 
 As yon traitor turn and fly ; 
 For I lead ye not to win a field : 
 I lead ye forth to die. 
 
 7. " Olea, plant my standard here 
 
 Here on this little mound ; 
 Here raise the war-cry of thy house, 
 Make this our rallying ground. 
 
 8. " Forget not, as thou hop'st for grace 
 
 The last care I shall have 
 Will be to hear thy battle-cry, 
 And see that standard wave." 
 
 9. Down on the ranks of Aragon 
 
 The bold Gonzalez drove, 
 
 And Olea raised his battle-cry, 
 
 And waved the flag above.

 10. Slowly Gonzalez's little band 
 
 Gave ground before the foe, 
 But not an inch of the field was won 
 "Without a deadly blow ; 
 
 11. And not an inch of the field was won 
 
 That did not draw a tear 
 From the widowed wives of Aragon, 
 That fatal news to hear. 
 
 12. Backward and backward Gomez fought, 
 
 And high o'er the clashing steel, 
 Plainer and plainer rose the cry, 
 " Olea for Castile ! " 
 
 13. Backward fought Gomez, step by step, 
 
 Till the cry was close at hand, 
 Till his dauntless standard shadowed him 
 And there he made his stand. 
 
 14. Mace, sword, and ax rang on his mail, 
 
 Yet he moved not where he stood, 
 Though each gaping joint of armor ran 
 A stream of purple blood. 
 
 15. As pierced with countless wounds he fell, 
 
 The standard caught his eye, 
 And he smiled, like an infant hushed asleep, 
 To hear the battle-cry.

 Have fallen, or basely flown ; 
 And on the mound where his post was fixed 
 Olea stood alone. 
 
 17. " Yield up thy banner, gallant knight 1 
 
 Thy lord lies on the plain ; 
 
 Thy duty has been nobly done ; 
 
 I would not see thee slain." 
 
 18. " Spare pity, King of Aragon; 
 
 I would not hear thee lie : 
 My lord is looking down from heaven 
 To see his standard fly."

 19. "Yield, madman, yield! thy horse is down, 
 
 Thou hast nor lance nor shield ; 
 Fly! I will grant thee time." " This flag 
 Can neither fly nor yield ! " 
 
 20. They girt the standard round about, 
 
 A wall of flashing steel ; 
 But still they heard the battle-cry, 
 "Oleafor Castile! " 
 
 21. And there, against all Aragon, 
 
 Full armed with lance and brand, 
 Olea fought until the sword 
 Snapped in his sturdy hand. 
 
 22. Among the foe, with that high scorn 
 
 Which laughs at earthly fears, 
 He hurled the broken hilt, and drew 
 His dagger on the spears. 
 
 23. They hewed the hauberk from his breast, 
 
 The helmet from his head ; 
 They hewed the hands from off his limbs, 
 From every vein ne bled. 
 
 24. Clasping the standard to his heart, 
 
 He raised one dying peal, 
 That ran<>: as if a trumpet blew 
 "Olea for Castile!" 
 
 Bernardo Del Carpio. 
 
 MRS. HEMANS. 
 
 1. The warrior bowed his crested bead, and tamed his heart 
 
 of fire, 
 And sued the haughty king to free his long-imprisoned 
 
 sire ; 
 "I bring thee here my fortress-keys, I bring my captive 
 
 train ; 
 I pledge thee faith, my liege, my lord ! O break my 
 
 father's chain ! "

 2. "Rise, rise! even now thy father comes, a ransomed man 
 
 this day ! 
 Mount thy good horse, and thou and I will meet him. on 
 
 his way." 
 Then lightly rose that loyal son, and bounded on his 
 
 steed, 
 And urged as if with lance in rest, the charger's foamy 
 
 3. And lo ! from far, as on they pressed, there came a glitter- 
 ing band, 
 
 With one that 'midst them stately rode, as leader in the 
 land! 
 
 "Now haste, Bernardo, haste! for there, in very truth, 
 is he, 
 
 The father whom thy faithful heart hath yearned so long 
 to see." 
 
 I. His dark eye flashed, his proud breast heaved, his cheek's 
 
 hue came and went ; 
 He reached that gray-haired chieftain's side, and there 
 
 dismounting, bent; . 
 A lowly knee to earth he bent, his father's hand he took 
 What was there in its touch that all his fiery spirit shook ? 
 
 5. That hand was cold a frozen thing it dropped from his 
 
 like lead ! 
 He looked up to the face above the face was of the dead? 
 A plume waved o'er the noble brow the brow was fixed 
 
 and white ; 
 He met, at last, his father's eyes but in them was no sight ! 
 
 6. Up from the ground he sprang and gazed but who could 
 
 paint that gaze ? 
 They hushed their very hearts, that saw its horror and 
 
 amaze 
 They might have chained him, as before that stony form 
 
 he stood; 
 For the power was stricken from his arm, and from his lip 
 
 the blood.

 V. "Father! " at last he murmured low, and wept like child- 
 hood then : 
 
 Talk not of grief till thou hast seen the tears of warlike 
 men! 
 
 He thought on all his glorious hopes, and all his young 
 renown 
 
 He flung his falchion from his side, and in the dust sat 
 down. 
 
 8. Then covering with his steel-gloved hands his darkly 
 
 mournful brow, 
 "No more, there is no more," he said, "to lift the 
 
 sword for now ; 
 My king is false my hope betrayed ! My father ! the 
 
 worth, 
 The glory, and the loveliness are passed away from earth ! 
 
 9. "I thought to stand where banners waved, my sire, 
 
 beside thee yet ! 
 I would that there our kindred blood on Spain's free soil 
 
 had met ! 
 Thou wouldst have known my spirit then; for thee my 
 
 fields were won ; 
 And thou hast perished in thy chains, as though thou hadst 
 
 no son! 
 
 10. Then, starting from the ground once more, he seized the 
 
 monarch's rein, 
 
 Amid the pale and wildered looks of all the courtier train ; 
 
 And with a fierce o'ermastering grasp, the rearing war- 
 horse led, 
 
 And sternly set them face to face the king before the 
 dead. 
 
 11. " Came I not forth, upon thy pledge, my father's hand to 
 
 kiss ? 
 Be still, and gaze thou on, false king ! and tell me, what is 
 
 this? 
 The voice, the glance, the heart I sought give answer, 
 
 where are they ? 
 If thou wouldst clear thy perjured soul, send life through 
 
 this cold clay !

 12. "Into these glassy eyes put light be still! keep down 
 
 thine ire! 
 Bid these white lips a blessing speak this earth is not my 
 
 sire; 
 Give me back him for whom I strove, for whom my blood 
 
 was shed ! 
 Thou canst not? and a king! his dust be mountains on 
 
 thy head!" 
 
 13. He loosed the steed his slack hand fell ; upon the silent 
 
 face 
 He cast one long, deep, troubled look, then turned from 
 
 that sad place ; 
 His hope was crushed; his after fate untold in martial 
 
 strain ; 
 His banner led the spears no more amid the hills of Spain. 
 
 The Raven. 
 
 EDGAR A. rOE. 
 
 1. Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and 
 
 weary, 
 Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore 
 While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a 
 
 tapping, 
 As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber 
 
 door. 
 " 'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my chamber 
 
 door 
 
 Only this, and nothing more." 
 
 2. Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December, 
 And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the 
 
 floor. 
 Eagerly I wished the morrow: vainly I had sought to 
 
 borrow 
 From my books surcease of sorrow sorrow for the lost 
 
 Lenore 
 For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels named 
 
 Lenore 
 
 Nameless here for evermore

 3. And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple cur- 
 
 tain, 
 Thrilled me filled me with fantastic terrors never felt 
 
 before ; 
 So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood 
 
 repeating, 
 " 'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber 
 
 door 
 Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door : 
 That it is, and nothing more." 
 
 4. Presently my soul grew stronger : hesitating then no longer, 
 "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I 
 
 implore ; 
 But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came 
 
 rapping, 
 And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber 
 
 door, 
 That I scarce was sure I heard you " here I opened wide 
 
 the door : 
 
 Darkness there, and nothing more. 
 
 5. Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, 
 
 wondering, fearing. 
 Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream 
 
 before ; 
 But the silence was unbroken, and the darkness gave no 
 
 token, 
 And the only word there spoken was the whispered word 
 
 "Lenore! " 
 This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word 
 
 "Lenore! " 
 
 Merely this, and nothing more. 
 
 6. Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me 
 
 burning, 
 
 Soon again I heard a tapping, something louder than 
 before. 
 
 "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my win- 
 dow lattice;

 Let me see then what thereat is, and this mystery explore 
 Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery 
 explore ; 
 
 'Tis the wind, and nothing more." 
 
 7. Open then I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and 
 
 flutter, 
 In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days of yore. 
 Not the least obeisance made he ; not an instant stopped 
 
 or stayed he : 
 But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber 
 
 door 
 Perched upon a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber 
 
 door 
 
 Perched, and sat, and nothing more. 
 
 8. Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling, 
 By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it 
 
 wore, 
 "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, 
 
 1 ' art sure no craven ; 
 Ghastly, grim, and ancient raven, wandering from the 
 
 nightly shore, 
 Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Plutonian 
 
 shore." 
 
 Quoth the raven, " Nevermore! " 
 
 9. Much I marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so 
 
 plainly, 
 Though its answer little meaning little relevancy bore ; 
 For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being 
 Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber 
 
 door 
 Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber 
 
 door 
 
 With such name as " Nevermore! " 
 
 10. But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only 
 That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did out- 
 pour.

 Nothing further then he uttered not a feather then he 
 
 fluttered 
 Till I scarcely more than muttered, "Other friends have 
 
 flown before 
 On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have flown 
 
 before. " 
 
 Then the bird said, " Nevermore 1 " 
 
 11. Startled at the stillness, broken by reply so aptly spoken, 
 " Doubtless," said I, " what it utters is its only stock and 
 
 store, 
 Caught from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful 
 
 disaster 
 Followed fast and followed faster, till his song one burden 
 
 bore 
 Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden bore, 
 Of Never nevermore !' " 
 
 12. But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling, 
 Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and 
 
 bust and door, 
 Then upon the velvet sinking, I took myself to linking 
 Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of 
 
 yore 
 What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous 
 
 bird of yore 
 
 Meant in croaking "Nevermore! " 
 
 13. Thus I sat engaged in guessing, but no sj^llable expressing 
 To the fow T l, whose fiery eyes now burned into my 
 
 bosom's core. 
 
 This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease 
 reclining 
 
 On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated 
 o'er, 
 
 But whose velvet, violet lining, with the lamp-light gloat- 
 ing o'er 
 
 She shall press ah ! nevermore !

 14. Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from an 
 
 unseen censer 
 Swung by seraphim, whose faint foot-falls tinkled on the 
 
 tufted floor. 
 " Wretch!" I cried, "thy God hath lent thee by these 
 
 angels he hath sent thee 
 Respite respite and nepenthe from thy memories of 
 
 Lenore 1 
 Quaff, O quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this losi 
 
 Lenore! " 
 
 Quoth the raven, "Nevermore!" 
 
 15. " Prophet! " said I, " thing of evil ! prophet still, if bird 
 
 or devil ! 
 Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here 
 
 ashore, 
 Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land 
 
 enchanted 
 On this home by Horror haunted tell me truly, I implore 
 Is there is there balm in Gilead ? tell me tell me, I 
 
 implore ! " 
 
 Quoth the raven, " Nevermore! " 
 
 16. "Prophet!" said I, " thing of evil ! prophet still, if bird 
 
 or devil ! 
 By that heaven that bends above us by that God we 
 
 both adore, 
 Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if, within the distant 
 
 Aidenn, 
 It shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels name 
 
 Lenore ; 
 Clasp a fair and radiant maiden, whom the angels name 
 
 Lenore ! " 
 
 Quoth the raven, " Nevermore ! " 
 
 17. "Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!" I 
 
 shrieked upstarting 
 "Get thee back into the tempest and Night's Plutonian 
 
 shore ! 
 Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath 
 
 spoken !

 Leave my loneliness unbroken! quit the bust above my 
 
 door! 
 Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form 
 
 from off my door ! " 
 
 Quoth the raven, ' ' Nevermore ! " 
 
 .8. And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting 
 On the placid bust of Pallas, just above my chamber door; 
 And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon that is 
 
 dreaming, 
 And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow 
 
 on the floor ; 
 And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on 
 the floor, 
 
 Shall be lifted nevermore ! 
 
 Evening at the Farm. 
 
 J. T. TROWBRIDGE. 
 
 1. Over the hill the farm-boy goes; 
 
 His shadow lengthens along the land, 
 A giant staff in a giant hand ; 
 In the poplar-tree, above the spring, 
 The katy-did begins to sing ; 
 
 The early dews are falling ; 
 Into the stone-heap darts the mink : 
 The swallows skim the rivers brink ; 
 And home to the woodland fly the crows, 
 When over the hill the farm-boy goes, 
 Cheerily calling, 
 
 11 Co', boss! co', boss! co'! co'! co'!" 
 Farther, farther, over the hill, 
 Faintly calling, calling still, 
 
 " Co', boss! co', boss ! co'! co'! co'!' 
 
 2. Now to her task the milkmaid goes. 
 
 The cattle come crowding through the gate, 
 Lowing, pushing, little and great ; 
 About the trough, by the farm-yard pump, 
 The frolicsome yearlings frisk and jump, 
 While the pleasant dews are falling;

 The new milch heifer is quick and shy, 
 But the old cow waits with tranquil eye, 
 And the white stream into the bright pail flows, 
 When to her task the milkmaid goes, 
 
 Soothingly calling : 
 " So, boss ! so, boss ! so ! so ! so ! " 
 The cheerful milkmaid takes her stool, 
 And sits and milks in the twilight cool, 
 
 Saying, "So! so, boss! so! so! " 
 
 3. To supper at last the farmer goes. 
 The apples are pared, the paper read, 
 The stories are told, then all to bed. 
 Without, the crickets' ceaseless song 
 Makes shrill the silence all night long ; 
 
 The heavy dews are falling. 
 The housewife's hand has turned the lock; 
 Drowsily ticks the kitchen clock ; 
 The household sinks to deep repose, 
 But still in sleep the farm-boy goes, 
 
 Singing, calling 
 u Co', boss! co', boss! co'! co'! co'! " 
 And oft the milkmaid, in her dreams, 
 Drums in the pail with the flashing streams, 
 Murmuring, "So, boss! so!" 
 
 Pyramus and Thisbe. 
 
 JOHN G. SAXE. 
 
 1. This tragical tale, which they say is a true one, 
 Is old ; but the manner is wholly a new one. 
 One Ovid, a writer of some reputation, 
 Has told it before in a tedious narration, 
 In a style, to be sure, of remarkable fullness, 
 But which nobody reads on account of its dullness. 
 Young Peter Pyramus I call him Peter, 
 Not for the sake of the rhyme or the meter; 
 But merely to make the name completer 
 For Peter lived in the olden times, 
 And in one of the worst of pagan climes

 That flourish now in classical fame, 
 Long before either noble or boor 
 Had such a thing as a Christian name. 
 Young Peter, then, was a nice young beau 
 As any young lady would wish to know ; 
 In years, I ween, he was rather green ; 
 That is to say, he was just eighteen 
 A trifle too short, a shaving too lean, 
 But " a nice young man " as ever was seen, 
 And fit to dance with a May-day queen ! 
 
 2. Now Peter loved a beautiful girl 
 
 As ever ensnared the heart of an earl. 
 In the magical trap of an auburn curl 
 A little Miss Thisbe, who lived next door. 
 (They dwelt, in fact, on the very same floor 
 With a wall between them and nothing more 
 Those double dwellings were common of yore.) 
 And they loved each other, the legends say, 
 In that very beautiful, bountiful way, 
 That every young maid and every young blade 
 Are want to do before they grow staid, 
 And learn to love by the laws of trade ; 
 But (alack-a-day, for the girl and boy !) 
 A little impediment checked their joy, 
 And gave them awhile the deepest annoy ; 
 For some good reason, which history cloaks, 
 The match didn't happen to please the old folks! 
 
 3. So Thisbe's father and Peter's mother 
 Began the young couple to worry and bother, 
 And tried their innocent passions to smother, 
 By keeping the lovers from seeing each other! 
 But who ever heard of a marriage deterred, 
 Or even deferred, 
 
 By any contrivance so very absurd 
 As scolding the boy and caging the bird? 
 Now Peter, who wasn't discouraged at all 
 By obstacles such as the timid appal,

 Contrived to discover a hole in the wall, 
 Which wasn't so thick but removing a brick 
 Made a passage though rather provokingly small. 
 Through this little chink the lover could greet her, 
 And secrecy made their courting the sweeter, 
 While Peter kissed Thisbe, and Thisbe kissed Peter 
 For kisses, like folks with diminutive souls, 
 Will manage to creep through the smallest of holes! 
 
 4. 'Twas here that the lovers, intent upon love, 
 Made a nice little plot to meet at a spot 
 Near a mulberry- tree in a neighboring grove; 
 For the plan was all laid by the youth and the maid, 
 Whose hearts, it would seem, were uncommonly bold ones, 
 To run off and get married in spite of the old ones. 
 In the shadows of evening, as still as a mouse, 
 The beautiful maiden slipped out of the house, 
 The mulberry-tree impatient to find ; 
 While Peter, the vigilant matrons to blind, 
 Strolled leisurely out, some minutes behind. 
 While waiting alone by the trysting tree, 
 A terrible lion as e'er you set eye on, 
 Came roaring along quite horrid to see, 
 And caused the young maiden in terror to flee 
 (A lion's a creature whose regular trade is 
 Blood and u a terrible thing among ladies"), 
 And losing her veil as she ran from the wood, 
 The monster bedabbled it over with blood. 
 
 & Now Peter arriving, and seeing the veil 
 All covered o'er and reeking with gore, 
 Turned, all of a sudden, exceedingly pale, 
 And sat himself down to weep and to wail 
 For, soon as he saw the garment, poor Peter 
 Made up his mind in very short meter 
 That Thisbe was dead, and the lion had eat her! 
 So breathing a prayer, he determined to share 
 The fate of his darling, "the loved and the lost," 
 And fell on his dagger, and gave up the ghost !

 Now Thisbe returning, and viewing her beau, 
 Lying dead by her veil (which she happened to know), 
 She guessed in a moment the cause of his erring ; 
 And, seizing the knife that had taken his life, 
 In less than a jiffy was dead as a herring. 
 
 MORAL. 
 
 Young gentlemen ! pray recollect, if you please, 
 Not to make your appointments near mulberry-trees. 
 Should your mistress be missing, it shows a weak head 
 To be stabbing yourself till you know she is dead. 
 Young ladies ! you shouldn't go strolling about 
 When your anxious mammas don't know you are out ; 
 And remember that accidents often befall 
 From kissing young fellows through holes in the wall ! 
 
 Mr. Pickwick's Proposal to Mrs. Bardell. 
 
 DICKENS. 
 
 It was evident that something of great importance was in 
 contemplation ; but what that something was, not even Mrs. 
 Bardell herself had been enabled to discover. 
 
 4 'Mrs. Bardell," said Mr. Pickwick, at last, as that amiable 
 female approached the termination of a prolonged dusting of 
 the apartment. 
 
 "Sir," said Mrs. Bardell. 
 
 "Your little boy is a very long time gone." 
 
 "Why, it is a good loDg way to the Borough, sir," remon- 
 strated Mrs. Bardell . 
 
 "Ah," said Mr. Pickwick, "very true; so it is." 
 
 Mr. Pickwick relapsed into silence, and Mrs. Bardell re- 
 sumed her dusting. 
 
 "Mrs. Bardell, " said Mr. Pickwick, at the expiration of a few 
 tninutes. 
 
 "Sir," said Mrs. Bardell again. 
 
 ' ' Do you think it's a much greater expense to keep two peo- 
 ple than to keep one?" 
 
 "La, Mr. Pickwick," said Mrs. Bardell, coloring up to the 
 very border of her cap, as she fancied she observed a species of

 matrimonial twinkle in the eyes of her lodger; " La, Mr. Pick- 
 wick, what a question ! " 
 
 "Well, but do you?" inquired Mr. Pickwick. 
 
 "That depends" said Mrs. Bardell, approaching the duster 
 very near to Mr. Pickwick's elbow, which was planted on the 
 table ; "that depends a good deal upon the person, you know r , 
 Mr. Pickwick; and whether it's a saving and careful per- 
 son, sir." 
 
 "That's very true," said Mr. Pickwick; "but the person I 
 have in my eye (here he looked very hard at Mrs. Bardell) I 
 think possesses these qualities, and has, moreover, a consider- 
 able knowledge of the world, and a great deal of sharpness, 
 Mrs. Bardell, which may be of material use to me." 
 
 "La, Mr. Pickwick," said Mrs. Bardell, the crimson rising 
 to her cap-border again. 
 
 "I do," said Mr. Pickwick, growing energetic, as was his 
 wont in speaking of a subject which interested him; "I do, 
 indeed ; and to tell you the truth, Mrs. Bardell, I have made 
 up my mind." 
 
 "Dear me, sir!" exclaimed Mrs. Bardell. 
 
 "You'll think it not very strange now," said the amiable 
 Mr. Pickwick, with a good-humored glance at his companion, 
 4 ' that I never consulted you about this matter, and never men- 
 tioned it till I sent your little boy out this morning eh? " 
 
 Mrs. Bardell could only reply by a look. She had long 
 worshiped Mr. Pickwick at a distance, but here, she was all at 
 once, raised to a pinnacle to which her wildest and most ex- 
 travagant hopes had never dared to aspire. Mr. Pickwick was 
 going to propose a deliberate plan, too sent her little boy 
 to the Borough to get him out of the way how thoughtful 
 how considerate ! 
 
 " Well," said Mr. Pickwick, "what do you think? " 
 
 "O, Mr. Pickwick," said Mrs. Bardell, trembling with agi- 
 tation, "you're very kind, sir." 
 
 "It'll save you a good deal of trouble, wont it?" said Mr. 
 Pickwick. 
 
 "O, I never thought any thing of the trouble, sir," replied 
 Mrs. Bardell; "and of course, I should take more trouble to 
 please you then than ever ; but it is so kind of you, Mr. Pick- 
 wick, to have so much consideration for my loneliness."

 "Ah, to be sure," said Mr. Pickwick; "I never thought of 
 that. When I am in town you'll always have somebody to sit 
 with you. To be sure, so you will." 
 
 "I'm sure I ought to be a very happy woman," said Mrs. 
 Bardell. 
 
 "And your little boy " said Mr. Pickwick. 
 
 "Bless his heart," interposed Mrs. Bardell, with a maternal 
 sob. 
 
 "He, too, will have a companion," resumed Mr. Pickwick, 
 "a lively one, who'll teach him, I'll be bound, more tricks in 
 a week than he would ever learn in a year." And Mr. Pick- 
 wick smiled placidly. 
 
 "O you dear!" said Mrs. Bardell. 
 
 Mr. Pickwick started. 
 
 "O you kind, good, playful dear," said Mrs. Bardell; and 
 without more ado, she rose from her chair and flung her arms 
 around Mr. Pickwick's neck, with a cataract of tears and a 
 chorus of sobs. 
 
 "Bless my soul!", cried the astonished Mr. Pickwick; 
 " Mrs. Bardell, my good woman dear me, what a situa- 
 tion pray consider, Mrs. Bardell, don't if any body should 
 come " 
 
 "O let them come!" exclaimed Mrs. Bardell, frantically; 
 "I'll never leave you y-dear, kind, good soul;" and with these 
 words Mrs. Bardell clung the tighter. 
 
 The Bobolink. 
 
 ALDINE. 
 
 1. Once, on a golden afternoon, 
 
 With radiant faces and hearts in tune, 
 
 Two fond lovers, in dreaming mood, 
 
 Threaded a rural solitude. 
 Wholly happy, they only knew 
 That the earth was bright and the sky was blue, 
 
 That light and beauty and joy and song 
 
 Charmed the way as they passed along : 
 The air was fragrant with woodland scents ; 
 The squirrel fiisked on the roadside fence \

 And hovering near them, " Chee, chee, chink? " 
 Queried the curious bobolink, 
 Pausing and peering with sidelong head, 
 As saucily questioning all they said ; 
 While the ox-eye danced on its slender stem, 
 And all glad nature rejoiced with them. 
 Over the odorous fields were strewn 
 Wilting windrows of grass new mown, 
 And rosy billows of clover bloom 
 Surged in the sunshine and breathed perfume. 
 Swinging low on a slender limb, 
 The sparrow warbled his wedding hymn, 
 And balancing on a blackberry brier, 
 The bobolink sung with his heart on fire, 
 Chee, chee chink ! 
 "If you wish to kiss her, do! 
 Do it, do it ! You coward, you ! 
 
 Kiss her ! kiss her, kiss her ! Who will see ? 
 Only we three ! we three 1 we three I " 
 
 2. Past wide meadow-fields, lately mowed, 
 
 Wandered the indolent country road. 
 The lovers followed it, listening still, 
 And loitering slowly, as lovers will, 
 Entered a gray-roofed bridge that lay 
 Dusk and cool, in their pleasant way. 
 Under its arch a smooth, brown stream, 
 Silently glided with glint and gleam, 
 Shaded by graceful elms which spread 
 Their verdurous canopy overhead 
 The stream so narrow, the bough so wide, 
 They met and mingled across the tide. 
 Alders loved it, and seemed to keep 
 Patient watch as it lay asleep, 
 Mirroring clearly the trees and sky, 
 And the flitting form of the dragon-fly, 
 
 Save where the swift-winged swallow played 
 In and out in the sun and shade, 
 And darting and circling in merry chase, 
 Dipped and dimpled its clear, dark face.

 Fluttering lightly from brink to brink, 
 Followed the garrulous bobolink, 
 
 2. Rallying loudly with mirthful din, 
 The pair who lingered unseen within. 
 
 And when from the friendly bridge at last 
 
 Into the road beyond they passed, 
 Again beside them the tempter went, 
 Keeping the thread of his argument 
 
 "Kiss her! kiss her! chink-a-chee-chee ! 
 
 I'll not mention it ! Don't mind me ! 
 I'll be sentinel I can see 
 All around from this tall birch tree ! " 
 
 But ah ! they noted nor deemed it strange 
 
 In his rollicking chorus a trifling change, 
 u Do it ! do it ! " with might and main 
 Warbled the tell-tale " Do it again! " 
 
 Pictures of Memory. 
 
 ALICE CABY. 
 
 Among the beautiful pictures 
 
 That hang on Memory's wall, 
 Is one of a dim old forest, 
 
 That seemeth best of all. 
 Not for its gnarled oaks olden, 
 
 Dark with the mistletoe ; 
 Not for the violets golden 
 
 That sprinkle the vale below; 
 Not for the milk-white lilies 
 
 That lean from the fragrant ledge, 
 Coquetting all day with the sunbeams, 
 
 And stealing their golden edge ; 
 Not for the vines on the upland 
 
 Where the bright red berries rest, 
 Nor the pinks, nor the pale, sweet cowslip, 
 
 It seemeth to me the best.

 2. I once had a little brother 
 
 With eyes that were dark and deep; 
 In the lap of that dim old forest, 
 
 He lieth in peace asleep. 
 Light as the down of the thistle, 
 
 Free as the winds that blow, 
 We roved there, the beautiful summers, 
 
 The summers of long ago ; 
 But his feet on the hills grew weary, 
 
 And, one of the autumn eves, 
 I made for my little brother 
 
 A bed of the yellow leaves. 
 
 3. Sweetly his pale arms folded 
 
 My neck in a meek embrace, 
 As the light of immortal beauty 
 
 Silently covered his face ; 
 And when the arrows of sunset 
 
 Lodged in the tree-tops bright, 
 He fell, in his saint-like beauty, 
 
 Asleep by the gates of light. 
 
 4. Therefore, of all the pictures 
 
 That hang on Memory's wall, 
 The one of the dim old forest 
 Seemeth the best of all. 
 
 Sandalphon. 
 
 H. W. LONGFELLOW. 
 
 1. Have you read in the Talmud of old, 
 In the Legends the Rabbins have told 
 
 Of the limitless realms of the air, 
 Have you read it, the marvelous story 
 Of Sandalphon, the Angel of Glory, 
 
 Sandalphon, the Angel of Prayer ? 
 
 2. How, erect, at the outermost gates 
 Of the City Celestial he waits,

 With his feet on the ladder of light, 
 That, crowded with angels unnumbered, 
 By Jacob was seen, as he slumbered 
 
 Alone in the desert at night ? 
 
 3. The Angels of Wind and of Fire 
 Chant only one hymn, and expire 
 
 With the song's irresistible stress ; 
 Expire in their rapture and wonder, 
 As harp -strings are broken asunder 
 
 By music they throb to express. 
 
 4. But, serene in the rapturous throng, 
 Unmoved by the rush of the song, 
 
 With eyes unimpassioned and slow, 
 Among the dead angels, the deathless 
 Sandalphon stands listening, breathless, 
 
 To sounds that ascend from below ; 
 
 5. From the spirits on Earth that adore, 
 From the souls that entreat and implore 
 
 In the fervor and passion of prayer ; 
 From the hearts that are broken with losses, 
 And weary with dragging the crosses 
 
 Too heavy for mortals to bear. 
 
 tf . And he gathers the prayers as he stands, 
 And they change into flowers in his hands, 
 
 Into garlands of purple and red ; 
 And beneath the great arch of the portal, 
 Through the streets of the City Immortal 
 
 Is wafted the fragrance they shed. 
 
 7. It is but a legend, I know, 
 A fable, a phantom, a show, 
 
 Of the ancient Rabbinical lore : 
 Yet the old mediaeval tradition, 
 The beautiful, strange superstition, 
 
 But haunts me and holds me the more.

 8. When I look from my window at night, 
 And the welkin above is all white, 
 
 All throbbing and panting with stars, 
 Among them majestic is standing 
 Sandalphon the angel, expanding 
 
 His pinions in nebulous bars. 
 
 9. And the legend, I feel, is a part 
 
 Of the hunger and thirst of the heart, 
 
 The frenzy and fire of the brain, 
 That grasps at the fruitage forbidden, 
 The golden pomegranates of Eden, 
 To quiet its fever and pain. 
 
 The Blacksmith's Story. 
 
 FRANK OLIVE. 
 
 1. Well, no! My wife aint dead, sir, but I've lost her all 
 
 the same ; 
 She left me voluntarily, and neither was to blame. 
 It's rather a queer story, and I think you will agree 
 When you hear the circumstances 'twas rather rough on 
 
 me. 
 
 2. She was a soldier's widow. He was killed at Malvern Hill ; 
 And when I married her she seemed to sorrow for him still; 
 But I brought her here to Kansas, and I never want to see 
 A better wife than Mary was for five bright years to me. 
 
 3. The change of scene brought cheerfulness, and soon a rosy 
 
 glow 
 Of happiness warmed Mary's cheeks and melted all their 
 
 snow. 
 I think she loved me some, I'm bound to think that of 
 
 her, sir; 
 And as for me, I can't begin to tell how I loved her! 
 
 4. Three years ago the baby came our humble home to bless; 
 And then I reckon I was nigh to perfect happiness ;

 'Twas hers, 'twas mine ; but I've no language to explain 
 
 to you, 
 How that little girl's weak fingers our hearts together 
 
 drew! 
 
 5. Once we watched it through a fever, and with each gasp- 
 
 ing breath, 
 Dumb with an awful, wordless woe, we waited for its 
 
 death; 
 And, though I'm not a pious man, our souls together there, 
 For Heaven to spare our darling, went up in voiceless 
 
 prayer. 
 
 6. And, when the doctor said 'twould live, our joy what 
 
 words could tell? 
 Clasped in each other's arms, our grateful tears together 
 
 fell. 
 Sometimes, you see, the shadow fell across our little nest, 
 But it only made the sunshine seem a doubly welcome 
 
 guest. 
 
 7. Work came to me a plenty, and I kept the anvil ringing ; 
 Early and late you'd find me there a-hammering and sing- 
 ing; 
 
 Love nerved my arm to labor, and moved my tongue to 
 
 song, 
 And, though my singing wasn't sweet, it was tremendous 
 
 strong ! 
 
 8. One day a one-armed stranger stopped to have me nail a 
 
 shoe, 
 And, while I was at work, we passed a compliment or two; 
 I asked him how he lost his arm. He said 'twas shot away 
 At Malvern Hill. "Malvern Hill ! Did you know Robert 
 
 May?" 
 
 9. "That's me," said he. "You, you!" I gasped, choking 
 
 with horrid doubt ; 
 " If you're the man, just follow me; we'll try this mystery 
 out!"

 With dizzy steps, I led him in to Mary. God! 'Twas 
 
 true ! 
 Then the bitterest pangs of misery, unspeakable, I knew. 
 
 10. Frozen with deadly horror, she stared with eyes of stone, 
 And from her quivering lips there broke one wild, de- 
 spairing moan. 
 
 'Twas he I the husband of her youth, now risen from the 
 
 dead, 
 But all too late ; and, with bitter cry, her senses fled. 
 
 11. "What could be done ? He was reported dead. On his re- 
 
 turn 
 He strove in vain some tidings of his absent wife to learn. 
 'Twas well that he was innocent! Else I'd have killed 
 
 him, too, 
 So dead he never would have riz till Gabriel's trumpet 
 
 blew! 
 
 12. It was agreed that Mary then between us should decide, 
 And each by her decision would sacredly abide. 
 
 No sinner, at the judgment-seat, waiting eternal doom, 
 Could suffer what I did, while waiting sentence in that 
 room. 
 
 13. Rigid and breathless, there we stood, with nerves as tense 
 
 as steel, 
 While Mary's eyes sought each white face, in piteous ap- 
 peal. 
 God ! could not woman's duty be less hardly reconciled 
 Between her lawful husband and the father of her child ? 
 
 14. Ah, how my heart was chilled to ice, when she knelt down 
 
 and said, 
 "Forgive me, John! He is my husband ! Here! Alive! 
 
 not dead ! " 
 I raised her tenderly, and tried to tell her she was right, 
 But somehow, in my aching breast, the prisoned words 
 
 stuck tight !

 15. "But, John, I can't leave baby." "What! wife and 
 
 child ! " cried I ; 
 " Must I yield all ! Ah, cruel fate ! Better that I should 
 
 die. 
 Think of the long, sad, lonely hours, waiting in gloom for 
 
 me, 
 No wife to cheer me with her love, no babe to climb my 
 
 knee! 
 
 16. And yet you are her mother, and the sacred mother-love 
 Is still the purest, tenderest tie that Heaven ever wove. 
 Take her; but promise, Mary, for that will bring no 
 
 shame, 
 My little girl shall bear, and learn to lisp, her father's 
 name ! " 
 
 17. It may be, in the life to come, I'll meet my child and wife; 
 But yonder, by my cottage gate, we parted for this life ; 
 One long hand-clasp from Mary, and my dream of love was 
 
 done ! 
 One long embrace from baby, and my happiness was gone ! 
 
 Toussaint L'Ouverture. 
 
 WENDELL PHILLIPS. 
 
 If I were to tell you the story of Napoleon, I should take it 
 from the lips of Frenchmen, who find no language rich enough 
 to paint the great captain of the nineteenth century. Were I 
 to tell you the story of Washington, I should take it from 
 your hearts you who think no marble white enough on which 
 to carve the name of the father of his country. But I am to 
 tell you the story of a Negro, Toussaint L'Ouverture, who has 
 left hardly one written line. I am to glean it from the reluct- 
 ant testimony of his enemies, men who despised him because he 
 was a Negro and a slave, hated him because he had beaten 
 them in battle. 
 
 Cromwell manufactured his own army. Napoleon, at the 
 age of twenty-seven, was placed at the head of the best troops 
 Europe ever saw. Cromwell never saw an army till he was

 forty ; this man never saw a soldier till he was fifty. Crom- 
 well manufactured his own army out of what ? Englishmen 
 ^the best blood in Europe. Out of the middle class of En- 
 glishmen the best blood of the island. And with it he con- 
 quered what ? Englishmen their equals. This man manu- 
 factured his army out of what ? Out of what you call the 
 despicable race of Negroes, debased, demoralized by two hun- 
 dred years of slavery, one hundred thousand of them imported 
 into the island within four years, unable to speak a dialect 
 intelligible even to each other. Yet out of this mixed, and, 
 as you say, despicable mass he forged a thunder-bolt and 
 hurled it at what ? At the proudest blood in Europe, the 
 Spaniard, and sent him home conquered ; at the most warlike 
 blood in Europe, the French, and put them under his feet ; 
 at the pluckiest blood in Europe, the English, and they 
 skulked home to Jamaica. Now, if Cromwell was a general, 
 at least this man was a soldier. 
 
 Now, blue-eyed Saxon, proud of your race, go back with me 
 to the commencement of the century, and select what states- 
 man you please. Let him be either American or European ; 
 let him have a brain the result of six generations of culture ; 
 let him have the ripest training of university routine ; let him 
 add to it the better education of practical life ; crown his tem- 
 ple with the silver locks of seventy years, and show me the 
 man of Saxon lineage for whom his most sanguine admirer will 
 wreathe a laurel rich as embittered foes have placed on the 
 brow of this Negro rare military skill, profound knowledge 
 of human nature, content to blot out all party distinctions, and 
 trust a State to the blood of its sons anticipating Sir Robert 
 Peel fifty years, and taking his station by the side of Roger 
 Williams before any Englishman or American had won the 
 right ; and yet this is the record which the history of rival 
 Slates makes up for this inspired black of St. Domingo. 
 
 Some doubt the courage of the Negro. Go to Hayti, and 
 stand on those fifty thousand graves of the best soldiers France 
 ever had, and ask them what they think of the Negro's sword. 
 
 I would call him Napoleon, but Napoleon made his way to 
 empire over broken oaths and through a sea of blood. This 
 man never broke his word. I would call him Cromwell, but 
 Cromwell was only a soldier, and the State he founded went

 down with him into his grave. I would call him "Washington, 
 but the great Virginian held slaves. This man risked his 
 empire rather than permit the slave-trade in the humblest vil- 
 lage of his dominions. 
 
 You think me a fanatic, for you read history, not with your 
 eyes but with your prejudices. But fifty years hence, when 
 Truth gets a hearing, the Muse of history will put Phocion for 
 the Greek, Brutus for the Roman, Hampden for England, Fay- 
 ette for France, choose "Washington as the bright consummate 
 flower of our earlier civilization, then, dipping her pen in 
 the sunlight, will write in the clear blue, above them all, the 
 name of the soldier, the statesman, the martyr, Toussaint

 Sol. How now, Shylock; Avhat news among the merchants ? 
 
 Shy. You knew, none so well, none so well as you, of my 
 daughter's flight. 
 
 Sol. That's certain; I, for my part, knew the tailor that 
 made the wings she flew withal. 
 
 Sala. And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was 
 fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all to leave 
 the dam. 
 
 Shy. She is damned for it. 
 
 Sol. That's certain, if the devil may be her judge. 
 
 Shy. My own flesh and blood to rebel ! 
 
 Sala. But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had 
 any loss at sea or no? 
 
 Shy. There I have made another bad match : a bankrupt, a 
 prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the Rialto; a 
 beggar, that was used to come so smug upon the mart. Let 
 him look to his bond : he was wont to call me usurer ; let him 
 look to his bond : he was wont to lend money for a Christian 
 courtesy ; let him look to his bond.

 flesh; what's that good for?

 will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and hindered 
 me half a million; laughed at my losses, mocked at my 
 gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled my 
 friends, heated mine enemies; and what's his reason? I am 
 a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes ? hath not a Jew hands, organs, 
 dimensions, senses, affections, passions ? fed with the same 
 food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same dis- 
 eases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the 
 same winter and summer as a Christian is ? If you prick us, 
 do we not bleed ? if you tickle us, do we not laugh ? if you 
 poison us, do we not die ? and if you wrong us, shall we not 
 revenge ? if we are like you in the rest, we will resemble you 
 in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian, what is his humility ? 
 revenge. If a Christian wrong a Jew, what should his suffer- 
 ance be by Christian example ? why, revenge. The villainy 
 you teach me I will execute ; and it shall go hard but I will 
 better the instruction.

 Shy. How now, Tubal, what news from Genoa ? hast thou 
 found my daughter ? 
 
 Tub. I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find 
 her. 
 
 Shy. Why, there, there, there, there ! a diamond gone, cost 
 me two thousand ducats in Frankfort ! The curse never fell 
 upon our nation till now ; I never felt it till now : two thou- 
 sand ducats in that; and other precious, precious jewels. I 
 would my daughter were dead at my foot, and the jewels in 
 her ear ! would she was hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in 
 her coffin ! No news of them ? Why, so : and I know not 
 what's spent in the search. Why, thou loss upon loss ! the thief 
 gone with so much, and so much to find the thief ; and no 
 satisfaction, no revenge; nor no ill luck stirring but what 
 lights o' my shoulders; no sighs but o' my breathing; no 
 tears but o' my shedding. 
 
 Tub. Yes, other men have ill luck too ; Antonio, as I heard 
 in Genoa, 
 
 Shy. What, what, what ? ill luck, ill luck, ill luck ? 
 
 Tub. Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.

 Tub. I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the 
 wreck. 
 
 Shy. I thank thee, good Tubal; good news, good news: 
 ha! ha! Where ? in Genoa ? 
 
 Tub. Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, one night, 
 fourscore ducats. 
 
 Shy. Thou stick'st a dagger in me : I shall never see my gold 
 again. Fourscore ducats at a sitting! fourscore ducats! 
 
 Tub. There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my com- 
 pany to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break. 
 
 Shy. I am very glad of it : I'll plague him ; I'll torture him ; 
 I am glad of it. 
 
 Tvh. One of them shewed me a ring, that he had of your 
 daughter for a monkey. 
 
 Shy. Out upon her ! Thou torturest me, Tubal : it was my 
 torquoise: I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor: I would 
 not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys. 
 
 Tvb. But Antonio is certainly undone. 
 
 Shy. Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee me an 
 officer, bespeak him a fortnight before : I will have the heart 
 of him, if he forfeit ; for were he out of Venice, I can make 
 what merchandise I will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our 
 synagogue ; go, good Tubal ; at our synagogue, Tubal.

 Why don't you tell me, like a man,

 The green beneath and the blue above, 
 And dash and danger, and life and love, 
 And Lasca!

 With blue serdpe and bright-belled spur ; 
 I laughed with joy when I looked at her! 
 Little knew she of books or creeds ; 
 An Ave Maria sufficed her needs ; 
 Little she cared, save to be by my side, 
 To ride with me, and ever to ride, 
 From San Saba's shore to Lavaca's tide. 
 She was as bold as the billows that beat, 
 She was as wild as the breezes that blow; 
 From her little head to her little feet 
 She was swayed, in her suppleness, to and fro 
 By each gust of passion ; a sapling pine, 
 That grows on the edge of a Kansas bluff, 
 And wars with the wind when the weather is rough, 
 Is like this Lasca, this love of mine. 
 She would hunger that i might eat, 
 Would take the bitter and leave me the sweet; 
 But once, when I made her jealous for fun, 
 At something I'd whispered, or looked, or done, 
 One Sunday, in San Antonio, 
 To a glorious girl on the Alamo, 
 She drew from her girdle a dear little dagger, 
 And sting of a wasp ! It made me stagger ! 
 An inch to the left or an inch to the right, 
 And I shouldn't be maundering here to-night; 
 But she sobbed, and, sobbing, so swiftly bound 
 Her torn reboso about the wound 
 That I quite forgave her. Scratches don't count 
 In Texas, down by the Rio Grande. 
 
 o. Her eye was brown a deep, deep brown ; 
 Her hair was darker than her eye ; 
 And something in her smile and frown, 
 Curled crimson lip, and instep high, 
 Showed that there ran in each blue vein, 
 Mixed with the milder Aztec strain, 
 The vigorous vintage of old Spain. 
 The air was heavy, the night was hot, 
 I sat by her side, and forgot forgot ;

 Forgot the herd that were taking their rest ; 
 Forgot that the air was close opprest, 
 That the Texas norther comes sudden and soon, 
 In the dead of night or the blaze of noon; 
 That once let the herd at its breath take fright, 
 And nothing on earth can stop the flight ; 
 And woe to the rider, and woe to the steed, 
 Who falls in front of their mad stampede ! 
 Was that thunder? No, by the Lord ! 
 I spring to my saddle without a word. 
 One foot on mine, and she clung behind. 
 Away on a hot chase down the wind ! 
 But never was fox-hunt half so hard, 
 And never was steed so little spared. 
 For we rode for our lives. You shall hear how we fared 
 In Texas, down by the Rio Grande. 
 
 4. The mustang flew, and we urged him on ; 
 There is one chance left, and you have but one 
 Halt, jump to ground, and shoot your horse ; 
 Crouch under his carcass, and take your chance ; 
 And if the steers, in their frantic course, 
 
 Don't batter you both to pieces at once, 
 You may thank your star ; if not, good-bye 
 To the quickening kiss and the long-drawn sigh, 
 And the open air and the open sky, 
 
 In Texas, down by the Rio Grande. 
 
 5. The cattle gained on us and then I felt 
 For my old six-shooter, behind in my belt ; 
 Down came the mustang, and down came we, 
 Clinging together, and what was the rest? 
 A body that spread itself on my breast, 
 Two arms that shielded my dizzy head, 
 Two lips that hard on my lips were pressed; 
 Then came thunder in my ears 
 
 As over us surged the sea of steers; 
 Blows that beat blood into my eyes, 
 And when I could rise 
 Lasca was dead.

 6. I dug out a grave a few feet deep, 
 
 And there in Earth's arms I laid her to sleep; 
 
 And where she is lying no one knows, 
 
 And the summer shines and the winter snows ; 
 
 And for many a day the flowers have spread 
 
 A pall of petals over her head ; 
 
 And the little gray hawk hangs aloof in the air, 
 
 And the sly coyote trots here and there, 
 
 And the black snake glides and glitters and slides 
 
 Into the rift in a cotton- wood tree ; 
 
 And the buzzard sails on, 
 
 And comes and is gone. 
 
 Stately and still as a ship at sea ; 
 
 And I wonder why I do not care 
 
 For the things that are like the things that were. 
 
 Does half my heart lie buried there 
 
 In Texas, down by the Rio Grande? 
 
 No Sects in Heaven. 
 
 MBS. E. H. J. CLEAVELAND. 
 
 1. Talking of sects till late one eve, 
 
 Of the various doctrines, the saints believe, 
 That night I stood, in a troubled dream, 
 By the side of a darkly flowing stream. 
 
 2. And a Churchman down to the river came ; 
 When I heard a strange voice call his name, 
 
 1 ' Good father, stop ; when you cross this tide. 
 You must leave your robes on the other side.' 1 
 
 3. But the aged father did not mind ; 
 And his long gown floated out behind, 
 As down to the stream his way he took, 
 His pale hands clasping a gilt-edged book : 
 
 4. " I'm bound for Heaven; and, when I'm there, 
 I shall want my Book of Common Prayer; 
 And, though I put on a starry crown, 
 
 I should feel (juite lost without my gown."

 5. Then he fixed his eyes on the shining track, 
 But his gown was heavy and held him back, 
 And the poor old father tried in vain, 
 
 A single step in the flood to gain. 
 
 6. I saw him again on the other side, 
 But his silk gown floated on the tide ; 
 And no one asked in that blissful spot, 
 Whether he belonged to " the Church " or not. 
 
 7. Then down to the river a Quaker strayed; 
 His dress of a sober hue was made : 
 "My coat and hat must all be gray 
 
 I cannot go any other way." 
 
 8. Then he buttoned his coat straight up to his chin, 
 And staidly, solemnly, waded in, 
 
 And his broad-brimmed hat he pulled down tight 
 Over his forehead so cold and white. 
 
 9. But a strong wind carried away his hat ; 
 A moment he silently sighed over that ; 
 And then, as he gazed on the farther shore, 
 His coat slipped off, and was seen no more ; 
 
 10. As he entered Heaven, his suit of gray 
 "Went quietly sailing, away, away ; 
 And none of the angels questioned him 
 About the width of his beaver's brim. 
 
 11. Next came Dr. Watts, with a bundle of psalms 
 Tied nicely up in his aged arms, 
 
 And hymns as many a very wise thing 
 
 That the people in Heaven, "all around " might sing. 
 
 12. But I thought that he heaved an anxious sigh, 
 When he saw that the river ran broad and high, 
 And looked rather surprised, as one by one 
 
 The psalms and the hymns in the waves went down. 
 
 13. And after him, with his MSS., 
 
 Came Wesley, the pattern of godliness ;

 But he cried, " Dear me ! what shall I do ? 
 
 The water has soaked them through and through." 
 
 14. And there on the river, far and wide, 
 Away they went down the swollen tide ; 
 
 And the saint, astonished, passed through alone, 
 Without his manuscripts, up to the throne. 
 
 15. Then, gravely walking, two saints by name 
 Down to the river together came ; 
 
 But, as they stopped at the river's brink, 
 I saw one saint from the other shrink. 
 
 16. " Sprinkled or plunged ? may I ask you friend, 
 How you attained to life's great end I " 
 
 " Thus, with a few drops on my brow," 
 
 "But /have been dipped, as you'll see me now; 
 
 17. " And I really think it will hardly do, 
 
 As I'm ' close communion,' to cross with you: 
 You're bound, I know, to the realms of bliss, 
 But you must go that way, and I'll go this." 
 
 18. Then straightway plunging with all his might, 
 Away to the left his friend to the right 
 Apart they went from this world of sin, 
 
 But at last together they entered in. 
 
 19. And now, when the river was rolling on, 
 A Presbyterian Church went down; 
 
 Of women there seemed an innumerable throng, 
 But the men I could count as they passed along. 
 
 30. And concerning the road they could never agree, 
 The old or the new way, which it could be, 
 
 Nor ever a moment paused to think 
 That both would lead to the river's brink. 
 
 31. And a sound of murmuring, long and loud, 
 Came ever up from the moving crowd : 
 "You're in the old way, and I'm in the new; 
 That is the false, and this is the true : "

 Or, " I'm in the old way, and you're in the new; 
 That is the false, and this is the true." 
 
 22. But the brethren only seemed to speak: 
 Modest the sisters walked and meek, 
 And, if one of them ever chanced to say 
 What troubles she met with on the way, 
 How she longed to pass to the other side, 
 Nor feared to cross over the swelling tide, 
 A voice arose from the brethren then : 
 "Let no one speak but the 'holy men; ' 
 For have ye not heard the words of Paul, 
 1 O, let the women keep silence all ? ' " 
 
 23. I watched them long in my curious dream, 
 Till they stood by the borders of the stream: 
 Then, just as I thought, the two ways met; 
 But all the brethren were talking yet, 
 
 And would talk on till the heaving tide 
 Carried them over side by side 
 Side by side, for the way was one : 
 The toilsome journey of life was done ; 
 And all who in Christ the Saviour died 
 Came out alike on the other side. 
 
 24. No forms or crosses or books had they; 
 No gowns of silk or suits of gray; 
 
 No creeds to guide them, or MSS., 
 
 For all had put on Christ's righteousness.

 The swift g. m., Old Hiram's nag, 
 The fleet s. h., Don Pfeiffer's brag, 
 With these a third and who is he 
 That stands beside his fast b. g. ? 
 Budd Doble, whose catarrhal name 
 So fills the nasal trump of fame. 
 There, too, stood many a noted steed 
 Of Messenger, and Morgan breed ; 
 Green horses also, not a few 
 Unknown as yet what they could do ; 
 And all the hacks that know so well 
 The scourgings of the Sunday swell. 
 
 2. Blue are the skies of opening day ; 
 The bordering turf is green with May; 
 The sunshine's golden gleam is thrown 
 On sorrel, chestnut, bay, and roan ; 
 The horses paw and prance and neigh; 
 Fillies and colts like kittens play, 
 And dance and toss their rippled manes 
 Shining and soft as silken skeins; 
 Wagons and gigs are ranged about, 
 And fashion flaunts her gay turnout : 
 Here stands each youthful Jehu's dream 
 The jointed tandem, ticklish team ! 
 
 And there in ampler breadth expand 
 The splendors of the four-in-hand ; 
 On faultless ties and glossy tiles 
 The lovely bonnets beam their smiles ; 
 (The style's the man, so books avow ; 
 The style's the woman anyhow ;) 
 From flounces frothed with creamy lace 
 Peeps out the pug-dog's smutty face, 
 Or spaniel rolls his liquid eye, 
 Or stares the wiry pet of Skye, 
 O woman, in your hours of ease 
 So shy with ua ; so free with these!

 Pray listen till my story's through. 
 
 4. Scarce noticed, back behind the rest, 
 By cart and wagon rudely prest, 
 The parson's lean and bony bay, 
 Stood harnessed in his one-horse shay 
 Lent to his sexton for the day. 
 
 (A funeral so the sexton said ; 
 
 His mother's uncle's wife was dead.) 
 
 Like Lazarus bid to Dives's feast, 
 
 So looked the poor forlorn old beast ; 
 
 His coat was rough, his tail was bare, 
 
 The gray was sprinkled in his hair : 
 
 Sportsmen and jockeys knew him not, 
 
 And yet they say he once could trot 
 
 Among the fleetest of the town, 
 
 Till something cracked and broke him down-^ 
 
 The steed's the statesman's common lot! 
 
 "And are we then so soon forgot ? " 
 
 Ah me ! I doubt if one of you 
 
 Has ever heard the name " Old Blue," 
 
 Whose fame through all this region rung 
 
 In those old days when I was young ! 
 
 5. " Bring forth the horse ! " Alas ! he showed 
 Not like the one Mazeppa rode : 
 Scant-maned, sharp-backed and shaky-kneed, 
 The wreck of what was once a steed 
 
 Lips thin, eyes hollow, stiff in joints ; 
 Yet not without his knowing points. 
 The sexton laughing in his sleeve, 
 As if 'twere all a make-believe, 
 Led forth the horse, and as he laughed 
 Unhitched the breeching from a shaft, 
 Unclasped the rusty belt beneath, 
 Drew forth the snaffle from his teeth, 
 Slipped off his head-stall, set him free 
 From strap and rein a sight to see !

 6. So worn, so lean in every limb, 
 
 It can't be they are saddling him ! 
 It is ! His back the pig-skin strides, 
 And flaps his lank rheumatic sides; 
 With look of mingled scorn and mirth 
 They buckle round the saddle-girth ; 
 With horsey wink and saucy toss 
 A youngster throws his leg across. 
 And so, his rider on his back, 
 They lead him, limping, to the track, 
 Far up behind the starting-point, 
 To limber out each stiffened joint. 
 
 7. As through the jeering crowd he passed, 
 One pitying look old Hiram cast ; 
 
 " Go it, ye cripple, while ye can ! " 
 Cried out unsentimental Dan ; 
 " A fast-day dinner for the crows ! " 
 Budd Doble's scoffing shout arose, 
 
 8. Slowly, as when the walking-beam 
 First feels the gathering head of steam, 
 With warning cough and threatening wheeze 
 The stiff old charger crooks his knees ; 
 
 At first with cautious step sedate, 
 As if he dragged a coach of state ; 
 He's not a colt ; he knows full well 
 That time is weight and sure to tell ; 
 No horse so sturdy but he fears 
 The handicap of twenty years. 
 
 9. As through the throng on either hand 
 The old horse nears the judges' stand, 
 Beneath his jockey's feather-weight 
 He warms a little to his gait, 
 
 And now and then a step is tried 
 That hints at something like a stride. 
 
 10. " Go ! " Through his ear the summons stung, 
 As if a battle-trump had rung ; 
 The slumbering instincts long unstirred 
 Start at the old familiar word ;

 It thrills like flame through every limb 
 What mean his twenty years to him ? 
 The savage blow his rider dealt 
 Fell on his hollow flanks unf elt ; 
 The spur that pricked his staring hide 
 Unheeded tore his bleeding side ; 
 Alike to him are spur and rein 
 He steps a five-year-old again ! 
 
 11. Before a quarter pole was passed, 
 Old Hiram said, " He's going fast." 
 Long ere the quarter was a half, 
 The chuckling crowd had ceased to laugh ; 
 Tighter his frightened jockey clung 
 As in a mighty stride he swung, 
 The gravel flying in his track, 
 His neck stretched out, his ears laid back, 
 His tail extended all the while 
 Behind him like a rat-tail file ! 
 Off went a shoe away it spun, 
 Shot like a bullet from a gun ; 
 The quaking jockey shapes a prayer 
 From scraps of oaths he used to swear; 
 He drops his whip, he drops his rein, 
 He clutches fiercely for a mane ; 
 He'll lose his hold he sways and reels 
 He'll slide beneath those trampling heels ! 
 The knees of many a horseman quake, 
 The flowers on many a bonnet shake, 
 And shouts arise from left and right, 
 "Stick on! stick on!" " Hould tight! hould 
 
 tight!" 
 " Cling round his neck; and don't let go 
 That pace can't hold there! steady! whoa! w 
 But, like the sable steed that bore 
 The spectral lover of Lenore, 
 His nostrils snorting foam and fire, 
 No stretch his bony limbs can tire ; 
 And now the stand he rushes by, 
 And " Stop him ! stop him ! " is the cry.

 12. " Stand back! he's only just begun 
 He's having out three heats in one ! " 
 
 " Don't rush in front! he'll smash your brains; 
 
 But follow up and grab the reins ! " 
 
 Old Hiram spoke. Dan Pfeiffer heard, 
 
 And sprang, impatient, at the word : 
 
 Budd Doble started on his bay, 
 
 Old Hiram followed on his gray, 
 
 And oif they spring, and round they go, 
 
 The fast ones doing " all they know," 
 
 Look ! twice they follow at his heels, 
 
 As round the circling course he wheels, 
 
 And whirls with him that clinging boy 
 
 Like Hector round the walls of Troy. 
 
 Still on, and on, the third time round ! 
 
 They're tailing off ! they're losing ground ! 
 
 Budd Doble's nag begins to fail ! 
 
 Dan PfeifEer's sorrel whisks his tail ! 
 
 And see ! in spite of whip and shout, 
 
 Old Hiram's mare is giving out ! 
 
 13. Now for the finish! At the turn, 
 The old horse all the rest astern 
 Comes swinging in, with easy trot ; 
 By Jove ! he's distanced all the lot ! 
 That trot no mortal could explain ; 
 
 Some said, " Old Dutchman come again! " 
 Some took his time at least, they tried, 
 But what it was could none decide ; 
 One said he couldn't understand 
 What happened to his second-hand ; 
 One said 2:10; that couldn't be 
 More like two twenty-two or three ; 
 Old Hiram settled it at last : 
 " The time was two too mighty fast! " 
 
 14. The parson's horse had won the bet ; 
 It cost him something of a sweat ; 
 Back in the one-horse shay he went. 
 The parson wondered what it meant,

 And murmured, with a mild surprise 
 
 And pleasant twinkle of the eyes, 
 
 "That funeral must have been a trick, 
 
 Or corpses drive at double quick ; 
 
 I shouldn't wonder, I declare, 
 
 If Brother Murray made the prayer ! " 
 
 And this is all I have to say 
 
 About the parson's poor old bay, 
 
 The same that drew the one-horse shay. 
 
 Moral for which this tale is told : 
 
 A horse can trot, for all he's old.

 Near to the nest of his little dame, 
 Over the mountain-side or mead,

 Look, what a nice new coat is mine, 
 Sure there was never a bird so fine.

 One weak chirp is her only note, 
 Braggart and prince of braggarts is he,

 Never was I afraid of man ; 
 Catch me, cowardly knaves, if you can.

 5. Six white eggs on a bed of hay, 
 
 Flecked with purple, a pretty sight ! 
 There, as the mother sits all day, 
 Robert is singing with all his might :

 Spink, spank, spink; 
 Nice good wife, that never goes out, 
 Keeping house while I frolic about.

 Six wide mouths are open for food ; 
 Robert of Lincoln bestirs him well, 
 Gathering seed for the hungry brood.

 This new life is likely to be 
 Hard for a gay young fellow like me.

 When you can pipe that merry old strain, 
 Robert of Lincoln, come back again.

 The Bald-Headed Man. 
 
 The other day a lady, accompanied by her son, a very small 
 boy, boarded a train at Little Rock. The woman had a care- 
 worn expression hanging over her face like a tattered veil, and 
 many of the rapid questions asked by the boy were answered 
 by unconscious sighs. 
 
 "Ma," said the boy, "that man's head is like a baby, aint 
 it ? " pointing to a bald-headed man sitting just in front of 
 them. 
 
 "Hush!" 
 
 " Why must I hush ? " 
 
 After a few moments' silence, "Ma, what's the matter 
 with that man's head ? " 
 
 " Hush, I tell you. He's bald." 
 
 "What's bald?" 
 
 "His head hasn't got any hair on it." 
 
 " Did it come off ? " 
 
 "I guess so." 
 
 "Will mine all come off ?" 
 
 " Some time, may be." 
 
 Then I'll be bald, wont I ? 
 
 "Yes."

 " Will you care ? " 
 
 "Don't ask so many questions." 
 
 After another silence, the boy exclaimed, ' ' Ma, there's a fly 
 on that man's head." 
 
 "If you don't hush, I'll whip you when we get home." 
 
 " Look ! There's another fly. Two flies, see ; em fight." 
 
 "Madam," said the man, putting aside a newspaper and 
 looking around, "what's the matter with, that young 
 hyena ? " 
 
 The woman blushed, stammered out something, and at- 
 tempted to smooth back the boy's hair. 
 
 ' ' One fly, two flies, three flies, " said the boy. 
 
 "Here, you young hedgehog, if you don't hush I'll have 
 the conductor put you off the train." 
 
 The poor woman, not knowing what else to do, boxed the 
 boy's ears, and then gave him an orange to keep him from 
 crying. 
 
 "Ma, have I got any red marks on my head ? " 
 
 " I'll whip you again if you don't hush." 
 
 "Mister," said the boy, after a short silence, "does it hurt 
 to be bald-headed ? " 
 
 "Youngster," said the man, "if you'll keep quiet, I'll give 
 you a quarter." 
 
 The boy promised, and the money was paid over. 
 
 " This is my bald-headed money," said the boy. "When I 
 get bald-headed, I'm goin' to give boys money. Mister, have 
 all bald-headed men got money ? "

 1. You needn't be trying to comfort me: I tell you my dolly 
 
 is dead ! 
 There's no use in saying she isn't, with a crack like that in 
 
 her head ! 
 It's just like you said it wouldn't hurt much to have my 
 
 tooth out that day ; 
 And then, when the man most pulled my head off, you 
 
 hadn't a word to say.

 2. And I guess you must think I'm a baby, when you say you 
 
 can mend it with glue ! 
 As if I didn't know better than that ! Why, just suppose 
 
 it was you ! 
 You might make her look all mended ; but what do I care 
 
 for looks ? 
 Why, glue's for chairs and tables and toys, and the backs 
 
 of books ! 
 
 3. My dolly ! my own little daughter ! O, but it's the awfulest 
 
 crack ! 
 It just makes me sick to think of the sound when her poor 
 
 head went whack 
 Against that horrible brass thing that holds up the little 
 
 shelf! 
 Now, nursey, what makes you remind me ? I know that I 
 
 did it myself ! 
 
 4. I think you must be crazy! You'll get her another 
 
 head! 
 What good would forty heads do her ? I tell you my 
 
 dolly is dead ! 
 And to think I hadn't quite finished her elegant new 
 
 spring hat ! 
 And I took a sweet ribbon of hers last night to tie on that 
 
 horrid cat ! 
 
 5. When my mamma gave me that ribbon I was playing 
 
 out in the yard 
 She said to me most expressly, ll Here's a ribbon for 
 
 Hildegarde." 
 And I went and put it on Tabby, and Hildegarde saw me 
 
 do it; 
 But I said to myself, ' ' O, never mind ; I don't believe she 
 
 knew it." 
 
 6. But I know that she knew it now; and I just believe, 
 
 I do, 
 That her poor little heart was broken, and so her head 
 broke too.

 O, my baby ! my little baby ! I wish my head had been 
 
 hit! 
 For I've hit it over and over, and it hasn't cracked a bit. 
 
 7. But, since the darling is dead, she'll want to be buried, of 
 
 course. 
 
 We will take my little wagon, nurse ; and you shall be the 
 horse; 
 
 And I'll walk behind, and cry ; and we'll put her in this 
 you see 
 
 This dear little box and we'll bury her under the maple- 
 tree. 
 
 8. And papa will make me a tombstone like the one he made 
 
 for my bird ; 
 And he'll put what I tell him on it ; yes, every single 
 
 word. 
 I shall say, "Here lies Hildegarde, a beautiful doll, who 
 
 is dead; 
 She died of a broken heart, and a dreadful crack in her 
 
 head." 
 
 THE END.
