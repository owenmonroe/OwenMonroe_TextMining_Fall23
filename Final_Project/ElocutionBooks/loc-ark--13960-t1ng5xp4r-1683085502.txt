EDITOR'S PREFACE. 
 
 At the request of many of the Principals of 
 Private Schools and Colleges in Philadelphia, I have 
 undertaken the pleasing task of collecting some of 
 the finest productions of genius, in Yerse and Prose, 
 and adding them to the talented work of the late 
 Dr. Comstock (one of the best Teachers for the culti- 
 vation of the voice that I ever met with). I hope 
 to produce a Work on Elocution suited to all per- 
 sons, whether old or young. AVhile I do not hold 
 myself responsible for all the assertions of the tal- 
 ented Doctor, I yet agree with him in most of his 
 remarks, and believe his work can be studied with 
 great advantage. 
 
 All persons ought to be aware how important it is 
 to attend to the modulation of the voice. The chief 
 beauty of oratory is in the melody of the speaker's 
 utterance. If the orator delivers his* own ideas, or 
 those of another, how soon his hearers become indif- 
 ferent if the speech is delivered in one tone of voice ! 
 Bat, when the speaker whose voice is cultivated and 
 modulated, is heard, every ear listens with delight, 
 every eye beams upon him with pleasure ; the feel- 
 ings of his hearers will be at one time melted into 
 tears by the pathos of his tones, at another roused

IV PREFACE. 
 
 "by the fire of Ms eloquence ; the time seems to fly 
 on golden pinions; and although the discourse may 
 have occupied two hours in delivery, the hearers 
 wish it had been still longer. 
 
 The voice may be so cultivated that it will be 
 as musical as any instrument, rising and falling, 
 sinking and swelling, as the meaning requires. I 
 advise all who wish to become fine readers and speak- 
 ers, to study with the greatest attention Dr. Corn- 
 stock's work, as they will there find important truths 
 fully analyzed and explained. 
 
 But, while studying this noble art, remember that 
 Elocution is not a science that can be learned from 
 books; it is an art, and can be imparted by the 
 living teacher alone. 
 
 Every feeling and emotion of the human heart 
 can be expressed by the tones of the voice ; and as, 
 by appropriate gesture, every thing we say can be 
 made plain to the understanding through the sight, 
 so also, by giving every word its proper sound, can 
 it be made perfectly intelligible to the ear. There- 
 fore, as this can be done only by a finished reader or 
 orator, I repeat, the living teacher alone can instruct 
 
 in Elocution. 
 
 PHILIP LAWRENCE.

THIS work is a system of Theoretical 
 and Practical Elocution. It is de- 
 signed for the use of Schools and Colleges, 
 as well as for the instruction of private 
 individuals who desire to improve them- 
 selves in the art of reading and speaking. 
 The arrangement of the several parts of 
 the work is strictly systematic: each is 
 discussed in its natural order, and with as 
 much brevity as consists with perspicuity* 
 
 The analysis of the vocal elements of 
 the English language, and the minute de- 
 scription which is given of their organic 
 formation, will be found important, not 
 only to the American who is desirous of 
 accurate knowledge upon this subject, but 
 also to the foreigner who is learning to 
 speak our vernacular tongue. And the 
 engravings, indicating the most favourable 
 postures of the mouth in the energetic 
 utterance of the elements, w T ill be found 
 a valuable auxiliary in the acquisition of 
 
 this knowledge.

vi PREFACE. 
 
 In ordinary works on Elocution, the inflections of the 
 voice are given, but not the changes of pitch, which 
 constitute melody. In this work, however, not only are 
 the inflections and the melody given, but also those tran- 
 sitions in pitch, called modulation, or a change of key. 
 My method of representing the melody and modula- 
 tions of the speaking voice, is original ; and, I feel con- 
 fident, it will prove of singular advantage to the Stu- 
 dent in Elocution. 
 
 The part on gesture is extracted, principally, from 
 Austin's Chironomia, a work which is extremely rare, 
 and one whose great size and expense are insuperable 
 obstacles to its general introduction. All, however, 
 that is particularly valuable, which the Chironomia con- 
 tains on the subject of gesture, is here presented to the 
 reader in the compass of a few pages. Austin's system 
 of notation of gesture is of great practical utility. 
 This will appear evident to the reader when he shall 
 have learned that, by its application, all the gestures 
 which an orator makes, in the delivery of a discourse, 
 may be accurately recorded for his own practice and 
 improvement, as well as for the benefit of posterity. 
 
 In the practical part of this work, are Exercises in 
 Articulation, Pitch, Force, Time, and Gesture. These 
 are important, not only to the Student in Elocution, but 
 also to the Stammerer. In training the muscles of 
 speech, as well as those of gesticulation, I begin with 
 exercises of the most energetic kind; because these 
 only will produce the desired effect: by diligently prac- 
 tising energetic exercises, the Student soon acquires a 
 strength and compass of voice, a distinctness of utter- 
 ance, and a freedom and gracefulness of action, which

 he could not attain by practising those of an opposite 
 character. 
 
 The Exercises in Reading and Declamation have 
 been taken from some of the best ancient and modern 
 authors ; and they are well adapted to the purposes of 
 the Student in Elocution. They are divided into para- 
 graphs, and subdivided into sections. The latter divi- 
 sion is marked by vertical bars. In concert reading, 
 as soon as a section is pronounced by the teacher, the 
 members of the class should repeat it together, in the 
 proper pitch and time, and with the requisite degree of 
 force. When a paragraph shall have been pronounced 
 in this way, it should be read singly by each member 
 of the class. Sometimes it will be found advantageous 
 to let each pupil, in turn, give out a piece, and the other 
 members of the class repeat it after him ; the teacher, 
 meanwhile, making the necessary corrections. In fine, 
 the exercise of reading should be practised in a variety 
 of ways according to circumstances. When a piece 
 is given out with gesticulation, the members of the class 
 should rise simultaneously, immediately after the first 
 section is pronounced, and repeat the words and ges- 
 ture. As the organs of speech require much training 
 to enable them to perform their functions -properly, the 
 pupil should repeat the same exercise till he can articu- 
 late every element, and give to each syllable the pitch, 
 force, and time which the sentiment demands. 
 
 The art of reading and speaking is not inferior in 
 importance to any branch of learning ; yet there is none 
 more generally neglected. While many of the merely 
 ornamental branches are cultivated with zealous assi- 
 duity, Elocution is allowed, at best, but a feeble sup-

viii PREFACE. 
 
 port. Among the numerous colleges with which our 
 country abounds, there is not, perhaps, a single one 
 endowed with a professorship of Elocution ! And 
 among our numerous public speakers, how small a num- 
 ber can deliver a discourse without having half the body 
 concealed by a desk or table ! The orators of classic 
 Greece never ensconced themselves behind elevated 
 desks, nor " stood upon all fours" as some of our public 
 speakers do :* they were masters of their art. Hence 
 they needed no screen to conceal uncouth attitudes and 
 awkward gestures from the scrutinizing eye of criti- 
 cism; nor had occasion to present the crown of the 
 head, instead of the face, to the audience, to hide the 
 blush of ignorance : they exposed the whole person to 
 the audience ; they stood erect, in all the dignity of con- 
 scious worth; their attitudes were fit models for the 
 statuary; their gestures were replete with grace and 
 expression ; their elocution defied criticism. 
 
 Let us endeavour to restore Elocution to its former 
 place in the department of useful instruction. Nothing 
 is wanted but a correct medium, laudable ambition, and 
 common industry, to enable our American youth to 
 rival those ancient orators whose eloquence, it is said, 
 " shook distant thrones, and made the extremities of the 
 earth tremble."

INTRODUCTION 
 
 ^3 A N is designed for action. Na- 
 ture has so constituted him, that 
 both body and mind require 
 daily exercise to develope their 
 powers, and maintain them in a 
 vigorous and healthy condition. 
 The truth of this remark is 
 manifest from constant observation and experience — those 
 who lead active, bustling lives, conjoined with temperance 
 and prudence, commonly possess robust frames, and healthy 
 constitutions; while the sedentary and the indolent are 
 enervated and sickly. 
 
 We find the same results from the exercise of the mental 
 faculties. He whose mind is constantly employed in the 
 acquisition of knowledge, usually retains his mental facul- 
 ties unimpaired to the last. But not so with the man of ease 
 and indolence. After the meridian of life, the powers of his 
 mind, with those of the body, become weaker, and weaker, 
 and he finally leaves the world as he entered it — a child. 
 
 The health and strength of the body, therefore, mainly 
 depend on the number of muscles that are frequently called 
 into action, and the degree of rational exercise through 
 which they pass. Now there are few, if any, whose daily 
 avocations are so varied as to bring into requisition all the 
 muscles of the body : hence the necessity of gymnastic exer-

 The term, gymnastics, in its widest sense, signifies all 
 bodily exercises ; in a more limited sense, " exercises syste- 
 matically adapted to develope the physical powers, and pre- 
 serve them in perfection, which constitutes the art of gym* 
 nasties properly so called."

12 INTRODUCTION. 
 
 These exercises, when commenced in youth, develope the 
 muscles, give agility to the limbs, and promote the various 
 mnctions of the animal system: in this way they impart 
 strength and consistency to the body, and lay the founda- 
 tion of lasting health : and even when commenced in man- 
 hood, they invigorate the frame, and brace it against the 
 infirmities of age. 
 
 By the frequent and energetic exercise of the muscles, 
 they are brought completely under the control of volition, 
 which is a powerful auxiliary to every variety of action. 
 Hence Gymnastics are not only useful because they exert a 
 healthful influence upon the body ; but because they lay a 
 good foundation for the easy acquisition of every mechanic 
 art. 
 
 From what has been said of Gymnastics in general, it may 
 readily be conceived that very important advantages may 
 be derived from vocal gymnastics. 
 
 By the term, Vocal Gymnastics, may be understood the 
 principles of the human voice as employed in speech and 
 song, as well as the training of the organs by which this 
 voice is produced. The principles are the science of the 
 voice — the training, the exercise of the organs, necessary 
 to develope their powers, and enable them to act with rapid- 
 ity, precision, and effect. 
 
 Vocal Gymnastics give the pupil complete command of 
 the muscles of articulation, extend the compass of the voice, 
 and render it smooth, powerful, and melodious. They not 
 only call forth all the energies of the vocal organs, correct 
 stammering, lisping, &c. ; but they invigorate the lungs, and, 
 consequently, fortify them against the invasion of disease. 
 
 All the blood, in the course of its circulation, passes through 
 the lungs, where it undergoes a change, not only essential 
 to health, but also to life. Whenever their function, there- 
 fore, is interrupted by debility, or disease, the blood is dete- 
 riorated, and the whole system suffers; in fact, the very 
 citadel of life is sapped, and nothing but a restoration of 
 these organs to their natural condition, will effect a return 
 of general health. Indeed, the lungs are of so much impor-

 tance in the animal economy, that the complete suspension 
 of their office is followed by speedy dissolution. 
 
 Hence such healthful measures should be adopted as are 
 calculated to invigorate the pulmonary apparatus, and ena- 
 ble it to maintain its integrity. One of the most kopefu! 
 expedients for this purpose, is a well-regulated and perse- 
 vering course of vocal gymnastics. 
 
 Were we to exercise our voices a few minutes, every day, 
 according to just principles, the number of deaths from pul- 
 monary affections, especially consumption, I have no doubt, 
 would be greatly diminished. 
 
 While Vocal Gymnastics give a keenness to appetite, they 
 are a powerful means of promoting digestion. A young 
 clergyman entered my Vocal Gymnasium, for the purpose 
 of improving his elocution as well as his health. He laboured 
 under dyspepsia which was attended with loss of appetite, 
 general debility, languor, and dejection of spirits. But in 
 twelve days after he commenced the exercises, there was a 
 radical change in his mental and physical condition : he had 
 become very cheerful ; and, to use his own words, his appe- 
 tite was ravenous. Nor is this a solitary case — numerous 
 others might be cited with the like happy result. 
 
 My pupils have frequently told me that they always feel 
 invigorated by the exercises. A gentleman who was for- 
 merly a pupil of mine, and who had been in the practice of 
 resorting to a common gymnasium for the benefit of his 
 health, assured me that he derived more advantage from his 
 vocal, than from his athletic exercises. Let the individuals, 
 therefore, who visit those gymnasia, designed only for the 
 exercise of the limbs, not neglect the equally important 
 gymnastics of the pulmonary organs.

PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS. 
 
 As Elocution is intimately connected with the voice, and 
 as every reader may not be prepared to enter upon a minute 
 development of its various principles, the following Prelimi- 
 nary Observations may be of some advantage. 
 
 Voice is sound, produced by the agitation of air when 
 forcibly expelled from the lungs. 
 
 The attributes of the voice, are general and special. The 
 general attributes are pitch and force, and are common to 
 all voices. The special attributes are those peculiarities 
 which render one voice more agreeable, or disagreeable, 
 than another, as sweetness, harshness, &c. 
 
 The acuteness and gravity of the voice depend on the 
 contractions and dilatations of the vocal tube. 
 
 The degree of loudness of the voice, is in proportion to the 
 expulsive effort, and to the resistance which the air meets 
 on its passage through the glottis. 
 
 When air is forcibly expelled from the lungs, and not suf- 
 ficient resistance given to its egress to produce what is gene- 
 rally understood by the term voice, an aspirated, or whis- 
 pered sound is the result. 
 
 From voice articulated by the motions of the lips, tongue, 
 and other parts of the mouth, is produced oral language. 
 Hence oral language is not inaptly termed articulated voice. 
 
 There are two varieties of oral language — song, and speech. 
 In several respects they resemble each other. Thus the 
 notes, both of song, and speech, vary in pitch, force, and 
 time. The most striking difference between them, is this : 
 a note of song is maintained in one range of pitch from its 
 commencement to its termination ; but a note of speech is 
 varied in pitch during its prolongation. If you prolong the 
 letter a, in one range of pitch, thus: 
 
 a 
 
 you will have an example of a note of song. If you utter it 
 interrogatively, and affirmatively, thus : 
 
 a 1 d. 
 
 you will have two varieties of the note of speech : the voice 
 in the interrogation, moving from a grave pitch to one more 
 acute ; in the affirmation, from acute to grave. 
 
 Perhaps enough has been said by way of preliminaries. 
 The principles here mentioned, together with the various 
 others, are methodically presented, fully discussed, and dia- 
 gramically illustrated, in the course of the work.

ELOCUTIOiN. 
 
 LOCUTION is vocal delivery. 
 It may be said to comprise both a 
 science, and an art. The science 
 embraces the principles which con- 
 stitute the basis of reading and 
 speaking ; the art, the practical ap- 
 plication of these principles. 
 Elocution is naturally divided into two parts ; namely, 
 Vocal Gymnastics, and Gesture. 
 
 Vocal Gymnastics is the philosophy of the human 
 voice, as well as the art of training the vocal organs 
 in speech and song. 
 
 Gesture is the various postures, and motions, em- 
 ployed in vocal delivery.

 as well as the art of training

 Vocal Gymnastics is subdi- 
 vided as follows : 
 
 1. Articulation, 3. Force, 
 
 2. Pitch, 4. Time. 
 Articulation is the act of forming, with the organs 
 
 of speech, the elements of vocal language. 
 
 Pitch is the degree of the elevation of sounds.

 forming, with the organs of speech, 
 the elements of vocal language. 
 
 These elements may be formed 
 separately, as in the utterance of 
 the letters of the alphabet, as 
 well as conjunctively, as in the 
 pronunciation of words. 
 By the utterance of the letters of the alphabet is not meant the 
 
 pronunciation of the mere names of the letters, but the formation 
 
 of the various sounds which the letters represent. 
 
 A good articulation is the perfect utterance of the 
 elements of vocal language. 
 
 The first step towards becoming a good elocutionist, 
 is a correct articulation. " A public speaker, possessed 
 of only a moderate voice, if he articulates correctly, 
 will be better understood, and heard with greater 
 pleasure, than one who vociferates without judgment. 
 The voice of the latter may indeed extend to a conside- 
 rable distance, but the sound is dissipated in confusion. 
 Of the former voice not the smallest vibration is wast- 
 ed, every stroke is perceived at the utmost distance to 
 which it reaches ; and hence it has often the appear- 
 ance of penetrating even farther than one which is 
 loud, but badly articulated. 
 
 " In just articulation, the words are not to be hurried 
 over, nor precipitated syllable over syllable ; nor, as it 
 were, melted together into a mass of confusion : they

 should not be trailed, or drawled, nor permitted to slip 
 out carelessly, so as to drop unfinished. They should 
 be delivered from the lips as beautiful coins newly 
 issued from the mint, deeply and accurately impressed, 
 neatly struck by the proper organs, distinct, in due 
 succession, and of due weight."* 
 
 Without good articulation, it is impossible to be & 
 correct reader, or speaker. Those who have been ac 
 customed to pronounce their words in a careless or slo- 
 venly manner, will find it difficult, even with their 
 best efforts, to utter them distinctly. The organs of 
 articulation, for the want of proper exercise, become, 
 as it were, paralyzed. The pupil, therefore, at the 
 very commencement of his studies, should be conduct- 
 ed through a series of exercises, calculated to strengthen 
 the muscles of articulation, and render them obedient 
 to the will. The best method for effecting these pur- 
 poses, is to exercise the voice on the elements of speech ; 
 first, on each element separately ; f secondly, on va- 
 rious combinations. 
 
 Under the head, Practical Elocution, will be found a variety 
 of Exercises on the Elements of the English language, which are 
 calculated to develope the voice, increase its compass, and give 
 flexibility to the muscles of articulation. In that part of this work 
 which consists of Exercises in Reading and Declamation, most 
 of the sounds liable to be omitted or imperfectly articulated, are re* 
 presented by italic letters. Hence the reader, if he pay proper 
 attention to the subject, will have no difficulty in correcting all 
 ordinary defects in his utterance. 
 
 The value of vocal gymnastics cannot be duly appreciated by 
 those who have not experienced, or witnessed, their beneficial re- 
 eults. But, I feel confident, the time is not far distant when these 
 exercises will be considered, by all intelligent persons, an essential 
 part of primary instruction. 
 
 * Austin's Chironomia, p. 37, 38. 
 
 f " When the elements are pronounced singly, they may re- 
 ceive a concentration of the organic effort, which gives them a 
 clearness of sound and a definite outline, if I may so speak, at their 
 extremes, that make a fine preparative for a distinct and forcible 
 pronunciation in the compounds of speech." — Rush's Philosophy 
 of the Human Voice.

18 ELOCUTION. 
 
 CHAPTER I. 
 
 THE ELEMENTS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE. 
 
 The Elements of vocal language are the Sounds of 
 which words are composed. These sounds are repre- 
 sented by graphic characters, called letters. 
 
 The number of letters in the English language, is 
 twenty-six ; but the number of elements is thirty-eight. 
 Hence, as the number of elements exceeds the number 
 of their literal signs, the same letter is employed, in 
 different situations, to represent different sounds. Thus 
 a represents four different sounds ; e, two ; i, two ; o, 
 three ; u, three ; z, two ; and there are six sounds, each 
 of which is represented by two letters — ou, ng, sh, wh, 
 ih in then, and th in thin. (See p. 19 and 20.) If we 
 had a perfect alphabet, every elementary sound would 
 be represented by its appropriate character.* 
 
 * That men have accomplished much by furnishing the world 
 with literature, art, and science, will be conceded by all. Nor will 
 it be denied by any that there remains much to be done to carry all 
 human institutions to their acme of excellence. Among- the nu- 
 merous proofs that our institutions have not attained their highest 
 possible degree of perfection, is the fact that the world is now fur- 
 nished with as much genius for contrivance, wisdom for invention, 
 and judgment for application, as at any former period. He, there- 
 fore, who advocates the doctrine of present perfection in human 
 productions, suggests, at least, the possibility that that amount of 
 mind which is unnecessary to the successful application of the pre- 
 sent principles, means, and inventions to their respective purposes, 
 is rendered a redundancy by the want, of appropriate subjects upon 
 which to operate. The English language, though by no means far 
 advanced in years, has already been the subject of much concur- 
 rent, and individual action ; yet there is hardly one part of it which 
 is not marred with defect, or deficiency. Even the English alpha- 
 bet suffers from both these imperfections. To attain perfection in 
 any thing, is, perhaps, beyond the power of man, especially in the 
 medium of communicating his ideas. But although perfection in lan- 
 guage can hardly be expected, yet, there is a degree of excellence 
 which is not so difficult of attainment as to render all exertion una-

 The elements, as well as the letters by which they 
 are represented, are usually divided into two classes. 
 Vowels and Consonants. A more philosophical divi- 
 sion, however, is into three classes, Vowels, Subvowels, 
 and Aspirates. 
 
 The vowels are pure vocal sounds ; their number is 
 fifteen. 
 
 The subvowels have a vocality, but inferior to that 
 of the vowels ; their number is fourteen. 
 
 The aspirates are made with the whispering breath, 
 and, consequently, have no vocality ; they are nine in 
 number.

 to represent these elements by appropriate characters, we should 
 have thirty-eight letters. There is, then, a deficiency in our alphabet 
 of twelve letters — and he who shall supply this imperfection, will 
 be one of the greatest benefactors of the human race. This work 
 must be done before our orthography can be rendered consistent, 
 our pronunciation natural and uniform, and our language easy of 
 acquisition. Until this is accomplished, words must be spelled one 
 way, and pronounced another — indeed, two languages must be 
 learned, instead of one. Should the English language, as some 
 confidently expect, become the language of the world, the advan- 
 tages in which a complete alphabet would result, can be conceived 
 by those only who have duly reflected upon the subject.

 The reader may ask why C, J, Q, and X, have not been classed 
 with the elements. These letters have no sounds which are not 
 represented, in the above scheme, by other letters. C has three 
 sounds — the sound of k, as in cat; that of s, as in cedar, and that 
 of sh, as in ocean. J expresses the combined sounds of d and z in 
 azure. Q has the sound of k. X, as in exercise, expresses the 
 combined sounds of k and s ; in example, the combined sounds of 
 g and z in zone ; in anxious, the combined sounds of A; and sh. In 
 Xenophon, x has the sound of z in zone.* 
 
 *Xin Xenophon was pronounced by the ancient Greeks as we 
 pronounce x in exercise, thus — Ksenophon; and I am informed by 
 Mr. Castanis, a native of the island of Scio, that the modern Greeks 
 bo pronounce it.

 CHAPTER II. 
 
 THE VOWELS. 
 
 The vowels are divided into Monothongs, Diph 
 thongs, and Triphthongs. 
 
 The Monothongs consist of one kind of sound through- 
 out their concrete movement, and consequently are 
 simple elements ; they are represented by the italics in 
 the following words : 
 
 arm, all, an, eve, end, in, on, up, full. 
 
 The Diphthongs consist of two vowel sounds, which 
 coalesce so intimately that they appear like one uni- 
 form sound ; they are represented by the italics in the 
 following words : 
 
 ale, He, lose, tube. 
 
 The diphthong a, as well as 1, has a characteristic 
 sound for its radical, and the monothong, f, for its van- 
 ish. These diphthongs, under certain circumstances 
 (for instance, when they are carried through a wide 
 range of pitch, as in interrogation with surprise), are 
 converted into triphthongs, the third constituent being 
 the monothong, e. 
 
 The diphthong 6, as well as u, has a characteristic 
 sound for its radical, and the subvowel to, for its vanish. 
 
 The Triphthongs consist of three vowel sounds which 
 coalesce so intimately that they appear like one uni- 
 form sound ; they are represented by the italics, in the 
 following words : 
 
 old, our. 
 
 The first constituent of 6, as well as that of ou, is a 
 sound characteristic of this element ; and the diph- 
 thong 6 constitutes the second and the third constitu 
 ent of these triphthongs. 
 
 The following scheme is an analysis of the diph- 
 thongs and triphthongs. The reader will observe that

 There is one diphthong, and three triphthongs, be- 
 sides those already noticed; they are represented by 
 the italics, in the following words : 
 oil, ay, boy, buoy. 
 
 But, as all their constituents are to be found among 
 the fifteen vowels before enumerated, they do not in-

 During the utterance of a monothong, the aperture 
 of the mouth remains stationary ; but during that of a 
 diphthong, or triphthong, the aperture is gradually di- 
 minished till the commencement of the last constituent; 
 it then remains stationary till the sound is ended. 
 This is illustrated by the following diagrams :

 The large end of Diag. 2 represents the aperture of 
 the mouth in commencing the utterance of the diph- 
 thong 6 — the portion of the figure between 6 and w f 
 shows the gradual diminution of the aperture of the 
 mouth during the utterance of the first constituent, and 
 the remaining portion shows the stationary position of 
 the aperture of the mouth during the utterance of the

 Bhows the gradual diminution of the aperture of the 
 mouth during the utterance of the first constituent — 
 the portion between 6 and w, shows the gradual dimi- 
 nution of the aperture of the mouth during the utter- 
 ance of the second constituent ; and the remaining por- 
 tion of the figure, the stationary position of the aperture 
 of the mouth during the utterance of the third constitu- 
 ent.

 THE SUBVOWELS. 
 
 . B consists of a vocal sound and an aspirate. The 
 first constituent is formed with the lips closed ; the 
 second, by aspirating the vowel u, at the moment of 
 their separation.* 
 
 When B is doubled, as in rabbit, the second constituent of the 
 first B is omitted. When B is whispered, the second constituent 
 only is heard. When words in which B is doubled are whispered, 
 the first B is mute. 
 
 D consists of a vocal sound and an aspirate. The 
 first constituent is formed with the tip of the tongue

 the second, by aspirating the vowel u at the moment

 When D is doubled, as in addition, the second constituent of the 
 first D is omitted. When D is whispered, the second constituent 
 only is heard. When words in which D is doubled are whispered, 
 the first D is mute. 
 
 G consists of a vocal sound and an aspirate. The 
 first constituent is formed with the root of the tongue 
 pressed against the curtain, or vail of the palate ; f the 
 second, by aspirating the vowel u at the moment of its 
 removal.* 
 
 When G is doubled, as in haggard, the second constituent of 
 the first G is omitted. When G is whispered, the second constitu- 
 ent only is heard. When words in which G is doubled are whis- 
 pered, the first G is mute. 
 
 L is a vocal sound, made with the tip of the tongue 
 pressed against the gums of the upper incisory teeth. 
 
 M is a nasal sound, made with the lips closed. 
 
 N is a nasal sound, formed with the tip of the tongue 
 pressed against the gums of the upper incisory teeth. 
 
 NG, as in song, is a nasal sound, formed with the 
 root of the tongue pressed gently against the curtain 
 of the palate. 
 
 R is a vocal sound, of which there are two varieties. 
 The first is called the trilled R, and is made by caus- 
 ing the tongue to vibrate against the gums of the upper 
 incisor teeth, while the breath is propelled through the 
 mouth ; the second is called the smooth R, and is made 
 with the tip of the tongue elevated towards the centre 
 of the roof of the mouth. R should be trilled when it 
 precedes a vowel, as in roll, crush, &c, ; but when it 
 follows a vowel, as in air, orb, &c, it should be made 
 smooth. 
 
 I have met with a number of individuals who could not trill the 
 R, and others who did it with difficulty. Those who cannot trill i

 however, not despair — their vocal organs may be rendered flexible

 TH, as in then, is a compound of vocality and aspi- 
 ration, formed with the tip of the tongue resting against 
 the inner surface of the upper incisory teeth. 
 
 V is a compound of vocality and aspiration. It is 
 formed with the under lip pressed against the edge of 
 the upper incisory teeth. 
 
 W is a vocal sound, formed with the lips contracted 
 as in the act of whistling. 
 
 Y is a vocal sound, formed with the lips and teeth a 
 little separated. 
 
 Z, as in zone, is a buzzing sound, a compound of vo- 
 cality and aspiration. It is formed by pressing the 
 tip of the tongue gently against the gums of the upper 
 incisors, and forcing out the breath. 
 
 Z, as in azure, is a compound of vocality and aspi- 
 ration. It is formed with the tip of the tongue nearly 
 in the same position as is z in zone, though drawn a 
 little further back, and somewhat widened, so as to 
 enlarge the aperture formed by its upper surface and 
 the roof of the mouth, through which the breath is 
 forced.

 F, like V, is formed with the under lip pressed

 H is the inceptive part of a vowel sound, aspirated

 varieties of ways as there are vowels in the language ; 
 each requiring the same posture of the mouth, which 
 the vowel itself requires.

 When this element is doubled, as in fickle (pronounced fikkl) the 
 first k is mute. 
 
 P is formed by closing the lips, and then aspirating

 When this element is doubled, as in happy, the first P is mute. 
 
 S is a hissing sound, and, like z in zone, is formed 
 with the tip of the tongue pressed gently against the 
 gums of the upper incisory teeth. It is nearly the same 
 as z in zone aspirated. 
 
 SH is formed with the tongue in the same position 
 as is z in azure. SH is nearly the same sound as z in 
 azure, aspirated. 
 
 T is formed by pressing the tip of the tongue against 
 the gums of the upper incisory teeth, and then aspirat- 
 ing the vowel u.* 
 
 When T is doubled, as in attempt, the first T is mute. 
 
 TH, as in thin, like th in then, is formed with the

 in the formation of this element, is nearly the same as 
 hu, whispered. WH requires the same posture of the 
 mouth that the vowel u requires. 
 
 That hu and wh are n t identical, may be proved by pronounc- 
 ing-, alternately, the wo Js hoom and whoom, and observing the 
 contrast between them. 
 
 * Although of no practical importance, it may not be uninterest- 
 ing to the philosophic reader to know that the second constituent 
 of the subvowels B, D, G, and of the aspirates, K, P, T, is formed 
 by aspirating the vowel u only when these elements are uttered 
 singly, when they are final, and when they are followed by a con- 
 sonant. When they are followed by a vowel, their second consti- 
 tuent is formed by aspirating that vowel. This may be rendered 
 obvious by pronouncing forcibly, and deliberately, the words, Bay, 
 Day, Gay, and Kay, Pay, Tay, or any other words, in which B, D, 
 G, and K, P, T are followed by vowels.

 CHAPTER V. 
 
 THE POSTURES OF THE MOUTH. 
 
 An accurate knowledge of the positions which the 
 organs of articulation should assume in the formation 
 of the several elements of vocal language, is very im- 
 portant to those who would speak with ease and ele- 
 gance. To aid the reader still further in the acquisi- 
 tion of this knowledge, he is furnished with the various 
 postm^es of the mouth, required in uttering the elements 
 energetically, and singly. 
 
 The elements are grouped according to the posture 
 in which the mouth should be when they are formed. 
 It will be seen that the Diphthongs and Triphthongs 
 have each two postures of the mouth — one at the 
 commencement, the other at the termination of the sound. 
 
 These postures are, of course, more or less modified, 
 when the elements are uttered in their various combi- 
 nations, and with different degrees of force. 
 
 The pupil should exercise his organs of speech, in the 
 most forcible manner, three times a week, and, if pos- 
 sible, even every day, on all the elements. The vow- 
 els should be exploded from the throat, both interroga- 
 tively and affirmatively, in every range of pitch within 
 the compass of the voice, and with every possible de- 
 gree of force. 
 
 The vowels are exploded in the following manner : 
 make a full inspiration, close the glottis, and contract 
 the muscles of expiration so as to condense the air in 
 the lungs, then utter the element with a sudden and 
 forcible emission of the breath. The sounds thus pro- 
 duced may be denominated vocal thunder; the effect 
 upon an audience is electrical. 
 
 This exercise strengthens the vocal organs, and ena- 
 bles the speaker to be heard at a great distance, with 
 very little effort, or expenditure of breath. It is also 
 beneficial to health.

 CHAPTER VI. 
 
 DEFECTIVE ARTICULATION. 
 
 Articulation is defective when one o~ more ele» 
 ments of a word are omitted, or imperfectly formed ; or 
 when one element is substituted for another. 
 
 Defective articulation is exceedingly common : per- 
 haps there is not one individual in ten thousand whose 
 articulation is perfect. This arises from the neglect of 
 a proper gymnastic training of the organs of speech in 
 childhood. As soon as children are capable of imitating 
 sounds, they should be taught the elements of vocal 
 language ; and, to facilitate their acquisition of this 
 knowledge, they should be made to exercise before a 
 mirror, so as to compare the movements of their own 
 lips with those of the lips of their instructor. By pur- 
 suing this course, a good foundation will be laid for a 
 perfect and graceful articulation. 
 
 In that part of this work which consists of Exercises 
 in Reading and Declamation, all, or nearly all, the 
 letters representing sounds liable to be omitted, or im- 
 perfectly articulated, are italicised. Hence it. is not 
 necessary to furnish examples, and treat of the subject 
 minutely, in this place. There are, however, some in- 
 stances of defective articulation, which are not pointed 
 out by the italic letters — these are so important that 
 they deserve special notice. I allude to those cases in 
 which one element is substituted for another. The 
 remainder of this chapter will be devoted to their con- 
 sideration. 
 
 Children are apt to substitute the sound of d for that 
 of g in gay ; and the sound of t for that of k, or c in 
 cat. Thus, for gay, they say day ; for cake, tate, &c. 
 
 To enable the pupil to correct these faults, I explain 
 to him the manner in which the sounds of g and k are

 produced — they are formed by pressing the root of 
 the tongue against the soft palate, and not, like d and 
 t by pressing its tip against the gums of the upper 
 incisors. I then direct him to pronounce, after me, the 
 elements, d, g, and t, k, and the syllables da, ga, and 
 ta, ka, thus : 
 
 d, g; d,g; d, g; d, g; d, g; d, g; d, g; d, g; d, g. 
 
 da, ga ; da, ga ; da, ga ; da, ga ; de, ge ; de, ge ; &e. 
 ta, ka ; ta, ka ; ta, ka ; ta, ka ; te, ke ; te, ke ; &c. 
 
 The object of this exercise is to contrast the substituted 
 sound with the correct one. 
 
 When this plan does not prove successful, I open my 
 mouth as widely as possible, so that the tip of the 
 tongue cannot touch the gums of the upper teeth, and 
 request the pupil to open his in like manner. I then 
 direct him to pronounce, after me, the following sylla- 
 bles: 
 
 ga, ga, ga, ga ; ge, ge ; gl, gl ; go, gd, gb ; gu, gu, gu ; gou. 
 ka, ka, ka, ka ; ke, ke ; kl, kl ; ko, k6, k& ; ku, ku, ku ; kou. 
 ag, eg, Ig, 6g, ug, oug; ak, ek, Ik, 6k, ftk, ouk. 
 
 When neither of these schemes proves successful, I 
 request the pupil to press his tongue downwards, and 
 backwards, with his index finger, while I do the same, 
 and pronounce, after me, the syllables in the preceding 
 exercise. This I have never known to fail. 
 
 Some children omit the element z, when it follows d, 
 and the element sh when it follows t ; for instance, they 
 pronounce John, don, and Charles, tarles, &c. # My 
 method of correcting these defects is to contrast the 
 false pronunciation with the true one, as in the follow- 
 ing exercise : 
 
 dia, d2a; da, dSa; da, d2a; da, dJa; de, die; &c. 
 
 ta, tsha ; ta, tsha ; ta, tsha ; ta, tsha ; te, tshe ; &c. 
 
 * J is a compound of d and z in azure ; and ch is equivalent to 
 Uh.

 The v and w are confounded by some perons ; for 
 instance, when they would say vine, they say wine, and 
 vice versa. An attention to the proper postures of the 
 mouth, in the production of these elements will soon 
 enable the pupil to correct this fault.* (See pos- 
 tures of the mouth, page 28.) The following exercise, 
 founded on the principle of contrast, should be fre- 
 quently practised by the pupil, in the most energetic 
 manner. 
 
 va, wa ; va, wa ; va, wa ; va, wa ; ve, we ; ve, we ; &c. 
 
 wa, va; wa, va; wa, va; wa, va ; we, ve ; we, ve ; &c. 
 
 In correcting faults in articulation, I often find it 
 advantageous to exercise the pupil before a mirror, that 
 he may observe the contrast between the movements 
 of his own mouth, and those of mine. 
 
 LISPING. 
 
 Lisping is the substitution of the sound of th for that 
 of some other letter, generally for that of s in sin. 
 Thus the words, sale, send, sight, song, &c, are pro- 
 nounced thale, thend, thight, thong, &c. 
 
 The lisper should be told, that, in forming the sound 
 of th, the tip of the tongue is pressed gently against 
 the inner surface of the upper incisor teeth ; whereas, 
 in forming that of s, it is placed, in like manner, against 
 the gums of the upper incisor teeth. Hence, to avoid 
 making th for s, the tongue should be drawn back a 
 little, and its point turned upward against the gums of 
 the upper teeth. In the correction of lisping, the fol- 
 owing exercise may be practised with advantage : 
 
 tha, sa ; tM, sa ; tha, sa ; tha, sa ; the, se ; the, the ; &c. 
 
 * A young; gentleman recently entered my institution who had 
 many faults in his utterance. Among- others was the sing-ular one 
 of pronouncing; vw for v: for vine, he said vwine; for vale, vwaJe, 
 &c. This, as well as the other numerous faults with wn.ich his 
 pronunciation was marred, arose from the want of proper instruc- 
 tion upon the use of the organs of speech.

 The defects of articulation, in which one element 
 (S substituted for another, are numerous ; but, as the 
 method of treatment is similar in all, it is presumed 
 enough has been said to enable the teacher to manage 
 them successfully, particularly as appropriate exer- 
 cises, for most of them, will be found in the practical 
 part of this work. 
 
 CHAPTER VII. 
 
 STAMMERING. 
 
 Stammering is a functional derangement of the or- 
 gans of speech, which renders them incapable, under 
 certain circumstances, of promptly obeying the com- 
 mands of the will. 
 
 In a majority of cases, the cause of this affection 
 operates through the medium of the mind. 
 
 Stammering is cured by a regular course of hygienic 
 elocution. But, as the disease exists under a variety 
 of forms, it requires a variety of treatment. And, as 
 the treatment is medico-elocutional, he who would 
 apply it successfully, must unite the skill of the elocu- 
 tionist with that of the physician. The idea that non- 
 medical men are capable of discharging the duties of 
 applying the remedies to complicated complaints of 
 the human body, is a sui generis in logic, and a bane 
 in the practice of the healing art. 
 
 As a full consideration of the subject of stammering 
 is not compatible with the design of this work ; and, as 
 I am preparing for publication another which will 
 treat exclusively of impediments of speech, I shall con- 
 clude the present chapter with the following 
 
 Remarks on Stammering , from a Lecture on Elocution 
 delivered before the American Lyceum, May 6, 1837, 
 by Andrew Comstock, M.D. 
 
 For the last ten years the author of these remarks has 
 been engaged in an investigation of the philosophy of the

 human voice, with a view to the formation of a system of 
 just Elocution, and to the discovery of the true means for 
 removing impediments of speech in stammerers. How far 
 he has succeeded in his attempt, is not for him to say. His 
 system is the result of his own reflection and experience ; 
 and, as it is founded in philosophy, it is the only true system. 
 The following pages contain the mere outlines of the system. 
 The work itself will be presented to the public as soon as 
 the author's other labours will permit. 
 
 Stammering or stuttering is a hesitation or interruption of speech, 
 and is usually attended with more or less distortion of feature. 
 This affection presents itself under a variety of forms ; but my limits 
 will not allow me to give a particular description of them. I will 
 notice only the most striking. 
 
 In some cases, the stammerer makes an effort to speak, and all 
 his breath is expelled without producing vocality ; in others, the 
 lips are spasmodically closed : — these two forms often occur in the 
 game case. Sometimes the stammerer, while speaking or reading, 
 loses all power over the vocal organs, and remains some momenta 
 with his mouth open, before he can recover sufficient energy to 
 proceed. In many cases, the stammerer repeats the word imme- 
 diately preceding the one he is attempting to pronounce, or he re- 
 peats, in a rapid manner, the first element, or the first syllable, of 
 the difficult word. 
 
 Causes. — The predisposing causes are nervous irritability and 
 delicacy of constitution. 
 
 The most usual exciting causes are diffidence, embarrassment, a 
 fear of not being successful when about to make an effort to speak, 
 an attempt to speak faster than the vocal organs can assume the 
 proper positions for utterance. Two or more of these causes often 
 occur in the same case. Sometimes the habit of stammering is 
 acquired by imitation. 
 
 The proximate cause of stammering is a spasmodic action of the 
 muscles of speech. 
 
 Prognosis. — The probability of a cure depends upon the follow- 
 ing circumstances: If the stammerer has a cheerful disposition, is 
 distinguished for energy of mind and decision of character, can ap- 
 preciate the variations of pitch in speech and song, or, in other 
 words, has an ear for music and a taste for elocution, the prognosis 
 is favourable. But if he is of a nervous temperament, subject to 
 melancholy, irresolute of purpose, incapable of imitation in speaking 
 and singing, the prognosis is unfavourable. 
 
 Treatment. — The stammerer should be impressed with the 
 importance, nay, necessity, of giving exclusive attention to the sub- 
 ject ; and he should not be allowed to converse with any one till

 he can speak without stammering 1 . These rules cannot be too 
 strongly enforced. I am fully persuaded of this from my own ex- 
 perience. Several stammerers, who have placed themselves under 
 my care, taking but two or three lessons a week, and attending to 
 their usual avocations, have left me disappointed ; while those who 
 have given undivided attention to the subject, have been entirely 
 relieved. True, many are more or less benefited even by occasion 
 ally taking a lesson ; but it is very difficult, by any irregular course, 
 to effect a radical cure. The habit of stammering should be ar- 
 rested at once ; for, while it is continued, how is it possible that the 
 habit of speaking correctly can be established 1 
 
 Great pains should be taken to inspire the stammerer with confi- 
 dence. He should be convinced that his success depends mainly 
 upon his own exertions : that he must pursue the various exercises 
 assigned him with indefatigable zeal, with untiring industry; that 
 he has the same organs of speech as other people, and nothing is 
 necessary to enable him to use them as well, but a conviction in his 
 ability to do so. To think that one can do, gives almost the ability 
 to accomplish — but to think that one cannot do, virtually takes 
 away the ability to do, even where it is ample. 
 
 Stammering is often continued by the subordinate estimation 
 which the stammerer puts upon himself. He is too apt to consider 
 those around him giants, and himself a dwarf. As this estimation 
 of himself serves to perpetuate his disease, it is clear that its reme- 
 dy must be found in making himself equal to any: if this mental 
 classification into giants and dwarfs must take place, let the stam- 
 merers make themselves the giants, and those around them the 
 dwarfs. 
 
 The teacher should study the disposition of his pupil : he should 
 persuade him to banish from his mind all melancholy thoughts — 
 in short, he should do every thing in his power to render his pupil 
 cheerful and happy. 
 
 Various athletic exercises should be resorted to daily, to invigo- 
 rate all the muscles of voluntary motion, and diminish nervous irri- 
 tability. In some cases it may be necessary to have recourse to 
 tonics, anti-spasmodics, bathing in salt water, frictions over the 
 whole surface of the body, &c, &c. Electricity may be used with 
 advantage as a tonic, and also as a means of interrupting the spasm 
 of the vocal organs. 
 
 The vocal treatment is deduced from the following circum 
 stances : 
 
 1. An ability to sing. 
 
 2. An ability to speak when alone : 
 
 3. And if the stammerer must speak before an audience, the 
 smaller the audience and the farther he is removed from it, the 
 better. 
 


## p. 36 (#46) ##############################################

36 ELOCUTION. 
 
 4. An ability to speak amidst a noise that is sufficient to render 
 the human voice nearly or quite inaudible. 
 
 5. An ability to speak better in the dark than in the light. 
 b\ An ability to speak in a measured manner. 
 
 7. An ability to speak in a drawling manner. 
 
 8. An ability to speak with the mouth more or less distorted. 
 
 9. An ability to speak in any key, either higher or lower than 
 that in which the stammerer usually converses. 
 
 10. An ability to speak with a halloo. 
 
 11. An ability to speak when the attention is divided or arrested 
 by some object or circumstance more or less irrelevant to the sub- 
 ject. 
 
 12. An ability to speak in concert or simultaneously. Every one 
 who has learned to sing, knows how much easier it is to sing in 
 concert than alone. All the exercises, therefore, for the cure of 
 stammering, should, at first, be conducted in concert. 
 
 Stammering may be considered a fault in elocution, the result of 
 defective education, and is confirmed by habit. If children were 
 properly instructed in .speaking and reading, this affection of the 
 vocal organs would probably, seldom or never occur. Hence, no 
 mode of treatment that is not founded in just elocution or the cor- 
 rect exercise of the organs of speech for the purposes of vocal ex- 
 pression, can be relied on. This must appear obvious to every in- 
 telligent and reflecting mind. The stammerer must be taught how 
 to give language the pitch, time, and force which the sense requires. 
 To effect this, his muscles of speech, which have long been refrac- 
 tory, must be trained till they are brought under the control of 
 volition, and like a well-marshalled troop of soldiers, made to act in 
 harmonious concert. 
 
 Oral language may be resolved into certain sounds which are its 
 elements. Now there are certain positions of the organs of speech 
 more favourable than others for the production of the elements. 
 The stammerer should be made thoroughly acquainted with these 
 positions, and, in connexion with them, should be required to exer- 
 cise his voice in the most energetic manner upon all the elements 
 singly, till he can utter them without hesitation. He should also 
 utter them in various combinations, not only according to the laws 
 of syllabication, but in every irregular way. The vowels should 
 be exploded from the throat with great force ; and they should be 
 sung, as well as pronounced with the rising and falling inflection, 
 through every interval of pitch within the compass of the voice. 
 
 The pupil should be drilled in various exercises whose highest 
 peculiarity is time and force. Time may be measured by means 
 of the Metronome, by beating with the hand, and by marching.* 
 
 Also by beating with the dumb-bells. 
 


## p. 37 (#47) ##############################################

ARTICULATION. 37 
 
 Pitch, time, and force, are the elements of expression, and a propel 
 combination of them in reading and speaking, constitutes good elo- 
 cution. When, therefore, the stammerer becomes master of these 
 elements, as well as the elements of the language, he may com- 
 mence speaking and reading. In his first attempts at conversation, 
 Doth teacher and pupil should speak in a deliberate manner, with a 
 full, firm tone of voice, and in a very low pitch. 
 
 The stammerer should now commit to memory a short piece 
 which requires to be spoken with explosive force; for example, 
 " Satan's speech to his legions." The members of the class should 
 stand at a sufficient distance from each other to prevent their hands 
 coming in contact when their arms are extended. They should 
 then pronounce the speech in concert, after the teacher, and accom- 
 pany it with appropriate gesticulation. It should be repeated again 
 and again, till each pupil can give it proper expression, both as 
 regards voice and gesture. Each pupil should then, in turn, take 
 the place of the teacher and give out the speech to the class. To 
 prevent the pupil's stammering, while he is performing the teach- 
 er's part, the teacher himself should play an accompaniment on the 
 violoncello, violin, organ, drum, or some other instrument. At firsl 
 the notes should be made very loud ; but if the effort of the pupil, 
 standing out of the class, is likely to be successful, they should gra- 
 dually be made softer and softer, and, finally, the accompaniment 
 omitted altogether. This piece should be pronounced alternately 
 with one which requires to be spoken with long quantity and in a 
 low pitch, as " Ossian's Address to the Sun." 
 
 When the pupil has mastered these two kinds of reading, he may 
 take up dignified dialogue, and, lastly, conversational pieces. He 
 should drawl out difficult words, which are generally those having 
 short vowels preceded by labials, dentals, and gutturals. 
 
 In very bad cases of stammering, the pupil should first sing the 
 words, then drawl them, then pronounce them with very long quan- 
 tity, and thus gradually approximate to common speaking. 
 
 As soon as the pupils can speak without stammering, they should 
 recite singly in a very large room, or in the open air, at a distance 
 from the audience, which, at first, should consist of the members of 
 the class only. A few visiters should be occasionally introduced, 
 and the number should be gradually increased. In this way the 
 stammerer will soon acquire sufficient confidence to speak before a 
 large assembly. In some cases it may be expedient for the stam- 
 merer to recite before an audience in a dark room ; but as he ac- 
 quires confidence, light should be gradually admitted. 
 
 Stammerers, instead of speaking immediately after inspiration, as 
 they should do, often attempt to speak immediately after expiration, 
 when, of course, they have no power to speak. The lungs, like a 
 bellows, perform their part in the process of speaking, best, when 
 plentifully supplied with air. This is an important fact, and should

 be remembered, not only by stammerers, but also by those who nave 
 occasion to read or speak in public. Loud speaking - , long-continued, 
 with the lungs but partially distended, is very injurious to these 
 organs : it is apt to occasion a spitting of blood, v Men is not unfre- 
 quently a precursor of pulmonary consumption. But loud speaking, 
 with proper management of the breath, is a healthful exercise : be- 
 sides strengthening the muscles which it calls into action, it pro 
 motes the clecarbonization of the blood, and, consequently, exerts a 
 salutary influence on the system generally. [See additional re- 
 marks, in Appendix at the end of the volume, where will be found 
 an account of the new surgical operation for the radical cure of 
 stammering, which has been performed, with more or less success, 
 both in Europe and in this country.] 
 
 SECTION II. 
 
 PITCH. 
 
 ITCH is the degree of the eleva- 
 tion of sounds. 
 
 As pitch regards the elevation of sounds, 
 it respects their acuteness and gravity. I 
 /5 $f use the term pitch in its widest significa- 
 tion. — In the science of music, it is used 
 not only in the sense in which I employ it, 
 but it also has a special application : in the 
 latter, it is applied to the medium note, the regulating note to 
 which instruments are brought by the act of tuning. When ap- 
 plied in this sense, it is termed concert-pitch. The note which has 
 been adopted, by common consent, as the pitch-note, is A, the open 
 note of the second string of the violin : it is written in the second 
 space of the treble staff. 
 
 A lax division of pitch is into high and low ; in other 
 words, into acute and grave ; (those notes being called 
 high, or acute, which are above the natural pitch of 
 the voice ; and those low, or grave, which are below it) 
 Strictly speaking, the application of high and low, to pitch, is 
 without philosophic foundation : it has originated, not from any

PITCH. 39 
 
 principles in the acuteness and gravity of sound, but from the rela- 
 tive position of the notes in the graphic scale. This is obvious 
 from the fact that the degrees of the scale may be exemplified in a 
 horizontal line, by varying the forms of the graphic notes, as was 
 done by the Greeks. 
 
 An exact division of pitch, as demonstrated by the 
 diatonic scale, is into tones and semitones.* 
 
 The word tone, as here employed, signifies a certain degree of 
 difference in pitch between two notes, as that between the first and 
 second note of the scale. But in some cases we use the word tone, 
 as synonymous with note; for instance, in some persons the tones 
 oi the voice are more musical than in others — that is, the notes 
 of the voice. 
 
 The diatonic scale consists of seven sounds, moving 
 discretely from grave to acute, or from acute to grave, 
 by different degrees of pitch, of which the semitone 
 may be the common measure, or divisor, without a 
 fraction. The scale, however, is not complete without 
 the octave, which is a repetition of the first note in the 
 eighth degree. 
 
 The notes do not ascend by equal degrees of pitch, 
 but by tones and semitones ; the semitones occurring 
 between the third and fourth, and seventh and eighth. 
 The order of the scale, therefore, is as follows : two 
 tones and a semitone, three tones and a semitone. And 
 should it be desirable to extend the series of sounds, the 
 eighth note of the first octave will become the first note 
 of the second octave ; the eighth note of the second oc- 
 tave, the first note of the third, and so on. 
 
 In teaching the pupil to " raise and fall the eight 
 notes," as it is called, the monosyllables, Do, Re, Mi, 
 Fa, Sol, La, Si,f may be employed. 
 
 Diag. 4 is a graphic representation of the scale. The 
 heavy, horizontal, parallel lines, represent the notes ; 
 and the spaces between them, the consecutive intervals 
 of the scale.

 An interval is a difference in pitch. Intervals are 
 either discrete, or concrete. A discrete interval is the 
 difference in pitch between any two notes which vary 
 from each other in acuteness and gravity. A concrete 
 interval is that portion of the scale through which the 
 voice slides on a concrete of speech. 
 
 The difference in pitch between the first and second 
 note of the scale, is called the interval of a tone, or 
 second ; between the second and third, a tone ; between 
 the third and fourth, a semitone ; between the fourth 
 and fifth, a tone; between the fifth and sixth, a tone ; be- 
 tween the sixth and seventh, a tone ; between the se- 
 venth and eighth, a semitone. 
 
 The difference in pitch between the first and third 
 note of the scale, is called the interval of a third ; be- 
 tween the first and fourth, the interval of a fourth ; be- 
 tween the first and fifth, the interval of a fifth ; between 
 the first and sixth, the interval of a sixth ; between the 
 first and seventh, the interval of a seventh ; between 
 the first and eighth, the interval of an octave. 
 
 The intervals between the first and third, fourth and 
 sixth, and fifth and seventh, are called major thirds; 
 because they contain two tones, or four semitones ; but 
 as the intervals between the second and fourth, third

 In the expression of our thoughts 
 by oral language, we employ three 
 sorts of voice — the natural voice, 
 the falsetto voice, and the whispering 
 voice, which I shall now attempt to 
 describe. 
 
 The medium compass of the voice, 
 in those whose voices have been pro- 
 perly cultivated, is three octaves.* 
 There is, however, a point of pitch 
 at which the voice, in ascending 
 the scale, is said to break. This 
 point, in a majority of persons, is 
 about two octaves above the lowest 
 note of the voice. The natural voice 
 embraces all the notes below this 
 point ; the falsetto, all the notes above 
 it. (See Diag. 5.) 
 
 The Italians call the natural voice voce di 
 petto, and the falsetto voice voce di testa ; f 
 because they suppose the former to come 
 from the chest, and the latter from the head. 
 This error has arisen from a want of anato- 
 mical and physiological knowledge of the 
 vocal organs. Voice is never formed in the 
 chest, or in the head : it is always formed in 
 the upper part of the larynx, at the aperture 
 of the glottis. It is, however, formed higher, 
 or lower in the throat, according to its de- 
 gree of acuteness, or gravity. At the command of the wi 
 larynx may be elevated, or depressed, and the aperture of the glot- 
 tis enlarged, or diminished. The larynx is the most depressed, and 
 the aperture of the glottis the most dilated, when the gravest sound 
 is formed ; and the larynx is the most elevated, and the aperture

 of the glottis the most contracted, when the acutest sound is formed. 
 Hence grave sounds appear to come from the chest, and acute ones 
 from the head, or roof of the mouth. From this circumstance, no 
 doubt, has arisen the error of calling the natural voice voce di petto, 
 and the falsetto voice voce di testa. 
 
 The whispering voice does not, like the natural voice 
 and the falsetto, owe its peculiarity to pitch, but to the 
 absence of what is generally understood by the term 
 vocality. The compass of the whispering voice is about 
 an octave. My own extends through ten degrees of 
 the scale.* 
 
 The natural pitch of the female voice is an octave 
 above that of the male voice. The pitch of the female 
 voice corresponds to that of the violin ; the pitch of the 
 male voice, to that of the violoncello. The voices of 
 boys are of the same pitch as the female voice — one 
 octave above a man's voice. When boys are about the 
 age of fourteen, their voices undergo a change of pitch. 
 
 The notes of the falsetto voice are called treble ; the 
 upper notes of the natural voice, tenor ; and the lower 
 notes of the natural voice, bass.-f (See Diag. 5.) 
 
 The divisions of the voice, as given by Italian au- 
 thors, and adopted by many musicians of other coun- 
 tries, are as follows : 
 
 " There are three departments in the human voice, 
 viz., the high, the middle, and the low. These depart- 
 ments are in the female, as well as in the male voice. 
 Soprano, mezzo soprano, and contralto, are female voices. 
 Tenore, baritono, and basso, are male voices. "J 
 
 The reader will observe that the falsetto voice is not 
 included in the above division.

 on the German flute, and some other wind instruments, through the 
 compass of an octave.

 The notes of music are named after the first seven letters of the 
 alphabet, and are represented by graphic notes, which are written 
 on five horizontal, parallel lines, and in the intermediate spaces. 
 These lines and spaces are called the staff. (See Diag. 6.) The 
 lines and spaces of the staff are counted upward, that is, the lowest 
 
 the staff. {Diag. 6.)

 line of the staff is called the first line, the one above it the second 
 line, and so on; the lowest space is called the first space, the next 
 the second space, and so on. (See Diag. 6.) Each line, and each 
 space, is called a degree. Hence, as there are five lines, and four 
 spaces, the staff includes nine degrees. (See Diag. 6.) 
 
 When it is desirable to extend the notes above or below the staff 
 short lines, called ledger lines, are employed. (See Diag. 7.) 
 
 THE STAFF WITH LEDGER LINES. (Diag. 7.) 
 
 As the great scale of sounds, which includes all the notes that 
 can be made by instrumental means, is very extensive, it has been 
 found convenient to divide it into two parts, and allot a staff to each 
 part. The notes in the upper division of the great scale are writ- 
 ten on what is called the treble staff ; those in the lower division, 
 upon what is denominated the bass staff. 
 
 To distinguish between the two staffs,* and to determine the 
 names of the graphic notes, and the sounds which they represent, 
 characters called cleffs are placed at the beginning of each staff. 
 
 The treble cleff is called G, because a particular Treble Cleff.

 Diag. 8. represents three octaves of the finger-board of the piano- 
 forte, and the two staffs, with their cleffs. The notes are written 
 upon the staffs opposite those keys of the piano by which they are 
 respectively produced. 
 
 The usual compass of a modern grand piano-forte, is six octaves. 
 The instrument extends one octave below, and two octaves above 
 that portion of the finger-board which is represented in Diag. 8. 
 
 The keys of the piano, like the notes which they severally pro- 
 duce, are named after the first seven letters of the alphabet: the 
 key which produces the F note is called the F Key; that which 
 produces the G note, the G Key; that which produces the A note, 
 the A Key, and so on. 
 
 The finger-board of the piano consists of white and black keys. 
 The instrument is so constructed, that if you touch the white keya 
 in their consecutive order, a diatonic series will be produced ■ but 
 if you touch all the keys, white and black, in their consecutive 
 order, a semitonic series will be the result. 
 
 In the diatonic scale, as has been shown, there are five tones, 
 and two semitones. There are, however, two varieties of the scale : 
 one is called the major mode; the other, the minor mode. In the 
 major mode, the first semitone is between the third and fourth de-

 gree of the scale ; the second, between the seventh and eighth, 
 (Diagram 4, p. 40, represents the major scale.) The minor mode, 
 in ascending, has the first semitone between the second and third 
 degree; the second, between the seventh and eighth; but in de- 
 scending, the second semitone is between the fifth and sixth. (See

 No. 1, in Diagram 9, represents the ascending and descending 
 major scale ; No. 2, the ascending minor scale ; and No. 3, the de- 
 scending minor scale. 
 
 There is another scale, called the semitonic, or chromatic. It ia 
 formed by dividing the whole tones of the diatonic scale into semi- 
 tones, by five additional sounds. The chromatic scale may be il- 
 lustrated by touching all the white and black keys of a piano-forte, 
 in their consecutive order. (The chromatic scale is represented by 
 No. 4, in Diag. 9.) 
 
 The sounds which compose the diatonic scale, as I have said, are 
 named after the first seven letters of the alphabet. The five addi- 
 tional sounds, which, when added to the diatonic scale, divide it 
 into semitones, are called flats, or sharps, according as they receive 
 the names of the notes immediately below, or of those immediately 
 above them. Thus, the second note of the chromatic scale of C, is 
 called C sharp, or Dflat; the fourth is called D sharp, or Eflat; 
 the seventh, F sharp, or G flat ; the ninth, G sharp, or Aflat; 
 and the eleventh, A sharp, or Bflat. (See No. 4, in Diag. 9.) 
 
 When a note is to be sung, or played sharp, a character called a 
 sharp (sf) is prefixed to it. When a note is to be sung, or played

 flat, a character called a flat (b) is prefixed to it. Sharps and flats 
 are generally placed at the beginning of a tune, or strain, immedi- 
 ately after the cleff. They are then called the signature ; because 
 they serve to point out the key. 
 
 By key is meant a scale of sounds, to the first of which all the 
 others bear a certain relation. This first note is called the key- 
 note, .' fundamental note, or tonic. As each note of the diatonic 
 scat; ( ' C (see No. 1), as well as its sharp and flat (see No. 4), 
 may <.y-, assumed as a key-note of a series of seven, it follows that 
 there are twenty-one major, and twenty-one minor keys. And as 
 eaci» note of the diatonic scale of C, as well as its sharp and flat, 
 may also be assumed as a key-note of a chromatic series, it follows 
 thai there are twenty-one keys in the chromatic genus. These, 
 ••added to the forty-two keys in the diatonic genus, make the whole 
 number of keys in the musical system amount to sixty-three. Still, 
 as there are but twelve notes, there can be but thirty-six scales ; 
 and even this number may be resolved into three — one major, one 
 minor, and one chromatic; all the others are transpositions of the 
 three primitive scales into different ranges of pitch. 
 
 The speaking voice, in good elocution, seldom rises 
 higher than a fifth above the lowest note of its com- 
 pass. Supposing the lowest note which can be made 
 with a full intonation, to be F, the following scheme 
 will show the relative pitch of keys, adapted to the 
 expression of different kinds of sentiments.

 We not unfrequently meet with individuals who always 
 speak in the highest key of the natural voice, and we 
 occasionally meet with some who even speak in the 
 falsetto. A high pitch, in speech, is unpleasant to a 
 cultivated ear ; and though it may answer in the busi- 
 ness transactions of life, it is totally inadequate tc the 
 correct expression of sentiments of respect, venerauon. 
 dignity and sublimity. 
 
 CHAPTER I. ■ 
 
 INFLECTIONS. 
 
 NFLECTIONS, in the science of 
 Elocution, are notes of speech — notes 
 that, in regard to pitch, undergo a con- 
 tinual change during the time of their 
 pronunciation. 
 
 Writers on elocution describe six dif- 
 ferent notes of speech ; namely, the rising 
 inflection, the falling inflection, the acuto- 
 grave circumflex inflection, the gravo-acute circumflex 
 inflection, the acuto-gravo-acute circumflex inflection, 
 and the gravo-acuto- grave circumflex inflection.* 
 
 In the rising inflection, the movement of the voice is 
 from grave to acute ; in the falling inflection, from acute 
 to grave ; in the acuto-grave circumflex, from grave to 
 acute, thence back to grave ; in the gravo-acute cir- 
 cumflex, from acute to grave, thence back to acute ; in 
 the acuto-gravo-acute circumflex, from grave to acute, 
 thence back to grave, and thence again to acute ; in the 
 
 * Mr. Steele calls the inflections of the voice accents — acute, 
 grave, and circumflex. Dr. Rush denominates the rising inflection 
 the rising- concrete; the falling- inflection, the downward concrete, 
 the circumflexes he calls waves.

 gravo-acuto-grave circumflex, from acute to grave, 
 thence back to acute, and thence again to grave. 
 
 In that part of this work which consists of Exercises 
 in Reading and Declamation, these notes of speech 
 are represented by the acute, grave, and circumflex 
 accents, thus ; 
 
 Rising inflection ('). Acuto-grave circumflex ( A ). 
 
 Falling inflection ( l ). Gravo-acute circumflex (v). 
 Acuto-gravo-acute circumflex (/v). 
 Gravo-acuto-grave circumflex (v\). 
 
 In reading and speaking, each syllable has some one 
 of these inflections ; but, for practical purposes, it is 
 necessary to mark those only which are emphatic. 
 
 The various movements of the voice, in song and speech, may be 
 explained in the following manner : 
 
 When the bow is drawn across an open string of the violin, or 
 any of its species, a sound is produced of a uniform pitch, from be- 
 ginning to end. This sound is a pure note of music, and, so far as 
 pitch is concerned, is identical with a note of song. When the 
 bow is drawn across the same string, while the centre of the string 
 is pressed down with the finger, a sound is produced similar to that 
 of the open string, but an octave higher. The intermediate notes 
 of the diatonic scale may be produced by pressing down the string, 
 at the proper places, and drawing the bow across it. 
 
 When a string of the violin is pressed down by the finger, and, 
 at the same time, the finger is made to slide upon it towards the 
 bridge of the instrument, during the drawing of the bow, a sound is 
 produced which gradually increases in acuteness from beginning 
 to end. When the finger is made to slide in the opposite direction, 
 during the drawing of the bow, a sound is produced which gradu- 
 ally increases in gravity during its prolongation. When the finger 
 is made to slide towards the bridge, and thence back again, during 
 the drawing of the bow, a simple circumflex note is produced. 
 When the finger is made to slide towards the bridge, thence back 
 again, and thence again towards the bridge, during the drawing of 
 the bow, a compound circumflex note is produced. 
 
 Other varieties of the slide might be given, but these are suffi- 
 cient to answer the purpose of explanation. 
 
 "The slide is a grace of much simplicity and beauty, evidently 
 drawn from nature. It expresses the most tender and affectionate 
 emotions: we hear it in those little gusts of passion which mothers 
 use in caressing their infants: it is one of the most endearing tones 
 in the language of nature. 
 


## p. 49 (#59) ##############################################

PITCH. 49 
 
 " The portamento, or carriage of the voice, as the Italians term 
 it, is an easy mode of sliding from one tone to another. Hence 
 second-rate singers find it a convenient method of encountering 
 those notes which lie at remote and awkward distances. In some 
 voices it is so fixed, by habit, that two bars cannot be sung without 
 it. When so used, it utterly destroys every pretence to good sing- 
 ing, by interposing an effect of the most sickening kind ; when used 
 with discretion, it adds much to the force of expression ; and, in 
 Madame Caradori, it was a grace both tender and agreeable. 
 
 " The violinist, Paganini, the present wonder of the world, plays 
 an entire cantabile* upon one string, sliding through all the inter- 
 vals with a single finger — the effect of which is so plaintive, and 
 desolate, as to move his audience to tears. Velluti, the first singing- 
 master of the age, uses this grace with incomparable beauty; in his 
 voice it imparts a tenderness not to be described."! 
 
 The sliding notes above described are analagous to drawling 
 notes of speech. Speech, to be natural, requires each syllable to 
 be uttered with a certain degree of force. This force is always in 
 proportion to the length of the syllable. A syllable is drawled 
 when it is pronounced with inadequate force — in other words, with 
 force less than that which constitutes the minimum degree of natu- 
 ral speech. 
 
 The extent of the concrete intervals of the notes of 
 speech, is various under various circumstances. A 
 rising inflection may be carried through the whole 
 compass of the voice. But, in the most energetic in- 
 terrogation, the voice seldom rises higher than an oc- 
 tave; though sometimes it extends to a tenth, or a 
 twelfth. The smallest concrete interval does not, per 
 haps, exceed a quarter tone. 
 
 The concrete intervals of rising inflections are 
 greater than those of their corresponding falling inflec- 
 tions. This may be illustrated by pronouncing the 
 letter a interrogatively and affirmatively, several times, 
 with increasing energy, making the intervals of each 
 succeeding pair greater than those of the preceding, as 
 shown by the following diagram :

 In the above diagram, each falling inflection com- 
 mences in a lower degree of pitch than that in which 
 its corresponding rising inflection terminates. Should 
 a falling inflection be made to extend through the same 
 interval as its corresponding rising inflection, it would 
 be a drawling note, and not a pure note of speech. 
 
 Falling inflections may be uttered with greater force 
 than rising inflections. This is shown, in Diag. 11, by 
 the relative widths of the notes. 
 
 Rising inflections are far more numerous than fall- 
 ing inflections : the former constitute the main body 
 of oral language, while the latter are employed for the 
 purposes of emphasis, and in the formation of cadences. 
 Rising inflections are often emphatic ; but their empha- 
 sis is weaker than that of falling inflections. 
 
 The circumflexes are used for the purposes of em- 
 phasis. The acuto-grave circumflex, when carried 
 through a wide interval, is employed for the expression 
 of irony and scorn.* When the circumflexes are pro- 
 perly introduced, they are very expressive. These 
 movements of the voice, however, are seldom required ; 
 when improperly employed, they affect the ear of a 
 good reader as unpleasantly as the too frequent use of 
 the portamento does that of a good musician. 
 
 * *' The circumflexes, acuto-grave" says Mr. Steele, " are cha- 
 racteristic of the Irish tone ; and the circumflexes, gravo-acute, are 
 characteristic of the Scottish tone." — (See Steele's Prosodia Ra- 
 twnaiis.)

 Writers on Elocution have given numerous rules foi 
 the regulation of inflections ; but most of these rules are 
 better calculated to make bad readers than good ones. 
 Those founded on the construction of sentences might, 
 perhaps, do credit to a mechanic, but they certainly do 
 none to an elocutionist. 
 
 The subject is of such a nature that it would be 
 difficult, if. not impossible, to give rules for the regula- 
 tion of all the inflections of the voice, in reading and 
 speaking; and, as any rule on this part of elocution 
 must necessarily be limited in its application, I have 
 thought proper to dispense with them altogether. This 
 work, however, does not leave the reader without a 
 guide : in the practical part of it, numerous examples 
 are given, which, I trust, will have a tendency to form 
 a correct taste. When the student shall have acquired 
 a knowledge of the principles of elocution, he will have 
 no occasion for rules. 
 
 The reader should bear in mind that a falling inflec- 
 tion gives more importance to a word than a rising in- 
 flection. Hence it should never be employed merely 
 for the sake of variety ; but for emphasis and cadences. 
 Neither should a rising inflection be used for the sake 
 of mere "harmony" where a falling inflection would 
 better express the meaning of the author. 
 
 The sense should, in all cases, determine the direc- 
 tion of inflections. Hence the absi^rdity of the term 
 u harmonic inflection" as employed by Walker and his 
 disciples— an inflection which, for the sake of harmony. 
 takes a direction contrary to that required by the sense i 
 If a sentence is pronounced so as to bring out the 
 sense in the most forcible manner, all the inflections 
 must necessarily be harmonic, or, more correctly speak- 
 ing, melodic* Every modification of the voice, which 
 is not compatible with the sentiment, weakens the force 
 of the elocution by drawing off the attention of the 
 hearer from the sense to the sound,

 MELODY. 
 
 r^ELODY is a series of simple 
 sounds, emanating from the 
 voice, or an instrument, so 
 varied in pitch as to produce 
 a pleasing effect upon the ear. 
 The series of graph denotes by 
 which these sounds are repre- 
 sented, is also called melody. 
 Melody is distinguished from harmony by not necessarily includ- 
 ing a combination of parts. The term harmony, as employed in 
 the science of music, signifies a union of melodies, a succession of 
 combined sounds, moving at consonant intervals, according to the 
 laws of modulation.* 
 
 Notation is the graphic representation of a melody — 
 in other words, the expression of a melody by written 
 characters. 
 
 Intonation is the act of sounding the notes of a me- 
 lody, either with the voice, or an instrument. When 
 each note is produced in its proper degree of pitch, the 
 intonation is true ; when the intervals are not observed 
 with exactness, the intonation is false. Correct into- 
 nation, in speech, is highly important : in song, and in- 
 strumental music, it is indispensable; for, if the intona- 
 tion is false, melody loses its charms, and harmony 
 becomes discord. 
 
 The melody of speech is founded on sense ; that of 
 song, generally, on sound. Words containing opposite 
 
 * The term harmonious is correctly employed when applied to 
 two or more sounds whose union is consonant, or agreeable ; it is 
 incorrectly employed when applied to the notes of a single melody, 
 as is done by some authors, who confound it with the word melo 
 dious.

 sentiments may be sung to the same air, with effects 
 equally good, if the force and time be properly varied. 
 Tnus, if the two songs, March to the Battle Field, and 
 Oft in the Stilly Night, be sung to the same air — the 
 former with great force, and in quick time — the latter 
 with diminished force, and in slow time, there will be 
 as much difference of expression between them as there 
 is between that of joy and sorrow.* But speech is not 
 so accommodating. Here every sentence must not 
 only have its appropriate tune, but the tune must be 
 properly pitched. 
 
 The melody of song is graduated on a scale whose 
 degrees are as definite as those of the scale of Gunter. 
 But the melody of speech is not formed with such ma- 
 thematical exactness — it has no scale of determinate 
 degrees. Hence it is difficult to represent it graphi- 
 cally — to give to each note 
 
 "A local habitation and a name." 
 
 But even if an exact notation of the melody of speech 
 should be given, it is doubtful whether it would be of 
 much practical importance to the generality of man- 
 kind, as none but a Paganini would be able to read it. 
 Such a notation, however, is a desideratum — it would 
 be highly interesting to the philosopher ; and I would 
 advise all elocutionists who have a good ear for music, 
 and can perform on stringed instruments of the violin 
 species, to direct their attention to the subject.f 
 
 For practical purposes, however, it is not essential 
 to present every syllable in speech under its proper 
 note, as is done in song : it is only necessary to give a 
 notation of the relative pitch of the emphatic syllables. 
 
 * The reader must not infer that I entertain the opinion that in 
 song- melody cannot be adapted to sentiment. I believe that if the 
 composers of music were elocutionists, they would always construct 
 their melodies with reference to the sentiments to be expressed.

 Such a notation may be read by those who have no 
 knowledge of music whatever, and, consequently, does 
 not require the aid of a Paganini. Besides, if the rela- 
 tive pitch of the heavy, or emphatic syllables, and their 
 inflections, are given, the light, or unemphatic sylla- 
 bles will naturally take their proper degrees of eleva- 
 tion. 
 
 The series of notes by which the relative pitch, ana 
 inflections of the emphatic syllables are represented, 
 is denominated an emphasis melody. The emphasis 
 melodies are written on four horizontal, parallel lines. 
 These lines are called the staff of speech, in contradis- 
 tinction to the staffof music, which consists of five hori- 
 zontal, parallel lines, and the intermediate spaces. 
 
 "Ye are the things that tower, that shine, whose 
 smile makes glad, whose frown is terrible.'' 
 
 In the above sentence there are four emphatic points, 
 which are represented by the following

 tower, shine, glad, terrible. 
 
 Each note in the above diagram has the falling inflec- 
 tion, and no two have the same radical pitch. There 
 is a gradual increase in the size of the notes from the 
 first to the last, which represents a gradual increase of 
 force, forming a sort of climax. 
 
 In that part of this work which consists of Exer- 
 cises in Reading and Declamation, the notes of the 
 emphasis melodies are represented by graphic inflec- 
 tions placed at different degrees of elevation, thus: 
 
 " Ye are the things that tow er, that shine*, whose 
 smile makes glad', whose frown is terrible." 
 
 In reading and speaking there is one note whicn

 predominates ; and in correct reading and speaking, the 
 pitch of this note is always in accordance with the 
 sentiment. This predominant, leading, or pitch-note 
 of speech, is written on the second line of the staff, 
 counting from below. To render the pitch-line con- 
 spicuous, it is made heavier than the other lines of the 
 staff. (See Diag. 12.) In the Exercises in Reading 
 and Declamation, the pitch-note is represented by the 
 graphic inflection which commences at the centre of 
 the body of the letter. (See the word shine, in the 
 foregoing example.) When one reads altogether in the 
 pitch-note, the reading is monotonous ; when the voice 
 is properly varied in pitch, it occasionally rises a de- 
 gree, or two degrees above, or descends a degree below 
 it, as represented by the staff. 
 
 The reader must not conclude that the melody of 
 speech is confined to four degrees of pitch, whose inter- 
 vals are as determinate as those of the diatonic scale. 
 The intervals between the several notes of an empha- 
 sis melody vary according to circumstances. In ener- 
 getic declamation, and in interrogative and exclamatory 
 sentences, they may be said to be at their maximum ; 
 in solemn, and in plaintive discourse, at their minimum. 
 Neither must the reader conclude that the melody of 
 speech consists solely of emphasis melodies. These form, 
 as it were, the grand outlines of the picture, and the 
 notes of the syllables not included in the emphasis 
 melodies, constitute the filling up and the shading of it. 
 
 The graphic notes of song represent absolute, as well 
 as relative pitch. But as the graphic notes of an em- 
 phasis melody of speech denote relative pitch only, two 
 emphasis melodies similarly constructed, though differ- 
 ent in their relative intervals, may be represented by 
 the same series of graphic notes. 
 
 In reading emphasis melodies, beginners are apt to 
 make the intervals too great. Care should be taken 
 to avoid this fault, or the melody will be caricatured. 
 A little practice, under a good teacher, will enable

 almost any one, who is not insensible to the changes 
 of pitch, to observe the proper intervals with tolerable 
 accuracy. And as these melodies are founded in the 
 nature of the subject, those who have a taste for elocu- 
 tion will scarcely require a teacher, for they will read 
 them, as it were, by intuition. 
 
 CHAPTER III. 
 
 MODULATION. 
 
 MODULATION is a chang- 
 ing of the pitch-note to a 
 higher or lower degree of ele- 
 vation — in other words, it 
 is the process of changing the 
 key, or of passing from one 
 key to another. This change 
 is sometimes made to a proxi- 
 mate key ; at other times, a bold and abrupt transition 
 to a remote key is necessary to produce the desired 
 effect. Modulation is generally attended with a change 
 of force, or time; and, not unfrequently, with a change 
 of both. There is not a more important requisite in 
 Elocution — nothing which contributes more to the 
 pleasure of an audience — nothing which gives stronger 
 proof that an orator is master of his art, than a well- 
 regulated and expressive modulation. Modulation, 
 however, should never be resorted to for the sake of 
 mere variety — it should always be subservient to the 
 sense; for it is the province of modulation to mark 
 changes of sentiment, changes in the train of thought, 
 and parenthetical clauses. 
 
 Under ordinary circumstances, the various modula- 
 tions of the voice, in reading and speaking, may be 
 represented by a staff of four lines. That this staff 
 may not be confounded with the staff of melody, de-

 scribed in the preceding chapter, it is made of lines 
 composed of dots, and called the staff of modulation. 
 The lines of this staff, like those of the staff of melody, 
 are counted from below upward. The second line is 
 called the pitch-note line of the staff of modulation. 
 
 A series of modulations, as represented by the fol- 
 lowing diagram, might, very appropriately, be termed 
 a melody of melodies.

 This diagram shows the modulations of the voice in

 sian's Address to the Sun.

 Staff a, in Diagram 13, is designed for the first sec 
 tion in the above extract ; staff b, for the second sec- 
 tion, and so on. The transition from c to d is abrupt • 
 also that from g to A, The pitch-note of staff a is 
 identical with that of staff e and that of staff h, and 
 corresponds to the pitch-note of modulation. 
 
 In that part of this work which consists of Exer- 
 cises in Reading and Declamation, the modulations 
 of the voice are indicated by small numerals prefixed

 to the words where the transitions should take place 
 These numerals are 1, 2, 3, 4, and represent, respec- 
 tively, the first, second, third, and fourth line of the 
 staff of modulation. This is shown in the preceding ex- 
 tract from Ossian's Address to the Sun. No. 2 is pre- 
 fixed to the first section, to show that this section is to 
 be read in the pitch-note of modulation ; No. 3 is pre- 
 fixed to the second, section, to show that this section 
 should be read in the third degree of the staff of modu- 
 lation : No. 4 is prefixed to the third section, to show 
 that this section should be read in the fourth degree 
 of the staff of modulation ; No. 1 is prefixed to the 
 fourth section, to show that this section should be 
 read in the first degree of the staff of modulation ; and 
 so on. (See the Extract, and Diag. 13.) 
 
 Some public speakers, who are ignorant of the principles of Elo- 
 cution, but who, nevertheless, are considered by the vulgar as 
 great orators, modulate their voices in the most erratic and hyper- 
 bolical manner. I once heard a clergyman pronounce the follow- 
 ing sentence in the way which I shall describe : 
 
 " While God's omniscient eye passes from seat to seat, | and 
 ranges throughout the house, j he beholds what is passing in every 
 heart." 
 
 The first section, while God's omniscient eye passes from seat 
 to seat, he pronounced in the first degree above the lowest note of 
 his voice ; the second section, and ranges throughout the house, he 
 uttered with great force, in the highest note of his natural voice; 
 the third section, he beholds what is passing in every heart, he 
 pronounced with a mixture of vocality and aspiration, in the lowest 
 note of his voice. Such wild and extravagant transitions, though 
 they may astonish the ignorant, " cannot but make the judicious 
 grieve." The manner in which the speaker pronounced the first 
 and third section in the above sentence, is good ; and had he pro- 
 nounced the second section in the same pitch and force with the 
 first, his elocution would have been faultless. 
 
 There are other public speakers who never modulate their voices, 
 however necessary it may be to give proper expression to their sen- 
 timents; and, what is worse, they generally pitch their voices a 
 third, a fifth, or an octave too high. I once listened to an excellent 
 discourse, from a very learned man, which, however, was nearly 
 lost upon the audience from the disgusting manner in which it was 
 delivered. The lecturer pitched his voice an octave too high, and

 spoke an hour and a half, without any variation in pitch, force, or 
 time; and, what rendered his delivery still more offensive, every 
 syllable was marred with an intolerable drawling. Such elocution 
 is discreditable to any man who speaks in public, and ought not to 
 be tolerated by an educated community. 
 
 SECTION III. 
 
 FORCE. 
 
 ORCE is the degree of the loud- 
 ness of sounds. It is also the 
 degree of exertion with which 
 sounds are made. 
 
 A lax division of force is into 
 loud and soft : those sounds are 
 called loud, which are made 
 with greater effort than the or- 
 dinary tones of conversation ; and those are called soft, 
 which are made with less effort. 
 
 Some use the terms high and low, as synonymous with loud and 
 soft. But this is an improper application of these words. High 
 and low regard the acuteness and gravity of sounds only, and not 
 their force : a sound may be high and soft, as well as high and loud — 
 a sound may also be low and loud, as well as low and soft. 
 
 For convenience, force is divided into nine degrees. 
 These degrees are expressed by the following abbre« 
 via t ions : 
 
 PPP (pianissimo), .. as soft as possible. 
 
 pp (piu piano), more soft, very soft. 
 
 p (piano), soft. 
 
 mp (mezzo piano), . . middling soft, rather soft. 
 
 m (mezzo), half, middle, mean. 
 
 mf (mezzo forte), . . middling loud, rather loud. 
 
 / (forte), loud. 
 
 ff (piii forte), more loud, very loud. 
 
 (ff (fortissimo), ... as loud as possible.

 Force may be considered in reference to its applica- 
 tion to sentences and paragraphs, as well as in refe- 
 rence to its application to syllables. The application 
 of force to sentences may be varied in the following 
 manner : 
 
 1. A sentence may be pronounced with uniform 
 force. 
 
 2. A sentence may be pronounced with a gradual 
 diminution of force. 
 
 3. A sentence may be pronounced with a gradual 
 increase of force. 
 
 4. The first part of a sentence may be pronounced 
 with a gradual increase of force, and the second part, 
 with a gradual diminution of force. 
 
 5. The first part of a sentence may be pronounced 
 with a gradual diminution of force, and the second part, 
 with a gradual increase of force. 
 
 Force, however, is generally applied to sentences in 
 a more irregular manner. It should always be varied 
 according to the varying demands of sentiment. 
 
 Force, applied to a note, or syllable, is denominated 
 stress. 
 
 Radical stress is the application of force at the be- 
 ginning of a note, or syllable ; it corresponds to the 
 diminuendo, in music. 
 
 Median stress is the application of force at the middle 
 of a note, or syllable ; it corresponds to the swell, or 
 crescendo et diminuendo, in music.

 Final stress is the application of force at the end of 
 a note, or syllable ; it corresponds to the crescendo, or

 a note, or syllable; it corresponds to the forzando, in 
 music.f

 deed, force may be considered the light and shade or 
 elocution. 
 
 " Mr. Alison observes, that loud sounds are connected with ideas 
 of power and danger; and that many objects in nature, which have 
 such qualities, are distinguished by such sounds. On the contrary, 
 soft sounds are connected with ideas of gentleness and delicacy. 
 The contrasts produced by the different degrees of force with which 
 sounds are uttered, form the most prominent effects of musical ex- 
 pression. The rushing of the fortissimo brings with it dread and 
 alarm ; but in the pianissimo, the chiaroscuro* of the art, we feel 
 the opposite sensation. The indistinctness of sounds apparently 
 removes them to a distance — like the faint touches in painting, 
 they seem to retire from us. Upon this principle, the ventriloquist 
 deceives the ear, by directing the attention to a point from which 
 the voice may be supposed to proceed ; and effects the deception by 
 reducing it to the exact degree of softness that it would seem to 
 possess had it really proceeded from the spot." 
 
 CRESCENDO AND DIMINUENDO. 
 
 " What is more alarming than the gradual increase of a mighty 
 sound, when it pours upon the ear from a distance; — whether it 
 proceeds from the roar of a multitude, or the raging of a storm, the 
 auditory sense is overwhelmed, and the mind is filled with imagi- 
 nary danger ! When the increasing force accumulates to excessive 
 loudness, the vibrations become too great for the soul to bear. 
 There is also a sublimity in the gradual decrease of sounds. 
 
 " It is equally sublime to listen to sounds when they retire from 
 us. Handel has aimed at this poetic effect in the ' Messiah,'' when 
 he pictures the ascent of the heavenly host, giving an idea of theii 
 distance and flight. 
 
 "There is no accomplishment in the art of singing more fascinat- 
 ing than the swelling and dying rfway of the voice; — when used 
 with taste and judgment, it never fails to delight us. The perform- 
 ance of the '■Miserere,'' in the Sixtine Chapel, in Rome, so often 
 described by travellers, owes its shadowy effect to this approaching 
 and retiring of the sounds. Farinelli moved his audience to a state 
 of ecstasy by the manner in which he commenced his famous song 
 ' Son qual nave,'' ' the first note of which was taken with such deli- 
 cacy, swelled by minute degrees to such an amazing volume, and 
 afterwards diminished in the same manner to a mere point, that it 
 was applauded for five minutes.' Beethoven is the only composer 
 who has introduced this effect into choral music: we find it applied 
 at the termination of some of the choruses in his posthumous Mass; 
 — here the voices alone pour upon the ear with an effect like the 
 swelling and dying away of the storm.

 FORZANDO. 
 
 " Explosive force forms a strong feature in the character of mo- 
 dern music ; we never find it expressed in any author before the 
 time of Haydn. It may be described as a forcible expression of 
 sound which is no sooner uttered than it drops into the utmost de- 
 gree of softness. It has its origin in the ebullition of our passions. 
 We hear it in the expressions of joy, rage, despair, &c. Indeed 
 it is natural to persons under any violent emotion. It properly 
 belongs to the sublime, although it may be so burlesqued as to as- 
 sume a ridiculous character. Like all other forcible expressions, 
 its meaning will depend upon the situation and manner in which it 
 is used."* 
 
 SECTION IV. 
 TIME. 
 
 I M E is the measure of sounds in 
 regard to their duration. 
 
 Time, in song, and instrumental 
 music, is divided into equal mea- 
 sures by rhythmical pulsation — in 
 other words, by a periodical return 
 aw of similar accents.f In graphic 
 music, these measures are rendered conspicuous to the 
 eye by vertical bars, as in the following line of poetry : 
 | Hail to the | chief who in | triumph ad- | vances. J 
 
 In speech there is also a return of similar accents, 
 but they do not always occur at regular intervals of 
 
 * Gardiner's Music of Nature. 
 
 f It is rhythmical pulsation which enables a band of musicians 
 to perform in concert. It is this also which enables a company of 
 soldiers to march synchronously, and which governs the movements 
 of the feet in daneing.

 time. Hence the rhythm of speech, like its melody, is 
 more or less irregular. 
 
 The time of a note, or syllable, is called quantity. 
 The time of a rest is also called quantity ; because 
 rests, as well as notes, are a constituent of rhythm 
 Hence the characters used for the expression of quan- 
 tity, are either of sound or silence. The former are 
 called notes ; the latter, rests. These characters, and 
 their relative lengths, are as follows : 
 
 Semibreve

 Quaver Rest *i

 Demi-Semiquaver Rest *i 
 
 = 2

 Hence, a semibreve is equal to two minims; equal to 
 four crotchets ; equal to eight quavers, &c. 
 
 A dot following a note, or rest, increases its length 
 one-half — in other words, increases its length in the 
 ratio of 2 to 3. Thus, a dotted semibreve ( o* ) is 
 equal to a semibreve and a minim ( a P), or to three 
 minims (ppp); a dotted minim - (P*), to a minim and 
 a crotchet (ff), or to three crotchets (ff?) ; and 
 so on. 
 
 There are two general modes of time — common and 
 triple. In common time each measure is divisible by 
 2 : in triple time each measure is divisible by 3. 
 
 There are several varieties of each of these modes 
 of time. When a piece is in common time, and each 
 measure contains two quavers, or their equivalent, the

 these cases, shows how many notes of a certain descrip- 
 tion there are in each measure ; and the lower figure, 
 how many of these notes are equal in value to a semi- 
 breve.

 ment demands. Solemn discourse requires a slow 
 movement ; simple narrative, a medium rate of utter- 
 ance ; animated description, as well as all language 
 expressive of any sudden passion, as joy, anger, &c, a 
 movement more or less rapid, according to the inten- 
 sity of emotion. In the science of music, various terms 
 have been employed to denote the rate of movement, 
 the principal of which are the following : 
 
 Adagio, very slow ; the slowest time. 
 
 Largo, slow time. 
 
 Larghetto, . . . slow, but not so slow as largo. 
 Andante,. . . . medium time. 
 Andantino, . . a little quicker than andante. 
 Allegretto,. . . rather quick, but not so quick as allegro. 
 Allegro, .... quick time. 
 
 Presto, very quick. 
 
 Prestissimo . . as quick as possible. 
 
 Adagio, andante and allegro, are the three chief di- 
 visions of time ; the other terms mark the intermediate 
 degrees. 
 
 In addition to the foregoing terms, which mark the 
 movement, there are others, which indicate the style 
 of performance. Some of these are as follows : 
 
 Affetuoso, . . affectionate — a soft and delicate style of performance. 
 Brilldnte,. . shining, sparkling — a gay, showy style. 
 Furioso,. . . fierce, mad — a vehement style. 
 Spiritoso,. . spirited — a spirited style. 
 
 Sometimes these terms are used in connexion w 7 ith 
 those which express the rate of movement, thus : — 
 
 Allegro con spirito, quick with spirit — in a quick and spirited 
 manner. 
 
 The rate of movement is not definitely marked by 
 the terms Adagio, Largo, Larghetto, &c. ; it may, how- 
 ever, be designated with precision by means of the 
 
 METROTOME OF MAELZEL. 
 
 This instrument has a graduated pendulum, to which

 is moved upon the pendulum, the 
 slower are its vibrations ; and the 
 contrary. When the weight cor- 
 responds to the number 50, the vi- 
 brations of the pendulum are the 
 slowest; when it corresponds to 
 160, they are the quickest. All 
 the numbers on the instrument 
 have reference to suninute of time. 
 Thus, when the weight is placed 
 at 50, fifty beats, or ticks, occur 
 in a minte ; when at 60, sixty beats 
 in a minute ; when at 100, one 
 hundred beats in a minute, &c. 
 The engraving in the margin represents the instrument 
 in action. 
 
 In reading, as a general rule, the time should be 
 marked on the metronome by whole measures — in 
 other words, each measure should correspond to one 
 tick of the instrument. 
 
 In music, it is most convenient to mark the time on 
 the metronome in adagios, by quavers ; in andantes, by 
 crotchets ; in allegros, by minims ; and in prestos, by 
 whole measures.

PART II. 
 
 GESTURE. 
 
 ESTURE is the various pos- 
 tures and motions employed in 
 vocal delivery : as the postures and 
 motions of the head, face, shoul- 
 ders, trunk, arms, hands, fingers, 
 lower limbs, and the feet. 
 
 Graceful and appropriate ges- 
 ture renders vocal delivery far more pleasing and effec- 
 tive. Hence its cultivation is of primary importance 
 to those who are ambitious of accomplishment in Elo- 
 cution. 
 
 CHAPTER I. 
 
 POSTURES OF THE BODY. 
 
 The postures of the body, with respect to vocal 
 delivery, may be divided into favourable and unfavour- 
 able ; and, the better to suit my purpose in giving their 
 illustration, I shall first treat of the unfavourable. 
 
 The most unfavourable posture is the horizontal. If 
 a reader or a speaker should lie prone, or supine, he 
 would not be likely to deliver a discourse with energy 
 and effect. I have never known an orator to deliver 
 a discourse in the horizontal posture ; but I have known 
 individuals to speak in public in postures almost as in- 
 appropriate. 
 
 As impressions communicated through the medium 
 of the eye, are the most lasting, two series of figures are

 and the latter favourable, to vocal delivery.

 gentlemen, in a number of which it has fallen torn* 
 lot to give instruction in Elocution. 
 
 The human mind is so constituted, that, in its edu- 
 cation, order becomes almost indispensable. Hence, 
 any thing that interrupts methodical instruction, is a 
 serious obstacle to the growth of intellect. Nor is 
 order more necessary than perseverance ; consequently 
 all postures of the body which are calculated for re 
 pose, should be avoided by the student in elocution 
 And as grace and dignity are of primary importance 
 in vOcal delivery, all postures which are inconsistent 
 with these attributes should also be avoided. 
 
 The erect posture of the body is the best for vocal 
 delivery ; the trunk and limbs should be braced in pro- 
 portion to the degree of energy required by the senti- 
 ments to be delivered. The right foot should be from 
 two to four inches in advance of the left, and the toes 
 turned a little outwards ; meanwhile the body should 
 be principally sustained by the left foot. 
 
 The next best is the erect sitting posture, in which 
 the shoulders do not rest against the back of the seat, 
 and in which the body is retained in its proper posi- 
 tion by muscular action. (See Ornamental Letter, 
 page 11 and 16.) 
 
 The next best is the erect sitting posture in which 
 the shoulders rest against the back of the seat. 
 
 These are the only postures which are at all favour- 
 able to vocal delivery. 
 
 MANNER OF HOLDING THE BOOK. 
 
 The book should be held in the left hand, from six 
 to eight inches from the body, and as high as the centre 
 of the breast, so as to bring the face nearly perpendi- 
 cular. It should not, however, be held so high as to 
 prevent the audience from having a view of the reader's 
 mouth, as his voice would thereby be more or less ob- 
 structed. The fingers of the right hand may take hold 
 of the margin of the book lightly (see Fig. 10, and Orna-

 mental Letter, page 16), so as to be ready to turn over the 
 leaves, as occasion may require ; or they may be placed 
 upon the page, just below the line the reader is pronounc- 
 ing, to aid him in keeping his place ; or, particularly 
 if the reader is pronouncing an original composition, 
 the right hand may be employed to illustrate and en- 
 force the sentiments by appropriate gesticulation. (See 
 Fig. 11.) If the reader be a lady, the right hand may 
 support the left arm. (See Fig. 12.) I do not, how- 
 ever, advise ladies to adopt this posture exclusively, 
 but deem it not ungraceful for them. 
 
 The eyes should occasionally be directed from the 
 words of the discourse to the audience. (See Fig. 11.) 
 
 In demonstrating on the black-board, the face, and 
 not the back, should be turned to the audience. (See 
 Fig. 13 and 14.) 
 
 CHAPTER II. 
 
 NOTATION OF GESTURE. 
 
 The want of a language for expressing the different 
 modifications of gesture with brevity and perspicuity, 
 is the principal cause of the general neglect with which 
 the cultivation of this art has hitherto been treated. 
 For this desideratum the world is indebted to the Rev. 
 Gilbert Austin, of London. In 1806, this distinguished 
 elocutionist published a quarto volume of six hundred 
 pages ; and from that work I have taken the system 
 of notation of which the following is a specimen : 
 
 When the right arm is elevated backwards, and the 
 left extended forwards, in a horizontal direction, he 
 calls the posture of the former elevated backwards, and 
 notes it eb ; and the posture of the latter, horizontal 
 forwards, and notes it hf Now the abbreviations eb 
 and hf are placed over any word which requires these 
 postures of the arms, thus : —

 Jehovah's arm 
 
 Snatch'd from the waves, and brings to me my son !* 
 
 Douglas, Act 111 
 
 For an illustration of these gestures, the reader is 
 referred to the ornamental letter on page 69. 
 
 The original idea of this system of notation, says Mr. 
 Austin, was suggested by the labour of teaching decla- 
 mation in the usual manner. During this labour, which 
 for many years constituted a part of his duty in his 
 grammar-school, the author having often found that he 
 forgot, on a following day, his own mode of instructing 
 on a former, wished to be able to invent some perma- 
 nent marks, in order to establish more uniformity in 
 his instructions, for the ease both of himself and of his 
 pupils. The mode of instruction is not so liable to 
 change, with respect to the expression of the voice, and 
 countenance, for this is always pointed out by the sen- 
 timent. But the great difficulty lies in ascertaining 
 and marking the suitable gesture ; and for these ob- 
 vious reasons ; because a language of gesture was want- 
 ing, and because gesture may be infinitely varied, and 
 yet, perhaps, be equally just. To leave the pupil to 
 choose for himself would but distract him, and, instead 
 of giving him freedom and grace, would deprive him 
 of both. On his commencement as a public speaker 
 (which cannot be too early), it is necessary to teach 
 him every thing, and to regulate, by rules, every pos- 
 sible circumstance in his delivery ; his articulation, 
 accent, emphasis, pauses, &c, and along with all, his 
 gesture. After sufficient instruction and practice, he 
 will regulate his own manner, according to the sugges- 
 tions of his judgment and taste. 
 
 Among the higher objects of this system of notation, 
 may be reckoned its uses as a record, whence the his- 
 
 * Although an explanation of the gestures on Jehovah's arm, in 
 the above sentence, is sufficient to answer my present purpose, it 
 may not be improper to inform the reader that another gesture is

 torical painter may derive the materials of truth, and 
 whence the orator and the elocutionist may not only 
 obtain the instructions of the great men who have pre- 
 ceded them in the same career, but by which also they 
 may secure, unalterably, their own improvements for 
 the advancement of their art, and for the benefit of 
 posterity. A scene of Shakspeare, or a passage of Mil- 
 ton, so noted, after the manner of a great master of 
 recitation, or an oration so noted as delivered by an 
 admired speaker, would prove an enduring study of 
 truth and nature combined with imagination. And the 
 aspiring orator would not be obliged, as at present, to 
 invent for himself an entire system of action. He might 
 derive light from the burning lamps of the dead, and 
 proceed at once, by their guidance, towards the highest 
 honours of his profession. 
 
 Had the ancients possessed the art of notating their 
 delivery, such was the unwearied diligence of their 
 great orators, Demosthenes and Cicero, that we should, 
 most probably, at this day, be in possession of their 
 manner of delivery, as well as the matter of their ora- 
 tions ; and not be limited to conjecture relative to a 
 single sentence of these eminent speakers, on the great 
 occasions which called forth their powers.

76 ELOCUTION. 
 
 CHAPTER III. 
 
 POSITION OF THE FEET AND LOWER LIMBS. 
 
 The parts of the human figure which are brought 
 into action, in gesture, cannot, in truth, be considered 
 separate ; for every muscle, over which men can exer- 
 cise voluntary action, contributes, in some measure, to 
 the perfection of gesture. For, convenience, how T ever, 
 we may enumerate and class the most distinguished 
 parts of the body, which effect the principal gestures. 
 These are : 
 
 1. The Head. 5. The Hands and Fingers. 
 
 2. The Shoulders. 6. The Low r ER Limbs and 
 
 3. The Trunk. Knees. 
 
 4. The Arms. 7. The Feet. 
 
 I shall begin, as it were, with the foundation of the 
 building, and shall first consider the positions and 
 motions of the feet and lower limbs ; since without the 
 stability and ease of these, neither grace nor dignity 
 can consist in the standing figure. 
 
 As the object of the orator is to persuade, and as 
 prejudice against his person or manners may greatly 
 impede him, he must recommend himself by every at- 
 tention to his external deportment which may be 
 deemed correct and proper ; and guard against every 
 species of inelegance that may prove disadvantageous. 
 He must, therefore, even in his posture as he stands, 
 prefer manly dignity and grace to awkward rusticity 
 and rude strength. Rude strength may suit him who 
 wishes to terrify, or to insult ; but this is rarely the 
 purpose of a public speaker. Grace and decorum win 
 favour; and this is the general object. Rude strength 
 stands indeed with stability, but. without grace. 
 
 The gracefulness of motion in the human form, or 
 perhaps in any other, consists in the facility and secu- 
 


## p. 77 (#87) ##############################################

GESTURE. 77 
 
 nty with which it is executed. And the grace of any 
 postures (except such as are manifestly designed for 
 repose), consists in the apparent facility with which 
 they can be varied. Hence, in the standing figure, the 
 posture is graceful when the weight of the body is 
 principally supported by one limb, whilst the other is 
 so placed as to be ready to relieve it promptly, and 
 without effort. And as the limbs are formed for a 
 mutual share of labour and of honour, so their alterna- 
 tion in posture, and in motion, is agreeable and grace- 
 ful. 
 
 The body must then be supported, if grace be con- 
 sulted, on either limb, like Apollo, Antinous, and other 
 beautiful and well-executed statues. 
 
 The positions of the feet are expressed by the nota- 
 tion annexed, which is to be written under the word 
 where the speaker is to assume such position. They 
 are the follow in 2 : 
 
 First Position of the Right Foot, noted R. 1. (See Fig. 15) 
 
 The upper part of the figure represents the eleva- 
 tion of the position ; the lower, the plan. 
 
 In this position the right foot (advanced before the 
 eft about the breadth of the foot), 
 orms, with the left, an an^le of 
 about seventy-five degrees, as may 
 be seen in the plan. The lines 
 which form this angle, passing 
 through the length of each foot, 
 meet its vertex under the heel of 
 the left. The principal weight of 
 the body is sustained by the left 
 foot ; the right rests lightly, but in 
 its whole length, upon the floor. 
 This fact is shown in the plan by deeply shading the 
 left foot, and lightly shading the right.

 Second Position of the Right Foot >notedR. 2. 
 
 In this position, the right foot sliding forward about 
 half its length, receives the principal 
 weight of the body, the left being 
 raised, and turning as far inwards 
 towards the right ; the ball of the 
 left great toe only lightly touching 
 the floor, to keep the body from tot- 
 tering. In the plan, the right foot, 
 by which the weight of the body is 
 principally sustained, is all shaded, 
 while that part only of the left is 
 shaded which rests upon the floor. 
 
 The angle formed by lines drawn through the length 
 
 of the feet, in this position, is about ninety degrees. 
 In this position, when the feet are near together, the 
 
 entire sole of the left foot may lightly touch the floor ; 
 
 but when the feet are separated about their own length, 
 
 or more, the left should touch only near the great toe ; 
 
 the knee should be bent, and the heel turned inward, 
 
 as in Fig. 24 and 26. 
 
 First Position of th* Left Foot, noted L. 1. (See Fig. 17). 
 
 This position of the left foot is, in 
 all respects, analogous to the first 
 position of the right. The left foot 
 is advanced, and the body is princi- 
 pally supported by the right. The 
 shading of the plan is similar to that 
 in the first position of the right, and 
 for the same purposes. 
 
 The first position of the right foot 
 is the proper reading position, when 
 no gesture is employed ; but it should be occasionally 
 alternated with the first position of the left, for the 
 relief of the supporting muscles.

 This position of the left foot is, in

 figure, it is represented in the same 
 manner, only reversed. 
 
 Figure 19 is a better plan of the 
 feet than that annexed to the eleva- 
 tions. In both positions the right 
 foot advances about half its own 
 length, as may be seen by comparing 
 it with the equidistant parallel lines. In the first posi- 
 tion of the right foot, the lines ff, ff passing through 
 the centre of the feet, s

 of the right (because the more graceful), is the proper 
 reading position. It is also the proper rising position 
 of the orator. But should he stretch forth his arms 
 towards the audience, when he begins to speak, he 
 should take the second position. 
 
 Besides the four positions above mentioned, there are 
 two others, w T hich may be called positions in front. 
 The heels are placed nearly together, and the body is 
 supported, alternately, on the right and left foot, whilst 
 the toes of the other lightly touch the floor. The angle 
 formed by the feet, in these positions, is somewhat 
 greater than a right angle. In other respects they 
 are similar to the ordinary positions. The right po- 
 sition in front, noted R. F., is when the body is sup- 
 ported on the left foot. The left position in front, 
 noted L. F., is when the body is supported on the right 
 foot. The position in front is used when persons are 
 addressed alternately, on either side, whilst the audi- 
 tors are in front, as on the stage. It is not graceful, 
 and should not often be used ; it is too stiff and formal, 
 like the military figure, and presents the body with too 
 much uniformity and flatness.* 
 
 * This appears to be the position condemned by Qumtilian : 
 " The swing of those who balance their body to the right side and 
 left, upon the alternate feet, is very ungraceful."

 Connected with these positions which express the 
 moderate state of the feet, are marked the same posi- 
 tions in the extended state. (Fig. 20.) These differ 
 from the moderate, principally, in the greater separa- 
 tion of the feet. The second position extended, en- 
 larges the angle a few degrees by drawing up the heel 
 of the retired foot. (See Fig. 46 and 89.) The first 
 extended position is made when a person retires in any 
 degree of alarm; and the second, when he advances 
 with boldness. (See Fig. 106 and 108.) An x is added 
 to the notation to express the extended position, thus ; 
 R. 1. x; R. 2. x; &c. 
 
 The contracted position may be easily understood by 
 supposing the heels to be brought close together. A c 
 is added to the notation, to express the contracted 
 position, thus: R. 1. c. 
 
 The attitude of the orator should not be like that of 
 the affected dancing-master, which is adapted to spring- 
 ing agility and conceited display. The orator should 
 adopt such attitudes and positions only as consist with 
 manly simplicity and grace. The toes should be turned, 
 not inwards, like those of the awkward rustic, but 
 moderately outwards ; and the limbs should be so dis- 
 posed as to support the body with ease, and to change 
 with facility. The sustaining foot should be planted 
 firmly; the leg braced, but not contracted; and the 
 knee straightened (contraction suits the spring neces- 
 sary for the dancer, and bent knees belong to feeble- 
 ness, or timidity) ; the other foot and limb should press 
 lightly, and be held relaxed, so as to be ready for im- 
 mediate change and action, except in very energetic 
 delivery, where both limbs should be braced. The 
 trunk of the body should be well balanced, and sus- 
 tained erect upon the supporting limb, except in such 
 instances as particularly require its inclination, as 
 veneration, supplication, &c. The orator should face 
 his audience. Whatever his position may be, he should 
 present himself, as Quintilian expresses, cequo pectore 
 (Fig. 13), and never in the fencer's attitude. 
 


## p. 82 (#92) ##############################################

82 ELOCUTION. 
 
 In changing the positions of the feet, the motions 
 should be made with the utmost simplicity, and free 
 from the parade and SAveep of dancing. All changes, 
 except where particular energy requires the speaker to 
 stamp, start back, or advance with marked decision, 
 should be made almost imperceptibly. The changes 
 should not be too frequent : frequent change gives the 
 idea of anxiety and instability, which are unfavourable 
 to an orator. 
 
 The several acts resulting from the changes in the 
 positions of the feet, are, advancing (noted a) ; re- 
 tiring (r) ; traversing (tr.) ; starting (s. or st.) ; stamp- 
 ing {sp.),&LC. 
 
 If more steps than one are to be expressed (as in the 
 business of the theatre) the number may be introduced 
 in a parenthesis, after the letter marking the step, and 
 then the position follows which finishes the movement ; 
 thus, a (2) R. 2, means, advance two steps to the se- 
 cond position of the right foot. In private declama- 
 tions, or recitations on a platform, or rostrum, these 
 figures are not necessary, as a single step, in advancing 
 or retiring, is sufficient.* 
 
 Changes of position, or steps, are considered to be 
 made only by the foot on which the body is not sup- 
 ported, for that alone is free. Should it be required to 
 move the foot which supports the body (suppose the 
 left, in the first position of the right, Fig. 15), two mo- 
 
 * I have frequently seen college students take three steps to the 
 right, then three to the left, then three again to the right, and so 
 on, till they had changed their position fifteen times during the de- 
 livery of a discourse which did not occupy them more than ten 
 minutes. And I have known a clergyman to traverse the whole 
 length of his pulpit twenty-three times during the delivery of a ser- 
 mon. Such erratic movements in a public speaker are undigni- 
 fied : they betray a want of judgment, and are exceedingly annoy- 
 ing to an audience. An orator should "keep in his place:" he 
 should perform all the movements of his feet within the limits of 
 thirty-six inches square, and not be continually running about the 
 room ad if labouring under the effects of nitrous oxide.

 tions are necessary ; in the first the position must be 
 changed to R. 2. (Fig. 16), so as to throw the weight 
 of the body on the right foot, then the left may be 
 moved as required. 
 
 According to this principle, it will be found that 
 from each original &.&.% 
 
 position four steps 
 may be made. (See 
 Fig. 21 and 22.) 
 The plan of the 
 steps, in the origi- 
 nal position, is in 
 the centre, and 
 drawn larger ; the 
 plan of the steps, 
 made from that ori- 
 ginal position, is re- 
 presented smaller. 
 The line of motions 
 of the feet, is repre- 21 
 
 sented by a line of dots, nearly of the same form which 
 each foot should trace ; the line of the free, or first- 
 moving foot, is marked with a star. In the figures, it 
 will be observed, that from each position four steps 
 may be made — the speaker may advance, retire, tra- 
 verse, and cross. In 
 advancing and tra- 
 versing, each step 
 finishes on the second 
 position of the ad- 
 vancing foot ; and, 
 in retiring from the 
 first position, the step 
 finishes on the first 
 position of the con- 
 trary foot; but, in 
 retiring from the se- 
 cond position, it fin-

 position of the same foot. In crossing from the first 
 position, the free foot passes before the other, and 
 finishes on the second position ; but, in crossing from 
 ♦he second position, it passes behind the planted foot, 
 and finishes on the first position. 
 
 The steps from the two positions of the left foot are 
 similar to those of the right, and do not require to be 
 explained by another figure. 
 
 CHAPTER IV. 
 
 THE POSITIONS, MOTIONS, AND ELEVATIONS OF THE ARMS. 
 
 Fig. 23 represents a person standing with his arms 
 hanging unconstrained. Now, if from this position the 
 arm be raised as high as it can be, as in Fig. 24, the 
 extremity of the fingers will describe, in the vertical 
 direction, a semicircle, which, in the figure, is marked 
 
 at five points, 
 R, d, h, e, Z, at 
 intervals of for- 
 ty-five degrees. 
 If, in the trans- 
 verse direction, 
 the arm be ex- 
 tended across 
 the body, as far 
 as convenience 
 will permit, and 
 then swept hori- 
 zontally round, 
 and outwards, 
 the extremityof 
 the fingers will 
 describe a semi- 
 circle, which, in 
 Fig. 25, is also 
 marked at five points, c,/, q, x, b, at intervals of forty-

 circles b e qfc e b, and bdcfqdb, parallel to it, 
 above and below, at the distance of forty-five degrees. 
 The human figure is so placed within this sphere, that 
 the internal central point between the shoulders, is the 
 centre of the sphere. The postures and motions of the 
 arms are referred to, and determined by, the points at 
 which, the circles intersect each other.* The circle 
 marked q, for the right arm, becomes c for the left, and 
 the contrary. According to this scheme, the postures 
 of the arms are determined, and noted as follows : 
 
 First, in the Vertical Direction. 
 
 When the arm hangs down, at rest, Fig. 23, it 
 is noted R. 
 
 When directed downwards, within forty-five 
 degrees of the nadir, Fig. 27 to 31, it is noted - d. 
 
 When directed towards the horizon, Fig. 32 to 36 h. 
 
 When elevated forty-five degrees above the ho- 
 rizon, Fig. 37 to 41 e. 
 
 When pointing to the zenith, Fig. 24 - - - - Z. 
 
 .Second, in the Transverse Direction. 
 
 When the arm is extended as far as convenient, 
 across the body, say forty-five degrees from the 
 right circle, Z/R, Fig. 27, 32, 37, it is noted - c. 
 
 When extended in the plane of the right circle, 
 or directly forward, Fig. 28, 33, 38 /. 
 
 When directed forty-five degrees obliquely from 
 this position, Fig. 29, 34, 39 q. 
 
 When in the plane of the primary circle, Fig. 
 30, 35, 40 x. 
 
 * In speaking of angles and elevations, determined by degrees, 
 mathematical precision is not intended, and is not necessary : it is 
 sufficient for the present purpose that the position described should 
 be nearly in the angle or direction mentioned.

 From the combination of the three vertical and five 
 transverse positions (Fig. 24 and 25), exclusive of the 
 positions R and Z, fifteen primary positions of the arms 
 are formed. In the illustration of these primary posi- 
 tions of the arms, all the figures in the upper line (Fig. 
 27 to 31), direct the arm downwards, but to different 
 points in the transverse circle ; all the figures in the 
 second line (Fig. 32 to 36), direct the arm towards the 
 horizon ; and all those in the third (37 to 41), elevate it 
 towards the upper transverse circle. If they are taken 
 in the vertical direction, those in the first column (27 
 32, 37), point across; those in the second (28, 33, 38), 
 forwards ; those in the third (29, 34, 39), oblique ; those 
 in the fourth (30, 35, 40), extended ; those in the fifth 
 (31, 36, 41), backwards.

 These are 
 the simple 
 primary pos- 
 tures of the 
 whole arm, 
 which, with 
 the latitude

 be found suf-

 of the ordi-

 to give the

 name of that 
 point.

 quial eleva-

 less bold than the primary postures. The fore arm, in 
 the horizontal elevation, instead of being raised to the 
 
 lamer 
 
 height of the shoulder, points 
 about as high as the middle 
 of the breast; the hand, in 
 the elevated position, is not 
 raised above the eyes ; and 
 in the position downwards, 
 it is held but little below the 
 waist. 
 
 In delineating the primary 
 postures, the boldest and most 
 decided action has been cho- 
 sen, which is suited to the 
 epic style; because, in this 
 style, the different postures 
 gjgr are the most strongly discri- 
 minated. The colloquial 
 elevations are similar, but 
 In them the distinctive character is, that the

 arm, at the elbow, is bent, and the upper arm held 
 closer to the side. 
 
 The degree of energy proceeding from the sentiment 
 of desire, or aversion, with which a passage is delivered, 
 influences much the character of the gesture, in the 
 same manner that it does the tones and expressions of 
 the voice ; the language still remaining unaltered. It 
 the passage to be delivered may properly be illustrated 
 by the arm in the posture horizontal extended (hx), the 
 degree of that extension should vary with the spirit of 
 
 the passage. If an object is 
 simply pointed to in the hori-* — 
 zon, the arm should be mode- 
 rately extended (Fig. 45), and 
 slightly bent at the shoulder, 
 the elbow, and the wrist. If 
 the object is highly interesting, 
 and supposed to be in the same 
 situation as if a general pointed 
 to those troops which he re- 
 quired to be instantly sustained, 
 the arm should be extended to 
 the utmost, the wrist thrown 
 up, and the fingers down, whilst 
 the whole body should be projected forwards

 46.) The arm, in this posture, as in the last, is col- 
 sidered still to be horizontal extended, but in the ex~ 
 treme degree, and is marked with an additional x (hxx). 
 If the object in the same situation as before be sup- 
 posed something producing disappointment, or horror 
 the arm should be contracted, and the whole person 
 should recoil. (Fig. 47.) And this also is considered 
 horizontal extended ; horizontal, because the hand is 
 directed towards the horizon ; and extended, because 
 the arm continues in the same plane as in the former 
 instances. But the character of this gesture differs; 
 and, in order to express it by the notation letters, a c 
 is added, thus, hxc. This notation is read, horizontal 
 extended contracted. 
 
 There are other postures of the arm, w T hich require 
 u separate consideration. These postures are named 
 from the manner of holding the arm, or resting it upon 
 the body. They admit of considerable variety; but 
 the description of the following, will suffice to explain 
 the class to which they are to be referred.

 CHAPTER V. 
 
 POSTURES AND MOTIONS OF THE HANDS. 
 
 The Roman critics and orators attributed consider- 
 able importance to the manner of disposing the fingers, 
 in delivery, ascribing to each particular disposition of 
 them, a significancy, or suitableness for certain expres- 
 sions, of which we do not always see the force. Seve- 
 ral of these dispositions of the fingers are employed by 
 our speakers, but without attaching to them any par- 
 ticular significancy. Either they are natural gestures, 
 or they are imitations, of which the origin is not re- 
 membered, or regarded, as many of our apparently 
 original actions are. 
 
 The postures of the hand are determined by four 
 different circumstances : 
 
 1. By the disposition of the fingers. 
 
 2. By the manner of presenting the palm. 
 
 3. By the combined disposition of both hands. 
 
 4. By the part of the body on which they are occa- 
 sionally placed. 
 
 First Class of the Postures of the Hands, depending on 
 the Disposition of the Fingers. 
 
 The natural state, noted n., Fig. 51. The hand, 
 when unconstrained, in its natural, and relaxed state, 
 either hanging down at rest, or raised moderately up 
 has all the fingers a little bent inwards towards the

 palm ; the middle and third finger lightly touch ; the 
 fore-finger is separated from the middle finger, and less 
 bent, and the little finger separated from the third, and 
 more bent. The extremity of the thumb bends a little 
 outwards; and, in its general length and disposition, is 
 nearly parallel with the fore-finger. When the arm is 
 raised horizontal, the hand is held obliquely between 
 the postures inward and supine. Cresoilius recom- 
 mends the public speaker to adopt this posture of the 
 hand, and for this preference he adduces the authority 
 of Hippocrates and Galen. But it is not necessary that 
 a speaker should confine himself to any one posture of 
 the hand ; variety may often demand the contrary : if 
 however, he should prefer using only 
 one, this posture merits the preference. 
 
 Clinched, c, Fig. 52. The fingers, in this disposition, 
 are firmly closed, and press their extremities upon the 
 palm ; the thumb aids the pressure, and is lapped, par- 
 ticularly, over the middle finger. 
 
 Extended, xf* Fig. 53. The fingers, in this state, 
 whatever may be the general position of the hand, are 
 separated from each other with energy in proportion to 
 the excitation of the speaker. 
 
 Index, i, Fig. 54, 55, 56. Pointing w T ith the fore- 
 finger, and sometimes also with the middle finger ex-

 * The letter chosen for the notation of a particular gesture, is 
 not always the initial letter, because the names of many of the ges- 
 tures begin with the same letter. It becomes necessary, therefore, 
 to employ some remarkable letter in the word ; thus, x is used for 
 extended, and I for collected, which may be easily remembered. 
 Of the many names of gestures which begin with the same letter, 
 the gesture most used is marked by the initial letter.

 The Motions of the Arms and Hands, 
 
 In ascertaining the import of any posture of eitner 
 arm, or hand, it is important to consider the posture in 
 connexion with the action by which it is produced ;

 for any posture of the arm, or hand, may sustain differ- 
 ent significant characters, because different actions give 
 the same posture an entirely different import. This 
 must be obvious to all who reflect that the effect of the 
 posture greatly depends upon the exact character of 
 the motion, which is produced partly by the direction 
 which the motion takes, partly by the force with which 
 it is commenced, and partly by the distance through 
 which it passes. 
 
 The motions of the hands and arms together, are, 
 therefore, considered ; first, as to their direction ; and, 
 secondly, as to their manner of moving. The energy 
 is not here taken into account. These motions are 
 noted by the fourth and fifth small letters, should so 
 many be necessary. 
 
 In the direction of the motion (Fig. 85), gestures are 
 considered as ascending, noted a ; descending, d; to 
 the right, r; to the left,/; forwards,/; backwards, 
 b ; revolving.* v. The stars, connected with the hand 
 by dots, show the various points from which the mo 
 tion of the gestures has commenced.

 of some of the most useful in this class ; others may be

 CHAPTER VI. 
 
 THE HEAD, THE EYES, THE SHOULDERS, AND THE BODY. 
 
 As the head gives the chief grace to the person, so 
 does it principally contribute to the expression of grace, 
 in delivery. 
 
 The head should be held in an erect and natural 
 posture ; for, when hung down, it expresses humility, 
 or diffidence ; when thrown back, arrogance ; and when 
 inclined to one side, languor or indifference. The 
 movements of the head should be suited to the charac- 
 ter of the delivery ; they should accord with the ges- 
 ture, and fall in with the action of the hands, and the 
 motions of the body. 
 
 The head is capable of many appropriate expres- 
 sions. Besides those nods which signify assent, or ap- 
 probation and rejection, there are motions of the head, 
 known, and common to all, which express modesty, 
 doubt, admiration and indignation. But to use the 
 gesture of the head alone, unaccompanied by any other 
 gesture, is considered faulty. It is also a fault to shake 
 or nod the head frequently, to toss it violently, or to 
 agitate the hair, by rolling it about. 
 
 The most usual motions and postures of the head, 
 are as follows. In the notation, the head and eyes 
 may, without confusion, be considered together.

 The motions of the trunk contribute much to the 
 effect in delivery. The gestures of the arms and hands, 
 therefore, should always be supported by the accom- 
 paniment of the body. Not by affected and ridiculous 
 contortions, but by the manly and free exertions of the 
 muscles of the body, the general consent of which is 
 indispensable to the production of graceful motion. 
 The raising up, or shrugging of the shoulders, in ordei 
 to express indifference, or contempt, is merely theatri- 
 cal, and should be sparingly used, even on the stage. 
 
 The postures of the trunk might also be enumerated, 
 and be subjected to the rules of notation ; but this would 
 be unnecessary, as they are in general sufficiently un- 
 derstood, being the accompaniment of the motions of 
 the head, the arms and the hands. 
 
 CHAPTER VII. 
 
 THE STROKE AND TIME OF GESTURE. 
 
 The arm, the fore-arm, the hand, and the fingers, 
 form the grand instrument of gesture, or, as Cicero 
 calls it, " the weapon of the orator." The centre of 
 motion of this compound instrument, is the shoulder. 
 These parts do not move together in the manner of an 
 inflexible line ; but each separate joint often becomes 
 a new centre of motion for the portion between it and 
 the extremity. 
 
 In gesticulating, this complex instrument does not 
 continue long in one direct line, nor in any particulai

 flexure, but changes every moment the angles formed 
 at the different joints, which adds grace and variety to 
 the motions. The farther any portion of this complex 
 line is from the centre of motion, the greater space does 
 it pass through. The least motion, therefore, is that 
 made by the upper arm, and the greatest, that made 
 by the hand : from this circumstance alone, the ges- 
 tures of the latter are conspicuous. In gesticulating, 
 the hand has not only the advantage of being placed at 
 the extremity of the line farthest from the centre of 
 motion ; but, by means of the joint at the wrist, it can 
 spring with increased velocity on approaching the point 
 to which its gesture is directed. This action of the 
 hand is termed the stroke of the gesture ; and it should 
 be marked by different degrees of force, according to 
 the energy of the sentiment. In high passion, it should 
 be distinguished by a strong percussion; and in the 
 more moderate state of the speaker's feelings, merely 
 by a turn of the hand, by a change of posture, or ele- 
 vation of the arm, or by a momentary arrest of the 
 motion of the gesture in its transitions. 
 
 The stroke of the gesture is analogous to the empha- 
 sis of the voice ; and they should both fall exactly on 
 the accented syllable of the emphatic word. In this 
 way the emphatic force of the voice, and the stroke of 
 the gesture, co-operate in presenting the idea in the 
 most lively manner, to the eye as well as to the ear. 
 
 There are other points of analogy between the voice 
 and gesture, which deserve consideration. In the sim- 
 ple and narrative parts of a discourse, there is little 
 effort or variety of expression, in the voice. Under 
 the same circumstances, the gesture, if any is used, 
 should be tame and simple ; but, in the more impas- 
 sioned parts, both should be equally exerted. The 
 gesture, also, in many instances, nearly imitates the 
 manner of the inflections of the voice. When the voice 
 rises, the gesture naturally ascends; and .when the 
 voice makes the falling inflection, or lowers its pitch,

 the gesture follows it by a corresponding descent ; and, 
 in the level and monotonous pronunciation of the voice, 
 the gesture seems to observe a similar limitation, by 
 moving rather in the horizontal direction, without much 
 varying its elevation. 
 
 Some writers say, that, " in calm discourse, the 
 words and the gestures should generally accompany 
 each other; but, in impassioned discourse, the feelings 
 of the speaker should first be manifested in the eyes ; 
 then, by the countenance ; next, by the gesture ; and, 
 lastly, by the words." This is not just. In all dis- 
 course, whether calm or impassioned, the words and 
 the gestures should accompany each other. As, in 
 beating time in music, the beat is made on the accented 
 part of the measure, so in speaking, the stroke of the 
 gesture should fall on the accented syllable of the em- 
 phatic word. The emotion which calls forth the word, 
 at the same moment, prompts the gesture. Hence, the 
 muscles of gesticulation should move synchronously 
 and harmoniously with those of the voice. When ges- 
 ture is not marked by the precision of the stroke, in 
 the proper places, it is very offensive. The arms, like 
 those of a person groping in the dark, seem to wander 
 about in quest of some uncertain object ; and the ac- 
 tion is of that faulty kind which is called sawing the 
 air. Even graceful motions, unmarked by the pre- 
 cision of the stroke of the gesture, as sometimes seen, 
 particularly among singers on the stage, lose much of 
 their force, and very soon cease to afford pleasure. 
 All the unmeaning motions of public speakers are at- 
 tended with the same ill effect as a mouthing and cant- 
 ting tone of declamation, which lays no emphasis with 
 just discrimination, but swells and falls with a vain 
 affectation of feeling, and with absolute deficiency both 
 m taste and judgment.

 CHAPTER VIII. 
 
 THE CLASSIFICATION OF GESTURE. 
 
 The arms, as well as the hands, may be employed, 
 in gesticulation, separately, or together, each using 
 similar, or dissimilar actions. Each arm may perforin 
 
 stg* similar gestures when 
 Mar the body of the speaker 
 is presented towards 
 the person addressed 
 precisely in front (Fig. 
 92); but when the 
 body is not so pre- 
 sented, the gestures 
 will not be similar 
 (Fig. 93) ; and, as such 
 posture and gestures 
 are not graceful, they 
 are not frequently 
 used. 
 
 The advancement of one hand before the other is 
 an indication of precedence, as is, also, in general, its 
 higher elevation. The advanced hand, therefore, is 
 said to perform the principal gesture. In general, trgj 
 elevation of the retired arm is a whole position lower 
 than that of the advanced arm ; and, though the ges- 
 ture of the retired hand occasionally resembles that of 
 the advanced hand, yet its action is performed with 
 less energy and authority. For these reasons, the ac- 
 tion of the retired hand is called the subordinate ges- 
 ture. 
 
 There is aclass of gestures called significant gestures :* 
 
 * As this word has long been applied to a certain class of ges- 
 tures, and as there is some difficulty in procuring a better, I have 
 followed my predecessors in its use. The objection to the word is 
 obvious — it conveys the idea that all the gestures which do not

GESTURE. 109 
 
 the extending of the index-finger towards persons, or 
 things, points them out ; the laying of the hand on the 
 breast refers to the feelings of the speaker; the placing 
 of the finger on the lips signifies an injunction of si- 
 lence. &c. 
 
 But gestures, in general, are too vague to be com- 
 prehended under this description : they denote a sort 
 of general relation in the expressions — their power to 
 do this is derived from the time and manner of their 
 application, from the place in which they are used, and 
 from their various combinations. Some are used at 
 the beginning of a sentence, merely to indicate a com- 
 mencement in action, as well as speech; some are used 
 for description ; some, for explaining, extending, or 
 limiting; and some, for enforcing the predominant idea; 
 some, for keeping the audience in suspense, till the 
 more decisive gestures ; and some, for marking the ter- 
 mination of the sense, and the final result of the reason- 
 ing. These various gestures may be divided into five 
 classes : 
 
 1. Commencing gestures. 4. Suspending gestures. 
 
 2. Discriminating gestures. 5. Emphatic gestures. 
 .3. x\uxiliary gestures. 
 
 1. Commencing gestures are made simply by raising 
 the hand from rest; and that, in general, not higher 
 than the horizontal position. They are used at the 
 beginning, and at the divisions of a discourse. 
 
 2. Discriminating gestures comprehend all those ges- 
 tures which serve to indicate persons and objects, as 
 well as those which are used for explaining, extending, 
 limiting, or modifying the predominant idea, and those 
 which are employed in question and answer, when 
 made without vehemence. They are performed in the 
 intermediate degrees of the range of the gesture, with 
 
 fall into the class of which this is the distinctive name, are insigni* 
 Jicant, or unmeaning; a conclusion by no means correct.

 model ate force, and at small intervals. In colloquial 
 intercourse they are frequently confined to the motions 
 of the head. 
 
 3. Auxiliary, or alternate gestures, serve to aid, or 
 enforce the gesture of the advanced hand. They are 
 performed as follows : after the advanced hand has 
 made its gesture on the emphatic word, instead of pass- 
 ing to another gesture, on the next emphatic word, it 
 remains in the attitude of the last stroke till the retired 
 hand is brought up in aid of it, either by a similar ges- 
 ture, or by a more decisive one. In this way, variety 
 and extraordinary energy are given, at once, to pas- 
 sages which admit of such gestures. Of course, these 
 gestures are used with great advantage in high passion; 
 they are also frequently employed in description, where 
 they are executed more tamely. 
 
 4. Suspending, or preparatory gestures, are so called 
 because they hold the audience in suspense, by the 
 elevation or contraction of the arm, preparatory to the 
 stroke which is to fall on the emphatic word. 
 
 5. Emphatic gestures mark, with force, words op- 
 posed to, or compared with, each other; and, more par- 
 ticularly, the word which expresses the predominant 
 idea. Their stroke is generally arrested on the hori- 
 zontal elevation. Sometimes, however, emphatic ges- 
 tures are directed to the highest point in their range ; 
 at other times, to the lowest. When they are directed 
 to a high point, they often serve as suspending, or pre 
 paratory gestures, to the next emphatic gesture ; and, 
 when made at the close of a sentence, they serve a; 
 terminating gestures ; because, when the last important 
 idea is marked, no other gesture should be added, to 
 weaken its effect ; the arm should then fall to rest. 
 
 As a sentence is an epitome of a complete composi- 
 tion, having a beginning, a middle, and a conclusion, 
 among single sentences illustrations of these different 
 gestures may be found. In the following sentence the 
 gestures for the righrhand, only? are noted.

 ELOCUTION. 
 
 The five classes of gestures, above described, may 
 be used in any part of an oration. They are, as it were, 
 the elements of gesture, which, by their combinations, 
 produce its whole power of language and expression. 
 These elements are the component parts of every style 
 of delivery, whether tame or vehement, argumentative 
 or diffuse, ardent or indifferent, cold or pathetic. 
 
 It has been observed that the principal gesture is performed by 
 the advanced hand, and the subordinate gesture by the retired hand. 
 The best modern speakers use either the right, or the left hand, in- 
 discriminately, for the principal gesture, as occasion may require. 
 As this practice is altogether at variance with the opinions and 
 rules of the ancient critics and rhetoricians, it may be proper to in- 
 quire how far we are justifiable in our departure from their great 
 authority. 
 
 "The left hand," says Quintilian, "can never, with propriety, 
 perform gesture alone ; but it frequently acts in support of the right 
 hand." The consideration of the dress of the 
 ancients, which differed so essentially from that 
 of the moderns, may be sufficient to account for 
 the difference between their customs and ours. 
 The form of the ancient dress obliged the speaker, 
 if not totally to disuse his left hand, at least to 
 restrain its action very considerably. (See Fig. 
 94.) The occasions on which the left hand may 
 perform the principal gesture, are the following : 
 1. When the persons addressed are on the left 
 side, the left hand naturally performs the prin- 
 cipal gesture, in order to avoid the awkward- 
 ness of gesticulating across the body. 2. The 
 necessary discrimination of objects opposed to 
 erch other, requires the left hand alternately to 
 perform the principal gesture. 3. The advan- 
 tage of variety. 4. The power of giving, not 
 only. variety, but force, by occasionally elevating the retired hand, 
 and bestowing upon it all the spirit and authority of the gesture. 
 
 But it is not only in the use of the left hand that modern speakers 
 differ from the ancients: they constantly violate another precept 
 enjoined by Quintilian and his followers, viz., that of speaking with 
 
 .ique position ; x, extended position ; veq, hands vertical, arms 
 elevated oblique; a, ascending; br, breast — the right hand is laid 
 on the breast; Bnef, both hands natural, the arms elevated for 
 wards; Bshf sh, both hands supine, arms horizontal forwards shak- 
 ing; R, rest, the hands fall to rest.

 the corresponding- hand and foot advanced.* And yet, if the natural 
 emotions afford any just foundation for the manner of gesture, we 
 shall be inclined to give the preference to modern custom. Those 
 passions which incline us to advance towards their object, as love, 
 desire, anger, and revenge, naturally cause the corresponding hand 
 and foot to advance together with the head and body ; for, in this 
 way, the nearest approach is made to the object. And when pas- 
 sions of a contrary nature, as aversion and terror, affect us, still the 
 corresponding hand and foot are advanced; as if the better to guard 
 the body and head, which are thrown back. In such cases, it would 
 produce unnatural distortion to advance the contrary hand and foot. 
 Under tranquil circumstances, as when the speaker delivers narra- 
 tive, or reasons calmly, the contrary hand and footf may advance 
 together with grace and propriety. Indeed, perhaps such posture 
 is preferable, as it p^sents the body more exactly in front towards 
 the persons addressed. It was, probably, such circumstances alone, 
 which Quintilian had in view when he pronounced his opinion, that 
 it is unbecoming to stand with the corresponding hand and foot ad- 
 vanced. This explanation will serve to reconcile the apparent 
 deviation of the moderns from the ancient practice. 
 
 CHAPTER IX. 
 
 THE PREPARATION, TRANSITION, AND ACCOMPANIMENT OP 
 GESTURE. 
 
 In the transitions of gesture, the hand and arm should 
 not, in general, be precipitated to the intended position 
 by the shortest course ; but, in the calmer parts of the 
 oration, they should move in a sort of waving line, or 
 in one returning upon itself, somewhat in the manner 
 represented by the following diagram : 
 
 Diag. 18. 
 
 Let f represent tho position of the arm and hand for 
 wards, and let the place of the next gesture be q (ob*

 Jique), and of a third be x (extended). The hand should 
 not move in the line of dots directly from/ to q, and 
 from q to x ; bat from / go back almost to c (across), 
 in order that it may traverse the greater space; and 
 then proceed to q with an accelerated motion for the 
 stroke of the gesture. In the same manner, and for the 
 same purpose, it should return back almost tof, before 
 t proceeds to x. 
 The ascending and descending gestures are performed 
 
 Diag. 19. 
 
 in the same manner, under simi 
 lar circumstances, as may be 
 seen in diagram 19, in which Z 
 is the zenith, and R the point of 
 rest, and where the hand, in 
 ascending and descending, is re- 
 presented as making returning 
 inflections at the principal points, 
 d, h, and e. 
 
 The line of preparation as- 
 sumes a variety of other curves, 
 fourteen of which are repre- 
 sented by Diagram 20. 
 
 Whatever form this indirect 
 line may be, it is used as a pre- 
 paration for the gesture to which 
 it leads; and the extent of the 
 return, or depth of the sweep or 
 -^Z^^ indentation, is determined by 
 
 the character of the sentiments to be delivered. The 
 more magnificent they are, the greater is this parade ; 
 and the nearer to ordinary discourse, the less it is. 
 The preparation made by these different curves does 
 not suit every species of gesture ; it is adapted almost 
 solely to that kind which is termed discriminating 
 Another kind of preparation is made for emphatic ges- 
 tures. They are generally preceded by a suspending 
 gesture, which serves the double purpose of marking 
 some less important word, and of preparing for the

 Another example of a previous contracted gesture: 
 
 Bvhfrt 
 
 To hear the roar she sends through ail her gates. — Cowp. 
 
 Tn the passage from Cowper, the suspending, or previous gesture, 
 Bvhfrj, contains all the letters belonging to the subsequent em- 
 phatic gesture, except the last (p). This new letter, only, is ex- 
 pressed, and is joined by a long dash, or mark of connexion, with 
 the notation letters of the preceding gesture : another line of con- 
 nexion, joining this letter to x, signifies that both hands continuing 
 in the same position, viz. vertical, the arms are to be extended. The 
 gestures, marked at large on this line, would be as follows: 
 
 Bvlif rt Bvhff ■ Bvhx 
 
 To hear the roar she sends through all her gates.j" 
 
 But the former method is preferable, as it abridges the trouble ol 
 notation, and is equally intelligible. 
 
 The connexion of gesture is, therefore, the relation 
 which one gesture bears to another ; and it is shown 
 by the notation of the circumstances in which they 
 agree, and of those in which they differ. Thus, the 
 gestures noted in the foregoing line agree, first, in 
 being common to both hands (B), and then in the posi- 
 tion of each hand, v {vertical), and also in the elevation 
 of both arms, h (horizontal). So that it is unnecessary 
 to repeat those circumstances in which they agree, as 
 the connecting-dash expresses them with sufficient 
 clearness, and with greater brevity. 
 
 The connexion of gesture in the vertical direction, 
 when the hand, without altering its posture, merely 
 ascends by short intervals, in order to mark a succes- 
 sion of discriminating gestures, is noted by the usual 
 connecting-dash, and an a over the word where the 
 hand ascends.

 The transition of gesture relates to the manner of 
 arriving at a gesture, and to the changes of gesture ; 
 and signifies either the particular changes of the posi- 
 tion of the hand and arm, or the general change of the 
 principal gesture from one hand to the other. 
 
 A gesture may have a very different character and 
 effect, according to the manner in which the hand ar- 
 rives at its destined point. It may ascend, descend, 
 move towards the right, or towards the left, and may 
 also make the stroke with various degrees of energy, 
 and in various ways ; and these motions constitute, in 
 each, an absolutely different gesture, though, after the 
 moment of the stroke, which a painter might choose to 
 represent, the hand and arm of each should be in the 
 same precise position. (Fig. 85, p. 100.) As, however, 
 the emphatic gestures are liable to ambiguity, on ac- 
 count of the various transitions which might be sup- 
 posed to bring them to their stroke, painters more fre- 
 quently choose to represent the suspending gestures, 
 which give an idea of action, and greater interest to 
 their principal figures. 
 
 But the transition of gesture particularly relates to 
 the change of the principal gesture from one hand to 
 
 * Bphfa, both hands prone horizontal forwards ascending 1 , 
 vef (followed by a dash), right hand vertical elevated forwards ; 
 vef (preceded by a dash), left hand vertical elevated forwards;

 both hands supine horizontal forwards striking.

 the other , which may be regulated, in some measure, 
 according to the following principles. So long as there 
 subsists a strict connexion between the sentiments, un- 
 interrupted by any considerable pause, or change of 
 persons, no transition can take place in this last sense : 
 the same hand which began, continues to perform the 
 principal gesture. And the variety which it is always 
 desirable to produce, must not be attempted by the 
 change of the principal gesture : it must arise alone 
 from the graceful and well-regulated action of the ad- 
 vanced hand, supported by the combined assistance or 
 accompaniment of the other. If the passage to be pro- 
 nounced be of considerable length, the right hand should 
 perform the principal gesture throughout the whole of 
 it. For the left, though allowed to take its place oc- 
 casionally, according to certain rules, by no means 
 arrives at an equality of honour. The right hand 
 always continues the better hand, both from long pre- 
 scription, and the ability arising from use. 
 
 In the narrative parts of an oration, where different 
 persons or things are to be described as variously dis- 
 posed, or in the recitation of descriptive poetry, when 
 a picture, as it were, is to be represented by the speaker, 
 consisting of many natural objects in different parts of 
 a landscape, of which Gray's Elegy in a Country 
 Church-yard will afford many examples, the right hand 
 having first pointed out those persons or objects sup- 
 posed to lie adjacent to itself, may yield to the left the 
 arrangement and ordering of those other parts, which 
 may be imagined to be at its own side. This inter- 
 change, judiciously regulated, produces a pleasing va- 
 riety in the gesture ; and if the speaker possess the 
 imagination of a painter, his disposition and colouring 
 will produce the most distinct and vivid picture. 
 
 Variety, which is a most important object to be kept 
 in view by a public speaker, allows, with advantage, 
 an interchange of the principal gesture, even when the 
 subject may be of a more abstruse and demonstrative

GESTURE. 119 
 
 nature. When there is any opposition, or antithesis, 
 among the ideas, or even in the structure of sentences, 
 or where a new argument is introduced, after the dis- 
 cussion of a former is ended, as at. a new division, or a 
 new paragraph, there may be a change of the principal 
 gesture. But it will be a point of judgment and taste 
 in the speaker not to carry this balancing, or alterna- 
 tion of gesture, to an affected extreme, and not, even in 
 allowable cases, to indulge in it overmuch ; nor will he 
 prolong too far the principal action permitted to the 
 left hand, which he will always remember is the weaker, 
 and admitted into the foremost place rather by courtesy 
 than of right ; and which he will, therefore, restrict 
 with discretion in the exercise of this occasional dis- 
 tinction. 
 
 In the changes made from one hand to the other, the 
 transition should be managed with ease and simplicity. 
 As soon as the advanced hand has made the stroke of 
 its last, emphatic gesture, it should fall quietly to rest, 
 whilst, at the same time, the hand w r hich is, in its turn, 
 to assume the principal action, commences its prepara- 
 tion for the ensuing gesture. It will be observed that 
 a commencing, or discriminating gesture, should be 
 gentle, as a modest beginning suits its first entrance 
 into authority. An emphatic gesture immediately after 
 one from the other hand, would be violent and out- 
 rageous ; something like the gesticulations of those 
 little wooden figures set up to frighten birds from corn, 
 or fruit, which have the arms fixed on an axis in such 
 a manner that they are alternately raised and depressed 
 with equal vehemence, according as they are blown 
 about by the wind. 
 
 When the orator finds it necessary to change the 
 position of the feet, so as to advance that which was 
 before retired, the general rule is that he should effect 
 it imperceptibly, and not commence the change till 
 after the hand has begun its change of action. Some 
 times, however, in vehement passages, the oratoi is

 allowed, by the highest authority, to advance suddenly 
 and even to stamp. 
 
 The subordinate gesture, already mentioned, as performed by the 
 retired hand, will be found to bear a ciose analogy to accompani- 
 ment in music. A little observation will suffice for acquiring a 
 general knowledge of the accompaniment of gesture ; and after 
 attentively practising ibr some time, the inferior hand will as easily 
 fall into a suitable accompaniment of the principal gesture, as the 
 left hand of a performer on a keyed instrument, will strike correctly 
 the fundamental bass. 
 
 The general rule for accompaniment of gesture, in 
 calm and moderate speaking, when both hands do not 
 perform the same gesture, is that the retired arm should 
 be about one interval less raised than the advanced 
 arm, and that in the transverse position it should be 
 distant from it about two intervals, or a right angle. 
 Hence, if the right hand should perform the principal 
 gesture, and this gesture should be supine elevated for- 
 wards, the accompaniment would be expressed in the 
 
 second set of letters, for the left hand, thus : -J-. , 
 
 prm. ac. 
 
 (Fig. 38) ; and again, vh f~~~ P dx , (Fig. 33). When the 
 prin. ac. 
 
 force of the expression is strong, the accompanying 
 hand is equally elevated with the principal. In this 
 degree of force, the gestures are thus : vhf — vhx. 
 These circumstances afford convenient opportunities 
 for abridging the notation. When both hands perform 
 the same, or nearly the same gesture, a capital B pre- 
 ceding one set of letters suffices for both hands, as Bvhf 
 And when the accompanying gesture follows the gene- 
 ral rule, and has nothing remarkable distinguishing it, 
 the gesture of the principal hand only need be noted ; 
 the accompaniment is easily understood, and will fol- 
 low of course to the well-practised speaker. 
 
 But besides the motions of the subordinate gesture, 
 other very important accompaniments are to be at- 
 tended to; as those of the lower limbs, of the body, 
 und of the head : otherwise the performance will bo

 rigid and absurd, like that of a puppet. Indeed, not 
 only those more prominent and distinguished parts 
 must accompany the voice and principal action of the 
 speaker, but every muscle of the body, and every ex- 
 pression of the countenance, must, join in harmony with 
 those gestures, in order to impress upon them the cha- 
 racter of nature and truth. There is no gesture, or 
 change of gesture, which is not meant to enforce or to 
 illustrate some new circumstance, which either cails 
 into action muscles before at rest, or into a change of 
 action those already in exertion. And this impression 
 and influence extend not only to those muscles which 
 are most strong and distinguished, but even to the most 
 delicate fibres of the human frame, such as those which 
 adjust the expression of the mouth, of the nostrils, of 
 the brows, and of that wonderful organ the eye. 
 
 An example may here be given of some of the stronger 
 changes of the head, body, and lower limbs, which ac- 
 company certain principal gestures. If the right hand 
 be forcibly withdrawn, and presented vhfc (vertical 
 horizontal forwards contracted), the left vdqc (vertical 
 dowmwards oblique contracted), the 
 feet will naturally retire, and be 
 rRlx (retire to the first position 
 extended of the right foot). The 
 body, at the same time, will be 
 thrown backwards, whilst the whole 
 countenance will express aversion, 
 or horror. (Fig. 95). 
 
 The gesture of the right, phf ad, 
 will be accompanied and noted thus : 
 
 p /LJ. — — L_L which signifies that 
 aR2 ° 
 
 the head, and consequently the body, 
 
 leans forwards, and that the eyes are turned earnestly 
 
 in the same direction. This evident desire of inspect 
 
 ing the object more nearly, is also accompanied by an 
 
 advanced step of the right foot, the principal gesture

 bemg performed by the right hand. As the gesture 
 of the left hand could hardly be avoided, under the 
 circumstances mentioned, the notation of it might have 
 been omitted. 
 
 It will be observed, that if the hand, in its gestures, 
 
 at any time 
 approach 
 the head, 
 the head 
 bends to- 
 wards the 
 hand ; and 
 if the hand 
 presents its 
 palm, and 
 pushes, as it 
 were, an ob- 
 ject away 
 in disgust, 
 
 the head accompanies the action, not only by retiring 
 back, but by averting the face. And the motions ex- 
 pressing this aversion are ; first, the eye, directed to- 
 wards the object ; the approaching of the back of the 
 hand towards the face, and the head bending towards 
 the hand, and then the pushing forwards of the palm 
 of the hand, and the throwing back of the head, and 
 averting the face at the same time. The notation will 
 
 stand thus : F vh f c ~~, (Fig. 96), and then, A vk 9 P ~~ 
 aR2 rRlx 
 
 (Fig. 07). 
 
 After the stroke of the emphatic gesture, if the 
 speaker has completely closed his remarks on a par- 
 ticular part of his subject, or if he has finished his ora- 
 tion, both hands should fall to rest, in a manner suiting 
 the last expressions which he has delivered. This 
 falling of the hand to rest is named the close and ter- 
 mination of gesture. It is contrary to the correct sim- 
 plicity of gesture to mark a single word or idea with

 more than one emphatic stroke ; any appendix of ges- 
 ture, after this, would only weaken its force, or render 
 it ridiculous. 
 
 The termination of gesture, or rather, the emphatic 
 gesture which terminates, should not be made across. 
 It is generally made about the horizontal elevation, but 
 sometimes it is made downwards, or elevated, according 
 to the sentiment. The horizontal termination suits 
 decision and instruction ; the downward, disapproba- 
 tion and condemnation ; the elevated, pride, high pas- 
 sion and devotion. 
 
 CHAPTER X. 
 
 THE FREQUENCY, MODERATION, AND INTERMISSION OP 
 GESTURE. 
 
 As gesture is used for the illustration or enforce- 
 ment of language, it should be limited, in its applica- 
 tion, to such words and passages only as admit, or 
 rather require, such illustration or enforcement. That 
 is, gesture should not be used by a public speaker on 
 every word where it is possible to apply it without 
 manifest impropriety ; but it should rather be reserved 
 for such passages as require to be rendered more pro- 
 minent than the others, and to be more highly coloured. 
 A judicious speaker will therefore reserve his gesture, 
 at least the force and ornament of it, for those parts of 
 his discourse for which he also reserves the brilliancy 
 of language and thought. Sometimes, the absolute 
 intermission of gesture is advantageous, as in the com- 
 mencement or opening of arguments. When an argu- 
 ment is nearly concluded, moderate gesture will give 
 it more force, and relieve the monotony of a mere dry 
 demonstration, should the spirit of the composition 
 admit such addition. 
 
 In all discourses, the frequency of gesture will be 
 


## p. 124 (#134) ############################################

124 ELOCUTION. 
 
 determined, in general, by the number, the novelty, and 
 the discrimination of ideas. In every well-constructed 
 sentence, some new idea is advanced, which may be 
 marked by a suitable gesture; and possibly the various 
 limitations and modifications of it will also admit of a 
 similar distinction. Thus each separate clause, or 
 member of a sentence, may admit a distinct gesture on 
 the principal word: and as each epithet is a distinct 
 quality, added to the principal name, and as each ad- 
 verb has the same effect on the principal action ex- 
 pressed by the verb, a new gesture may be made on 
 each. But for this purpose, unless the word is empha- 
 tic, a turn of the hand, a small motion in the trans- 
 verse or vertical direction, or a slight inclination of the 
 head, is sufficient. 
 
 In a sentence where every word is emphatic, each 
 may be marked with a gesture. Sentences of this kind 
 generally condense, in a small compass, valuable infor- 
 mation, and should therefore be strongly enforced and 
 marked with precision. They should, however, be 
 delivered distinctly and deliberately, or the gestures 
 will confuse the sentiment, and even cast a degree of 
 ridicule upon it, as may be found by pronouncing the 
 following serious observation with different degrees of 
 rapidity.

 Neither the emphatic gesture, nor the force of the 
 voice, always falls on those words which are the prin- 
 cipal, in a grammatical sense — the nouns and verbs. 
 The gesture sometimes falls on the word which modi- 
 fies each — on the adjective, which expresses the 
 quality of the noun, or on the adverb, which has a 
 similar effect upon the action or assertion of the verb. 
 
 The same notation, applied to a vehement passage

 apolied to one of the contrary character. A judicious

 speaker will often omit his gesture altogether, and use 
 it only when absolutely necessary to illustrate, or to 
 enforce his sentiments. Gesture may be said to hold 
 the place of high seasoning; it must, therefore, be 
 managed with discretion, lest it should defeat its own 
 purposes, and create disgust. If a speaker proves 
 truly eloquent, he is sure of the most liberal and solid 
 approbation. But he should not hazard too much ; he 
 should be guarded in the commencement of his dis- 
 course, and should restrain his gesture in the calm and 
 reasoning passages, reserving its force and brilliancy 
 for the appropriate expression of his most earnest feel- 
 ings and boldest thoughts. His transitions from the 
 narrative parts to those which are most highly wrought, 
 and which require his utmost exertions, should be gra- 
 dual and just, and free from extravagance. 
 
 CHAPTER XL 
 
 THE QUALITIES OF GESTURE, AND THE GESTURE SUITED 
 TO DIFFERENT MODES OF PUBLIC SPEAKING. 
 
 The different qualities which constitute the perfec- 
 tion of gesture, and their opposite imperfections, are as 
 follows : 
 
 1. Magnificence. 5. Simplicity. 
 
 2. Boldness. 6. Grace. 
 
 3. Energy. 7. Propriety. 
 
 4. Variety. 8. Precision. 
 
 1. Magnificence of gesture. This is effected by de- 
 taching the elbow completely from the body, and 
 unfolding the whole oratorical weapon. In magnifi- 
 cent gesture, the action is flowing and unconstrained ; 
 the preparations are made in graceful curves ; the 
 transitions are easy, and the accompaniments, in all 
 respects, illustrative of the principal action. The mo- 
 9 
 


## p. 126 (#136) ############################################

126 ELOCUTION. 
 
 tions of the head are free, and the inflections of the 
 body manly and dignified. The action of the lower 
 limbs is decisive, and a considerable space is traversed 
 with firmness and with force. 
 
 The opposite imperfections are short and constrained 
 gestures, rigidity of the joints, and stiffness of the body, 
 with short steps, and doubtful or timid movements. 
 
 2. Boldness of gesture. This arises from that ele- 
 vated courage and self-confidence which ventures to 
 hazard any action, however unusual, which is produc- 
 tive of a grand or striking effect. In this sort of ges- 
 ture, unexpected positions, elevations and transitions, 
 surprise at once by their novelty and grace, and thus 
 illustrate or enforce the ideas of the speaker with irre- 
 sistible effect. 
 
 The opposite imperfection is tameness. 
 
 3. Energy of gesture. This consists in the firmness 
 and decision of the whole action ; and in the precision 
 of the stroke of the gesture, which aids the emphasis 
 of the voice. 
 
 The opposite imperfections are feebleness and inde- 
 cision. 
 
 4. Variety of gesture. This consists in the applica- 
 tion of different, but appropriate gestures, to the same, 
 or analogous sentiments, so as to avoid recurring too 
 frequently to one favourite gesture, or set of gestures. 
 
 The opposite imperfection is monotony of gesture, 
 analogous to that of the voice. 
 
 5. Simplicity of gesture. This is such a character 
 of gesture as appears the natural result of the situation 
 and sentiments ; which is neither carried beyond the 
 just extent of the feeling, through affectation of variety, 
 nor falls short of it through want of confidence. 
 
 The opposite imperfection is affectation. 
 
 6. Grace of gesture. This is the result of all other 
 perfections, arising from a dignified self-possession of 
 mind, and the power of personal exertion, practised 
 into facility after the best models, and according to 
 


## p. 127 (#137) ############################################

GESTURE. 1^7 
 
 true taste. To the more particular investigation of 
 this quality a Chapter is devoted. 
 
 The opposite imperfection is awkwardness. 
 
 7. Propriety of gesture, called also truth of gesture, 
 or natural gesture. This consists in the judicious use 
 of gestures best suited to illustrate or to express the 
 sentiment. Propriety of gesture is generally founded 
 on some natural connexion between the sentiment and 
 the action. Significant gestures are strictly connected 
 with the sentiment. 
 
 The opposite imperfections are false, contradictory, 
 or unsuitable gestures. 
 
 8. Precision, or correctness of gesture. This arises 
 from the just preparation, the due force, and the cor- 
 rect timing of the action : when the preparation is nei- 
 ther too much abridged, nor too pompously displayed ; 
 when the stroke of the gesture is made with such a 
 degree of force as suits the character of the sentiment ; 
 and when it is correctly marked on the precise syllable 
 to be enforced. Precision of gesture gives the same 
 effect to action, as neatness of articulation gives to 
 speech. 
 
 The opposite imperfections are the indecision, un- 
 certainty, and incorrectness arising from vague and 
 sawing gestures, which, far from illustrating, render 
 doubtful the sense of the sentiments which they accom- 
 pany, and distract the spectator. 
 
 There are three general modes of public speaking, 
 each of which requires a different style of gesture; 
 namely, 
 
 1. The Epic. 3. The Colloquial. 
 
 2. The Rhetorical. 
 
 1. Epic gesture demands every natural and acquired 
 power, on the part of the speaker : to it belong Magni- 
 ficence, Boldness, Energy, Variety, Simplicity, Grace, 
 Propriety, and Precision. The compositions which 
 require epic gesture, in delivery, are tragedy, epic 
 poetry, lyric odes, and sublime description. 
 


## p. 128 (#138) ############################################

1 28 ELOCUTION. 
 
 2. Rhetorical gesture requires, principally, Energy 
 Variety, Simplicity, and Precision. Grace is desirable , 
 Magnificence is rarely wanting, but may sometimes 
 lave place. Propriety, in a limited sense, should be 
 observed. Boldness is inadmissible ; because the ora- 
 tor is not, like the player, subjected to any unexpected 
 circumstances. He is not, therefore, at liberty to ex- 
 press surprise, or any other passion, by bold gestures 
 or attitudes. 
 
 3. Colloquial gesture, when concerned in the higher 
 scenes of polite life, requires, principally, Simplicity 
 and Grace ; Precision will follow of course ; it may oc- 
 casionally demand something of Energy and Variety 
 Magnificence and Boldness are inadmissible. 
 
 The gesture of the public speaker must vary con- 
 siderably with the different circumstances of his situa- 
 tion, of his sentiments, and of his audience. If the 
 mere information or instruction of his audience be his 
 sole object, as when the evidences of religion and the 
 grounds of Christian duties are to be explained from 
 the pulpit, or w T hen the details of calculation and finance 
 are to be laid before Congress, or when facts are 
 weighed and laws are argued in the courts of justice, 
 his gestures should be of that class which is called dis- 
 criminating gestures. These he should exercise with 
 simplicity and precision. He should strip them of all 
 the parade of preparation, and of the graces of transi- 
 tion, and give them only that degree of variety which 
 shall guard them against disgusting sameness. This 
 is far removed from theatrical gesture ; it rather ap- 
 proaches the colloquial style. Nothing could be more 
 incongruous than for a public speaker, in either of the 
 foregoing situations, to introduce the parade and mag- 
 nificence of theatrical gesture. The charge which is 
 sometimes made against public speakers, of being thea- 
 trical in their gesture, probably arises more from some 
 unsuitableness in their manner to the matter, than from 
 any thing of uncommon majesty, boldness, or grace in 
 their action. 
 


## p. 129 (#139) ############################################

GESTURE. 129 
 
 When the public speaker aims at persuasion, as in 
 discourses from the pulpit for public charities, or on 
 extraordinary occasions in Congress, or at the bar, 
 when the advocate desires to influence the opinions of 
 a jury, he will naturally use more graceful, more flow- 
 ing, and more varied gesture. But he should not fail 
 into the action of the theatre. He may be graceful, 
 but he should be simple ; he may be energetic, but he 
 should not affect gestures too strongly significant, much 
 less attempt surprise by attitudes. All his gestures 
 should be regulated by manly decorum, suitable to his 
 situation, to the character of his hearers, and to the 
 just expression of his sentiments. 
 
 CHAPTER XII. 
 
 SIGNIFICANT GESTURES. 
 
 The most important of the significant gestures are 
 the following : 
 
 The Head and Face. 
 
 The hanging down of the head denotes shame, or 
 grief. 
 
 The holding of it up, pride or courage. 
 
 To nod forwards implies assent. 
 
 To toss the head back, dissent. 
 
 The inclination of the head implies diffidence or lan- 
 guor. 
 
 The head is averted, in dislike or horror. 
 
 ft leans forward, in attention. 
 
 The Eyes. 
 
 The eyes are raised, in prayer. 
 
 They weep, in sorrow. 
 
 They burn, in anger. 
 
 They are downcast -or averted, in shame or grief

130 ELOCUTION. 
 
 They are cast on vacancy, in thought. 
 
 They are cast in various directions, in doubt and 
 anxiety. 
 
 The Arms. 
 
 The placing of the hand on the head, indicates pain 
 or distress. 
 
 On the eyes, shame or sorrow. 
 
 On the lips, an injunction of silence. 
 
 On the breast, an appeal to conscience. 
 
 The hand is waved, or flourished, in joy or contempt 
 
 Both hands are held supine, or they are applied, 01 
 clasped, in prayer. 
 
 Both are held prone, in blessing. 
 
 They are clasped, or wrung, in affliction. 
 
 They are held forward, and received, in friendship. 
 
 The Body. 
 The body, held erect, indicates steadiness and courage. 
 Thrown back, pride. 
 
 Stooping forward, condescension or compassion. 
 Bending, reverence or respect. 
 Prostration, the utmost humility or abasement. 
 
 The Lower Limbs. 
 The firm position of the lower limbs signifies courage, 
 or obstinacy. 
 
 Bended knees indicate timidity, or weakness. 
 
 The lower limbs advance, in desire or courage. 
 
 They retire, in aversion or fear. 
 
 Start, in terror. 
 
 Stamp, in authority or anger. 
 
 Kneel, in submission and prayer. 
 
 These are a few of the simple gestures which may 
 be termed significant.

 131 
 
 COMPLEX SIGNIFICANT GESTURES. 
 
 Complex Significant Gestures are employed chiefly in 
 dramatic representation. They are combinations of 
 simple significant gestures, variously associated accord- 
 ing to the mingled passions which they represent. The 
 boldest and most magnificent of them are termed atti- 
 tudes. The following are examples of complex signifi- 
 cant gestures : 
 
 Reproach puts on a stern aspect : the brow is con- 
 tracted, the lip is turned up with scorn, and the whole 
 body is expressive of 
 aversion. Fig. 166 
 represents Queen Ka- 
 tharine, in the trial 
 scene, in the play of 
 Henry VIII. reproach- 
 ing Wolsey for the in- 
 juries which had been 
 neaped upon her. 
 
 Apprehension is the 
 prospect of future evil 
 accompanied with un- 
 easiness of mind. Fig. 
 167 is a good example. 
 It represents Hamlet 
 
 in the act of exclaiming, "Ay, there's the rub.' 
 Hamlet's Soliloquy, p. 249.] 
 
 Terror excites the person who suffers under it, to 
 avoid the dreaded object, or to escape from it. If it be 
 some dangerous reptile on the ground, and very neai, 
 the expression is represented by starting back and look-

 ELOCUTION. 
 
 ing downwards. If the danger threaten from a dis- 
 tance, the terror arising is expressed by looking for- 
 wards, and not starting back, but merely in the retired 
 position. But if the dread of impending death from 
 the hand of an enemy awaken this passion, the coward 
 flies. Of this there is a fine example in the battles of 
 
 Alexander, by 
 LeBrun. Fig. 
 168represents 
 terror as de- 
 scribed by En- 
 gel. It is that 
 of a man a- 
 1 a.r m e d by 
 lightning and 
 thunder. He 
 shuts his eyes, 
 covers them 
 with one hand 
 and extends 
 
 the other behind him, as if to ward off the dreaded stroke. 
 Aversion, as already observed, is expressed by two 
 gestures. (See p. 122.) 
 
 Horror, which is aversion or astonishment mingled 
 with terror, is seldom capable of retreating, but remains 
 in one attitude, with the eyes riveted on the object, the 
 arms, with the hands vertical, held forward to guard 
 the person, and the whole frame trembling. (Fig. 169.) 
 Listening in order to obtain the surest and most va- 
 rious information, first casts the eye quickly in the ap- 
 parent direction of the sounds; if nothing is seen, the 
 ear is turned towards the point of expectation, the eye 
 is bent on vacancy, and the arm is extended, with the 
 hand vertical ; but all this passes in a moment. If the 
 sounds proceed from different points at the same time, 
 both hands are held up, and the face and eyes alternately 
 change from one side to the other with a rapidity go- 
 verned by the nature of the sound ; if it be alarming, with

 Admiration, if of surrounding natural objects, of a 
 pleasing kind, holds both hands vertical, and across, 
 and then moves them outwards to the position extended 
 as in the figure. (Fig. 100.) In admiration arising 
 from some extraordinary or unexpected circumstances, 
 the hands are thrown up supine elevated, together with 
 the face and the eyes. , 
 
 Veneration crosses both hands on the breast, casts 
 
 down the eyes slow- 
 ly, and bows the 
 head, (Fig. 101.) 
 
 Deprecation ad- 
 vances in the ex- 
 tended position of 
 the feet, approach- 
 ing to kneeling, 
 clasps the hands 
 forcibly together 
 throws back the 
 H head, sinking it be- 
 tween the shoui 
 tiers, and looks earnestly up to the person implored

 In appealing to heaven, the right hand is laid on the 
 breast, then the left is projected su- 
 pine upwards ; the eyes are first di- 
 rected forwards, and then upwards. 
 (Fig. 103.) 
 
 In the appeal to conscience, the 
 right hand is laid on the breast, the 
 left drops unmoved, the eyes are fixed 
 upon the person addressed (Fig. 80, p. 
 99) ; sometimes both hands press the 
 breast. 
 
 Shame in the extreme sinks on the 
 knee, and covers the eyes with both 
 hands. (Fig. 104.) This is a femi- 
 nine expression of it. 
 
 Mild resignation falls on the knee, 
 crosses the arms on the breast, and looks forwards and 
 upwards towards heaven. (Fig. 105.) 
 
 Resignation mixed with desperation, stands erect and 
 unmoved, the head thrown back, the eyes turned up- 
 ward, and fixed, the arms crossed. A fine instance is 
 seen in Fig. 108, from an attitude of Mrs. Siddons. 
 
 Grief arising from sudden and afflicting intelligence, 
 covers the eyes with one hand, advances forwards, and 
 throws back tne other hand. (Fig. 107, and Fig. 81, p. 99.)

 Attention demanding silence, holds the finger on the 
 lips, and leans forwards, sometimes repressing with the 
 left hand. (Fig. 82, p. 99.) 
 
 Distress, when extreme, lays the palm of the hand 
 upon the forehead, throws back the head and body, 
 and retires with a long and sadden step. (Fig. 83. p. 99. 
 
 Deliberation on ordinary subjects, holds the chin 
 and sets the arm a-kimbo. (Fig. 84, p. 99.) 
 
 Self-sufficiency folds the arms, and sets himself on 
 his centre. (Fig. 48, p. 92.) This was a favourite 
 posture of Bonaparte. 
 
 Pride throws back the body, and holds the head high. 
 
 These few complex significant gestures are some of 
 the most obvious, and principally such as occurred in 
 the illustration of other parts of this system; they 
 serve, however, in some degree, to explain the nature 
 of these gestures. But among the writers who have 
 treated particularly of significant gestures, none have 
 written with greater ingenuity than Engel : we will 
 borrow, therefore, an example or two from him. 
 
 Surprise causes the body and lower limbs to retire 
 and affection stimulates the person to advance. (Fig. 
 108.) The figure represents Frederick de Reuss, in a 
 German play, who unexpectedly sees his dear friend. 
 


## p. 136 (#146) ############################################

 GESTURE. 
 
 He withdraws, in surprise, his body and lower limbs, 
 Riid, in the ardour of friendship, immediately stretches 
 forwards his head and his arms. 
 
 When the thoughts flow without 
 diilicuity or opposition, the move- 
 ment of the limbs is free and direct. 
 But when difficulties occur, or ob- 
 stacles are discovered, a man either 
 arrests his action entirely, or changes 
 it to something altogether different. 
 The direction of his eyes, and the(ggxi^ 
 action of his head, are also, under ^e*—=* 
 similar circumstances, quite altered. 
 The eyes, instead of moving freely 
 from object to object, become fixed, 
 and the head is thrown back, if be- 
 fore hanging down on the breast. As an example of 
 these effects, M. Engel refers to a scene in a play of 
 Lessing, in which an old gentleman is very much 
 puzzled how to ma- 
 nage, in a situa- 
 tion of great diffi- 
 culty and delicacy. 
 In the commence- 
 ment of his delibe- 
 rations he is repre- 
 sented as in Fig. i09, 
 and in the next pe- 
 riod of them, as in 
 Fig. 110. 
 
 These examples 
 are introduced by 
 M. Engel to illus- 
 trate his analogous gestures, but they may also be 
 very well applied to illustrate the complex, significant 
 gestures, which are the present subject of investigation. 
 The description which he gives of melancholy, con- 
 trasted with anxiety, is, throughout, eorrect, and full 
 of nice discrimination.

 Melancholy is a feeble and passive affection ; it is 
 attended by a total relaxation of the muscles, with a 
 mute and tranquil resignation, un- 
 accompanied by opposition either 
 to the cause or the sensibility of 
 the evil. The character, externally, 
 is languor, without motion, the 
 head hanging at the " side next, the 
 heart," the eyes turned upon its 
 object, or, if that is absent, fixed 
 upon the ground, the hands hang- 
 ing down by their own weight, 
 without effort, and joined loosely 
 together. (Fig. 111.) 
 
 Anxiety is of a different charac- 
 ter; it is restless and active, and 
 manifest by the extension of the muscles ; the eye is 
 filled with fire, the breathing is quick, the motion is 
 hurried, the head is thrown back, the whole body is 
 extended. The sufferer is like a sick 
 man, who tosses incessantly, and finds 
 himself uneasy in every situation. (Fig. 
 112.) 
 
 One of the causes of M. Engel's ges- 
 tures of analogy is, as he observes, the 
 " disposition of the mind to refer intellec 
 tual ideas to external objects. When 
 king Lear recollects the barbarous treat- 
 ment of his daughters, who, in the midst 
 ?[IIL of a stormy night, had exposed his hoary 
 " head to the inclemency of the weather ; 
 and when he immmediately exclaims 
 
 O that way madness lies; 
 No more of that, 
 
 let me shun that 
 
 <here is not, in reality, any external object from which 
 this unhappy prince should avert his eyes with horror 
 and yet he turns his head away to the side opposite 
 that to which it was directed before, endeavouring, as

 it were, with his hand reversed, to banish that cru^l 
 
 and afflicting recollection." (Fig. 
 113.) 
 
 The significant gestures, how- 
 ever numerous and correct, which 
 u great actor makes in the repre- 
 sentation of an entire dramatic 
 character, bear no proportion to 
 the number of those gestures 
 which do not belong to this class, 
 and which are no less necessary, 
 though they are not so splendid 
 a.nd imposing. The painter is 
 struck by the boldest and finest 
 of the significant gestures, which are called attitudes; 
 and he records them : they are the proper objects oi 
 his art ; they are striking, and less evanescent, than the 
 other gestures which pass unnoticed by him, although 
 they make up by far the greater and more important 
 part of the gestures requisite for illustrating the senti- 
 ments. These less prominent gestures give to the de- 
 clamation its precision and force. A slight movement 
 of the head, a look of the eye, a turn of the hand, a ju- 
 dicious pause, or interruption of gesture, or a change 
 of position in the feet, often illuminates the meaning 
 of a passage, and sends it, full of life and warmth, into 
 the understanding. And the perfection of gesture, in 
 a tragedian, will be found to consist more in the skilful 
 management of the less showy action, than in the exhi- 
 bition of the finest attiludes. Attitudes are danger 
 ons to hazard : the whole powers of the man mus'„ be 
 wrought up to their highest energy, or they become 
 forced and frigid. Excellent players have been seen, 
 who have never ventured an attitude ; but none, deserv- 
 ing the name of excellence, have ever appeared, whose 
 declamation has been deficient in precision or propriety 
 Where all the solid foundation of just and appropriate 
 action has been laid, attitude, when regulated witn

 perstructure ; but, when it is introduced unseasonably, 
 or is overcharged, it is an evidence of deficiency of un- 
 derstanding, as well as of depravity of taste.

 CHAPTER XIII. 
 
 GRACE. 
 
 " Grace," says lord Karnes, " may be defined, that 
 agreeable appearance which arises from elegance of 
 motion, and from a countenance expressive of dignitj^. 
 Expressions of other mental qualities are not essential 
 to that appearance, but they heighten it greatly." 
 
 The gracefulness of rhetorical action depends partly 
 on the person, and partly on the mind. Some are so 
 happily formed that all their motions are graceful ;* 
 and some minds are so noble, that they impart genu- 
 ine grace to the most uncouth forms : both these cases, 
 however, are comparatively rare. 
 
 Grace, like the ideal beauty of the painter, and of 
 the sculptor, is not commonly to be found in the indi- 
 vidual living model, but to be collected from the various 
 excellencies of the many. 
 
 Neither true grace, nor consummate eloquence, can 
 be acquired by those who are totally deficient in natu- 
 ral qualifications; yet they to whom nature has not 
 denied some portion of talents, may improve in both, 
 precisely in proportion to the degree of their application. 
 
 The grace of oratorical action consists, chiefly, in 
 the facility, the freedom, the variety, and the simplicity 
 of those gestures which illustrate the discourse. 
 
 Action, to be graceful, should be performed with 
 facility ; because the appearance of great effort is in- 
 compatible with ease, which is a constituent of grace 
 It should also be performed with freedom : no gestures 
 can be graceful which are either confined by external 
 circumstances, or restrained by the mind. If an orator 
 should address an assembly from a narrow window, it 
 
 * Grace was in all her steps, heaven in her eye, 
 In every action, dignity and love. — Milton.

148 ELOCUTION. 
 
 v^ould be in vain for him to attempt graceful gesture. 
 Confinement, in any less degree, is proportionally in- 
 jurious to grace. Thus, the crowded courts, which 
 impede the motions of the advocate, and the enclosed 
 pulpit, which not unfrequentiy conceals more than half 
 the preacher's figure, are equally injurious to graceful 
 action. Greece, the native soil of manly eloquence 
 and true taste, icas not the originator of the pulpit. 
 
 The restraint arising from diffidence is also prejudi- 
 cial to grace. It has, however, this advantage — t 
 may be effectually corrected by perseverance. 
 
 For the maintenance of grace, in rhetorical action, 
 variety is indispensable. The iteration of the same 
 gesture, or set of gestures, however graceful in them- 
 selves, betrays a poverty of resource which is altoge- 
 ther prejudicial to the speaker. 
 
 Simplicity and truth of manner, if they do not con- 
 stitute grace in themselves, are inseparable from it. 
 Gestures which are manifestly contrived for the mere 
 display of the person, or for the exhibition of some fop- 
 pery, as, for instance, a fine ring, instantly offend. 
 
 To simplicity of gesture is opposed affectation, which 
 destroys every pretension to genuine grace. The more 
 showy the gestures are, unless they are adapted to the 
 subject, and to the character of the speaker, the more do 
 they offend the judicious by their manifest affectation. 
 When the profligate speaks of piety, the miser of gene- 
 rosity, the coward of valour, and the corrupt of integ- 
 rity, they are only the more despised by those who 
 know them. 
 
 The faults of manner are analogous to those of cha- 
 racter, and almost equally disgusting : such as the 
 assumption of dignity where there is none in the senti- 
 ment ; pathos, where there is nothing interesting ; vehe- 
 mence in trifles, and solemnity upon common-place 
 subjects. 
 
 It is an observation founded in fact, that the action 
 of young children is never deficient in grace ; for which 
 


## p. 149 (#159) ############################################

GESTURE. 149 
 
 two reasons may be assigned; first, because they are 
 under no restraint from diffidence, or from any other 
 cause, and therefore use their gestures, with ail sin- 
 cerity of heart, only to aid the expression of their 
 thoughts; and, secondly, because they have few ideas 
 of imitation, and consequently are not deprived of 
 natural grace by affectation, nor perverted by bad 
 models. 
 
 The grace of action, according to Hogarth, consists 
 in moving the body and limbs in that curve which he 
 calls the line of beauty.* When action is considered 
 independent of language and sentiment, this definition 
 will, perhaps, be found generally correct. Rhetorical 
 action, however, derives its grace, not only from the 
 actual motions of the speaker, but also from the con- 
 gruity of his motions with his own character and situa- 
 tion, as well as with the sentiments which he delivers. 
 The dignity which is a becoming grace in a judge, 
 would be quaint affectation in a young advocate ; and 
 the colloquial, but graceful familiarity of action, even 
 of the most polished society, would be highly indeco- 
 rous in the pulpit. Hence, it must be admitted, ac- 
 cording to the just maxim of Cicero and Quintilian, 
 that decorum constitutes true oratorical grace ; and that 
 this decorum admits of great variety of action, under 
 different circumstances. Vehement action is sometimes 
 both decorous and graceful ; so also are abrupt and 
 short gestures, if they bear the impress of truth and 
 suitableness. Such are the gestures of an old man, 
 when he is irritated. But the most flowing and beau- 
 tiful motions, the grandest preparations, and the finest 
 transitions of gesture, ill applied, and out of time, lose 
 their natural character of grace, and become indeco- 
 rous, ridiculous, or offensive.

 CHAPTER XV. 
 
 APPLICATION OF THE NOTATION LETTERS. 
 
 The most complicated gestures are those which 
 relate to the combined postures and motions of the 
 hands and arms; yet these are expressed with suffi- 
 cient accuracy by four, or fewer, notation letters for 
 


## p. 153 (#163) ############################################

GESTURE. 153 
 
 each movement. For this purpose they are divided 
 into four classes ; the notation letters of each always 
 preserve their own place, as to priority, or succession, 
 and derive their signification from it. The first four, 
 or the first three letters, taken together, are called a 
 set of letters. In a set, as phfd, or seq n, 
 
 The first letter relates to the posture of the hand. 
 
 The second, to the elevation of the arm. 
 
 The third, to the transverse situation of the arm. 
 
 The fourth, to the motion, or force of the gesture.* 
 
 Thus, phfd is to be read, prone horizontal forward 
 descending. Prone, is the posture of the hand ; hori- 
 zontal, is the elevation of the arm; forward, is the pos- 
 ture of the arm in the transverse direction ; and de- 
 scending, means that the arm descends from a higher 
 elevation. The set, seq n, is read supine elevated oblique 
 noting. Supine, the posture of the hand ; elevated, the 
 arm, as to elevation ; oblique, the arm in the transverse 
 direction ; noting, the action of the hand and arm. 
 
 As both hands and both arms are equally capable 
 of executing any gesture, the letters, and sets of letters, 
 relate to both indifferently. But they are thus distin- 
 guished : when there are two sets of small letters, the 
 first set denotes the gesture of the right hand and arm ; 
 the second, those of the left. The two sets are sepa- 
 rated by a short dash, thus : phq ■ — pdb, prone horizon- 
 tal oblique, the right hand ; and prone downwards back- 
 wards, the left. 
 
 When only a single set of three, four, or five smal 1 
 letters is marked, the gesture of one hand only is ex- 
 pressed ; that of the other is presumed to be easily 
 supplied, according to the rules of accompaniment. A 
 short dash always accompanies a single set of small 
 letters — when the dash follows the letters, they denote 
 the gesture of the right hand ; when the dash precedes 
 the letters, they denote the gesture of the left hand. 
 
 * This last letter is often omitted. 
 
 


## p. 154 (#164) ############################################

154 ELOCUTION. 
 
 When a set of small letters is preceded by a capital 
 B, the gesture which they represent is to be performed 
 by both hands. 
 
 When a long dash follows the small letters, connect- 
 ing them with other small letters, or with a single one, 
 farther on, a change of gesture is marked, which is to 
 take place on the word over which such letter or let- 
 ters are placed ; and the commencement and termina- 
 tion of the dash mark the commencement and termina- 
 tion of the gesture. 
 
 When a set of small letters, having a dash, is con- 
 nected by a line of dots with another set of small letters, 
 having a contrary dash, the gesture made by the first 
 hand is to be followed and supported by another ges- 
 ture made by the other hand, which is to take place 
 where the second set of letters is marked. This is 
 called alternate gesture, and noted al. 
 
 In order to prevent, confusion, the postures of the 
 head, and the direction of the eyes, are indicated by 
 capital letters near the beginning of the sentence, or at 
 some distance from the letters relating to the hands 
 and arms. 
 
 The letters which mark the positions of the feet, and 
 the steps, are placed below the line, and under the word 
 where they should take place.

 Remarks on the Notation of the Miser and Plutus. 
 
 For the convenience of reference, the piece is divided into sec- 
 tions, by vertical bars, and the number of each section is printed in 
 the margin. 
 
 (1.) The direction of motion, expressed by the 4th small letter, 
 r, means that from the position in which both hands are presented, 
 vhf, they should move towards the right, and stop at the position, 
 oblique, as noted by q, connected by a dash to the position mentioned. 
 
 (2.) The 4th small letter, n, signifies noting - . 
 
 (12.) The posture of the hands is, at first, folded horizontal for- 
 wards, as expressed in the notation, Id hf. At the a, connected 
 by a dash, which signifies ascending, the hands are raised up, and 
 at the next notation, Id br, they are forcibly withdrawn back on the 
 breast. 
 
 (21.) This posture begins horizontal, as first noted, Bvhf, and 
 ends elevated, B vef; but the B is omitted over the word, weak, 
 being understood by the connecting dash. 
 
 (25.) The 3d small letter, relating to the transverse direction of 
 the arm, is often placed alone, but connected by a dash with a pre 
 ceding set of letters, as already observer (1.) In such case it is to 
 be understood that the posture of the hands remains as before, and 
 that the transverse direction of the arm only is changed. Here 
 each arm passes through the whole semicircle, from tie position 
 across to extended. 
 
 The fourth, and the fifth small letter, which relates to the direc- 
 tion and manner of motion, are also often separated, in this manner 
 from the position to which they belong, in order that the place of 
 the motion, or action, may be the more distinctly marked. (See 9,

 15 ahd 20, in which n is thus separated, to point out the particular 
 eyllable on which the action of noting falls ) 
 
 The action of the hands and arms, at No. 15 and 20, is the same, 
 but the general effect is different, in consequence of the difference 
 in the positions of the feet. In the preparation for these gestures, 
 the palms of both hands are raised so as almost to touch the fore- 
 head ; then they descend gradually, and when the arms are a little 
 below the horizontal elevation, the wrists make that particular 
 motion called noting, on the respective words, stores and cheat. 
 
 (26.) Left foot first position extended. To make this position 
 extended, the left foot is advanced, the body at the same time is 
 thrown back, and sinks a little, bending the right knee. 
 
 (28.) This gesture, Bvhf rj, both vertical horizontal forwards 
 rejecting, is thus made : both hands are drawn backwards, nearly 
 to the mouth, in the vertical position ; the eyes, at this time, are 
 directed forwards, the hands are then pushed forwards, while the 
 face is averted, and the feet retire, to a greater or less extent, in 
 proportion to the degree of disgust or abhorrence to be expressed.

 Remarks on the Notation of Gray's Elegy. 
 
 (Stanza I.) First Line. Ls, listening-. (See complex signifi- 
 cant gestures.) The small «, over knell, is connected with the set 
 of letters, B pef, over parting ; and the small d, over day, is also 
 connected with the same set. Each is considered a fourth small 
 letter, separated from its &et ; a denotes the preparation, and d, the 
 termination of the motion of the gesture. Second line. The set 
 of letters, phd, relates to the right hand, which finishes its action 
 at x, and falls slowly to rest. Third line. Here the left hand

162 ELOCUTION. 
 
 takes up the principal gesture. This is called alternate gesture. 
 Both hands unite their action on weary. Fourth Line. V, the 
 eyes bent on vacancy. 
 
 (Stanza II.) The several gestures which are connected toge- 
 tner by long dashes, are to be considered as the flowing variation of 
 continued motion, till either one, or both hands fall to rest. Ges- 
 tures, thus connected, maybe called continuous; they are gene- 
 rally of that kind which are styled discriminating gestures. First 
 line. The posture, Bphc, on fades, is the preparation for sweep- 
 ing round the horizon. Whilst the hands are proceeding to the 
 position, Bphc, the head and eyes should turn towards either ex- 
 treme ; and whilst the arms are moving from this to the different 
 positions, q and x, the head and eyes should move to the other ex- 
 treme. In cases where the right hand performs the principal ac- 
 tion, the head should follow its motion ; in other words, it should 
 turn from left to right, and vice versa. Third line. The left hand 
 drops here, and the index-finger of the right hand is prepared to 
 point across. The eye should follow the object at which the finger 
 seems to point, as at a flying beetle. 
 
 (Stanza III.) In order to vary the gestures, and the better to 
 distribute the objects in the picture, the tower is supposed to be 
 placed on the left side, and the left hand assumes the principal ges- 
 ture; this is indicated, in the notation, by the short dash which 
 precedes the set of letters. Fourth line. " Ancient, solitary" 
 Nouns, or, substantives, may be considered as the outlines, or im- 
 ages of things; adjectives, as the colouring, or circumstances added 
 to those images, or limitations deducting something from them. In 
 poetical language they are called epithets. Gray has indulged in 
 the use of them, perhaps to a fault. But however that may be, 
 whenever they occur, they almost constantly rob the principal image, 
 or substantive, of its emphatic distinction, and claim it for themselves ; 
 perhaps, because the circumstances alone give individuality to the 
 image, which, in itself, is a general term. For these reasons, the 
 action, or gesture, falls rather on the epithet; and, if two, or more 
 epithets are added to the same image, each should be distinctly 
 marked, both by emphasis and action: if so pronounced, they serve 
 to illustrate the idea; but if they are hurried over, they cause only 
 confusion. Therefore, the words ancient solitary reign, require 
 two gestures, one on each epithet. But, to avoid affectation, the 
 transition should be the easiest possible ; and this will be when the 
 gesture on the preceding word is made the preparation for that on 
 the subsequent. When two epithets are applied to a name, the 
 latter should be the stronger; and in this view, also, it is proper to 
 reserve the emphatic gesture for it, as the principal. 
 
 (Stanza IV.) First line. On elms, the right hand again re- 
 sumes the principal gesture. It is here alternate, or auxiliary, as 
 appears from the dotted line of connexion. Second line. On heaves

GESTURE. 163 
 
 the backs of the hands are presented forwards, the hands hanging 
 down, and in the action they ascend gradually towards vertical eleva- 
 ted, on the word mouldering. Third line. " Each in his narrow cell 
 for ever laid ;" the arms gradually ascend to the highest point, on the 
 word ever, and then, in the same manner, descend, to rest on the 
 word sleep, making, in their progress, a momentary arrest on the 
 word forefathers. It seems to be an incongruity to raise the arms, 
 in speaking of the grave, which is below ; but this is removed by 
 the downward inclination of the head, and look of the eyes, as noted ; 
 and it is not uncommon to elevate the arms in looking into any 
 thing dreadful below. This is also the preparation for the following 
 gesture, which requires the arms to fall to rest. From the third 
 line to the end of the stanza the gestures are continuous. 
 
 (Stanza V.) First line. On breathing the graceful wave is 
 marked. The wave may be considered of three kinds, the graceful, 
 the wave of triumph (which, in a less degree, is also the wave of 
 joy), and the wave of scorn, or contempt. The subject will always 
 sufficiently determine the character to be adopted, though the no- 
 tation is the same for all. Second line. On swallow, the index is 
 raised, to point out the object ; on twittering it ascends to the high- 
 est point in the range of gesture, or is retracted, so as almost to 
 touch the head, and then on the word straw-built it makes the ac- 
 tion of noting. Third line. The joyful wave, approaching to tri- 
 umph, should be made on echoing ; the voice should here mark the 
 crescendo, which will be contrasted with the gravity of the follow 
 ing line. Fourth line. In order to perform the action of springing, 
 indicated by sp, the arms begin to ascend from more, and having 
 arrived at the word rouse, the wrists make on it the stroke of the 
 gesture by springing suddenly into the elevated position. 
 
 (Stanza VI.) Fourth line. The gesture on climb is a suspend- 
 ing gesture, preparatory to that on kiss. The eyes look downwards 
 on climb, and forwards on kiss. The ends of the fingers approach 
 the mouth a little on kiss, after which the hands are advanced su- 
 pine noting. 
 
 (Stanza VII.) Second line. The preparation for the gesture 
 on stubborn is neq rt, and would fall on oft, but is here omitted as 
 taking place, of course, when the gesture marked on stubborn is 
 executed. It will be observed that several emphatic gestures im- 
 ply a proper suspending, or preparatory gesture, and reciprocally, 
 the latter the former. Thus, when a stroke is required to be made, 
 the arm must, of course, be raised ; therefore, shf st must necessa- 
 rily imply nefbn, inwards elevated forwards bending ; veq w im- 
 plies, bhf a, backwards horizontal forwards ascending ; and vhxrj, 
 implies, vhx rt, vertical horizontal extended retracting. In the 
 notation, the preparatory gestures are often omitted, when they arc 
 not required to make a preceding less emphatic word ; in which 
 case they are prepared with less decision, and their stroke is soft-

164 ELOCUTION. 
 
 cried. When the suspending-, or preparatory gesture is used as the 
 principal, as in terror, where the arms are retracted violently, and 
 in surprise, where they are elevated forcibly, the subsequent ges- 
 ture is also softened ; and the emphasis of its stroke is remitted. 
 Fourth line. Should woods not be pronounced with a strong em- 
 phasis, the notation over this word might be omitted. 
 
 (Stanza VIII.) The first gesture in each of the first three 
 lines of this stanza, is a preparatory gesture, of the decisive kind, 
 and the last, in each, emphatic. As all the words which are noted 
 are important, each requires the enforcement of gesture; and the 
 connexion of suspending, or preparatory and emphatic gestures, 
 renders the transitions easy and unaffected. Second line. The 
 noun, destiny, being here placed before its adjective, or epithet, 
 may obtain both the emphasis and action ; they might, also, be re- 
 served for the epithet obscure. Fourth line. "• Short and simple ;" 
 the first epithet is distinguished by a slight discriminating gesture, 
 produced by a small change in the elevation of the arm and hand, 
 marked a. This is made the commencement of the gesture vef, 
 which is completed by a suspending gesture on simple, and which 
 descends to rest on the word poor, with an emphatic and terminat- 
 ing gesture. 
 
 (Stanza IX.) First line. The flourish is marked on power. 
 The flourish, as expressed in Fig. 88, is performed principally by 
 the wrist. In order to perform this action, the hand, with the in- 
 dex-finger, is dropped down a little above the head, nearly at right 
 angles with the fore-arm, and is then thrown forcibly upwards, and 
 sweeps round as marked by the line of dots in the figure. To ad- 
 vance boldly, indicates confidence, pride, &c. ; to advance slowly, 
 implies solemnity, grief, resignation, &c. The notation is the same, 
 in each case, as the sentiments sufficiently show in what manner 
 the speaker should advance. Of the former (bold advance), an in 
 stance is observed on the word power, in this line; of the latter 
 (slow advance), an instance is seen on the word grave, in the last 
 line. Third line. The shake, sh, is marked on inevitable. It 
 should not comprise many tremulous motions, lest it appear ridicu- 
 lous ; it is sufficient that the hand move twice suddenly backwards 
 and forwards. Fourth line. The gestures in this line are continu- 
 ous. The first, on paths, is a discriminating gesture, leading to 
 the suspending gesture, on glory. The gesture on lead, is the pre- 
 paration for that which descends to the word grave, on which falls 
 the emphatic and terminating gesture. The advance, noted in this 
 line, aR2, for the step, combines with the descending arms, and aids 
 in looking down with resignation. But it might be r/21, or rIA % 
 which would express terror, or alarm. / prefer aR2. 
 
 (Stanza XL) Second line. From back, both hands (the palma 
 inwards), move inwards, so that at mansion they nearly touch tha

GESTURE. 165 
 
 lips, as noted ; they then move outwards to the position oblique, on 
 the word fleeting. 
 
 (Stanza Xll.) Third line. There is a suspending gesture on 
 hands, which is the preparation for the subsequent gesture. It 
 might have been omitted, as it is obviously implied, were it not 
 thought proper to mark the word hands with some force ; and, in 
 this way, it obtains the distinction of gesture without extravagance 
 or unnecessary waste of gesture. Were this preparatory gesture 
 not marked, the hands would ascend, by a uniform motion, to rod, 
 then make the stroke on empire, which would be feeble, and, if 
 noted at large, would be thus : 
 
 B shfst 
 
 Hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd. 
 
 Fourth line. The double sweep is here performed — first inwards, 
 on ecstasy, and then outwards, on lyre. 
 
 (Stanza XIII.) The gesture on penury is a suspending one; 
 its fourth and its fifth letter, rp, which express the manner of mo- 
 tion, being separated, in order to place them over their proper syl- 
 lable. The notation, at large, would be as follows : 
 
 _ B vhf rt B v/if rp 
 
 Chill penury repressed, &c. 
 
 The first retracting, the last repressing ; this, however, is under- 
 stood from the nature of the emphatic gesture. Fourth line. The 
 fourth small letter, c, over froze, signifies contracted. The gesture 
 on current serves as a preparation for placing the hands on the 
 breast. This gesture, Bnhfp, begins on genial, and the arms are 
 stretched out, with some force, on current. 
 
 (Stanza XIV.) Third line. On the won] flower, shfrt might 
 be placed, as the preparation for the gesture on blush; but as the 
 word does not require a strong emphasis, the notation is omitted; 
 however, the gesture is implied. (See remarks on Stanza VII.) 
 
 (Stanza XV.) Fourth line. When from the transverse posi- 
 tion, c, the arms move directly to x, without noting the interme- 
 diate position, q, as here, on country's blood, the motion is under- 
 stood to be rapid, and decisive, expressing vehemence or horror. 
 
 (Stanza XVI.) Second line. The gestures necessary to be 
 marked, on this line, are four, of which the second, on pain, and 
 the third, on ruin, are made by the momentary arrest of the hand, 
 in its ascent to vef, on the first syllable of despise ,- rj* rejecting, on 
 the last syllable, finishes the whole with the emphatic stroke. 
 Thus sufficient discrimination is made, without falling into quaint- 
 ness of gesture, or affectation. These small discriminating ges- 
 tures, produced by a slight arrest of motion, and often by merely 
 changing the posture of the hand, are more frequent, and more im 
 portant to the orator, than the more showy gestures, and should be 
 particularly attended to. 
 


## p. 166 (#176) ############################################

166 ELOCUTION. 
 
 (Stanza. XVII.) The last two lines have each a series of con- 
 tinuous gestures. 
 
 From the preceding- analysis and notation, it will be observed that 
 the discriminating gestures are principally requisite for the recit- 
 ing of this poem. The suspending and the emphatic are frequent; 
 but the last seldom require to be strongly marked, as the general 
 character of the sentiments is calm and tender. Of significant 
 gestures there are very few. The first, marked Ls, listening, over 
 curfew, is of this class, and perhaps a few others may also be 
 reckoned to belong to it, as when the hand is laid on the breast; but 
 there are not many more. 
 
 As these gestures may be varied, it may be said, infinitely, so 
 there can be no fixed standard, as to the manner of delivering this, 
 or any other poem, or oration, which should be considered exclusively 
 appropriate. The sentiments require, indeed, to be delivered with 
 suitable tones of voice, and expression of countenance; but great 
 variety of gesture may be consistent with propriety, provided gene- 
 ral rules are not violated : as, that decorum and simplicity be ob- 
 served; that the transitions, connexions, the time of the gesture, 
 and precision in the stroke, be attended to, and other obvious precau- 
 tions, of general import, already sufficiently detailed. The notation 
 will accommodate itself to every variety in the speaker's manner; 
 and this must prove a recommendation to its use.

 Remarks on the Notation of the Speech of Brutus. 
 
 I have introduced this speech, and noted it, for the purpose of 
 showing- that the gestures necessary for delivering it in the true 
 spirit, are principally the suspending and the emphatic. These are 
 suited to the vehemence of the speaker's manner, which seeks no 
 ornament, but hastens to produce the main impression on his hearers, 
 by the most direct method. An inspection of the notation will make 
 his evident ; for, even though the reader may wish tr alter many

GESTURE. 169 
 
 particular gestures which are here noted, he must change them for 
 others of the same nature, if he would preserve the character of the 
 speech. The suspending and the emphatic gestures must still 
 abound, and he will find little opportunity for introducing the other 
 descriptions, which are, in general, too tame for the abrupt and ve- 
 hement style of this speech. 
 
 " Be silent that you may hear. 1 '' On these words I have marked 
 the gesture for the left hand, as well as that for the right, and also 
 on the words, " have respect unto mine honour.'''' This last is an 
 auxiliary gesture, but of the vehement kind. The exordium of this 
 singular oration ends at " better judge ;" after which, the arms 
 should fall to rest, and there should be a considerable pause. An- 
 other division, which may be called the proposition, takes place at 
 "live all freemen " another, the narration, at "death for his am- 
 bition " and that which may be called the pathetic, or appeal to 
 the passions, finishes at " I pause for a reply.'*'' The argument, or 
 reasoning, ends at " suffered death ;" and the peroration follows. 
 
 " I weep for him?* This is noted E — R, the right hand on the 
 eyes, the left at rest. 
 
 "Him have I offended " noted on "him, 1 '' ihfrc, recoiling. In 
 this action the finger is pointed suddenly, and scornfully ; then im- 
 mediately withdrawn. 
 
 Frequent changes in the positions of the feet indicate anxiety ; 
 they are, therefore, noted, in this speech. 
 
 "His body, mourned;" auxiliary gesture. When the right 
 hand is brought up on " mourned,'''' both hands become supine ; and, 
 on the next words, " by Mark Antony," they make the action of 
 noting. At "Here comes," noted B, the speaker looks back; at 
 " Mark Antony," noted F, he looks forward to those whom he ad- 
 dresses. It would be tedious to point out all the suspending ges- 
 tures, succeeded immediately by the emphatic, for they abound. 
 In all the antitheses, which are numerous, the suspending will be 
 found over the first member, and the emphatic over the last.

 Remarks on the Extract from Young's Night-Thoughts. 
 
 The peculiarities of Young's style, especially in his Night- 
 Thoughts, render his poetry particularly difficult for recitation. 
 His use of epithets is faulty to excess. He heaps them profusely, 
 and in every manner, on the principal idea. Man is here his sub- 
 ject, which he colours with every variety of tint, exhibits in every 
 light, and touches and re-touches almost to disgust. And yet he 
 has here produced many sublime images ; and his very faults, his 
 labour, his antitheses and his catachreses,* are the source of his 
 beauties. This passage is particularly difficult to recite. The dif- 
 
 * Catachresis, a figure of speech by which one word is abusive^? 
 put for another.

172 ELOCUTION. 
 
 ficnlty arises cbiefiy from the multiplicity of the images, and the 
 brevity of the expression ; consequently, if the speaker is not care- 
 ful to pronounce every line with due deliberation, his gesture makes 
 confusion only, and gives an air of mummery to his recitation. 
 This condensation of images occurs in almost every line ; but the 
 twenty -sixth line, which consists of only four words, is remarkable. 
 " Helpless immortal ! insect infinite !" 
 
 To give force and variety, and, at the same time, simplicity and 
 gracefulness to gestures so heaped on each other, is attended with 
 no inconsiderable difficulty. But even should the speaker's manner, 
 in the recitation of these lines, prove unexceptionable in this re- 
 spect, the difficulty is but half conquered. They do not, indeed, 
 require any considerable variety of voice; but the eye and the coun- 
 tenance of the speaker must be full of expression and intelligence: 
 he must appear to be rapt in meditation, which rises into sublimity 
 as it proceeds, and inflames, as it catches the rapid succession of 
 thought. On these accounts, this passage is seldom recited suc- 
 cessfully. 
 
 After what has been said in the analysis of the other pieces, a 
 few observations will suffice for this. 
 
 Line 4, "aright," continuous gesture to the end of the 5th line, 
 where the hand falls to rest with some degree of force, noted R st, 
 rest, striking. The hand, generally, in falling to rest, drops quietly 
 and imperceptibly by its own gravity, and it is then noted with a 
 simple R ; but sometimes the hand is struck down forcibly, and then 
 it is noted, as above, R st. 
 
 Line 8. " How much ;" the x, in the fourth place, means that 
 the arms are to be extended forwards eagerly. 
 
 Line 14, 15, 16, six epithets, antithesis, and a climax: the voice 
 and gesture must increase in energy, and on " Ae," in the 16th line, 
 complete the climax. The first, in each pair of gestures, is pre- 
 paratory to the subsequent, in the antithesis. 
 
 Line 23 to 25. Antitheses and catachreses heaped on each 
 other, each requiring a separate gesture, strongly contrasted with 
 that to which it is opposed. 
 
 Line 29. F st, the hand striking the forehead. 
 
 GENERAL REMARKS. 
 
 In order to render every circumstance perfectly intelligible, I have 
 marked with the notation letters the gestures in the preceding ex- 
 amples more minutely than is necessary for general use. For gene- 
 ral use, it is sufficient to note the most important circumstances, 
 leaving the filling up to the judgment of the speaker. 
 


## p. 173 (#183) ############################################

GESTURE. 173 
 
 In the recitation of descriptions of any kind, the speaker must, in 
 imagination, have the picture before his eyes, and each object must 
 be disposed in the same order as if actually painted. If this imagi- 
 nary picture be faulty in the composition, confused, or ill-grouped 
 the gesture will perplex, rather than enlighten ; but, if well con- 
 ceived, and well disposed in its parts, the speaker will seem to give 
 it the interest of life by his skilful gesture and recitation; and the 
 puditor will almost imagine that he actually contemplates all that 
 the speaker describes. 
 
 Impassioned compositions, delivered with proper feeling and ex- 
 pression, open, in like manner, to the view of the hearer, the inter- 
 nal operations of the speaker's mind, — a contemplation still more 
 interesting than any scenes of external nature which can be pre- 
 sented in description. 
 
 As, in writing, even an appropriate term must not be used too 
 frequently, so in this art, the same gesture, however expressive, 
 must not be too often repeated. Variety is graceful, and requires 
 that similar gestures, as well as similar words, should be separated 
 b.v those which are diverse. 
 
 In oratorical action, it is a general rule that each new idea requires 
 a new gesture. But important ideas, only, require distinguished 
 gesture. For these last, therefore, should be reserved the species of 
 gestures named emphatic; for the former (which are the most nu- 
 merous), the discriminating will be sufficient. As to frequency, the 
 propriety of gesture will be found to depend on the deliberation and 
 expression of the speaker. If the feelings are not alive, and if the 
 lines are not pronounced with due deliberation, the gestures will 
 appear to be too numerous. In the preceding examples they may 
 seem to have this fault, from the circumstance that it is my object 
 to exhibit at large the greater part of their minute connexions and 
 transitions. A little attention, however, will show, that much, 
 still, has been left to be supplied by the judgment of the reader. 
 
 The notation, and the analytical observations on the foregoing 
 pieces, will, it is conceived, afford sufficient information to such as 
 may desire to assist their rhetorical studies by this system. I would 
 not recommend that the young speaker, in using this notation, should 
 mark every possible passage in his discourse, in the manner of these 
 examples; for such minuteness would lead to embarrassment, un- 
 less preceded by much labour. The utmost advisable notation 
 should not exceed a few marks on particular passages, and those 
 separated from each other; the filling up of which should be trusted 
 to the feelings of the moment. But the best method, in all re- 
 spects, for acquiring a finished rhetorical delivery, is the private 
 practice of declamation, which is supported on the authority of the 
 great masters and models of oratory, Demosthenes and Cicero. The 
 aspiring rhetorical student should select one or more celebrated 
 orations, couched in the style that he wishes to adopt; these he

 should carefully subject to all the rules of notation ; he should study 
 them, and commit them to memory ; he will exercise on them all 
 the powers of his voice, his countenance and gesture ; and, like De- 
 mosthenes, consult his mirror, and obtain the opinion of a judicious 
 friend on his performances. The knowledge and facility, which, 
 by repeated exercises of this kind, he will acquire in rhetorical 
 delivery, may be transferred, with advantage, to his own composi- 
 tions which are to be delivered in public; and, without hazarding 
 the inconveniences of particular notation, he will find himself pos- 
 sessed of such a store of various, forcible, and expressive action, 
 that, whatever his feelings shall suggest at the moment, he will be 
 able to execute in a satisfactory manner.

PRACTICAL ELOCUTION. 
 
 Having treated of the principles of Reading and 
 Speaking, it is now necessary, in order to render this 
 Work an entire System of Elocution, to furnish the 
 pupil with appropriate Exercises for the practical 
 application of these principles. 
 
 The Exercises are divided into two Parts. Part I. 
 consists of Exercises in Articulation, Pitch, Force, 
 Time, and Gesture. Part II. consists of Exercises in 
 Reading and Declamation.

 This Exercise should be practised as 
 
 follows : 
 
 1. Utter each ele- 
 
 wont with the fall 
 
 ing 
 
 inflection, the vowels with explosive force. 
 
 
 
 
 
 (183) 
 


## p. 184 (#194) ############################################

184 PRACTICAL ELOCUTION. 
 
 2. Utter each vowel and subvowel, alternately, with the rising- and 
 falling inflection. 3. Utter the vowels with the falling 1 inflection, 
 alternately, in a high and low pitch. 4. Utter each vowel in the 
 medium pitch of the natural voice, then in the falsetto, and lastly, 
 in the lowest note of the natural voice. 5. Pronounce every word 
 under the head Subvowels, as well as under the head Aspirates, in 
 the following manner: make a full inspiration, and dwell for two 
 or three seconds on the initial element ; then utter the remainder 
 of the word with a sudden and forcible expulsion of the breath.* 
 
 SECOND EXERCISE. 
 
 In this Exercise, every vowel is preceded by every subvowel, 
 ind by every aspirate.

 * As song and orb do not begin with a subvowel, they should 
 be omitted in this exercise. And as it is impossible to dwell on the 
 aspirate, h, the word hut may also be omitted.

 The object of this Exercise is to enable the pupil to utter per- 
 fectly the subvowels and aspirates, when they are the final elements 
 of words.

 SIXTH EXERCISE. 
 
 This Exercise exhibits the analysis of words in which there are 
 easy combinations of elements. In the first column the words are 
 presented as they are usually spelled ; in the second, their elements 
 are separated by hyphens. The pupil should spell the words, ut- 
 tering, separately, each element, and not the name of the letter, as 
 is generally done in the schools.

 muscles which move the tip, and root of the tongue, and to contrast 
 the elements, d and g, and t and k, which, by children, are some- 
 times confounded. The want of entire command of the muscles of 
 the tongue and lips, is the reason why some persons speak thick, as 
 it is called. A part of this Exercise is adapted to the case of lispers, 
 those who substitute the subvowel th for i ; and the aspirate th, 
 for*.

 EIGHTH EXERCISE. 
 
 This is an Exercise in Pitch. The first four notes, counting 
 from below, belong to the natural voice ; the fifth, to the falsetto. 
 The pupil should pronounce the letters, a, e, i, a, in the ascending 
 and descending order of the scale, and with the rising and falling 
 inflection, as represented by the notes. He should then, in like 
 manner, pronounce each vowel element — ascending and descend- 
 ing, as before.

 INTERROGATIVE SENTENCES. 
 
 There is nothing peculiar in the melody of interrogative sentences, 
 when they are pronounced with the falling inflection ; but, when 
 they are pronounced with the rising inflection, they are character- 
 ized as follows : 
 
 When a question is asked simply for information, and there is 
 but one emphatic syllable in it, this syllable rises concretely from 
 the pitch-note line, through the interval of a third, or fifth (or there- 
 abouts), according to the degree of energy with which the sentence 
 is pronounced. And the syllables which follow the interrogative 
 note (if I may so call it), are pronounced in the pitch of the upper 
 extreme of this note, thus : — 
 
 Dias* 32.

 When a question is asked with surprise, the interrogative note 
 begins a degree below the pitch-note, and rises, concretely, about a 
 fifth, or an octave, thus: —

 less energy than you, the melody would be as follows: —

 And should you, Susan's, and side, be all pronounced with empha-

 TWELFTH EXERCISE. 
 
 MODULATION. 
 
 There are many persons who do not vary the pitch and force of 
 their voices according to the varying demands of sentiment. They 
 read every thing alike ; and they do not appear capable of imitating 
 a correct manner of speaking. In such cases, I have found it ne- 
 cessary, in order to break up established habits, and direct the voice, 
 as it were, into a new channel, to institute exercises in which the 
 pitch and force of the voice are varied in the wildest and most ex- 
 travagant manner. For instance, I select some piece, and divide it 
 into sections. The first of these sections I pronounce in the falsetto 
 voice, and request the pupil, or, what is better, the whole class, to 
 pronounce it in like manner; the second section I pronounce in the 
 lowest note of the natural voice, and it is immediately repeated by 
 the class ; the third, in the highest note of the natural voice ; the 
 fourth in a whisper; the fifth, in the medium pitch of the natural 
 voice; and so on. After exercising awhile in this manner, the

 pupil is able to appreciate smaller intervals of pitch ; and the voices 
 of the whole class are ultimately brought into the same key, as is 
 done in singing. The following is an exercise of the kind to which 
 I allude. 
 
 Falsetto. Lowest note of the natural voice. 
 
 My brave associates, | partners of my toil, | 
 
 Highest note of n.v. Whispering voice. Medium note of natural voice

 Lowest note.

 THIRTEENTH EXERCISE. 
 
 TREMOUR. 
 
 The pupil should pronounce all the vowels which admit of long 
 quantity, with a tremulous movement of the voice, as shown by the 
 following diagram : — 
 
 Diag. 39. 
 
 a a 
 
 a a 
 
 The vowels, a, a, e, i, 0, 6, u, and ou, should be pronounced in 
 the same manner. 
 
 The accented syllable of the words printed in italics, in the fol- 
 lowing passages, may be pronounced with the tremour. 
 
 That wash ihy hallow'd feet, and warbling flow. 
 Greece nurtured in her glory's time. 
 And the complaining brooks, that make the meadows 
 §reen. 
 
 The tremour heightens the expression, even of opponent passions, 
 as joy and sorrow. It may be occasionally introduced with great 
 effect, both in song and speech, as well as in instrumental music.

 FOURTEENTH EXERCISE. 
 
 TIME AND GESTURE. 
 
 A rhythmical ear is essential to the public speaker who would 
 gesticulate with gracefulness, precision and effect. The subject of 
 time, therefore, should claim his particular attention. Those who 
 have not a rhythmical ear, may acquire one, by practising faithfully 
 the following progressive Exercises : 
 
 1. Raise the arms, with the hands clinched, to the position ele- 
 vated forwards {Beef ') ,and then bring them down, with great force, 
 to the position downwards forwards \Bcdf), on the energetic utter- 
 ance of each of the elements of speech. 
 
 2. Clinch the hands, then retract one arm, and project the other, 
 alternately, horizontal forwards, on each of the elements. 
 
 3. Clinch the hands, and make a beat, horizontal forwards, on 
 the first element ; strike the palms of the hands together on the 
 second; with the hands clinched, make a beat horizontal forwards 
 on the third ; strike the palms of the hands together on the fourth ; 
 and so on. 
 
 4. Beat time on the elements with the dumb-bells. Make the 
 first beat by bringing the bells in contact, horizontal forwards ; the 
 second, by bringing them in contact elevated forwards ; the third, 
 by bringing them in contact downwards forwards ; the fourth, by 
 bringing them in contact downwards backwards, thus : — 
 
 Diag. 40. 
 
 METHOD OF BEATING TIME WITH THE DUMB-BELLS.* 
 
 a &c. 
 
 *Dumb-bells are commonly made of lead. Those 
 used in the author's Vocal Gymnasium are turned 
 out of lignum vitae. They are one foot long, and 
 rbur inches in diameter. (See the cuts in the 
 margin.)

 5. Mark the time by marching. The class should marcn, in rile, 
 on a line, in the form of the figure eight (8), and pronounce, after 
 ihe teacher, an element at every step. Should the class be large, 
 two columns may be formed, which should march in opposite direc- 
 tions. Meanwhile, two, or more pupils, standing out from the class, 
 may keep time with the dumb-bells. 
 
 SYLLABLE RHYTHM. 
 
 6. When the pupil cannot mark the rhythm of poetry, he should 
 first beat time on every syllable, in either, or in all, of the ways 
 which have been described.

 POETRY RHYTHM. 
 
 7. The rhythm of poetry should be marked by a beat on the ac- 
 cented part of the measure, which, in the following examples, is the 
 first syllable after each vertical bar. 
 
 Lines supposed to have been written by Alexander Sel- 
 kirk, during his solitary abode on ihe Island of Juan 
 Fernandez.

 8. Accompany the pronunciation of the elements with gesture. 
 In the following series of figures, there are two periods of gesture. 
 The first gesture should be made during the pronunciation of the 
 four sounds of a; the second, during the pronunciation of the two 
 sounds of e; and so on. The whole of the Second Exercise (p. 
 168), should be practised in this way. The stroke of the gesture 
 should be made on the last element in each group.

 FIFTEENTH EXERCISE. 
 
 PRONUNCIATION. 
 
 The article a should have the sound oi u in an, thus — He waa 
 & man ; not k man. When, however, this article is emphatic 
 (which is seldom the case), it should have the sound of a in ale, 
 thus — Did you say a man, or the man! 
 
 When the article the precedes a word beginning with a vowel, it 
 should be pronounced the ; when it precedes a word beginning' with 
 a consonant, it should be pronounced the, thus — The arts and the 
 sciences. But, when the precedes a word beginning with a conso- 
 nant, and is emphatic, it should be pronounced the, thus — Did you 
 say a man or the man 1 
 
 The pronoun my, when emphatic, is pronounced ml ; when not 
 emphatic, it is generally pronounced me. Sometimes the perspi- 
 cuity of a sentence requires my to be pronounced ml, when this 
 pronoun is not emphatic, as in the following example: 
 "And the pale stars shall be at night, 
 The only eyes that watch my rite." 
 
 Should my, in the above example, be pronounced me, by a public 
 speaker, the auditors might suppose the meaning of the passage to 
 be as follows : 
 
 And the pale stars shall be at night, 
 The only eyes that watch me right. 
 
 Euphony sometimes requires my, when not emphatic, to be pro- 
 nounced ml. The following passages are examples: 
 
 " My brave associates." " Hear me for my cause." " When it 
 shall please my country to need my death." 
 
 Mine should always be pronounced mine, not mean; by should 
 always be pronounced bl, not bee; to should be pronounced t6, not 
 tu ; of should be pronounced 6v, not uv ; and from should be pro- 
 nounced fr6m, not frum. 
 
 The pronunciation of many other words, liable to be pronounced 
 wrong, is given in the foot-notes under the Exercises in Reading 
 and Declamation. 
 
 SIXTEENTH EXERCISE. 
 
 DECLAMATION. 
 
 Before the student attempts to declaim, he should learn to stand 
 erect; to hold his book in a proper manner, and to read correctly. 
 He should then select some short piece, and learn a set of gestures 
 for its illustration by practising them in pantomime, after the 
 teacher. Lastly, he should learn to combine the words and ges 
 tures, by repeating them together, after the teacher.

EXPLANATION 
 
 OP THE CHARACTERS USED IN THE EXERCISES IN READING 
 AND DECLAMATION. 
 
 ( | ) A vertical bar, employed to divide each paragraph into sec- 
 tions of a convenient length for concert reading. [See the Pre- 
 face.] 
 
 ( i ) A separation mark. It signifies that the words between 
 which it is placed, should not coalesce. 
 
 (n) A rest. Where this character is employed there should be 
 a slight suspension of the voice. 
 
 (-) A hold. The vowels over which this character is placed, 
 should have an unusual prolongation. 
 
 (o) A pause, called also a suspending pause. When placed over 
 a rest, it signifies that this rest should have two or three times its 
 usual length. It is called a suspending pause, because it keeps 
 the mind of the hearer in suspense. [See an example on page 221, 
 seventh line from the bottom.] 
 
 ( M / \ ' * ' ) Acute and grave accents. They are employed to 
 represent the rising and falling inflections, and also the emphasis 
 melodies. [See page 48 and 54.] 
 
 (a) Acuto-grave accent, or acuto-grave circumflex. [See p. 48.] 
 
 (") Gravo-acute accent, or gravo-acute circumflex. [See p. 48.] 
 
 (ir) Irony. The passage to which these letters are prefixed, is 
 ironical. 
 
 (rp) Reproach. When these letters are prefixed to a passage, 
 it contains the language of reproach. 
 
 (wh) Whisper. The passage to which these letters are prefixed, 
 should be whispered. 
 
 (1, 2, 3, 4) These numbers represent the degrees of modulation. 
 [See p. 57.] 
 
 The italic letters represent sounds which are liable to be omitted, 
 or imperfectly articulated. When all the letters in a word are 
 italic, the word is emphatic. The emphatic words, however, are 
 seldom, in this work, marked by italic letters. 
 
 In designating the pronunciation of words, in the foot-notes, I 
 have used the letters which, on page 19, and 20, represent the ele- 
 ments of the English language. No superfluous letters are em- 
 ployed, as is done by lexicographers. The pronunciation of each 
 word is determined by the letters which represent the sounds of 
 which it is composed, and by the situation of the accent.

 (LORD CHATHAM.) 
 
 I can^no/, my lords, | I will' not | join in congratula- 
 tion | on misfortune and disgrace^ | This, my lords, | is 
 a perilous, and tremendous moment ; | it is not a time 
 for adula'tion : | the smoothness of flattery cannot save 
 us | in this rugged and aw v ful crisis. | It is now neces- 
 sary j to instruct the throne in the language of truths | 
 We musf, if possible, | dispel the delusion, and darkness 
 which envelope it ; | and display in its full danger, and 
 genuine colours, | the ruin which is brought to our 
 doorsv. j 
 
 Can ministers still presume to expect support in their 
 infatua'tion ? | Can parliament be so dead to its dig- 
 nity, and duty, | as to give its support to measures thus 
 obtruded, and forced' upon it ? | measures, my lords, | 
 which have reduced this late flourishing empire | to 
 scorn, and contempt \ Bu£ yesterday, | and England 
 might have stood against the world'; | now, none so poor 
 is to do Aer reverence ! | 
 
 * Mr. Pitt delivered this speech in opposition to Lord Snfibik, 
 who proposed in Parliament to employ the Indians against the 
 Americans; and who had said, in the course of the debate, that they 
 had a right to use all the means, that God and Nature had put into 
 their hands, to conquer America.

 The people whom we at first despised as rebels, | but 
 whom we now acknowledge as enemies, | are abetted 
 against us, j supplied with every military store*, ] their 
 interest consulted, j and their ambassadors entertained ]

 dare' no* | interpose with dignity, or effect | 
 
 The desperate state of our army abroad, | is, in par/,

 the English troops than L do : | I know their virtues, 
 and their valor ; j I know they can achieve any thing 
 but impossibilities ; | and I know thai the conquest of 
 English America, j is v an impossibility : | you cannot, my 
 lords, | you cannot, conquer America, j 
 
 What is your present situation there .' | We do not 
 know the worst ; | but we know ] tha£ in three cam- 
 paigns | we have done nothing, and suffered mucbu. J 
 You may swell every expense 1 , | accumulate every as- 
 sistance, | and extend your traffic to the shambles of 
 every German des v po£, | yet your attempts will be for 
 ever vain and im potent ; j doubly so indeed | from this 
 mercenary aid on which you relyv ; | for it irritates, to 
 an incurable resen^men/, | the minds of your adversa- 
 ries, | to overrun them with the mercenary sons of ra- 
 pine, and plunder, devoting them, and their possessions, ( 
 to the rapacity of hireling cruelty. | If I were an 
 American, ! as I am an Englishman, | while a foreign

 the disgraces, and mischiefs of the war, j has dared to 
 authorize, and associate to our arms | the tomahaw/f, 
 and scalping-knife of the sa\ n age — | to call into civil- 
 ized alliance, j the wild, and inhuman inhabitant of the 
 woods' — | to delegate to the merciless Xn v dian | the

 of his' barbarous war j against our brethren? | My

 Bui, my lords, | this barbarous measure has been de- 
 fended, | noi only on the principles of policy, and neces- 
 sity, | but also on those of morality ; | " for it is per- 
 fectly allowable," | says Lord Suffolk, | " to use all the 
 means j thai God, and nature -have pui into our hands." j 
 I am astonished, | 1 am shocker/', | to hear such princi- 
 ples confessed ; | to hear them avowee? in this house', | 
 or in this couirtry ! j 
 
 My lords, | I did noi intend to encroach so much on 
 your attention ; j but I cannot repress my indignation : I 
 I feel myself impelled' to speak. | My lords, | we are 
 called upon as members of this houses | as men', | as 
 Christians, | to protest against such horrible barbar- 
 ity — | " Thai God, and nature have put into our 
 hands v !" | What ideas of Goof, and nature | thai noble 
 lord may entertain, | I know^ not ; \ but I know | thai 
 such detestable principles | are equally abhorreni to 
 religion, and humanity. | 
 
 Whai* / | to attribute the sacred sanction of God, and 
 nature, | to the massacres of the Indian scal'ping-knife ! | 
 to the cannibal savage, | torturing, | murdering, | and 
 devouring his unhappy vic'tims ! | Such notions shock 
 every precepi of moral ity, | every feeling of human ity, | 
 every sentimeni of homor. | These abominable prin- 
 ciples, | and this more abominable avowal of them, | 
 demand the mosi decisive indignation. | 
 
 I call upon thai righi reverend, j and this mosi learn- 
 ed bench, | to vindicaie the religion of their God,", | to 
 suppori the justice of their country. | I call upon the 
 bishops | to interpose the unsullied sanctity of their

 the honor of your lordships | to reverence the dignity

 HYDER ALL 
 [Extract i'rom Mr. Burke's Speech on the Nabob of Arcot's D^bts.] 
 
 Among the victims to this magnificent plan of uni- 
 versal plunder, J pursued by the company in India, | so 
 worthy of the heroic avarice of the projectors, | you 
 have all heart/ ! (and he has made Aimself to be well 
 remembered) | of an Indian Chief, called Hyder Ali 
 Khan. | This man possessed the western, ] as the com- 
 pany under the Nabofr of Arcoi, | does the east'ern 
 division of the Carnatic* I It was among the leading 
 measures in the design of this cabal I (according to their 
 own emphatic language) | to extir pate this Hyder Ali. | 
 They declared the Nabob of Arcoi to be his sovereign, | 
 and himself to be a rebel, I and publicly invested their 
 instrument | w T ith the sovereignty of the kingdom of 
 Mysore. | Bui their victim was not of the passive 
 kind: | they were soon obliged I to conclude a treaty of 
 peace, and close alliance with this rebel, j at the gates 
 of Madras. | 
 
 Both before, and since' that treaty, | every principle 
 of policy I pointed out this power as a natural allrance; | 
 and, on his pari, | it was courted by every sort of ami- 
 
 * "The Carnatic is that portion of southern India which runs 
 along 1 the coast of Coromandel. Its length is 500 miles, and its 
 breadth from 50 to 100, and it belongs to the East India Company. 
 Hyder Ali and the Nabob of Arcot were neighboring princes, — 
 but the Nabob held his power from the Company. Toe Company 
 lent themselves to the Nabob's schemes of ambition, the object of 
 which was (as usual), to enlarge his own dominion at the expense 
 of that of Hvder Ali." a Plant eyes ; not plantize.

 cable office. | Bui the cabinet council of English cred- 
 itors j would not suffer their Nabob of Arcot to sign* 
 the treaty, | nor even to give to a prince 1 , | at leas? /.'is 
 ea^ial, | the ordinary titles of respect, and courtesy. I 
 From that time forward, j a continued plot' was car- 
 ried on within the divan, ] blac&, and whites I of the 
 Nabob of Arcoi', | for the destruction of this Hyder Ali. | 
 As to the outward members of the double, j or rather 
 treble government of Madras, | which had signed the 
 treaty, | they were always prevented by some over- 
 ruling influence I (which they do not describe, | but 
 which cannot be misunderstood) I from performing whaZ 
 justice, ant? interest | combined so evidently to enforce. | 
 
 When at length Hyder Ali | found that he had to 
 do with men | who either would sign no convention, | 
 or whom no treaty, and no signature could bind ( , | and 
 who were the determined enemies of human intercourse 
 itself, | he decreed to make the country I possessed by 
 these incorrigible, and predestinated criminals, | a me- 
 morable example to mankind. | He resolved, | in the 
 gloomy recesses of a mind, capacious of such things, ) 
 to leave the whole Carnatic I an everlasting monument 
 of vengeance, | and to put perpetual desolation, | as a 
 barrier between him, and those | against whom, I the 
 faith which holds the moral elements of the world to- 
 gether, | was no protection. | 
 
 He became at length I so confident of 7ms force, I and 
 so collected in his mighi, j thai he made no secret what- 
 ever | of his dreadful resolution. I Having terminated 
 //is disputes with every enemy, and every rival, I who 
 buried their mutual animosities | in their common in- 
 terest againsi the creditors of the Nabob of Arcoi, j he 
 drew from every quarter, | whatever a savage ferocity | 
 could add v to his new rudiments in the art of destruc- 
 tion ; | and, compounding ail the materials of fu'ry, 
 havoc, and desola'tion, I into one blacA- cloud, | he hung 
 for a while on the declivities of the mountains. | Whilst 
 the authors of all these evils, | were idly, and stupidly

 gazing on this menacing meteor | (which blackened all 
 the horizon) | it suddenly burs^, | and poured down the 
 whole of its contents i upon the plains of the Carnatic. ) 
 
 Then ensued a scene of wo ( ; I the like of which no 
 eye had seen, | nor heart conceived*, I and which no 
 tongue can adequately tell. | All the horrors of war, 
 before known, or heard* of, | were mercy to tha* new 
 havoc. | A storm of universal fire', I blasted every 
 fields I consumed every house/ | and destroyed every 
 teimple. | The miserable inhabitants, I flying from their 
 flaming villages, | in part, were slaughtered ; j others, | 
 without regard to sex', to age', to rank', or sacredness 
 of function — | fathers torn from their chifdren, | hus- 
 bands, from wives 1 , I enveloped in a whirlwind of cav'- 
 alry, | and amidst the goading spears of dri'vers, | and 
 the trampling of pursuing horses, I were swep£ into 
 captivity I in an unknown, and hostile land. I Those 
 who were able to evade this tempest, | fled to the walled 
 cities ; I but escaping from fire', sword', and exile, | they 
 fell into the jaws of famine. I 
 
 For eighteen months', I without intermission, | this 
 destruction raged from the gates of Madras I to the 
 gates of Tanjorex ; I and so completely did these mas- 
 ters in their art, | Hyder Ali, and his more ferocious 
 son, | absolve themselves of their impious vow, I tlmt, 
 when the British armies traversed, as they did, | the 
 Carnatic for hundreds of miles in all directions, | through 
 the whole line of their march, | they did not see one 
 mam, i not one woman*, | not one child , | not one four- 
 footed beast' I of any description whatever. | One dead, 
 uniform silence M | reigned over the whole region. |

 long been wished for, | towards allaying the envy youi 
 order has been subject to, ! and removing the imputa- 
 tions against trials, | is effectually put into your power, j 
 An opinion has long prevailed, 1 not only here at home, j

 tions, ! men of wealth are always safe', | however clearly

 There is now to be brought upon his trial, before 
 you, | to the confusion, I hope, I of the propagators of 
 this slanderous imputation, I one whose life, and ac- 
 tions i condemn him in the opinion of all impartial per- 
 sons ; | but who, according to his own reckoning, | and 
 declared dependence upon his riches, I is already ac- 
 quitted : I I mean Caius Verres. I 
 
 I demand justice of you, Fathers, | upon the robber 
 of the public treasvury, I the oppressor of Asia Minor, 
 and Pamphyhia, I the invader of the rights, and privi- 
 leges of Ro'mans, | the scourge, and curse of Sicily, j

 If that sentence is passed upon him, | which his crimes 
 deserve, I your authority, Fathers, | will be venerable, 
 and sa*cred in the eyes of the public ; | but, if his great 
 riches should bias you in his favor, ] I shall still gain 
 one* point, — | to make it apparent to all the world, | 
 that what was wanting in this case, | was not a crimi- 
 nal, | nor a prosecutor; | but justice, and adequate 
 punishment. | 
 
 To pass over the shameful irregularities of his youth, | 
 what does his ques'torship, I the first public employ- 
 ment he held, | what does it exhibit, I but one continued 
 scene of viHanies 1 | Cneius Carbo, I plundered of the 
 public money by his own treasurer, I a consul stripped, 
 and betrayed', | an army, deserted, and reduced to 
 want, | a province, robbed', | the civil, and religious 
 rights of a people vrolated. | 
 
 The employment he held in Asia Minor, and Pam- 
 phyfia, — I what did it produce but the ruin of those 
 countries, | in which houses, cities, and tern pies were 
 robbed* by him ? | What was his conduct in his pre x - 
 torship here at home ? | Let the plundered temples, 
 and public works neglected, | that he might embezzle 
 the money intended for carrying them on', I bear wit- 
 ness. | How did he discharge the office of a judge* ? | 
 Let those who suffered by his injustice, answer. | 
 
 But his pretorship in Srcily, | crowns all' his works 
 of wickedness, I and finishes a lasting monument to his 
 infamy. | The mischiefs, done by him in that unhappy 
 country, I during the three years of his iniquitous ad- 
 ministration, | are such, that many years*, I under the 
 wisest, and best' of pretors, | will not be sufficient to 
 restore things I to the condition in which he found 
 them; I for it is notorious,'! that, during the time of his 
 tyranny, | the Sicilians neither enjoyed the protection 
 of their own original laws ; I of the regulations made 
 for their benefit by the Roman senate, I upon theii 
 coming under the protection of the commonwealth ; j 
 nor of the natural, and unalienable rights of men. •

 trary taxes, and unheard-of impositions, j extorted from 
 the industrious poor, | are not to be computed. | The 
 most faithful allies of the commonwealth, 1 have been 
 treated as enemies. | Roman citizens, like slaves', 
 have been put to death with tortures. | The most 
 atrocious criminals I have been exempted, for money, | 
 from deserved punishments ; i and men, of the most 
 unexceptionable characters, | condemned, and banished, 
 unheard. | 
 
 The harbours, though sufficiently fortified, | and the 
 gates of strong towns', I have been opened to pirates, 
 and ravagers. | The soldiery, and sailors, | belonging 
 to a province under the protection of the commonwealth,! 
 have been starved to death* ; | whole fleets^, | to the 
 great detriment of the prov'ince, | suffered to perish. | 
 The ancient monuments i of either Sicilian, or Roman 
 greatness, I the statues of heroes, and princes, | have 
 been carried off 4 ; | and the temples stripped of the 
 images. | 
 
 Having, by his iniquitous sentences, | filled the 
 prisons with the most industrious, and deserving of the 
 people, | he then proceeded to order numbers of Roman 
 citizens j to be strangled in the jails* ; I so that the excla- 
 mation, | " I am a citizen of Rome v !" I which has often, 
 
 in the most distant regions, | and among the most bar- 
 es ' ' o 
 
 barous people, j been a protection, I was of no service 
 to them ; | but, on the contrary, \ brought a speedier, 
 and more severe punishment upon them. I 
 
 I ask now, Verres, I what thou hast to advance 
 against this charge? | Wilt thou pretend to deny' it?| 
 Wilt thou pretend that any thing false\ | that even any 
 thing aggravated, I has been urged against thee? I Had 
 an} princes ' or any state', i committed the same out- 
 rage against the privilege of Roman citizens, | should 
 we not think we had sufficient ground for demanding

 What punishment ought, then, to be inflicted \ upon 
 a tyrannical, and wicked pretor, I who dared, at no 
 greater distance than Si cily, j within sight of the Italian 
 coast', | to put to the infamous death of crucifixion, | 
 that unfortunate, and innocent citizen, i Publius Gavins 
 Cosanus, j only for his having asserted his privilege of 
 citizenship, I and declared his intention of appealing to 
 the justice of his country, j against the cruel oppressor | 
 who had unjustly confined him in prison at Syracuse, j 
 whence he had just made his escape? | 
 
 The unhappy man, | arrested as he was going to em- 
 bark for his native country, | is brought before the 
 wicked pretor. | With eyes darting fury, I and a coun- 
 tenance distorted with cruelty, I he orders the helpless 
 victim of his rage to be stripped^, | and rods' to be 
 brought — | accusing him, j but without the least sha- 
 dow of evidence, I or even of suspicion, j of having come 
 to Sicily as a spy. | It was in vain that the unhappy 
 man cried out, | " I am a Roman citizen — | I have 
 served under Lucius Pre'tius I who is now at Panor- 
 mus, | and will attest my innocence." 
 
 The blood-thirsty pretor, I deaf to all he could urge 
 in his own defence, I ordered the infamous punishment 
 to be inflicted. I Thus, Fathers, I was an innocent Ro- 
 man citizen I publicly mangled with scourging; \ while 
 the only words he uttered, | amidst his cruel sufferings, 
 were, | "I am a Roman citizen !" I With these , he 
 hoped to defend himself I from violence, and infamy. | 
 But of so little service was this privilege to him, | that, 
 while he was thus asserting his citizenship, I the order 
 was given for his execu tion, — | for his execution upon 
 the cross* ! | 
 
 O liberty ! — I O sound once delightful to every Ro 
 man ear ! j O sacred privilege of Roman citizen- 
 ship ! — | once' sacred ! — | now tranrpled upon ! — j

 Friends', Romans,, countrymen! I lend me your ears. 
 I come to bu ry Caesar, I not to praise* him. | 
 The evil that men do, I lives after them : | 
 The good \ is oft interred with their bones. : | 
 So let it be with Caesar. I The noble Brutus 
 Hath told you, | Caesar was ambitious. | 
 If it were so, j it was a grievous fault" ; | 
 And grievously hath Caesar amsw T er'd it. | 
 Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest, I 
 (For Brutus is an honorable man ; | 
 So are they all, I all honorable men) | 
 Come I | to spea& in Caesar's funeral. | 
 
 He was my friend, I faithful, and jus^ to me | 
 
 But Brutus , says, he was ambitious ; | 
 
 And Brutus is an homorable man. | 
 
 He hath brought many cap'tives home to Rome, | 
 
 Whose ransoms did the gen era] coffers fill : | 
 
 Did this in Caesar seem ambi'tious? | 
 
 When that the poor have cried, I Caesar hath wept, j 
 
 Ambition should be made of sterner stuff*. | 
 
 Yet Brutus says, he was x ambitious ; | 
 
 And Brutus is an honorable man. | 
 
 You all did see I that, on the Lupercal, a ] 
 
 I thrice presented Aim a kingly crown', | 
 
 Which he did thrice refuse. I Was this v ambition ? ■ 
 
 Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious ; J 
 
 And Brutus is an honorable man. | 
 
 I speak not to disprove wha£ Brutus spoke ; | 
 
 Bu£ here I am to speaA; what I do know. | 
 
 You all did love him once, I not without cause*, |

 against a painful truth, ! and listen to the song of thai 
 syren 1 till she transforms us into beasts. I Is this the 
 part of wise men, I engaged in a grea£, and arduous 
 struggle for liberty? I Are we disposed to be of the

 ears, hear not I the things which so nearly concern their 
 temporal salva'tion? | For my part, I whatever an-

 for i*. | 
 
 I have hut one lamp by which my N feet are guided ; j 
 and that is the lamp of experience, j I know of no way 
 of judging of the future, | but by the past' ; | and, judg- 
 ing by the past, | I wish to know | what there has been 
 in the conduct of the British ministry j for the last ten 
 years' | to justify those hopes | with which gentlemen 
 have been pleased to solace themselves, and the housed j 
 Is it thai insidious smile | with which our petition has 
 been lately received' ? | Trust it not", sir — ■ | it will 
 prove a snare to your fee^ ; j suffer not yourselves to be 
 betrayed with a kiss. | 
 
 Ask yourselves | how this gracious reception of our 
 petition, | comports with those warlike preparations | 
 which cover our waters, | and darken our land. \ Are 
 fleets, and armies I necessary to a worA; of love, and 
 reconcilia'tion ? I Have we shown ourselves so unwil- 
 ling to he reconciled, | that force must be called in | to 
 win hack our love' ? | Lei us not deceive* ourselves, 
 sir : | these are the implements of war, ! and subjuga- 
 tion — | the last arguments I to which kings resort. |

 cism | nothing to which it corresponds, | droops, ana 
 languishes. | In a world which presents a fair spec- 
 tacle a of order, ana 7 beauty, I of a vast family, nourished, 
 ana 7 supported by an Almighty Parent — j in a world 
 which leads the devout mind, step by step, | to the con- 
 templation of the firs^ fair, and the firs* good, I the scep- 
 tic is encompassed with nothing hut obscurity, mean- 
 ness, and disorder. | 
 
 When we reflect on the manner in which the idea 
 of Deity is formed, | we must be convinced ) tha* such 
 an idea intimately present to the mind, | must have a 
 most powerful effect | in refining the moral taste. | Com- 
 posed of the richest elements, b |it embraces in the char- 
 acter of a beneficent Parent, | and Almighty Ruler, | 
 whatever is venerable in wisdom, I whatever is awful 
 in author ity, I whatever is touching in goodness. | 
 
 Human excellence is blended with many imperfec- 
 tions, | and seen under many limitations, j It is beheld 
 only in detached, and separate portions, I nor ever ap- 
 pears in any one character, whole, and entire. | So 
 that, when, in imitation of the Stoics, | we wish to form 
 out of these fragments, | the notion of a perfectly wise, 
 and good man, | we know it is a mere fiction of the 
 mind', I without any real being in w r hom it is embodied, 
 and realized. I In the belief of a Deity, | these concep- 
 tions are reduced to reahity — | the scattered rays of 
 an ideal excellence, are concentrated, | and become the 
 real attributes of thai Being \ w r ith whom we stand in 
 the nearest relation — | who sits supreme at the head 
 of the universe, 1 is armed w r ith infinite pow er, I and 
 pervades all nature with his presence. I 
 
 The efficacy of these sentiments, | in producing, and 
 augmenting a virtuous taste, I will indeed be propor- 
 tioned to the vividness w T ith which they are formed^, :

 nature I mechanically obey^ /zim; I and stand ready to 
 execute his commands without hesitation. | Man alone 
 is found refractory : | he is the only being, | endued 
 with a power of contradicting these mandates. | The 
 Deity was pleased to exert superior power I in creating 
 him a superior baling ; | a being endued with a choice 
 of good, and e N vil ; I and capable, in some measure, | of 
 co-operating with Ms own intentions. | Man, there- 
 fore, I may be considered as a limited creature, | en- 
 dued with powers, I imitative of those residing in the 
 Deity. I He is thrown into a world thai stands in need 
 of his help x ; I and he has been granted a power I of pro- 
 ducing harmony from partial confusion. | 
 
 If, therefore, we consider the earth | as allotted for

 ample reasons for our gratitude, | and many for our in- 
 dustry. | In those great outlines of nature, I to which 
 ari eannoi reach, I and where our greatest efforts must 
 nave been ineffectual, | God himself has finished every 
 thing I with amazing grandeur, and beauty. I Our 
 beneficent Father \ has considered these parts of nature 
 as peculiarly /?is owm ; I as parts which no creature 
 could have skill, or strength to amend^ ; I and he has, 
 therefore, made them incapable of alteration, I or of 
 more perfect regularity. | The heavens, and the firma- 
 ment | show the wisdom, and the glory of the Work- 
 man. | Astronomers, who are best skilled in the sym- 
 metry of systems, | can find nothing there thai they can 
 alter for the better. | God made these perfeci, I be- 
 cause no subordinate being | could correci their defecis. 
 
 When, therefore, | we survey nature on this side, | 
 nothing can be more splendid, more correci, or amaz- 
 ing. | We there behold a Deity | residing in the midsi 
 of a universe, I infinitely extended everyway, ! animat- 
 ing all, I and cheering the vacuity with his presence .

 THE JOURNEY OF A DAY, A PICTURE OF HUMAN LIFE. 
 
 (DR. JOHNSON.) 
 
 Obidah, the son of Abensina, I left the caravansera 
 early in the morning, | and pursued /ns journey through 
 the plains of Indostan.v | He was fresh, mid vigorous 
 with res£* ; I he was animated with hope' ; | he was in- 
 cited by desire x ; | he walked swiftly forward over the 
 va'lleys, | and saw the hills gradually rising before* Aim. | 
 
 As he passed along, I his ears were delighted with 
 the morning song of the bird of par*adise ; 1 he was 
 fanned by the last flutters of the sinking breeze x , | and 
 sprinkled with dew from groves of spices. I He some- 
 times contemplated the towering height of the oa/r, | 
 monarc/i of the hills* ; | and sometimes caught the gentle 
 fragrance of the prinrrose, I eldest daughter of the 
 spring* : I all his senses were gratified, | and all care 
 was banished from his heart . | 
 
 Thus he went on, I till the sun approached his me- 
 ridian, | and the increased heat preyed upon his 
 strength* ; | he then looked round abou^ /lira I for some 
 more commodious path. | He saw, on his right hand, 
 a grove x I that seemed to wave its shades as a sign of 
 invita*tion ; I he entered it, I and found the coolness, and 
 verdure irresistibly pleasant. | 
 
 He did not, however, | forged whither he was travel- 
 ling^ | but found a narrow way, bordered with flowers, ]

 main road ; I and was pleased, | thai by this happy 
 experiment, | he had found means to unite pleasure with 
 bu v siness, a j and to gain the rewards of diligence I with- 
 out suffering its fatigues. J 
 
 He, therefore, still continued to walk for a time, | 
 without the leasi remission of his ardor, | except thai 
 he was sometimes tempted to stop | by the music of the 
 birds | which the heai had assembled in the shade* ; | 
 and sometimes amused /nmself | w T ith plucking the 
 flowers | thai covered the banks on either side*, | or the 
 fruii that hung upon the branches. | 
 
 At lasi, the green path began to decline from its flrsi 
 tendency, I and to wind among hills, and thickets, j 
 cooled with fountains, and murmuring with waterfalls. J 
 Here Obidah paused* for a time,, I and began to con- 
 sider | whether it w T ere longer safe | to forsake the known, 
 and common track* ; I bui remembering thai the heai 
 was now in its greatest violence, I and that the plain 
 was dusty, and uneven, | he resolved to pursue the new 4 
 path | which he supposed only to make a few meanders, | 
 in compliance w<ith the varieties of the ground, | and to 
 end at last in the common road. | 
 
 Having thus calmed his solicitude, I he renewed fas 
 pace v , | though he suspected thai he was noi gaining 
 ground. I This uneasiness of Ais mind, I inclined him 
 to lay hold on every new objeci, | and give way to 
 every sensation i thai mighi soothe, or diveri him. | He 
 listened to every £ch N o; I he mounted every hill for a 
 fresh pros peci ; \ he turned aside to every cascade* ; j 
 and pleased himself | with tracing the course of a gentle 
 riv er | thai rolled among the trees, I and watered a 
 large region I with innumerable circumvolutions. | 
 
 In these amusements, ! the hours passed away unac- 
 counted ; | his deviations had perplexed Ais menrory, | 
 and he knew noi towards whai poini to trav el. | He

 tured with uncertainty, | the sky was overspread with

 He now resolved to do wha£ jet remained in Ais 
 power, | to tread bacA the ground which Ae had passed, |

 open into the plain. | He prostrated Aimself on the 
 ground, | and recommended Ais life to the Lord of Na- 
 ture. | He rose with confidence, and tranquillity, | and 
 pressed on with resolution. | The beasts of the desert 
 were in motion, I and on every hand I were heard the 
 mingled howls of rage', and fear', — | and ravage, and 
 expiration. | All the horrors of darkness, and solitude, 
 surrounded Aim : | the winds roared in the woods, 1 and 
 the torrents tumbled from the hills, j 
 
 Thus forlorn, and distressed, | he wandered through 
 the wild, | without knowing whither Ae was go*ing, | or 
 whether Ae was every moment I drawing nearer to 
 safety, or to destruction. | At length, not fear, I but

 short, and Ais knees trerabled ; | and Ae was on the

 REPLY TO WALPOLE. 
 (PITT.*) 
 
 The atrocious crime of being a young man, | which 
 the honorable gentleman has, | with such spiri* and 
 decency, charged upon me, I I shall neither attemp* to 
 palliate, nor deny*; | bu* conten* myself with wishing | 
 tha* I may be one of those | whose follies cease with 
 their youtlr, ) and no* of tha* number ) who are igno- 
 ran* in spi*e of experience. | 
 
 Whether youth can be imputed to a x ny man as a 
 reproach, I I will no* assume the province of determin- 
 ing: | bu* surely age may become justly contemptible, | 
 if the opportunities which it brings | have passed away 
 without improvement, | and vice appears to prevail | 
 when the passions have subsided. 1 
 
 * This illustrious father of English Oratory, having expressed 
 himself, in the House of Commons, with his accustomed energy, in 
 opposition to one of the measures then in agitation, his speech pro- 
 duced an answer from Mr. Walpole, who, in the course of it, said, 
 " Formidable sounds, and furious declamation, confident assertions, 
 and lofty periods, may affect the young and inexperienced ; and, 
 perhaps, the honorable gentleman may have contracted his habits 
 of oratory by conversing more with those of his own age, than with 
 such as have had more opportunities of acquiring knowledge, and 
 more successful methods of communicating their sentiments." And 
 he made use of some expressions, such as vehemence of gesture, 
 theatrical emotion, &c., applying them to Mr. Pitt's manner of 
 speaking. As soon as Mr. Walpole sat down, Mr. Pitt got up 
 and replied as above.

 The wretch who, after having seen the consequences

 whose age has only added obstinacy to stupidity, | is 
 surely the object of either abhorrence or contempt*, i

 Much more is he to be abhorred, | who, as he has

 But youth is noi my only crime. I I have been

 We claim attentions to which we are not entitled. \ 
 We are rigorous to offences, i as if we had never offend- 
 ed ; | unfeeling to distress, | as if we knew not what it 
 was to suffer. I From those airy regions of pride and 
 folly, | let us descend to our proper level. I Let us 
 survey the natural equality | on which Providence has 
 placed man with man, | and reflect on the infirmities 
 common to all. I If the reflection on natural equality

 manity, i let us at leasZ remember wha£ we are in the 
 sight of our Creator. I Have we none of that forbear- 
 ance to give one another, | which we all so earnestly

 centives to violence and contention. I In the ruffled

 bittered an enemy ; I we have sown the seeds of future

 our violence for a moment, I when causes of discord 
 occur. I Let us anticipate tha£ period of coolness, | 
 which, of itself, will soon arrive. | Let us reflect how

 tention; I hut how much of the true happiness of life (

 positaries, I and are to render an account at the lasi. 
 Thai portion of ii which he has allotted to us, | is in- 
 tended partly for the concerns of this world, | partly 
 for those of the nexi. | Let each of these occupy, | in

 perly belongs to it. 1 Lei not the hours of hospitality 
 and pleasure, I interfere with the discharge of our neces- 
 sary affairs ; ! and let not whai we call necessary affairs, j 
 encroach upon the time which is due to devotion. | To 
 every thing there is a season, | and a time for every 
 purpose under heaven. I If we delay till to-morrow, 
 whai ought to be done to-day, | we overcharge the 
 morrow with a burden which belongs not to it. | We 
 load the wheels of time, I and prevent them from carry- 
 ing us along smoothly. I He who every morning plans 
 the transactions of the day, ! and follows out thai plan, | 
 carries on a thread | which will guide him through the 
 labyrinth of the mosi busy life. | The orderly arrange- 
 ment of his time is Me a ray of lighi, I which darts 
 itself through all his affairs. I Bui, where no plan is 
 laid, | where the disposal of time I is surrendered mere- 
 ly to the chance of incidents, | all things lie huddled 
 together in one chaos, | which admits neither of distri- 
 bution nor review. |

 INDUSTRY NECESSARY TO THE ATTAINMENT OF 
 ELOQUENCE. 
 
 (ware.) 
 
 The history of the world is full of testimony | to 
 prove how much depends upon industry; I not an emi- 
 nent orator has lived hut is an example of it. I Yet, 
 in contradiction to all this, | the almost universal feel- 
 ing appears to be, | thai industry can effect nothing, 
 thai eminence is the resuli of accideni, I and thai every 
 one musi be conteni I to remain jusi whai he may hap- 
 pen to be. | Thus multitudes, who come forward as 
 teachers and guides, I suffer themselves to be satisfied 
 with the mosi mdiffereni attainmenis, I and a miserable 
 mediocrity, I withoui so much as inquiring how they 
 may rise higher, | much less making any attempi to 
 rise. | 
 
 For any other ari they would have served an ap- 
 prenticeship, | and would be ashamed to practise ii in 
 public before they had learned it. I If any one would 
 sing, | he attends a master, | and is drilled in the very 
 elementary principles ; ! and only after the mosi labori- 
 ous process, I dares to exercise Ais voice in public. | 
 This he does, I though he has scarce any thing to learn 
 bui the mechanical execution I of whai lies in sensible

 If he were learning to play on the flute for public 
 exhibition, I whai hours and days would Ae spend in 
 giving facility to his fingers, I and attaining the power 
 of the sweetesi and mosi expressive execution ! \ Jf he

 LOCHINVAR.* 
 (SCOTT.) 
 
 O, young Lochinvar is come out of the west, ] 
 Through all the wide border his steed was the best ; ' 
 And save his good broadsword, he weapon had none, , 
 He rode all unarm'd, I and he rode all alone. I 
 So faithful in love, I and so dauntless in war, | 
 There never was knight like the young Lochinvar. | 
 
 He staid not for brake, I and he stopped not for stone, | 
 He swam the Eske river | where ford there was none ; j 
 But, ere he alighted at Netherby gate, I 
 The bride had consented, j the gal'lant came late : | 
 For a laggard in love, | and a dastard in war, | 
 Was to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar. | 
 
 So, boldly he entered the Netherby hall, | 
 
 Among bridesmen, and kinsmen, and brothers, and 
 
 all: | 
 Then spoke the bride's father, I his hand on his sword, I 
 (For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word,) ) 
 " O come ye in peace here, j or come ye in war, | 
 Or to dance at our bridal, [ young lord Lochinvar ?" | 
 
 " I long woo'd your daughter, 1 my suit you denied ; ) 
 Love swells like the Sohvay, I but ebbs like its tide ; j I 
 And now am I come, I with this lost love of mine, I 
 To lead but one measure, I drink one cup of wine. I 
 There are maidens in Scotland, I more lovely by far, I 
 That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar." | 
 
 * The ballad of Lochinvar is in a very slight degree founded on 
 a ballad called "Katharine Janfarie," which may be found in the 
 " Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border."'

 So stately his form, I and so lovely her face, I 
 That never a hall such a galliard a did grace: |

 does any man dissemble,* | or seem to be that which 
 he is not, — | but because he thinks it good | to have 
 the qualities he pretends to 1 I Now the best way for 
 a man to seem to be any thing, J is to be in reality 
 what he would seem to be : I besides, — ] it is often as

 as to have it: | and, if a man have it not, \ it is most 
 likely he will be discovered to want it ; I and, then, all 
 his labor to seem to have it, is \ost. | There is some- 
 thing unnatural in painting, | which a skilful eye | will 
 easily discern 6 from native beauty and complexion. | 
 
 Therefore, if any man think it convenient to seem 
 good, | let him be so indeed ; i and then his goodness 
 will appear to every one's satisfaction. ) Particularly, 
 as to the affairs of this world, i integrity hath many 
 advantages I over all the artificial modes of dissimula- 
 tion and deceit. | It is much the plainer and easier, — | 
 much the safer, and more secure way of dealing in the 
 world; | it has less of trouble and difficulty, | of entan- 
 glement and perplexity, | of danger and hazard in it. | 
 
 The arts of deceit and cunning I continually grow 
 weaker, and less serviceable I to those that practise 
 them ; I whereas integrity gains strength by use ; | and 
 the more and longer any man practiseth it I the greater 
 service it does ^im; I by confirming his reputation,!

 repose the greatest confidence in him ; I which is an 
 unspeakable advantage in business | and the affairs of

 But insincerity is very troublesome to manage. I A 
 hypocrite hath so many things to attend to, | as make 
 his life a very perplexed and intricate thing. | A liar

 paper j he conjures them to regard that unity of go- 
 vernment, I which constitutes them one people, j as the 
 very palladium a of their prosperity and safety, | and 
 the security of liberty itself, i He regarded the union 
 of these states, ; not so much one of our blessings, \ as

 Here, in his judgment, j was the great magazine of

 our animating prospec/s, | all our solid hopes for future

 hand, | nor by surrendering them on the other ; hut by 
 an administration of them, J at once firm and moder- 
 ate, | adapted for objects truly national, | and carried 
 on in a spirit of justice and equity. |

 union, 1 at all times manifested by /am, I shows not only 
 the opinion he entertained of its usefulness, | hut his 
 clear perception of those causes | which were likely to 
 spring up to endanger it, | and which, | if once they 
 should overthrow the present system, ! would leave 
 little hope of any future beneficial reunion. |

 forth its inhabitants, I who lined the road and thronged 
 the villages. I In the large towns, I the streets, win- 
 dows, and balconies, | were filled with eager specta- 
 tors, I who rent the air with acclamations. I 
 
 His journey was continually impeded I by the multi- 
 tude I pressing to gain a sigh* of him, I and of the In- 
 dians, I who were regarded with as much admiration •

 impossible to satisfy the craving curiosity which as- 
 sailed /nmseif ana //is attendants, j at every stage, \ 
 with innumerable questions: j popular rumor, as usual, | 
 had exaggerated the truth, and had fillet/ the newly- 
 found country with all kinds of wonders. | 
 
 It was abou* the middle of April, j that Columbus 
 arrived at Barcelona, I where every preparation had 
 been made I to give him. a solemn and magnificent re- 
 ception. | The beauty and serenity of the weather, | 
 in that genial season and favoured climate, I contributed 
 to give splendor to this memorable ceremony. | As 
 he drew near the place, | many of the more youthful 
 courtiers, I and hidal'gos a of gallant bearing, I together 
 with a vasi concourse of the populace, | came forth to 
 mee* and welcome Aim. I 
 
 His entrance into this noble city ! has been compared 
 to one of those triumphs, I which the Romans were ac- 
 customed to decree to conquerors. I First were para- 
 ded the Indians, I painted according to their savage 
 fashion, | and decorated with tropical feathers, I and 
 with their national ornaments of gold ; | after these 
 were borne various kinds of live parrots, | together 
 with stuffed birds and animals of unknown species, | 
 and rare plants, supposed to be of precious qualities : j 
 while great care was taken to ma/ce a conspicuous dis- 
 play of Indian coronets, i bracelets, I and other decora- 
 tions of gold, | which migfa give an idea of the wealth 
 of the newly-discovered regions. | After these follow- 
 ed Columbus, on horseback, I surrounded by a brilliant 
 cavalcade of Spanish chivalry. | 
 
 The streets were almost impassable from the count- 
 less multitude; I the windows and balconies were 
 crowded with the fair; I the very roofs were covered 
 with spectators. | It seemed, as if the public eye could 
 not be sated | with gazing on these trophies of an un«

 known world, | or on the remarkable man by whom it 
 had been discovered. \ There was a sublimity in this 
 event, | thai mingled a solemn feeling with the public 
 joy. | It was looked upon as a vast and signal dispen- 
 sation of Providence, I in reward for the piety of the 
 monarchs ; | and the majestic and venerable appearance 
 of the discoverer, I so different from the youth and 
 buoyancy a | thai are generally expected from roving 
 enterprise, I seemed in harmony with the grandeur and 
 dignity of his achievement I 
 
 To receive Aim with suitable pomjo and distinction, | 
 the sovereigns had ordered their throne to be placed 
 in public, | under a rich canopy of brocade 13 of gold, ) 
 in a vast and splendid saloon. | Here the king and 
 queen awaited Ais arrival, | seated in state with the 
 prince Juan beside them, I and attended by the digni- 
 taries of their couri, j and the principal nobility of 
 Castile, | Valentia, | Catalonia, I and Arragon, I all im- 
 patient to behold the man, I who had conferred so in- 
 calculable a benefit upon the nation. | 
 
 At length Columbus entered the hall, I surrounded 
 by a brilliant crowd of cavaliers, I among whom, says 
 Las Casas, | he was conspicuous for his stately and 
 commanding person, | which, with Ais countenance 
 rendered venerable by his gray hairs, I gave Aim the 
 augusZ appearance of a senator of Rome. | A modest 
 smile lighted up Ais features, | showing that he enjoyed 
 the state and glory in which he came ; | and certainly 
 nothing could be more deeply moving, | to a mind in- 
 flamed by noble ambition, | and conscious of having 
 greatly deserved, | than were these testimonials | of the 
 admiration and gratitude of a nation, | or rather of a 
 world. | 
 
 As Columbus approached, | the sovereigns rose, | as 
 if receiving a person of the highest rank. J Bending 
 /lis knees, | he requested to kiss their hands ; | but there

 was some hesitation on the part of their majesties | to 
 permit this act of vassalage. | Raising him in the 
 mosi gracious manner, | they ordered him to seai Aim- 
 self in their presence ; | a rare honor in this proud 
 and punctilious court. | 
 
 At the request of their majesties, | Columbus now 
 gave an account of the mosi striking events of his voy- 
 age, | and a description of the islands which he had 
 discovered. I He displayed the specimens he had 
 brought | of unknown birds and other animals ; I of rare 
 plants, of medicinal and aromatic virtue ; I of native 
 gold, | in dusi, | in crude masses, | or labored into bar- 
 baric ornaments ; I and, above all, I the natives of these 
 countries, | who were objects of intense and inexhaust- 
 ible interest ; I since there is nothing to man I so curi- 
 ous as the varieties of his own species. I All these he 
 pronounced mere harbingers of greater discoveries I he 
 had yei to make, I which would add realms of incalcu- 
 lable wealth to the dominions of their majesties, | and 
 whole nations of proselytes to the true faith. | 
 
 The words of Columbus I were listened to with pro- 
 found emotion by the sovereigns. | When he had 
 finished, I they sunk on their knees, I and raising their 
 clasped hands to heaven, I their eyes filled with tears 
 of joy and gratitude, I they poured forth thanks and 
 praises to God for so greai a providence ; | all present 
 followed their example ; ! a deep and solemn enthusiasm 
 pervaded thai splendid assembly, | and prevented all 
 common acclamations of triumph. I 
 
 The anthem of Te Deum laudamus , a 1 chanted by

 as it were, j the feelings and thoughts of the auditors 
 to heaven, | ' so thai,' says the venerable Las Casas, i

 EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH OF ROBERT EMMET, ESQ,, 
 BEFORE LORD NORBURY, ON AN ENDICTMENT FOR HIGH 
 TREASON. 
 
 What have I to s&y, why sentence of death should 
 not be pronounced on me according to law ? I have 
 nothing to say that can alter your predetermination, 
 nor that will become me to say with any view to the 
 mitigation of that sentence which you are here to pro- 
 nounce, and which I must abide by. But I have that 
 to say which interests me more than life, and which 
 you have labored (as was necessarily your office to do, 
 in the present circumstances of this oppressed country) 
 to destroy. I have much to say why my reputation 
 should be rescued from the load of false accusation 
 and calumny which has been heaped upon it. 
 
 I do not imagine, seated where you are, your minds 
 can be so free from impurity as to receive the least 
 impression from what I am going to utter. I have no 
 hopes that I can anchor my character in the breast of 
 a court constituted and trammelled as this is. I only 
 wish, and it is the utmost I expect, that your lordships 
 may suffer it to float down your memories, untainted 
 by the foul breath of prejudice, until it finds some 
 more hospitable harbor to shelter it from the storms 
 by which it is at present buffeted. Were I only to 
 suffer death, after being adjudged guilty by your 
 tribunal, I should bow in silence, and meet the fate 
 that awaits me without a murmur ; but the sentence 
 of the law, which delivers my body to the executioner, 
 will, through the ministry of that law, labor, in its 
 own vindication, to consign my character to obloquy — 
 for there must be guilt somewhere ; whether in the 
 sentence of the court, or in the catastrophe, posterity 
 must determine. 
 
 My lord, it may be a part of the system of angry 
 justice to bow a man's mind by humiliation to the pur- 
 posed ignominy of the scaffold ; but worse to me than 
 the purposed s/iarae, or the scaffold's terrors, would

 be the shame of such foul and unfounded imputations 
 as have been laid against me in this court. You, my 
 lord, are a judge ; I am the supposed culprit — I am a 
 man ; you are a man also. Bj r a revolution of power, 
 we might change places, though we never could change 
 characters. If I stand at the bar of this court, and 
 dare not vindicate my character, what a farce is your 
 justice ! If /stand at this bar, and dare not vindicate 
 -my character how dare you calumniate it ! Does the 
 sentence of death, which your unhallowed policy inflicts 
 upon my body, also condemn my tongue to silence, and 
 my reputation to reproach ? Your executioner may 
 abridge the period of nry existence ; but, while I exist, 
 I shall not forbear to vindicate my character and 
 motives from your aspersions ; and, as a man to whom 
 fame is dearer than life, I will make the last use of that 
 life in doing justice to that reputation which is to live 
 after me, and which is the only legacy I can leave to 
 those I honor and love, and for whom I am proud to 
 perish. As men, we must appear, on the great day, at 
 one common tribunal ; and it will then remain for the 
 Searcher of all hearts to show a collective universe, 
 who was engaged in the most virtuous actions, or 
 actuated by the purest motives — my country's op- 
 pressors, or myself. 
 
 I am charged with being an emissary of France. 
 An emissary of France ! And for what end ? It is 
 alleged that I wished to sell the independence of my 
 country ! And for what end ! Was this the object of 
 my ambition ! And is this the mode by which a tri- 
 bunal of justice reconciles contradictions? ]S T o ; lam 
 no emissary. My ambition was to hold a place among 
 the deliverers of my country — not in power, not in profit, 
 but, in the gloiy of the achievement. Sell my country's 
 independence to France ! and for what ? A change of 
 masters ? No ; but for ambition. 
 
 Oh, my country ! had it been personal ambition that 
 influenced me — had it been the soul of my actions, 
 could I not, by my education and fortune, by the rank 
 and consideration of my family, have placed myself

 amongst the proudest of your oppressors ? My country 
 was my idol. To it I sacrificed every selfish, every 
 endearing sentiment ; and for it I now offer up my life. 
 No, my lord, I acted as an Irishman, determined on 
 delivering my country from the yoke of a foreign and 
 unrelenting tyranny, and from the more galling yoke 
 of a domestic faction, its joint partner and perpetrator 
 in parricide, whose rewards are the ignominy of exist- 
 ing with an exterior of splendor, and a consciousness 
 of depravity. 
 
 It was the wish of my heart to extricate my country 
 from this doubly riveted despotism. I wished to place 
 her independence beyond the reach of any power on 
 earth. I wished to exalt her to that proud station of 
 the world which Providence had destined her to fill. 
 
 I have been charged with so great importance, in the 
 efforts to emancipate my country, as to be considered 
 the key-stone of the combination of Irishmen, or, as 
 your lordship expressed it, " the life and blood of the 
 conspiracy." You do me honor overmuch— you have 
 given to the subaltern all the credit of a superior. There 
 are men engaged in this conspiracy who are not only 
 superior to me, but even to your own conceptions of 
 yourself, my lord — men before the splendor of whose 
 genius and virtues I should bow with respectful defer- 
 ence, and who would think themselves dishonored to 
 be called your friends — who would not disgrace them- 
 selves by shaking your blood-stained hand — [Here he 
 was interrupted.'] 
 
 What, my lord, shall you tell me, on the passage to 
 that scaffold which that tyranny, of which you are 
 only the intermediary executioner, has erected for my 
 murder, that I am accountable for all the blood that 
 has been, and will be, shed in this struggle of the op- 
 pressed against the oppressor — shall you tell me this, 
 and must I be so very a slave as not to repel it ? — I, 
 who fear not to approach the omnipotent Judge, to 
 answer for the conduct of my whole life — am I to be 
 appalled and falsified by a mere remnant of mortality 
 here ? — by you, too, who, if it were possible to collect

 all the innocent blood that yon have shed, in } t out un- 
 hallowed ministry, in one great reservoir, 3 r our lord- 
 ship might swim in it? — [Here the judge interfered.'] 
 
 Let no man dare, when I am dead, to. charge me 
 with dishonor : let no man attaint nry memory, by 
 believing that I could engage in any cause but that of 
 my country's liberty and independence ; or that I could 
 become the pliant minion of power in the oppression 
 or the miseries of my countrymen. The proclamation 
 of the provisional government speaks my views; from 
 which no inference can be tortured to countenance 
 barbarity or debasement at home, or subjection, or 
 humiliation, or treachery from abroad. I would not 
 have submitted to a foreign invader, for the same 
 reason that I would resist the domestic opjjressor. In 
 the dignity of freedom, I would have fought upon 
 the threshold of my country, and its enemy should 
 enter only by passing over my lifeless corpse. And 
 am I, who lived but for my country, who have subjected 
 myself to the dangers of the jealous and watchful op- 
 pressor, and now to the bondage of the grave, only to 
 give my countrymen their rights, and my country her 
 independence, to be loaded with calumny, and not suf- 
 fered to resent and repel it ? No ; God forbid ! 
 
 My lords, you seem impatient for the sacrifice. The 
 blood for which you thirst, is not congealed by the 
 artificial terrors which surround your victim : it cir- 
 culates warmly and unruffled through the channels 
 which God created for noble purposes, but which you 
 are bent to destroy for purposes so grievous, that they 
 cry to Heaven. 
 
 Be yet patient. I have but a few words more to say. 
 I am going to my cold and silent grave : my lamp of 
 life is nearly extinguished: my race is run; the grave 
 opens to receive me ; and I sink into its bosom. I have 
 but one request to ask at my departure from this world : 
 it is the charity of its silence. Let no man write my 
 epitaph ; for, as n"o man who knows my motives, dares 
 now vindicate them, let not prejudice nor ignorance 
 asperse them. Let them and me repose in obscurity, and

 Cassius. That you have wronged me, doth appear in

 You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella, 
 For taking bribes here of the Sardians ; 
 Wherein my letters, praying on his side, 
 Because. I knew the man, were slighted of. 
 
 Brutus. You wronged yourself, to write in such a 
 case. 
 
 Cas. In such a time as this, it is not meet 
 That every nice offence should bear its comment. 
 
 Bru. Yet let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself 
 Are much condemned to have an itching palm ; 
 To sell and mart your offices for gold 
 To undeservers. 
 
 Gas. I an itching palm ? 
 You know that you are Brutus that speak this, 
 Or, by the gods, this speech were else 3^our last. 
 
 Bru. The name of Cassius honors this corruption, 
 And chastisement doth therefore hide its head. 
 
 Gas. Chastisement ! 
 
 Bru. Remember March, the Ides of March remem- 
 ber! 
 Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake ? 
 What villain touched his body, that did stab, 
 And not for justice? What, shall one of us, 
 That struck the foremost man in all this world, 
 But for supporting robbers ; shall we now, 
 Contaminate our lingers with base bribes ? 
 And seli the might}' space of our large honors, 
 For so much trash as may be grasped thus ?

 There is no terror, Cassins, in your threats ; 
 For I am armed so strong in honesty, 
 That they pass by me as the idle wind, 
 Which I respect not. I did send to you 
 For certain sums of gold, which you denied me; 
 For I can raise no money by vile means ; 
 Ye Gods ! I had rather coin my heart, 
 And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring 
 From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash, 
 By any indirection. I did send 
 To you for gold to pay my legions, 
 Which you denied me : was that done like Cassius ? 
 Should I have answered Caius Cassius so ? 
 When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous, 
 To lock such rascal counters from his friends, 
 Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts, 
 Dash him to pieces ! 
 
 Gas. I denied you not. 
 
 Bru. You did. 
 
 Gas. I did not : — he was but a fool 
 That brought my answer back. Brutus hath rived my 
 
 heart ; 
 A friend should bear his friend's infirmities, 
 But Brutus makes mine greater than they are. 
 
 Bru I do not, till 3^011 practice them on me.

 As huge as high Olympus.

 Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius. 
 For Cassias is aweary of the world :

 Set in a note-book, learned and conned by rote, 
 To cast into my teeth. 0, I could weep 
 My spirit from mine eyes. There is my dagger, 
 And here my naked breast; within, a heart 
 Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold: 
 If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth; 
 I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart ; 
 Strike as thou didst at Cesar ; for I know, 
 When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him

 Be angry when you will, it shall have scope ; 
 Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor. 
 Cassius, 3 t ou are 3 T oked with a lamb, 
 That carries anger as the flint bears fire ; 
 Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark, 
 And straight is cold again.

 To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus, 
 When grief or blood ill-tempered vexeth him ?

 When that rash humor which my mother gave me, 
 Makes me forgetful ?

 THE BATTLE OF IVRY * 
 
 (macaulay.) 
 
 Henry the Fourth, on his accession to the French throne, 
 was opposed by a large part of his subjects, under the Duke 
 of Mayenne, with the assistance of Spain and Savoy, and, 
 from the union of these several nations, their army was called 
 the " army of the league." In March, 1590, he gained a deci- 
 sive victory over that party, at Ivry. a small town in France. 
 Before the battle, he said to his troops. '■ My children, if you 
 lose sight of your colors, rally to my white plume. — you will 
 always find it in the path to honor and glory." His conduct 
 was answerable to his promise. Nothing could resist his im- 
 petuous valor, and the leaguers underwent a total and bloody 
 defeat. In the midst of the rout, Henry followed, crying, 
 " Save the French !" and his clemency added a number of the 
 enemy to his own army. 
 
 Now gloiyto the Lord of Hosts, from whom all glories 
 
 are ! 
 And glory to our sovereign liege. King Henry of 
 
 Navarre. 
 Now let there be the merry sound of music and the 
 
 dance, 
 Through thy corn-fields green and sunny vines, 
 
 pleasant land of France ! 
 And thou, Rochelle, our own Rochelle, proud city of 
 
 the waters, 
 Again let rapture light the eye of all thy mourning 
 
 daughters. 
 As thou wert constant in our ills, be joyous in our joy, 
 For cold, and stiff, and still are they who would thy 
 
 walls annoy. 
 Hurrah ! hurrah ! a single field hath turned the chance 
 
 of war ; 
 Hurrah ! hurrah! for Ivry, and King Henry of Navarre !

 our land ! 
 And dark Mayenne was in the midst, a truncheon in 
 
 his hand ! 
 And, as we looked on them, we thought of Seine's em- 
 purpled flood, 
 And good Coligni's* hoary hair, all dabbled with his 
 
 blood ; 
 And we cried unto the living God, who rules the fate 
 
 of war, 
 To fight for his own holy name, and Henry of Navarre. 
 
 The king is come to marshal us, in all his armor drest, 
 And he has bound a snow-white plume upon his gallant 
 
 crest. 
 He looked upon his people, and a tear was in his eye ; 
 He looked upon the traitors, and his glance was stern 
 
 and high. 
 Right graciously he smiled on us, as rolled from wing 
 
 to wing, 
 Down all our line, a deafening shout, " God save our 
 
 Lord, the King !" 
 "And if my standard-bearer fall, and fall full well he 
 
 may, 
 For never saw I promise yet of such a bloody fray, 
 Press where you see my white plume shine, amid the 
 
 ranks of war, 
 And be your oriflamme,")* to-day, thehelmet of Navarre." 
 
 * Coligni, (pronounced Co-leen-yee,) a venerable old man, 
 was one of the victims in the massacre of St. Bartholomew.

 Hurrah ! the foes are moving ! Hark to the mingled

 Of fife, and steed, and trump, and drum, and roaring

 Now, by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of

 A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears

 Amidst the thickest carnage, blazed the helmet of

 THE FRENCHMAN AND THE RATS. 
 
 A Frenchman once, who was a merry wight, 
 Passing to town from Dover in the night, 
 Near the roadside an ale-house chanced to spy : 
 And being rather tired as well as dry, 
 Resolved to enter ; but first he took a peep, 
 In hopes a supper he might get, and cheap. 
 He enters : " Hallo ! Garcon, if you please, 
 Bring me a little bit of bread and cheese. 
 And hallo ! Garcon, a pot of porter too !" he said, 
 " Vich I shall take, and den myself to bed."

 His supper done, some scraps of cheese were left, 
 Which our poor Frenchman, thinking it no theft, 
 Into his pocket put ; then slowly crept 
 To wished-for bed ; but not a wink he slept — 
 For, on the floor, some sacks of flour were laid, 
 To which the rats a nightly visit paid. 
 
 Our hero now undressed, popped out the light, 
 Put on his cap and bade the world good-night ; 
 But first his breeches, which contained the fare, 
 Under his pillow he had placed with care. 
 
 Sans ceremonie, soon the rats all ran, 
 And on the flour-sacks greedily began ; 
 At which they gorged themselves ; then smelling round, 
 Under the pillow soon the cheese they found ; 
 And while at this they regaling sat, 
 Their happy jaws disturbed the Frenchman's nap ; 
 Who, half awake, cries out, "Hallo! hallo! 
 Tat is dat nibbel at my pillow^ so ? 
 Ah ! 'tis one big huge rat ! 
 Vat de diable is it he nibble, nibble at?" 
 
 In vain our little hero sought repose ; 
 Sometimes the vermin galloped o'er his nose ; 
 And such the pranks the}' kept up all the night, 
 That he, on end antipodes upright, 
 Bawling aloud, called stoutly for a light, 
 " Hallo ! Maison ! Garcon, I say ! 
 Bring me the bill for vat I have to pa}*- !" 
 The bill was brought, and to his great surprise, 
 Ten shillings was the charge, he scarce believes his eyes : 
 With eager haste, he runs it o'er, 
 And every time he viewed it thought it more. 
 " Vy zounds, and zounds !" he cries, " I sail no pay; 
 Vat charge ten shelangs for vat I have mange ? 
 A leetal sup of porter, dis vile bed, 
 Vare all de rats do run about my head V 
 " Plague on those rats !" the landlord muttered out ; 
 " I wish, upon my word, that I could make 'em scout : 
 I'll pay him well that can." " Vat's dat you say ?" 
 " I'll pay him well that can." " Attend to me, I pray: 
 Vil you dis charge forego, vat I am at, 
 If from your house I drive away de rat ?"

 "With all my heart," the jolly host replies,

 THE PARTING OF MARMION AND DOUGLAS. 
 
 (WALTER SCOTT.) 
 
 Not far advanced was morning day, 
 When Marmion did his troop array, 
 
 To Surrey's camp to ride ; 
 He had safe conduct for his band, 
 Beneath the royal seal and hand, 
 
 And Douglas gave a guide. 
 
 The train from out the castle drew, 
 
 But Marmion stopped to bid adieu : 
 
 " Though something I might 'plain," he said, 
 
 " Of cold respect to stranger guest, 
 
 Sent hither by the king's behest, 
 While in Tantallon's towers I staid, 
 
 Part we in friendship from your land, 
 And, noble Earl, receive my hand.'' 1 
 But Douglas round him drew his cloke, 
 
 Folded his arms, and thus he spoke : — 
 " My manors, halls, and towers shall still 
 Be open at my sovereign's will, 
 
 To each one whom he lists, howe'er 
 Unmeet to be the owner's peer. 
 My castles are my king's alone, 
 
 From turret to foundation stone ; — 
 The hand of Douglass is his own ; 
 And never shall, in friendly grasp, 
 
 The hand of such as Marmion clasp."

 Burned Marmion's swarthy cheek like fire, 
 And shook his very frame for ire, 
 
 And " This to me," he said, 
 " And 'twere not for thy hoary beard, 
 Such hand as Marmion's had not spared 
 
 To cleave the Douglas' head ! 
 And first, I tell thee, haughty peer, 
 He who does England's message here, 
 
 Although the meanest in her state, 
 May well, proud Angus, be thy mate: 
 And Douglas, more I tell thee here, 
 
 Even in thx pitch of pride, 
 Here, in thy hold, thy vassals near, 
 I tell thee, thoitrt defied ! 
 
 And if thou said'st I am not peer 
 To any lord in Scotland here, 
 Lowland, or Highland, far, or near, 
 
 Lord Angus, thou — hast — lied/" 
 
 On the Earl's cheek, the flush of rage 
 O'ercame the ashen hue of age : 
 
 Fierce he broke forth ; " And dar'st thou then 
 To beard the lion in his den, 
 The Douglas in his hall ? 
 
 And hop'st thou thence unscathed to go ? 
 No, by St. Bryde, of Bothwell, no ! 
 Up drawbridge, grooms, — what, warder, 
 
 Let the portcullis fall," 
 Lord Marmion turned, — well was his need, — 
 And dashed the rowels in his steed, 
 
 Like arrow through the arch-way sprung ; 
 The ponderous gate behind him rung : 
 To pass there was such scanty room, 
 
 The bars, descending, grazed his plume. 
 
 The steed along the draw-bridge flies, 
 Just as it trembled on the rise : 
 2sot lighter does the swallow skim 
 Along the smooth lake's level brim : 
 And when lord Marmion reached his band 
 He halts, and turns with clinched hand,

 And shont of loud defiance pours, 
 
 And shook his gauntlet at the towers. 
 
 " Horse ! horse /" the Douglas cried, " and chase /" 
 
 But soon he reined his fury's pace : 
 
 "A royal messenger he came, 
 
 Though most unworthy of the name ; 
 
 Saint Mary mend my fiery mood ! 
 
 Old age ne'er cools the Douglas' blood, 
 
 I thought to slay him where he stood. 
 
 'Tis pity of him too," he cried ; 
 
 " Bold he can speak, and fairly ride ; 
 
 I warrant him a warrior tried." 
 
 With this, his mandate he recalls, 
 
 And slowly seeks his castle walls. 
 
 PAUL'S DEFENSE BEFORE KING AGRIPPA. 
 
 Then said Agrippa unto Paul : " Thou art permit- 
 ted to speak for thyself." Then Paul stretched forth 
 his hand and answered for himself. 
 
 I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because 1 shall 
 answer for myself, this day, before thee, touching all the 
 things whereof I am accused of the Jews ; especially, 
 because I know thee to be expert in all customs and 
 questions which are among the Jews : wherefore I be- 
 seech thee to hear me patiently. My manner of life 
 from my youth, which was at the first among mine own 
 nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews; who knew 
 me from the beginning, if they would testify, that, af- 
 ter the most straitest sect of our religion, I lived a 
 Pharasee. 
 
 And now, I stand and am judged for the hope of 
 the promise made of God unto our fathers : unto which 
 promise our twelve tribes, instant!} 1 - serving God day 
 and night, hope to come. Por which hope's sake king 
 Agrippa. I am accused of the Jews. Why should it 
 be thought a thing incredible with you, that God 
 should raise the dead ? I verily thought with myself, 
 that I ought to do many things contrary to the name

 of Jesus of Nazareth. Which things T also did in 
 Jerusalem : and many of the saints did I shut up in 
 prison, having received authority from the chief-priests, 
 and when they were put to death, I gave my voice 
 against them. 
 
 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and 
 compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly 
 mad against them, I persecuted them, even unto strange 
 cities. Whereupon, as I went to Damascus, with au- 
 thority and commission from the chief-priests, at mid- 
 day, king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, 
 above the brightness of the sun, shining round about 
 me and them which journeyed with me. And when we 
 were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking 
 unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, 
 wiry persecutest thou me ? it is hard for thee to kick 
 against the goads. And I said, Who art thou Lord ? 
 
 And he said, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest. 
 But rise and stand upon thy T feet: for I have appeared 
 unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and 
 a witness both of these things which thou hast seen, and 
 of those things in the which I will appear unto thee ; 
 delivering thee from the people and from the Gentiles, 
 unto whom now I send thee, to open their eyes, and to 
 turn them from darkness to light, and from the power 
 of Satan unto God; that they may receive forgiveness 
 of sins, and inheritance among them which are sancti- 
 fied, b\* faith that Is in me. 
 
 Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient 
 unto the heavenly vision; but showed first unto them 
 of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the 
 coasts of Judea, and then to the Gentiles, that they 
 should repent and turn to God, and do works meet for 
 repentance. For these causes the Jews caught me in 
 the temple, and went about to kill me. Having, there- 
 fore, obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, 
 witnessing both to small and great, saying none other 
 things than those which the prophets and Moses did 
 say should come ; that Christ should suffer, aDd that 
 he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and 
 should show light unto the people, and to the Gentiles

 And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with 
 a loud voice, " Paul, thou art beside thyself, much 
 learning hath made thee mad." But he said, " I am not 
 mad, most noble Festus, but speak forth the words of 
 truth and soberness. For the king knoweth of these 
 things, before whom I speak freely ; for I am per- 
 suaded that none of these things are hidden from him ; 
 for this thing was not done in a corner. King Agrippa, 
 believest thou the prophets ? I know that thou be- 
 lievest." 
 
 Then Agrippa said unto Paul ; " Almost thou per- 
 suadest me to be a Christian." And Paul said, "I 
 would to God that not only thou, but also all that hear 
 me this day, were both almost, and altogether such as 1 
 am, except these bonds." 
 
 BERNARDO DEL CARPIO. 
 
 (mrs. hemans.) 
 
 The celebrated Spanish champion, Bernardo del Carpio, 
 having made many ineffectual efforts to procure the release of 
 his father, the Count Saldana, who had been imprisoned by 
 King Alfonso of Asturias, almost from the time of Bernardo's 
 birth, at last took up arms in despair. The war which he 
 maintained proved so destructive, that the men of the land 
 gathered round the king, and united in demanding Saldana's 
 liberty. Alfonso accordingly offered Bernardo immediate pos- 
 session of his father's person, in exchange for his castle at 
 Carpio. Bernardo, without hesitation, gave up his stronghold, 
 with all his captives, and being assured that his father was 
 then on his way from prison, rode forth with the king to meet 
 him. " And when he saw his father approaching, he ex- 
 claimed," says the ancient chronicle. " Oh ! Cod, is the Count 
 Saldana indeed coming?" " Look where he is," replied the 
 cruel king, " and now go and greet him, whom you have 
 so long desired to see." — The remainder of the story will be 
 found related in the ballad. The chronicles and romances 
 leave us nearly in the dark as to Bernardo's future history 
 after this event, with the exception of the final interview in 
 which he renounced his allegiance to the kingr.

 The warrior bowed his crested head, and tamed his 
 
 heart of fire, 
 And sued the haughty king to free his long-imprisoned 
 
 sire ; 
 " I bring thee here my fortress-keys, I bring my captive 
 
 train, 
 I pledge thee faith, my liege, my lord ! — Oh ! break my 
 
 father's chain I" 
 
 "Rise, rise ! even now thy father comes, a ransomed 
 
 man this day : 
 Mount thy good horse ; and thou and I will meet him 
 
 on his way." — 
 Then lightly rose that loyal son, and bounded on his 
 
 steed, 
 And urged, as if with lance in rest, the charger's foamy 
 
 speed. 
 
 And lo ! from far, as on they pressed, there came a 
 
 glittering band, 
 With one that 'midst them stately rode, as a leader in 
 
 the land ; 
 — "Now haste, Bernardo, haste! for there, in very 
 
 truth, is he, 
 The father whom thy faithful heart hath yearned so 
 
 long to see." 
 
 His dark e3'e flashed, — his proud breast heaved, — his 
 
 cheek's hue came and went, — 
 He reached that gray-haired chieftain's side, and there 
 
 dismounting bent, 
 A lowly knee to earth he bent, his father's hand he 
 
 took — 
 What was there in its touch that all his fiery spirit 
 
 shook ? 
 
 That hand was cold, — a frozen thing, — it dropped from

 A plume waved o'er the noble brow, — the brow was

 He met at last his father's eyes, — but in them was no

 Up from the ground he sprang and gazed ; — but who 
 
 could paint that gaze ! 
 They hushed their very hearts, that saw its horror and 
 
 amaze : — 
 They might have chained him, as before that stony form

 For the power was stricken from his arm, and from his

 " Father !" at length he murmured low, and wept like 
 childhood then — 
 
 Talk not of grief till thou hast seen the tears of war-

 He thought on all his glorious hopes, and all his young 
 renown, — 
 
 He flung his falchion from his side, and in the dust sat 
 down. 
 
 Then covering with his steel-gloved hands his darkly 
 
 mournful brow, 
 "No more, there is no more," he said, "to lift the 
 
 sword for now, —

 Then starting from the ground once more, he seized 
 
 the monarch's rein, 
 Amidst the pale and wildered looks of all the courtier 
 
 train ; 
 And with a fierce, o'ermastering grasp, the rearing 
 
 war-horse led, 
 And sternly set them face to face, — the king before the 
 
 dead : — 
 
 " Came I not forth upon thy pledge, my father's hand 
 
 to kiss ? 
 — Be still, and gaze thou on, false king ! and tell me 
 
 what is this ? 
 The voice, the glance, the heart I sought, — give answer, 
 
 where are they ? 
 — If thou wouldst clear thy perjured soul, send life

 " Into these glassy eyes put light, — be still ! keep down

 He loosed the steed, — his slack hand fell ; — upon the 
 
 silent face 
 He cast one long, deep, troubled look, then turned from

 His hope was crushed, his after-fate untold in martial

 None but the brave, none but the brave,

 With flying fingers — touched the lyre ; 
 The trembling notes ascend the sky, 
 
 And heavenly joys inspire.

 Who left his blissful seats above ; 
 Such is the power — of mighty love.

 And stamped an image of himself, a sovereign of the

 The vanquished victor — sunk — upon her breast. 
 
 Now, strike the golden lyre again ; 
 A louder yet, and yet a louder strain : 
 Break his bands of sleep asunder, 
 And rouse him like a rattling peal of thunder. 
 Hark ! hark ! — the horrid sound

 And amazed he stares aronnd. 
 Revenge, revenge ! Timotheus cries — 
 See the furies arise ! See the snakes that they rear, 
 
 How they hiss in the air, 
 And the sparkles that flash from their eyes ! 
 Behold a ghastly band, each a torch in his hand ! 
 These are Grecian ghosts, that in battle were slain, 
 And, unburied, remain inglorious on the plain. 
 Give the vengeance due to the valiant crew. 
 Behold, how they toss their torches on high ! 
 How they point to the Persian abodes, 
 And glittering temples of their hostile gods ! 
 The princes applaud, with a furious joy ; 
 And the king seizes a flambeau with zeal to destroy : 
 
 Thais led the way, to light him on his prey ; 
 And, like another Helen — fired another Troy.

 Tall poplar-trees their shadows throw ; 
 And from its station in the hall 
 An ancient timepiece says to all, — 
 " Forever — never ! 
 Never — forever !" 
 
 Half-way up the stairs it stands. 
 And points and beckons with its hands 
 From its case of massive oak, 
 Like a monk, who, under his cloak, 
 Crosses himself, and sighs, alas! 
 With sorrowful voice to all who pass, — 
 " Forever — never ! 
 Never — forever !" 
 
 By day its voice is low and light ; 
 But in the silent dead of night,

 Distinct as a passing footstep's fall, 
 It echoes along the vacant hall, 
 Along the ceiling, along the floor, 
 And seems to say at each chamber door, — 
 " Forever — never ! 
 Never — forever I" 
 
 Through days of sorrow and of mirth, 
 Through days of death and days of birth, 
 Through every swift vicissitude 
 Of changeful time, unchanged it has stood, 
 And as if, like God, it all things saw, 
 It calmly repeats those words of awe, — 
 " Forever — never ! 
 Never — forever !" 
 
 In that mansion used to be 
 Free-hearted Hospitality : 
 His great fires up the chimney roared ; 
 The stranger feasted at his board ; 
 But, like the skeleton at the feast, 
 That warning timepiece never ceased, — 
 " Forever — never ! 
 Never — forever I" 
 
 There groups of merry children played, 
 There j^ouths and maidens dreaming strayed ; 
 O precious hours ! golden prime, 
 And affluence of love and time ! 
 Even as a miser counts his gold, 
 Those hours the ancient timepiece told, — 
 " Forever — never ! 
 Never — forever !" 
 
 From that chamber, clothed in white, 
 The bride came forth on her wedding night ; 
 There, in that silent room below, 
 The dead lay in his shroud of snow ;

 All are scattered now and fled, 
 Some are married, some are dead ; 
 And when I ask, with throbs of pain, 
 " Ah ! when shall they all meet again?" 
 As in the days long since gone by, 
 The ancient timepiece makes reply, — 
 " Forever — never ! 
 Never — forever I" 
 
 Never here, forever there, 
 Where all parting, pain, and care, 
 And death, and time shall disappear, — 
 Forever there, but never here I

 THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH. 
 
 (LONGFELLOW.) 
 
 Under a spreading chestnut tree, 
 The village smithy stands ; 
 
 The smith, a mighty man is he, 
 With large and sinewy hands ; 
 
 And the muscles of his brawny arms, 
 Are strong, as iron bands. 
 
 His hair is crisp, and black, and long ; 
 
 His face — is like the tan ; 
 His brow — is wet with honest sweat ; 
 
 He earns — whate'er he can, 
 And looks the whole world in the face, 
 
 For he owes not any man.

 Week out, week in, from morn till night, 
 
 You can hear his bellows blow ; 
 You hear him swing his heavy sledge, 
 
 With measured beat and slow, 
 Like a sexton, ringing the old kirk chimes, 
 
 When the evening sun is low. 
 
 And children, coming home from school, 
 
 Look in at the open door ; 
 They love to see a flaming forge, 
 
 And hear the bellows roar, 
 And catch the burning sparks, that fly 
 
 Like chaff — from a threshing-floor. 
 
 He goes, on Sunday, to the church, 
 
 And sits among his boys ; 
 He hears the parson — pray and preach, 
 
 He hears his daughter's voice, 
 Singing — in the village choir, 
 
 And it makes his heart rejoice. 
 
 It sounds to him, like her mother's voice, 
 
 Singing — in paradise ! 
 He needs must think of her once more, 
 
 How in the grave she lies ; 
 And with his hard — rough hand he wipes 
 
 A tear from out his eyes. 
 
 Toiling — rejoicing — sorrowing — 
 
 Onward — through life he goes : 
 Each morning — sees some task begin, 
 
 Each evening — sees it close ; 
 Something attempted — something done, 
 
 Has earned a night's repose. 
 
 Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend, 
 
 For the lesson thou hast taught I 
 Thus — at the flaming forge of Life, 
 
 Our fortunes must be wrought ; 
 Thus, on its sounding anvil shaped, 
 
 Each burning deed, and thought.

 SPARTACUS TO THE GLADIATORS AT CAPUA. 
 
 (ELIJAH KELLOGG.) 
 
 It had been a day of triumph in Capua. Lentnlus, 
 returning with victorious eagles, had amused the popu- 
 lace, with the sports of the amphitheatre, to an extent 
 hitherto unknown even in that luxurious city. The 
 shouts of reverly bad died away ; the roar of the lion 
 had ceased ; the last loiterer had retired from the ban- 
 quet ; and the lights in the palace of the victor were 
 extinguished. 
 
 The moon, piercing the tissue of fleecy clouds, sil- 
 vered the dew-drops on the corslet of the Roman sen- 
 tinel, and tipped the dark waters of the Yulturnus 
 with a wav} T , tremulous light. Xo sound was heard, save 
 the last sob of some retiring wave, telling its story to 
 the smooth pebbles of the beach ; and then all was still 
 as the breast when the spirit has departed. 
 
 In the deep recesses of the amphitheatre, a band of 
 gladiators were assembled, — their muscles still knotted 
 with the agony of conflict, the foam upon their lips, the 
 scowl of battle } T et lingering on their brows, — when 
 Spartacus, starting forth from amid the throng, thus 
 addressed them : 
 
 " Ye call me chief, and ye do well to call him chief, 
 who, for twelve long years, has met upon the arena 
 every shape of man or beast the broad empire of Rome 
 could furnish, and who never 3-et lowered his arm. If 
 there be one among you who can say that ever, in 
 public fight or private brawl, my actions did belie my 
 tongue, let him stand forth, and say it. If there be 
 three in all }~our company dare face me on the bloody 
 sands, let them come on. 
 
 "And j^et, I was not alwa3 T s thus, — a hired butcher, 
 a savage chief of still more savage men ! My ancestors 
 came from old Sparta, and settled among the vine-clad 
 rocks and citron groves of Syrasella. My early life 
 ran quiet as the brooks by which I sported : and when,

 at noon, I gathered the sheep beneath the shade, and 
 played upon the shepherd's flute, there was a friend, 
 the son of a neighbor, to join me in the pastime. We 
 led our flocks to the same pasture, and partook to- 
 gether our rustic meal, 
 
 " One evening, after the sheep were folded, and we 
 were all seated beneath the myrtle which shaded our 
 cottage, my grandsire, an old man, was telling of 
 Marathon and Leuctra, and how, in ancient times, a 
 little band of Spartans, in a defile of the mountains, 
 had withstood a whole army. I did not then know 
 what war was ; but my cheeks burned, I knew not why, 
 and I clasped the knees of that venerable man, till my 
 mother, parting the hair from off my forehead, kissed 
 my throbbing temples, and bade me go to rest, and 
 think no more of those old tales and savage wars. 
 
 "That very night, the Romans landed on our coast. 
 I saw the breast that had nourished me trampled by the 
 hoof of the war-horse ; the bleeding body of my father 
 flung amidst the blazing rafters of our dwelling! To- 
 day I killed a man in the arena ; and when I broke his 
 helmet-clasps, behold ! he was my friend. He knew 
 me, — smiled faintly, — gasped, — and died; — the same 
 sweet smile upon his lips that I had marked, when, in 
 adventurous boyhood, we scaled some lofty cliff to 
 pluck the first ripe grapes, and bear them home in 
 childish triumph. T 
 
 "I told the pretor that the dead man had been my 
 friend, generous and brave ; and I begged that I might 
 bear away the body, to burn it on a funeral pile, and 
 mourn over its ashes. Ay ! upon my knees, amid the 
 dust and blood of the arena, I begged that poor boon, 
 while all the assembled maids and matrons, and the 
 holy virgins they call Yestals, and the rabble, shouted 
 in derision, deeming it rare sport, forsooth, to see 
 Rome's fiercest gladiator turn pale and tremble at the 
 sight of that piece of bleeding clay ! And the pretor 
 drew back as I were pollution, and sternly said, — ' Let 
 the carrion rot ; there are no noble men but Romans 1'

 "0 Rome! Rome! thou has been a tender nurse to

 shepherd lad, who never knew a harsher tone than a 
 flute-note, muscles of iron and a heart of flint : taught

 of rugged brass, and warm it in the marrow of his foe!

 he shall pay thee back, till the 3'ellow Tiber is red as 
 frothing wine, and in its deepest ooze tlry life-blood

 strength of brass is in your toughened sinews ; but to- 
 morrow some Roman Adonis, breathing sweet perfume 
 from his curly locks, shall with his lily fingers pat your 
 red brawn, and bet his sesterces upon } T our blood ! 
 Hark ! hear ye \ r on lion roaring in his den ? 'Tis 
 three days since he tasted flesh; but to-morrow he shall 
 break his fast upon yours, — and a dainty meal for him 
 ye will be !

 waiting for the butcher's knife : if ye are men, — follow 
 me ! strike down yon guard, gain the mountain passes, 
 and there do blood}- work, as did 3 r our sires at Old 
 Thermopjdae ! Is Sparta dead ? Is the old Grecian 
 spirit frozen in your veins, that you do crouch and 
 cower like a belabored hound beneath his master's lash ? 
 O comrades! warriors! Thracians ! — if we must fight, 
 let us fight for ourselves ; if we must slaughter, let us 
 slaughter our oppressors ; if we must die, let us die 
 under the open sky, by the bright waters, in noble,

 THE CHESTNUT HORSE. 
 
 An Eaton stripling, training for the law, 
 A dunce at S^yntax, but a dab at taw, 
 One happy Christmas, laid upon the shelf 
 His cap and gown, and stores of learned pelf, 
 With all the deathless bards of Greece and Rome, 
 To spend a fortnight at his uncle's home. 
 Return'd, and past the usual how-dy'e-does, 
 Inquiries of old friends, and college news : 
 " Well, Tom, the road ; what saw you worth discerning ? 
 How's all at College, Tom ? — what is 't you're learn- 
 ing ?" 
 " Learning! — 0, logic, logic ! — not the shallow rules 
 Of Locke and Bacon — antiquated fools ! 
 But wits' and wranglers' logic ; for d 'ye see, 
 I'll prove as clear, — as clear as A, B, C, 
 That an eel pie 's a pigeon ; to deny it, 
 Is to say black 's not black." — 
 
 "Come, let's try it!" 
 " Well, sir ; an eel pie is a pie of fish." "Agreed." 
 " Fish pie may be a jack pie." " Well, well, proceed." 
 " A jack pie is a John pie — and, 'tis done ! 
 For every John pie must be a pie-John." — {pigeon.) 
 " Bravo ! bravo !" Sir Peter cries ; " logic forever ! 
 That beats my grandmother, and she was clever ; 
 But now I think on 't, 't would be mighty hard 
 If merit such as thine met no reward ; 
 To show how much I logic love in course, 
 I'll make thee master of a chestnut horse." 
 "A horse !" quoth Tom, " blood, pedigree, and paces 1 
 0, what a dash I'll cut at Epsom races !" 
 
 Tom dreamt all night of boots and leather breeches, 
 Of hunting-caps, and leaping rails and ditches ; 
 Rose the next morn an hour before the lark, 
 And dragg'd his uncle, fasting, to the park ; 
 Bridle in hand, each vale he scours, of course, 
 To find out something like a chestnut horse ;

 But no such animal the meadows cropt, 
 Till under a large tree Sir Peter stopt, 
 Caught at a branch, and shook it, when down fell 
 A fine horse chestnut, in its prickly shell. 
 
 " There, Tom, take that."—" Well, sir, and what be- 
 
 side ?" 
 "Why, since you're booted, saddle it and ride." 
 " Ride ! what, a chestnut, sir ?" — " Of course, 
 For I can prove that chestnut is a horse ; 
 Not from the doubtful, fusty, musty rules 
 Of Locke and Bacon, antiquated fools, 
 Nor old Malebranch, blind pilot into knowledge, 
 But by the laws of wit and Eton college ; 
 As you have prov'd, and which I don't deny, 
 That a pie John 's the same as a John pie, 
 The matter follows, as a thing of course, 
 That a horse-chestnut is a chestnut horse." 
 
 THE NATURE OF TRUE ELOQUENCE. 
 (DANIEL WEBSTER.) 
 
 When public bodies are to be addressed on momen- 
 tous occasions, when great interests are at stake, and 
 strong passions excited, nothing is valuable in speech 
 further than it is connected with high intellectual and 
 moral endowments. Clearness, force, and earnestness, 
 are the qualities which produce conviction. 
 
 True eloquence, indeed, does not consist in speech. 
 It cannot be brought from far. Labor and learning 
 may toil for it, but they will toil in vain. Words and 
 phrases may be marshaled in every way, but they can- 
 not compass it. It must exist in the man, in the sub- 
 ject and in the occasion. 
 
 Affected passion, intense expression, the pomp of 
 declamation, all may aspire after it : they cannot reach 
 it. It comes, if it come at all, like the out-breaking of 
 a fountain from the earth, or the bursting forth of vol- 
 canic fires, with spontaneous, original, native force.

 The graces taught in the schools, the costly orna- 
 ments and studied contrivances of speech, shock and 
 disgust men, when their own lives, and the fate of their 
 wives, their children, and their country, hang on the 
 decision of the hour. Then, words have lost their 
 power, rhetoric is vain, and all elaborate oratory con- 
 temptible. Even genius itself then feels rebuked and 
 subdued, as in the presence of higher qualities. 
 
 Then, patriotism is eloquent ; then, self-devotion is 
 eloquent. The clear conception, out-running the de- 
 ductions of logic, the high purpose, the firm resolve, 
 the dauntless spirit, speaking on the tongue, beaming 
 from the eye, informing every feature, and urging the 
 whole man onward, right onward, to his object — this, 
 this is eloquence ; or, rather it is something greater 
 and higher than all eloquence — it is action, noble, sub- 
 lime, godlike action.

 Stand ! the ground's your own, my braves- 
 Will ye give it up to slaves ? 
 Will ye look for greener graves ?

 What's the mercy despots feel ?

 Read it on yon bristling steel ! 
 
 Ask it, ye who will. 
 
 Fear ye foes who kill for hire ? 
 Will ye to your homes retire ? 
 Look behind you ! they're a-fire !

 On they come ! and will ye quail ? —

 And the beauty that maddens the passions of earth : 
 And the crowds all shout, till the vast roofs ring —

 VULTURE AND INFANT. 
 (anon.) 
 
 I've been among the mighty Alps, and wandered thro' 
 
 their vales, 
 And heard the honest mountaineers — rel te their dismal 
 
 tales, 
 As round the cotters' blazing hearth, when their daily 
 
 work was o'er, 
 They spake of those, who disappeared, and ne'er were 
 
 heard of more. 
 
 And there, I, from a shepherd, heard a narrative of 
 
 fear, 
 A tale — to rend a mortal heart, which mothers— might 
 
 not hear; 
 The tears — were standiug in his eyes, his voice — was 
 
 tremulous ; 
 But wiping all those tears away, he told his story thus : 
 
 " It is among these barren cliffs — the ravenous vulture 
 
 dwells, 
 Who never fattens on the prey, which from afar he 
 
 smells ; 
 But, patient, watching hour on hour, upon a lofty rock, 
 He singles out some truant lamb, a victim, from the 
 
 flock. 
 
 One cloudless Sabbath summer morn, the sun was rising 
 
 high, 
 When, from my children on the green, I heard a fearful 
 
 cry, 
 As if some awful deed were done, a shriek of grief, and 
 
 pain, 
 A cry, I humbly trust in God, I ne'er may hear again. 
 
 I hurried out to learn the cause ; but, overwhelmed 
 
 with fright, 
 The children never ceased to shriek ; and, from my 
 
 frenzied sight,

 I missed the youngest of my babes, the darling of my 
 
 care ; 
 But something caught my searching eyes, slow sailing 
 
 thro' the air. 
 
 Oh! what an awful spectacle — to meet a father's 
 
 eye — 
 His infant — made a vulture's prey, with terror to 
 
 descry ; 
 And know, with agonizing heart, and with a maniac 
 
 rave, 
 That earthly power — could not avail — that innocent to 
 
 save ! 
 
 My infant — stretched his little hands — imploringly to 
 
 me, 
 And struggled with the ravenous bird, all vainly to get 
 
 free : 
 At intervals, I heard his cries, as loud he shrieked and 
 
 screamed ! 
 Until, upon the azure sky, a lessening spot he seemed. 
 
 The vulture — flapped his sail-like wings, though heavily 
 
 he flew ; 
 A mote, upon the sun's broad face, he seemed unto my 
 
 view ; 
 But once, I thought I saw him stoop, as if he would 
 
 alight, — 
 'Twas only a delusive thought, for all had vanished 
 
 quite. 
 
 All search was vain, and years had passed ; that child 
 
 was ne'er forgot, 
 When once a daring hunter climbed unto a lofty spot, 
 From thence, upon a rugged crag — the chamois never 
 
 reached, 
 He saw — an infant's fleshless bones — the elements had 
 
 bleached !

 I clambered up that rugged cliff — I could not stay- 
 away, — 
 
 I knew they were my infant's bones — thus hastening to 
 decay ; 
 
 A tattered garment — yet remained, though torn to many 
 a shred : 
 
 The crimson cap — he wore that morn — was still upon 
 his head." 
 
 That dreary spot — is pointed out to travelers, passing 
 
 by, 
 
 Who often stand, and musing, gaze, nor go without a 
 
 sigh ; 
 And as /journeyed, the next morn, along my sunny 
 
 way, 
 The precipice was shown to me, whereon the infant lay. 
 
 OTHELLO'S APOLOGY. 
 
 Most potent, grave, and reverend seigniors 
 My very noble and approv'd good masters : 
 That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter, 
 It is most true ; true, I have married her : 
 The very head and front of my offending 
 Hath this extent ; no more. 
 
 Rude am I in speech, 
 And little blessed with the set phrase of peace : 
 For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith, 
 Till now some nine moons wasted, they have us'd 
 Their dearest action in the tented field ; 
 And little of this great world can I speak, 
 More than pertains to feats of broils and battle; 
 And therefore, little shall I grace my cause, 
 In speaking of myself. Yet, by your patience, 
 I will, a round, unvarnish'd tale deliver, 
 Of my whole course of love ; what drugs, what charms, 
 What conjuration, and what mighty magic, 
 (For such proceedings I am charg'd withal) 
 I won his daughter with.

 Her father lov'd me ; oft invited me ; 
 
 Still questioned me the story of my life, 
 
 From year to year : the battles, sieges, fortunes, 
 
 That I had past. 
 
 I ran it through, e'en from my boyish days, 
 
 To the very moment, that he bade me tell it. 
 
 Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances : 
 
 Of moving accidents by flood, and field: 
 
 Of hairbreadth 'scapes, in the imminent deadly breach; 
 
 Of being taken b}^ the insolent foe, 
 
 And sold to slavery ; of m} T redemption thence, 
 
 And with it all my travel's history. 
 
 All these to hear, 
 Would Desdemona seriously incline ; 
 But still the house affairs would draw her thence. 
 Which ever as she could with haste despatch, 
 She'd come again, and with a greedy ear, 
 Devour up my discourse. Which, I observing, 
 Took once a pliant hour, and found good means 
 To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart, 
 That I would all my pilgrimage dilate ; 
 Whereof by parcels, she had something heard, 
 But not distinctly. 
 
 I did consent ; 
 And often did beguile her of her tears, 
 When I did speak of some distressful stroke, 
 That mj' youth suffer'd. My story being done, 
 She gave me for my pains a world of sighs. 
 She swore in faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange, 
 'Twas pitiful; 'twas wondrous pitiful; 
 She wish'd she had not heard it ; yet she wish'd 
 That heaven — had made her such a man. 
 
 She thank'd me, 
 And bade me, if I had a friend that lov'd her, 
 I should but teach him how to tell my story, 
 And that would woo her. On his hint I spake ; 
 She lov'd me, for the dangers I had pass'd ; 
 And I lov'd her, that she did pity them. 
 This is the only witchcraft, which I've used.

 PARRHASIUS AND CAPTIVE. 
 
 (WILLIS.) 
 
 " Parrhasius, a painter of Athens, amongst those Olynthian 
 captives Philip of Macedon brought home to sell, bought one 
 very old man ; and when he had him at his house, put him 
 to death with extreme torture and torment, the better by his 
 example to express the pains and passions of his Prometheus, 
 whom he was then about to paint." 
 
 There stood an unsold captive in the mart, 
 A gray-haired and majestical old man, 
 Chained to a pillar. It was almost night, 
 And the last seller from his place had gone 
 And not a sound was heard but of a dog 
 Crunching beneath the stall a refuse bone, 
 Or the dull echo from the pavement rung, 
 As the faint captive changed his weary feet. 
 
 'Twas evening, and the half-descended sun 
 Tipped with a golden fire the many domes 
 Of Athens, and a yellow atmosphere 
 Lay rich and dusky in the shaded street 
 Through which the captive gazed. 
 
 The golden light into the painter's room 
 Streamed richly, and the hidden colors stole 
 From the dark pictures radiantly forth, 
 And in the soft and dewy atmosphere, 
 Like forms and landscapes, magical they lay. 
 Parrhasius stood gazing forgetfully, 
 Upon his canvas. There Prometheus lay 
 Chained to the cold rocks of Mount Caucasus — 
 The vulture at his vitals, and the links 
 Of the lame Lemnian festering in his flesh; 
 And, as the painter's mind felt through the dim, 
 Rapt m3'Stery, and plucked the shadows forth 
 With its far-reaching fancy, and with form

 Flashed with a passionate fire, and the quick curl 
 Of his thin nostril, and his quivering lip 
 Were like the winged God's breathing from his flight. 
 
 " Bring me the captive now ! 
 My hands feel skillful, and the shadows lift 
 From my waked spirit airily and swift 
 And I could paint the bow 
 Upon the bended heavens — around me play 
 Colors of such divinity to-day. 
 
 Ha ! bind him on his back ! 
 Look ! — as Prometheus in my picture here ! 
 Quick — or he faints ! stand with the cordial near ! 
 
 Now bend him to the rack !

 And tear agape that healing wound afresh! 
 
 So — let him writhe ! How long 
 Will he live thus ? Quick, my good pencil now ! 
 What a fine agony works upon his brow ! 
 
 Ha ! gray-haired, and so strong !

 THE MOTHER PERISHING IN A SNOW-STORM. 
 
 "In the year 1821, a Mrs. Blake perished in a snow-storm 
 in the night-time, while travelling over a spur of the Green 
 Mountains in Vermont. She had an infant with her, which 
 was found alive and well in the morning, being carefully 
 wrapped in the mother's clothing." 
 
 The cold winds — swept the mountain's height, 
 And pathless — was the dreary wild, 
 
 And, 'mid the cheerless hours of night, 
 A mother wancler'd — with her child : 
 
 As through the drifting snow she press'd, 
 
 The babe — was sleeping — on her breast.

 "If /must perish, save m}^ child!" 
 
 She stripd'd her mantle from her breast, 
 And bared her bosom to the storm, 
 
 And round the child — she wrapped the vest, 
 And smiled — to think her babe was warm. 
 
 With one cold kiss — one tear she shed, 
 
 And sunk — upon her snowy bed. 
 
 At dawn — a traveller passed by, 
 And saw her — 'neath a snowy vail ; 
 
 The frost of death — was in her eye, 
 
 Her cheek was cold, and hard, and pale;

 Now, while the Three were tightening 
 
 Their harness on their backs, 
 The Consul was the foremost man 
 
 To take in hand an axe ; 
 And Fathers mixed with Commons, 
 
 Seized hatchet, bar, and crow, 
 iLnd smote upon the planks above, 
 
 And loosed the props below. 
 
 Meanwhile the Tuscan army, 
 
 Right glorious to behold, 
 Came flashing back the noonday light, 
 Rank behind rank, like surges bright 
 
 Of a broad sea of gold. 
 Four hundred trumpets sounded 
 
 A peal of warlike glee, 
 As that great host, with measured tread, 
 And spears advanced, and ensigns spread, 
 Rolled slowly toward the bridge's head, 
 
 Where stood the dauntless Three. 
 
 The Three stood calm and silent, 
 
 And looked upon the foes, 
 And a great shout of laughter 
 
 From all the vanguard rose : 
 And forth, three chiefs came spurring 
 
 Before that mighty mass ; 
 To earth they sprang, their swords they drew 
 And lifted high their shields, and flew 
 
 To win the narrow pass. 
 
 But all Etruria's noblest 
 
 Felt their hearts sink to see 
 On the earth the bloody corpses, 
 
 In the path the dauntless Three : 
 And, from the ghastly entrance 
 
 Where those bold Romans stood, 
 All shrank, like boys who unaware, 
 Ranging the woods to start a hare, 
 Come to the mouth of the dark lair 
 Where, growling low, a fierce old bear 
 
 Lies amidst bones and blood.

 Above the boiling tide.

 Loud cried the Fathers all. 
 " Back, Lartius ! back, Herminius ! 
 
 Back, ere the ruin fall !" 
 
 Back darted Spurius Lartius ; 
 
 Herminius darted back : 
 And, as they passed, beneath their feet 
 
 They felt the timbers crack. 
 But when they turned their faces, 
 
 And on the farther shore 
 Saw brave Horatius stand alone, 
 
 They would have crossed once more. 
 
 But with a crash like thunder 
 
 Fell eveiy loosened beam, 
 And, like a dam, the mighty wreck 
 
 Lay right athwart the stream 
 And a long shout of triumph 
 
 Rose from the walls of Rome, 
 As to the highest turret-tops 
 
 Was splashed the 3 r ellow foam. 
 
 And like a horse unbroken 
 
 When first he feels the rein, 
 The furious river struggled hard, 
 
 And tossed his tawny mane ; 
 And burst the curb, and bounded, 
 
 Rejoicing to be free ; 
 And whirling down, in fierce career, 
 Battlement, and plank, and pier, 
 
 Rushed headlong to the sea. 
 
 Alone stood brave Horatius, 
 But constant still in mind ; 
 
 Thrice thirty thousand foes before, 
 And the broad flood behind.

 And, with his harness on his back, 
 
 Plunged headlong in the tide. 
 
 No sound of joy or sorrow 
 
 Was heard from either bank ; 
 But friends and foes, in dumb surprise, 
 
 With parted lips and straining eyes, 
 Stood gazing where he sank ; 
 
 And when above the surges 
 They saw his crest appear, 
 
 All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry, 
 And even the ranks of Tuscany 
 
 Could scarce forbear to cheer. 
 
 But fiercely ran the current, 
 
 Swollen high by months of rain : 
 And fast his blood was flowing ;

 Bare bravely up his chin.

 " Will not the villain drown ? 
 But for this stay, ere close of day 
 
 We should have sacked the town I" 
 " Heaven help him !" quoth Lars Porsena, 
 
 " And bring him safe to shore ; 
 For such a gallant feat of arms 
 
 Was never seen before." 
 
 And now he feels the bottom ; 
 
 Now on dry earth he stands, 
 Now round him throng the Fathers 
 
 To press his gory hands ; 
 And now with shouts and clapping, 
 
 And noise of weeping loud, 
 He enters through the River-gate, 
 
 Borne by the joyous crowd 
 
 ANNABEL LEE. 
 (EDGAR A. POE.) 
 
 It was many and many a year ago, 
 
 In a kingdom by the sea, 
 That a maiden there lived, whom you may know 
 
 By the name of Annabel Lee ; 
 And this maiden she lived with no other thought 
 
 Than to love, and be loved by me.

 I was a child and she was a child, 
 
 In this kingdom by the sea ; 
 But we loved with a love that was more than love, 
 
 I and my Annabel Lee — 
 With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven 
 
 Coveted her and me. 
 
 And this was the reason that, long ago, 
 
 In this kingdom by the sea, 
 A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling 
 
 My beautiful Annabel Lee ; 
 So that her high-born kinsmen came 
 
 And bore her away from me, 
 To shut her up in a sepulchre 
 
 In this kingdom by the sea. 
 
 The angels, not half so happy in heaven, 
 
 Went envying her and me, 
 Yes ! that was the reason (as all men know, 
 
 In this kingdom by the sea) 
 That the wind came out of the cloud by night, 
 
 Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee. 
 
 But our love it was stronger by far than the love 
 
 Of those who were older than we, 
 
 Of many far wiser than we ; 
 And neither the angels in heaven above, 
 
 Nor the demons down under the sea, 
 Can ever dissever my soul from the soul 
 
 Of the beautiful Annabel Lee. 
 
 For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams 
 
 Of the beautiful Annabel Lee, 
 A.nd the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes 
 
 Of the beautiful Annabel Lee ; 
 And so all the night-time, I lie down by the side 
 Of nry darling — my darling — my life and my bride, 
 In the sepulchre there by the sea, 
 In her tomb by the sounding sea.

 The splendor falls on castle avails 
 
 And snowy summits old and story ; 
 The long light shakes across the lakes, 
 And the wild cataract leaps in glory. 
 Blow, bugle, blow; set the wild echoes flying: 
 Blow, bugle ; answer, echoes, dying, djing, dying. 
 
 hark, hear ! how thin and clear, 
 
 And thinner, clearer, further going ; 
 sweet and far, from cliff and scar, 
 The horns of Elfland faintly blowing ! 
 Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying : 
 Blow, bugle ; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.

 They faint on hill or field or river : 
 Our echoes roll from soul to soul, 
 And grow forever and forever.

 THE DREAM OF EUGENE ARAM. 
 
 (THOMAS HOOD.) 
 
 'Twas in the prime of summer time,

 And four-and -twenty happy boys 
 
 Came bounding out of school : 
 There were some that ran and some that leapt, 
 
 Like troutlets in a pool.

 Away they sped, with gamesome minds, 
 
 And souls untouched b}^ sin ; 
 To a level mead they came, and there 
 
 They drave the wickets in: 
 Pleasantly shone the setting sun 
 
 Over the town of Lynn. 
 
 Like sportive deer they coursed about, 
 
 And shouted as they ran, — 
 Turning to mirth all things of earth, 
 
 As only boj'hood can ; 
 But the IJsher sat remote from all, 
 
 A melancholy man ! 
 
 His hat was off, his vest apart, 
 To catch heaven's blessed breeze ; 
 
 For a burning thought was in his brow, 
 And his bosom ill at ease : 
 
 So he lean'd his head on his hands, and read 
 The book between his knees ! 
 
 Leaf after leaf he turn'd it o'er, 
 
 Nor ever glanced aside, 
 For the peace of his soul he read that book 
 
 In the golden eventide : 
 Much stud} 7- had made him very lean, 
 
 And pale, and leaden-eyed. 
 
 At last he shut the ponderous tome, 
 
 With a fast and fervent grasp 
 He strain 'd the dusky covers close, 
 
 And fix'd the brazen hasp : 
 " Oh, God ! could I so close my mind, 
 
 And clasp it with a clasp !" 
 
 Then leaping on his feet upright, 
 
 Some moody turns he took, — 
 Now up the mead, then down the mead, 
 
 And past a shady nook, — 
 And, lo! he saw a little boy 
 
 That pored upon a book !

 Romance or fairy fable ? 
 Or is it some historic page, 
 
 Of kings and crowns unstable ?" 
 The young boy gave an upward glance, — 
 
 " It is ' The Death of Abel. ' » 
 
 The Usher took six hasty strides, 
 
 As smit with sudden pain, — 
 Six hasty strides beyond the place, 
 
 Then slowly back again ; 
 And down he sat beside the lad, 
 
 And talk'd with him of Cain ; 
 
 And, long since then, of bloody men 
 
 Whose deeds tradition saves ; 
 Of lonely folk cut off unseen, 
 
 And hid in sudden graves ; 
 Of horrid stabs, in groves forlorn, 
 
 And murders done in caves ; 
 
 And how the sprites of injured men 
 
 Shriek upward from the sod, — 
 Ay, how the ghostly hand will point 
 
 To show the burial clod ; 
 And unknown facts of guilty acts 
 
 Are seen in dreams from God ; 
 
 He told how murderers walked the earth 
 
 Beneath the curse of Cain, — 
 With crimson clouds before their eyes, 
 
 And flames about their brain : 
 For blood has left upon their souls 
 
 Its everlasting stain ! 
 
 "And well," quoth he, " I know, for truth, 
 
 Their pangs must be extreme, — 
 Woe, woe, unutterable woe, —

 The ringers rang by two, by three; 
 
 " Pull, if 3 r e never pulled before ; 
 
 Good ringers, pull } r our best," quoth he. 
 
 " Play uppe, play uppe, O Boston bells !

 But in nryne ears doth still abide 
 The message that the bells let fall : 
 
 And there was nought of strange, beside 
 
 The flight of mews and peewits pied 
 
 By millions crouched on the old sea-wall.

 Ere the early dews were falling,

 From the meads where melick groweth 
 Faintly came her milking song —

 She plucked that piece of geranium flower, 
 Beginning to die too, in the glass. 
 
 Little has yet been changed, I think : 
 The shutters are shut, no light may pass 
 
 Save two long rays through the hinge's chink. 
 
 Sixteen years old when she died ! 
 
 Perhaps she had scarcely heard my name ; 
 It was not her time to love ; beside, 
 
 Her life had many a hope and aim,

 Duties enough, and little cares, 
 
 And now was quiet, now astir, 
 Till God's hand beckoned unawares, — 
 
 And the sweet white brow is all of her. 
 
 Is it too late then, Evelyn Hope ? 
 
 What, your soul was pure and true, 
 The good stars met in } r our horoscope, 
 
 Made you of spirit, fire and dew, — 
 And just because I was thrice as old, 
 
 And our paths in the world diverged so wide, 
 Each was nought to each, must I be told ? 
 
 We were fellow-mortals, nought beside ? 
 
 No, indeed ! for God above 
 
 Is great to grant, as mighty to make, 
 And creates the love to reward the love : 
 
 I claim you still, for my own love's sake ! 
 Delayed it may be for more lives yet, 
 
 Through worlds I shall traverse, not a few : 
 Much is to learn and much to forget 
 
 Ere the time be come for taking 3-011. 
 
 But the time will come, — at last it will, 
 
 When, Evetyn Hope, what meant, I shall say, 
 In the lower earth, in the years long still, 
 
 That body and soul so pure and gay ? 
 Why your hair was amber, I shall divine, 
 
 And your mouth of your own geranium's red — 
 And what you would do with me, in fine, 
 
 In the new life come in the old one's stead. 
 
 I have lived, I shall say, so much since then, 
 
 Given up myself so many times, 
 Gained me the gains of various men, 
 
 Ransacked the ages, spoiled the climes ; 
 Yet one thing, one, in my soul's full scope, 
 
 Either I missed or itself massed me — 
 And I want and find you, Evelyn Hope! 
 
 What is the issue ? let us see !

 There was place and to spare for the frank young smile 
 
 And the red young mouth, and the hair's young gold. 
 So, hush, — I will give you this leaf to keep —

 ABOU BEN ADHEM. 
 (LEIGH HUNT.) 
 
 " Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase !) 
 Awoke one night from a sweet dream of peace, 
 And saw, within the moonlight in his room, 
 Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom, 
 An angel, writing in a book of gold. 
 Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold, 
 And to the Presence in the room he said, 
 1 What writest thou V The vision raised its head, 
 And, with a look made all of sweet accord, 
 Answered — ' The names of those who love the Lord.' 
 ' And is mine one ?' said Abou ; ' Nay, not so,' 
 Replied the angel. — Abou spoke more low, 
 But cheerily still ; and said, ' I pray thee, then, 
 Write me as one that loves his fellow- men.' 
 
 " The angel wrote, and vanish 'd. The next night 
 It came again, with a great wakening light, 
 And showed the names whom love of God had bless'd- 
 And, lo ! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest."

 A PSALM FROM LIFE. 
 (LONGFELLOW.) 
 
 Tell me not, in mournful numbers, 
 " Life is but an empt}^ dream !" 
 
 For the soul is dead that slumbers, 
 And things are not what thej r seem, 
 
 Life is real ! life is earnest! 
 
 And the grave is not its goal ; 
 "Dust thou art, to dust returnest," 
 
 Was not spoken of the soul. 
 
 Not enjoyment, and not sorrow, 
 Is our destined end or way ; 
 
 But to act, that each to-morrow, 
 Find us farther than to-day. 
 
 Art is long, and Time is fleeting, 
 
 And our hearts, though stout and brave 
 
 Still, like muffled drums, are beating, 
 Funeral marches to the grave.

 VAT YOU PLEASE. 
 
 (WM. B. FOWLE.) 
 
 Two Frenchmen, who had just come over, 
 
 Half starved but always gay 
 
 (No weasels ere were thinner,) 
 Trudged up to town from Dover, 
 
 Their slender store exhausted on the way, 
 
 Extremely puzzled how to get a dinner. 
 From morn till noon, from noon till dewy eve, 
 
 Our Frenchmen wandered on their expedition ; 
 Great was their need, and sorely did they grieve, 
 
 Stomach and pocket in the same condition. 
 At length by mutual consent they parted, 
 And different ways on the same errand started. 
 
 Towards night, one Frenchman at a tavern door 
 
 Stopped, entered, all the preparation saw ; 
 
 The ready waiter at his elbow stands, — 
 
 " Sir, will you favor me with your commands, 
 
 Roast goose or ducks, sir, choose you that or these ?" — 
 
 " Bare, you are very kine, sare, vat you please." 
 
 It was a glorious treat, pie, pudding, cheese and meat ; 
 At last the Frenchman, having eaten his fill, 
 Prepared to go, when, — " Here, sir, is your bill I" — 
 " 0, you are Bill — Veil, Mr. Bill, good-day /" — 
 " My name is Tom, sir — you've this bill to pay." —

 " Pay, pay, ma foi !

 You show to me the pooden, goose and sheeze, 
 You ask me vat I eat — / tell you vat you please." 
 The waiter, softened by his queer grimace, 
 Could not help laughing in the Frenchman's face, 
 And generously tore the bill in two, 
 Forgave the hungry trick, and let him go. 
 
 Our Frenchman's appetite subdued, 
 
 Away he chaseed in a merry mood, 
 
 And, turning round the corner of a street, 
 
 His hungry countryman perchanced to meet, 
 
 When, with a grin, 
 
 He told how he had taken John Bull in. 
 
 Fired with the tale, the other licks his chops, 
 
 Makes his congee, and seeks this shop of shops 
 
 Entering, he seats himself as if at ease, — 
 
 " What will you have, sir?" — " Vat you please. 17 
 
 The waiter saw the joke, and shyly took 
 
 A whip, and with a very gracious look 
 
 Sought instantly the Frenchman's seat, 
 
 " What will you have, sir ?" venturing to repeat ; — 
 
 Our Frenchman, feeling sure of goose and cheese. 
 
 With bow and smile, quick answers — ? u Vat you please I" 
 
 But scarcely had he let the sentence slip, 
 
 When round his shoulders twines the pliant whip. 
 
 " Sare ! save ! ah misericorde ! parbleu !

 Deserves the goose he gained, sir, by his cunning ; 
 But you, monsieur, without my dinner tasting, 
 Are goose enough, — and only want a basting."

 THE ANGELS OF BUENA VISTA. 
 (j. G. WHITTIER.) 
 
 A letter-writer from Mexico states that, at the terrible fight 
 of Buena Yista, Mexican women were seen hovering near the 
 field -of death, for the purpose of giving aid and succor to 
 the wounded. One poor woman was found surrounded by 
 the maimed and suffering of both armies, ministering to the 
 wants of Americans as well as Mexicans with impartial ten- 
 derness. 
 
 Speak and tell us, our Xiinena, looking northward far 
 
 away. 
 O'er the camp of the invaders, o'er the Mexican array, 
 Who is losing ? who is winning ? are they far, or come 
 
 they near ? 
 Look abroad, and tell us, sister, whither rolls the storm 
 
 we hear. 
 
 " Jesu, pity ! how it thickens ! now retreat and now 
 
 advance ! 
 Right against the blazing cannon shiver Puebla's 
 
 charging lines ! 
 Down they go, the brave young riders ; horse and foot 
 
 together fall ; 
 Like the ploughshare in its furrow, through them 
 
 ploughs the northern ball." 
 
 11 my heart's love ! my dear one ! lay thy poor head 
 
 on my knee ; 
 Dost thou know the lips that kiss thee ? Canst thou 
 
 hear me, canst thou see ? 
 my husband, brave and gentle ! my Bernal, look 
 
 once more 
 On the blessed Cross before thee ! Mercy ! mercy ! all 
 
 is o'er !" 
 
 Dry thy tears, my poor Ximena; lay thy dear one 
 
 down to rest ; 
 Let his hands be meekly folded ; lay the Cross upon 
 
 his breast ;

 Let Lis dirge be sung hereafter, and his funeral masses

 To-day, thou poor bereaved one, the living ask thy aid. 
 
 Close beside her faintly moaning, fair and young, a 
 
 soldier lay, 
 Torn with shot and pierced with lances, bleeding slow 
 
 his life away ; 
 But, as tenderly before hirn then the lorn Xhnena knelt, 
 She saw the northern hostile Eagle shining on his 
 
 pistol-belt. 
 
 With a stifled cry of horror straight she turned away 
 her head ; 
 
 With a sad and bitter feeling looked she back upon her 
 dead ; 
 
 But she heard the youth's low moaning, and his strug- 
 gling breath of pain. 
 
 And she raised the cooling water to his parching lips 
 again. 
 
 " A bitter curse upon them, boy, who to battle led thee 
 
 forth, 
 From some gentle, saddened mother, weeping lonely 
 
 in the North !" 
 Spake the mournful Mexic woman, as she laid him with 
 
 her dead, 
 And turned to soothe the living still, and bind the 
 
 wounds which bled. 
 
 Look forth once more, Ximena! " Like a cloud before

 Rolls the battle down the mountains, leaving blood and 
 
 death behind : 
 Ah ! they plead in vain for mercy ; in the dust the

 battle rolled, 
 In its sheath the sabre rested, and the cannon's lips 
 
 grew cold. 
 
 But the noble Mexic women still their holy task pur- 
 sued, 
 
 Through that long, dark night of sorrow, worn and 
 faint, and lacking food ; 
 
 Over weak and suffering brothers with a tender care 
 they hung, 
 
 And the dying foeman blessed them in a strange and 
 northern tongue. 
 
 Not wholly lost, Father ! is this evil world of ours ; 
 Upward, through its blood and ashes, spring afresh its

 From its smoking hell of battle, Love and Pity send

 And still Thy white-winged angels hover dimly in our

 BEAUTIFUL SNOW.

 Filling the sky and the earth below ; 
 Over the house-tops, over the street, 
 Over the heads of the people you meet ; 
 Dancing, flirting, skimming along, 
 Beautiful snow ! it can do nothing wrong ; 
 Flying to kiss a fair lady's cheek, 
 Clinging to lips in a frolicsome freak, — 
 Beautiful snow, from the heavens above, 
 Pure as an angel, and fickle as love !

 O, the snow, the beautiful snow! 
 
 How the flakes gather and laugh as the}' go! 
 
 Whirling about in its maddening fun, 
 
 It plays in its glee with every one. 
 
 Chasing, laughing, hurrying b}^ 
 
 It lights up the face, and it sparkles the eye ; 
 
 And even the dogs, with a bark and a bound, 
 
 Snap at the crystals that eddy around. 
 
 The town is alive, and its heart in a glow 
 
 To welcome the coming of beautiful snow. 
 
 How the wild crowd goes swa3 T ing along, 
 Hailing each other with humor and song ! 
 How the gay sledges, like meteors flash by, 
 Bright for a moment, then lost to the eye ! 
 Ringing, swinging, dashing they go, 
 Over the crest of the beautiful snow ; 
 Snow so pure when it falls from the sky, 
 To be trampled in mud by the crowd rushing by ; 
 To be trampled and tracked by thousands of feet, 
 Till it blends with the filth in the horrible street. 
 
 Once I was pure as the snow, — but I fell ; 
 Fell, like the snow-flakes from heaven — to hell ; 
 Fell, to be tramped as the filth of the street ; 
 Fell, to be scoffed, to be spit on, and beat. 
 Pleading, cursing, dreading to die, 
 Selling my- soul to whoever would by, — 
 Dealing in shame for a morsel of bread, 
 Hating the living, and fearing the dead. 
 Merciful G od ! have I fallen so low ? 
 And yet I was once like the beautiful snow ! 
 
 How strange it should be that this beautiful snow 
 
 Should fall on a sinner with nowhere to go! 
 
 How strange it would be, when the night comes again, 
 
 If the snow and the ice struck my desperate brain I

 Over the river they beckon to me, 
 
 Loved ones who crossed to the other side ; 
 The gleam of their snowy robes I see, 
 
 But their voices are drowned by the rushing tide. 
 There's one with ringlets of sunny gold, 
 
 And ej^es the reflection of heaven's own blue j 
 He crossed in the twilight gray and cold, 
 
 And the pale mist hid him from mortal view. 
 We saw not the angels that met him there, — 
 
 The gate of the city we could not see ; 
 Over the river, over the river, 
 
 My brother stands, waiting to welcome me. 
 
 Over the river the boatman pale 
 
 Carried another, the household pet ; 
 Her brown curls waved in the gentle gale,— 
 
 Darling Minnie ! I see her yet ! 
 She closed on her bosom her dimpled hands, 
 
 And fearlessly entered the phantom bark ; 
 We watched it glide from the silver sands, 
 
 And all our sunshine grew strangely dark. 
 We know she is safe on the further side, 
 
 Where all the ransomed and angels be ; 
 Over the river, the mystic river, 
 
 My childhood's idol is waiting for me. 
 
 For none return from those quiet shores, 
 
 Who cross with the boatman cold and pale ; 
 We hear the dip of the golden oars, 
 
 And catch a glimpse of the snowy sail ; 
 And lo ! they have passed from our yearning hearts, 
 
 They cross the stream and are gone for aye. 
 We may not sunder the vail apart 
 
 That hides from our vision the gates of day ;

 And joyfully sweet will the meeting be, 
 When over the river, the peaceful river, 
 
 The angel of death shall carry me.

 Pick your delicate way through the dampness and dirt, 
 
 Grope through the dark dens, climb the rickety stair 
 To the garret, where wretches, the young and the old, 
 Half starved and half naked, lie crouched from the

 Fade and die in the light of that region sublime ; 
 Where the soul, disenchanted of flesh and of sense, 
 Unscreened by its trappings, and shows, and pretence, 
 Must be clothed for the life and the service above, 
 With purity, truth, faith, meekness, and love ;

 Riding there in his sorry trim,

 And left him alone with his shame and sin.

 For all human ties that bind me, — 
 For the task by God assigned me, — ■ 
 For the bright hope left behind me, 
 And the good that I can do. 
 
 I live to learn their story, 
 
 Who've suffered for my sake ; 
 To emulate their glory, 
 
 And follow in their wake. 
 Bards, patriots, martyrs, sages, 
 The noble of all ages, 
 Whose deeds crowd history's pages, 
 
 And time's great volume make. 
 
 I live to hold communion 
 
 With all that is divine ; 
 To feel there is a union 
 
 'Twixt Nature's heart and mine ; 
 To profit by affliction, 
 Reap truth from fields of fiction, 
 Grow wiser from conviction, 
 
 And fulfil each grand design. 
 
 I live to hail that season, 
 
 By gifted minds foretold, 
 When men shall live \>y reason, 
 
 And not alone by gold, — 
 When man to man united, 
 And every wrong thing righted, 
 The whole world shall be lighted 
 
 As Eden was of old. 
 
 I live for those who love me, 
 For those who know me true, — 
 
 For the heaven that smiles above me, 
 And awaits my spirit too, — 
 
 For the cause that lacks assistance, 
 
 For the wrong that needs resistance, 
 
 For the future in the distance, 
 And the good that I can do.

 WHAT MIGHT BE DONE. 
 (CHARLES MACKAY.) 
 
 What might be done if men were wise ! 
 
 What glorious deeds, my suffering brother, 
 Would they unite, 
 In love and right, 
 And cease their scorn of one another ! 
 
 Oppression's heart might be imbued 
 
 With kindling drops of loving kindness, 
 
 And Knowledge pour, 
 
 From shore to shore, 
 Light on the eyes of mental blindness. 
 
 All Slavery, Warfare, Lies, and Wrong, 
 
 All Yice and Crime, might die together; 
 And wine and corn 
 To each man born 
 Be free as warmth in summer weather. 
 
 The meanest wretch that ever trod, 
 
 The deepest sunk in guilt and sorrow, 
 Might stand erect 
 In self-respect, 
 And share the teeming world to-morrow. 
 
 What might be done ? This might be done, 
 And more than this, my suffering brother,— 
 
 More than the tongue 
 
 E'er said or sung, 
 If men were wise and loved each other.

 The birds caught up our notes of love 
 
 In a song not half so sweet, 
 And earth's green carpet, violet flowered, 
 
 It scarcely felt our feet. 
 
 But, apropos of carpets, Charles, 
 
 I looked at some to-day, 
 Which you will purchase, won't you, dear, 
 
 Before our next soiree ? 
 
 And then, remember you, how, lost 
 
 In love's delicious dream, 
 We long stood silently beside 
 
 A gentle, gliding stream ? 
 
 'Twas Nature's mirror ; when your gaze 
 
 No longer I could bear, 
 I modestly cast down my eyes, 
 
 Yet but to meet it there. 
 
 And, apropos of mirrors, love, 
 
 The dear gift of your mother 
 Is quite old-fashioned, and to-day 
 
 I ordered home another. 
 
 Ah, well do I remember, Charles, 
 
 When first your arm stole round me ; 
 
 You little dreamed how long your soul 
 In golden chains had bound me. 
 
 But apropos of chains, my own, 
 
 At Banks's store last week, 
 I found the sweetest one, so rich, 
 
 So tasteful, and unique ! 
 
 The workmanship is most superb, 
 
 The gold most fine and pure ; 
 I quite long, Charles, to see that chain 
 
 Suspend your miniature !

 THE CURSE OF REGULUS. 
 
 The palaces and domes of Carthage were burning 
 with the splendors of noon, and the blue waves of her 
 harbor were rolling and gleaming in the gorgeous sun- 
 light. An attentive, ear could catch a low murmur, 
 sounding from the centre of the city, which seemed 
 like the moaning of the wind before a tempest. And 
 well it might. The whole people of Carthage, startled, 
 astounded by the report that Regulus had returned, 
 were pouring, a mighty tide, into the great square 
 before the Senate House. There were mothers in that 
 throng, whose captive sons were groaning in Roman 
 fetters ; maidens, whose lovers were dying in the dis- 
 tant dungeons of Rome ; gray-haired men and matrons, 
 whom Roman steel had made childless ; men, who were 
 seeing their country's life crushed out by Roman 
 power ; and with wild voices, cursing and groaning, the 
 vast throng gave vent to the rage, the hate, the an- 
 guish of long years.

 Calm and unmoved as the marble walls around him, 
 stood Regulus, the Roman ! He stretched his arm 
 over the surging crowd with a gesture as proudly im- 
 perious, as though he stood at the head of his own 
 gleaming cohorts. Before that silent command the 
 tumult ceased — the half-uttered execration died upon 
 the lip — so intense was the silence that the clank of 
 the captive's brazen manacles smote sharp on every 
 ear, as he thus addressed them : 
 
 " Ye doubtless thought, judging of Roman virtue by 
 your own, that I would break my plighted faith, rather 
 than by returning, and leaving }^our sons and brothers 
 to rot in Roman dungeons, to meet your vengeance. 
 Well, I could give reasons for this return, foolish and 
 inexplicable as it seems to you ; I could speak of 
 yearnings after immortality — of those eternal princi- 
 ples in whose pure light a patriot's death is glorious, a 
 thing to be desired ; but, b}^ great Jove ! I should de- 
 base myself to dwell on such high themes to you. If 
 the bright blood which feeds my heart were like the 
 slimy ooze that stagnates in your veins, I should have 
 remained at Rome, saved my life and broken my oath. 
 If, then, 3^011 ask, why I have come back, to let you 
 work your will on this poor body which I esteem but 
 as the rags that cover it, — enough reply for you, it is 
 because I am a Roman ! As such, here in your very 
 capital I defy you ! What I have done, ye never can 
 undo ; what ye may do, I care not. Since first my 
 young arm knew how to wield a Roman sword, have I 
 not routed your armies, burned your towns, and 
 dragged your generals at my chariot wheels ? And do 
 ye now expect to see me cower and whine with dread 
 of Carthaginian vengeance ? Compared to that fierce 
 mental strife which my heart has just passed through 
 at Rome, the piercing of this flesh, the rending of 
 these sinews, would be but sport to me. 
 
 " Venerable senators, with trembling voices and out- 
 stretched hands, besought me to return no more to 
 Carthage. The generous people, with loud wailing, 
 and wildly-tossing gestures, bade me stay. The voice

 flowing down her furrowed cheeks — praying me not to 
 leave her in her lonely and helpless old age, is still 
 sounding in my ears. Compared to anguish like this, 
 the paltry torments you have in store is as the murmur 
 of the meadow brook to the wild tumult of the moun-

 woes I see impending over this fated city will be 
 enough to sweeten death, though every nerve should 
 tingle with its agony. I die — but mine shall be the 
 triumph; yours the untold desolation. For every drop

 disrobed, uncrowned and scourged — thus again do I 
 devote thee to the infernal gods !

 Up and down the sands of gold.

 His beard of snow

 With her foot upon the sands, 
 
 Decked with flags and streamers gay,

 Ready to be

 THE CUMBERLAND. 
 
 (H. W. LONGFELLOW.) 
 
 At anchor in Hampton Roads we lay, 
 
 On board of the Cumberland, sloop-of-war ; 
 And at times from the fortress across the bay 
 The alarum of drums swept past, 
 Or a bugle blast 
 From the camp on the shore. 
 
 Then far away to the south uprose 
 
 A little feather of snow-white smoke, 
 And we knew that the iron ship of our foes 
 Was steadily steering its course, 
 To try the force, 
 Of our ribs of oak. 
 
 Down upon us heavily runs, 
 
 Silent and sullen, the floating fort ; 
 Then comes a puff of smoke from her guns, 
 And leaps the terrible death, 
 With fiery breath, 
 From each open port. 
 
 We are not idle but send her straight 
 
 Defiance back in a full broadside I 
 As hail rebounds from a roof of slate, 
 Rebounds our heavier hail 
 From each iron scale 
 Of the monster's hide. 
 
 " Strike your flag !" the rebel cries, 
 
 In his arrogant old plantation strain. 
 " Never 1" our gallant Morris replies ; 
 " It is better to sink than to yield !" 
 And the whole air pealed 
 With the cheers of the men.

 Then, like a kraken huge and black, 
 
 She crushed our ribs in her iron grasp ! 
 Down went the Cumberland all a wrack, 
 With a sudden shudder of death, 
 And the cannon's breath 
 For her dying gasp. 
 
 Xext morn, as the sun rose over the bay, 
 
 Still floated our flag nt the mainmast-head. 
 Lord, how beautiful was thy day ! 
 Every waft of the air 
 Was a whisper of prayer, 
 Or a dirge for the dead. 
 
 Ho ! brave hearts that went down in the seas 
 
 Ye are at peace in the troubled stream, 
 Ho ! brave land ! with hearts like these,

 THE RAVEN. 
 (edgar a. poe.) 
 
 Once upon a midnight dreary, while I ponder'd, weak 
 and weary, 
 
 Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten 
 lore, — 
 
 While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came 
 a tapping, 
 
 As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my cham- 
 ber-door. 
 
 " 'Tis some visitor," I mutter'd, "tapping at ray cham- 
 ber-door — 
 
 Only this, and nothing more." 
 
 Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak Decem- 
 ber, 
 
 And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost 
 upon the floor.

 Eagerly I wish'd the morrow : vainly I had sought to 
 
 borrow 
 From my books surcease of sorrow — sorrow for the 
 
 lost Lenore — 
 For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels 
 
 name Lenore — 
 
 Nameless here forevermore. 
 
 And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple 
 curtain, 
 
 Thrill'd me — fill'd me with fantastic terrors never felt 
 before ; 
 
 So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood 
 repeating, 
 
 " 'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber- 
 door, — 
 
 Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber- 
 door ; 
 
 That it is, and nothing more." 
 
 Presently my soul grew stronger : hesitating then no 
 longer, 
 
 "Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly your forgiveness I 
 implore ; 
 
 But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you came 
 rapping, 
 
 And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my cham- 
 ber-door', 
 
 That I scarce was. sure I heard you" — here I open'd 
 wide the door ; 
 
 Darkness there, and nothing: more. 
 
 Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there, 
 
 wondering, fearing, 
 Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to 
 
 dream before ; 
 But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave 
 
 no token,

 And the only word there spoken was the whisper'd 
 
 word, " Lenore !" 
 This I whisper'd, and an echo murmur'd back the word, 
 
 " Lenore !" 
 
 Merely this, and nothing more. 
 
 Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me 
 
 burning, 
 Soon again I heard a tapping, something louder than 
 
 before. 
 "Surely," said I, "surely that is something at my 
 
 window-lattice ; 
 Let me see then what thereat is, and this n^stery 
 
 explore, — 
 Let my heart be still a moment, and this n^stery 
 
 explore ; 
 
 'Tis the wind, and nothing more." 
 
 Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt 
 and flutter, 
 
 In there stepp'd a stately raven of the saintly days of 
 yore. 
 
 Not the least obeisance made he ; not a minute stopp'd 
 or stay'd he ; 
 
 But, with mien of lord or lady, perch'd above my 
 chainber-door, — 
 
 Perch'd upon a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber- 
 door — 
 
 Perched and sat and nothing more. 
 
 Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into 
 
 smiling, 
 By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it 
 
 wore, 
 " Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, 
 
 " art sure no craven ; 
 Ghastly, grim, and ancient raven, wandering from the 
 
 nightly shore, 
 Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's Pluto* 
 
 nian shore ?" 
 
 Quoth the raven, "Nevermore !"

 Much T marvell'd this ungainly fowl to hear discourse 
 
 so plainly, 
 Though its answer little meaning- — little relevancy 
 
 bore ; 
 For we cannot help agreeing that no living human 
 
 being 
 Ever yet was bless'd with seeing bird above his cham 
 
 ber-door — 
 Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his 
 
 chamber-door, 
 
 With such name as " Nevermore !" 
 
 But the raven sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke 
 
 only 
 That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did 
 
 outpour. 
 Nothing further then he utter'd — not a feather then he 
 
 flutter 'd— 
 Till I scarcely more than mutter'd, " Other friends 
 
 have flown before — 
 On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have 
 
 flown before." 
 
 Then the bird said, " Nevermore !" 
 
 Startled at the stillness, broken by reply so aptly 
 
 spoken, 
 "Doubtless," said I, " what it utters is its only stock 
 
 and store, 
 Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful 
 
 disaster 
 Follow'd fast and follow'd faster, till his songs one 
 
 burden bore, 
 Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden 
 
 bore, 
 
 Of — Never — nevermore I" 
 
 But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into 
 
 smiling, 
 Straight I wheel'd a cushion'd seat in front of bird, 
 
 and bust, and door.

 Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to 
 
 linking 
 Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of 
 
 yore— 
 What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous 
 
 bird of yore 
 
 Meant in croaking " Nevermore !" 
 
 This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable ex- 
 pressing 
 
 To the fowl, whose fiery eyes now burn'd into my 
 bosom's core. 
 
 This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease 
 reclining 
 
 On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light 
 gloated o'er, 
 
 But whose velvet violet lining, with the lamp-light 
 gloating o'er, 
 
 She shall press — ah ! nevermore ! 
 
 Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed from 
 
 an unseen censer 
 Swung by seraphim, whose foot-falls tinkled on the 
 
 tufted floor. 
 "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee — by these

 Quoth the raven, " Nevermore I" 
 
 "Prophet!" said I, " thing of evil! — prophet still, if

 By that heaven that bends above us — by that God we 
 
 both adore, 
 Tell this soul, with sorrow laden, if, within the distant 
 
 Aidenn, 
 It shall clasp a sainted maiden, whom the angels 
 
 name Lenore ; 
 Clasp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels 
 
 name Lenore I" 
 
 Quoth the raven, " Nevermore !" 
 
 " Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend !" I 
 
 shriek'd, upstarting — 
 " Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's 
 
 Plutonian shore ! 
 Leave no blaek plume as a token of that lie thy soul 
 
 hath spoken ! 
 Leave my loneliness unbroken ! — quit the bust above

 Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form

 Quoth the raven, "Nevermore!" 
 
 And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is 
 sitting 
 
 On the pallid bust of Pallas, just above my chamber- 
 door ; 
 
 And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is 
 dreaming, 
 
 And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his 
 shadow on the floor ; 
 
 And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating 
 on the floor 
 
 Shall be lifted — nevermore !

 Hear the loud alarum bells — 
 Brazen bells ! 
 What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells ! 
 In the startled ear of night 
 How they scream out their affright ! 
 Too much horrified to speak, 
 The}^ can only shriek, shriek, 
 Out of tune, 
 In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire, 
 In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire 
 Leaping higher, higher, higher, 
 With a desperate desire, 
 And a resolute endeavor, 
 Now — now to sit or never, 
 By the side of the pale-faced moon. 
 Oh, the bells, bells, bells ! 
 What a tale their terror tells 
 Of despair ! 
 How they clang, and clash, and roar ! 
 What a horror they outpour 
 On the bosom of the palpitating air ! 
 Yet the ear, it fully knows, 
 By the twanging 
 And the clanging, 
 How the danger ebbs and flows ; 
 Yet the ear distinctly tells, 
 In the jangling 
 And the wrangling, 
 How the danger sinks and swells, 
 By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells — 
 Of the bells— 
 Of the bells, bells, bells, bells, 
 Bells, bells, bells— 
 In the clamor and the clangor of the bells ! 
 
 Hear the tolling of the bells — 
 Iron bells ! 
 What a "world of solemn thought their monody compels! 
 In the silence of the night, 
 How we shiver with affright 
 At the melancholy menace of their tone !

 From the rust within their throats

 EXCELSIOR. 
 
 (H. W. LONGFELLOW.) 
 
 The shades of night were falling fast, 
 As through an Alpine village passed 
 A youth, who bore, mid snow and ice, 
 A banner with the strange device, 
 Excelsior ! 
 
 His brow was sad ; his eye, beneath, 
 Flashed like a falchion from its sheath ; 
 And like a silver clarion rung 
 The accents of that unknown tongue, 
 Excelsior ! 
 
 In happy homes he saw the light 
 Of household fires gleam warm and bright: 
 Above, the spectral glaciers shone : 
 And from his lips escaped a groan, 
 Excelsior ! 
 
 " Try not to pass !" the old man said ; 
 " Dark lowers the tempest overhead ; 
 The roaring torrent is deep and wide !"— 
 And loud that clarion voice replied, 
 Excelsior! 
 
 "Oh! stay," the maiden said, "and rest 
 Thy weary head upon this breast !" 
 A tear stood in his bright blue eye ; 
 But still he answered, with a sigh, 
 Excelsior ! 
 
 " Beware the pine-tree's withered branch! 
 Beware the awful avalanche!" 
 This was the peasant's last good-night ; — 
 A voice replied, far up the height, 
 Excelsior !

 A voice cried, through the startled air,

 A traveller, — by the faithful hound, 
 Half buried iu the snow, was found, 
 Still grasping, in his haud of ice, 
 The banner with the strange device,

 Lifeless, but beautiful, he lay ;

 THE FAMINE. 
 
 (H. W. LONGFELLOW.) 
 
 O the long and dreary Winter ! 
 
 the cold and cruel Winter ! 
 
 Ever thicker, thicker, thicker, 
 
 Froze the ice on lake and river ; 
 
 Ever deeper, deeper, deeper, 
 
 Fell the snow o'er all the landscape, 
 
 Fell the covering snow, and drifted 
 
 Through the forest, round the village. 
 
 Hardly from his buried wigwam 
 
 Could the hunter force a passage ; 
 
 With his mittens and his snow-shoes 
 
 Yainly walk'd he through the forest, 
 
 Sought for bird or beast and found none ; 
 
 Saw no track of deer or rabbit, 
 
 In the snow beheld no footprints, 
 
 In the ghastly, gleaming forest 
 
 Fell, and could not rise from weakness, 
 
 Perish'd there from cold and hunger.

 All the earth was sick and famish'd ; 
 Hungry was the air around them, 
 Hungry was the sky above them, 
 And the hungry stars in heaven 
 Like the eyes of wolves glared at them! 
 
 Into Hiawatha's wigwam 
 Came two other guests, as silent 
 As the ghosts were, and as gloomy, 
 Waited not to be invited, 
 Did not parley at the doorway, 
 Sat there without word of welcome 
 In the seat of Laughing Water; 
 Looked with haggard eyes and hollow 
 At the face of Laughing Water. 
 And the foremost said : " Behold me !

 And the other said : " Behold me! 
 I am Fever, Ahkosewin !" 
 And the lovely Minnehaha 
 Shudder'd as they look'd upon her, 
 Shudder'd at the words the} 7 utter'd, 
 Lay down on her bed in silence,. 
 Hid her face, but made no answer ; 
 Lay there trembling, freezing, burning 
 At the looks they cast upon her, 
 At the fearful words they utter'd. 
 
 Forth into the empty forest 
 
 Rushed the madden'd Hiawatha ; 
 
 In his heart was deadly sorrow, 
 
 In his face a stony firmness, 
 
 On his brow the sweat of anguish 
 
 Started, but it froze and fell not.

 Cried he with his face uplifted 
 In that bitter hour of anguish, 
 " Give } T our children food, father ! 
 Give us food, or we must perish I 
 Give me food for Minnehaha,

 Through the far-resounding forest, 
 Through the forest vast and vacant

 But there came no other answer 
 Than the echo of his crying, 
 Than the echo of the woodlands,

 In that melancholy forest, 
 
 Through the shadow of whose thickets, 
 
 In the pleasant days of Summer, 
 
 Of that ne'er forgotten Summer, 
 
 He had brought his .young wife homeward 
 
 From the land of the Dakotahs ; 
 
 When the birds sang in the thickets, 
 
 And the streamlets laugh'd and glisten'd, 
 
 And the air was full of fragrance,

 Said with voice that did not tremble,

 Far away amid the forest, 
 
 Miles away among the mountains, 
 
 Heard that sudden cry of anguish, 
 
 Heard the voice of Minnehaha 
 
 Calling to him in the darkness, 
 
 " Hiawatha ! Hiawatha !" 
 
 Over snow-fields waste and pathless, 
 Under snow-encumber'd branches, 
 Homeward hurried Hiawatha, 
 Empty-handed, heavy-hearted, 
 Heard Nokomis moaning, wailing : 
 " Wahonowin ! Wahonowin ! 
 Would that I had perish 'd for you, 
 Would that I were dead as you are !

 Utter'd such a cry of anguish, 
 
 That the forest moan'd and shudder'd, 
 
 That the very stars in heaven 
 
 Shook and trembled with his anguish. 
 
 Then he sat down still and speechless, 
 On the bed of Minnehaha, 
 At the feet of Laughing Water, 
 At those willing feet, that never 
 More would lightly run to meet him, 
 Never more would lightly follow. 
 With both hands his face he cover'd, 
 Seven long days and nights he sat there. 
 As if in a swoon he sat there, 
 Speechless, motionless, unconscious 
 Of the daylight or the darkness. 
 
 Then they buried Minnehaha ; 
 In the snow a grave they made her, 
 In the forest deep and darksome, 
 Underneath the moaning hemlocks ; 
 Clothed her in her richest garments ; 
 Wrapp'd her in her robes of ermine, 
 Cover'd her with snow, like ermine: 
 Thus they buried Minnehaha, 
 And at night a fire was lighted, 
 On her grave four times was kindled, 
 For her soul upon its journey 
 To the Islands of the Blessed. 
 From his doorway Hiawatha 
 Saw it burning in the forest, 
 Lighting up the gloomy hemlocks ; 
 From his sleepless bed uprising, 
 From the bed of Minnehaha, 
 Stood and watch 'd it at the doorway^ 
 That it might not be extinguish 'd, 
 Might not leave her in the darkness. 
 
 " Farewell !" said he, " Minnehaha ! 
 Farewell, my Laughing Water !

 LIBERTY AND UNION. 
 
 (WEBSTER.) 
 
 I profess, sir, in my career hitherto, to have kept 
 steadily in view the prosperity and honor of the whole 
 country, and the preservation of our federal union. It 
 is to that union we owe our safet}^ at home, and our 
 consideration and dignity abroad. It is to that union 
 that we are chiefly indebted for whatever makes us 
 most proud of our country. That union we reached, 
 only by the discipline of our virtues in the severe 
 school of adversity. It had its origin in the necessities 
 of disordered finance, prostrate commerce, and ruined 
 credit. Under its benign influences, these great inter- 
 ests immediately awoke, as from the dead, and sprang 
 forth with newness of life. Every year of its duration 
 has teemed with fresh proofs of its utility and its bless- 
 ings ; and, although our territory has stretched out 
 wider and wider, and our population spread farther 
 and farther, they have not outrun its protection or its 
 benefits. It has been to ns all, a copious fountain of 
 national, social, and personal happiness. 
 
 I have not allowed myself, sir, to look beyond the 
 union, to see what might lie hidden in the dark recess 
 behind. I have not coolly weighed the chances of pre- 
 serving liberty, when the bonds that unite us together 
 shall be broken asunder. I have not accustomed my-

 self to hang over the precipice of disunion, to see 
 whether, with my short sight, I can fathom the depth 
 of the abyss below ; nor could I regard him as a safe 
 counsellor in the affairs of this government, whose 
 thoughts should be mainly bent on considering, not 
 how the union should be preserved, but how tolerable 
 might be the condition of the people, when it shall be 
 broken up and destined. 
 
 While the union lasts, we have high, exciting, grati- 
 fying prospects spread out before us, for us and our 
 children. Beyond that, I seek not to penetrate the 
 vail. God grant, that in my day, at least, that curtain 
 may not rise. God grant, that on my vision never 
 ma}' be opened what lies behind. When my eyes shall 
 be turned to behold, for the last time, the sun in hea- 
 ven, may I not see him shining on the broken and dis- 
 honored fragments of a once glorious union ; on states 
 dissevered, discordant, belligerent ; on a land rent with 
 civil feuds, or drenched, it may be, in fraternal blood ! 
 Let their last feeble and lingering glance, rather, be- 
 hold the gorgeous ensign of the republic, now known 
 and honored throughout the earth, still full high ad- 
 vanced, its arms and trophies streaming in their origi- 
 nal lustre ; not a stripe erased or polluted, nor a single 
 star obscured, bearing for its motto, no such miserable 
 interrogatory as, What is all this worth? nor those 
 other words of delusion and folly: Liberty first, and 
 union afterwards ; but everywhere, spread all over in 
 characters of living light, blazing on all its ample folds, 
 as they float over the sea, and over the land, and in 
 every wind under the whole heavens, that other senti- 
 ment, dear to every true American heart, Liberty and 
 union, now and forever, one and inseparable ! 
 
 OH, VfHY SHOULD THE SPIRIT OF MORTAL BE PROUD?

 A flash of the lightnino-, a break of the wave,

 BINGEN ON THE RHINE.

 A soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers, 
 
 There was lack of woman's nursing, there was dearth

 But a comrade stood beside him, while his life-blood

 And bent, with pitying glances, to hear what he might 
 
 say. 
 The d} T ing soldier falter'd, as he took that comrade's

 And he said, " I never more shall see my own, my

 Take a message, and a token, to some distant friends

 For I was born at Bingen — at Bingen on the Rhine.

 ground, 
 That we fought the battle bravely, and when the day 
 
 was done, 
 Full many a corse lay ghastly pale, beneath the setting 
 
 sun. 
 And midst the dead and dying, were some grown old 
 
 in wars, 
 The death wound on their gallant breasts, the last of 
 
 many scars : 
 But some were } r oung — and suddenly beheld life's 
 
 morn decline ; 
 And one had come from Bingen — fair Bingen on the 
 
 Rhine !

 For in}' father was a soldier, and even as a child 
 
 My heart leap'd forth to hear him tell of struggles 
 
 fierce and wild ; 
 And when he died, and left us to divide his scanty 
 
 hoard, 
 I let them take whate'er they would, but kept my 
 
 father's sword, 
 And with boyish love I hung it where the bright light 
 
 used to shine, 
 On the cottage-wall at Bingen — calm Bingen on the 
 
 Rhine 1 
 
 " Tell my sister not to weep for me, and sob with 
 
 drooping head, 
 When the troops are marching home again, with glad 
 
 and gallant tread ; 
 But to look upon them proudly, with a calm and 
 
 steadfast eye, 
 For her brother was a soldier too, and not afraid to die. 
 And if a comrade seek her love, I ask her in my name 
 To listen to him kindly, without regret or shame ; 
 And to hang the old sword in its place (my father's 
 
 sword and mine), 
 For the honor of old Bingen — dear Bingen on the 
 
 Rhine ! 
 
 " There's another — not a sister ; in the happy days 
 gone by, 
 
 You'd have known her by the merriment that sparkled 
 in her eye ; 
 
 Too innocent for coquetry, — too fond for idle scorn- 
 ing,— 
 
 Oh ! friend, I fear the lightest heart makes sometimes 
 heaviest mourning ; 
 
 Tell her the last night of my life (for ere the moon be 
 risen 
 
 My body will be out of pain — my soul be out of prison), 
 
 I dream 'd I stood with her, and saw the yellow sun- 
 light shine 
 
 On the vine-clad hills of Bingen — fair Bingen on the 
 Rhine !

 "I saw the blue Rhine sweep along — I heard, or 
 seem'd to hear, 
 
 The German songs we used to sing, in chorus sweet 
 and clear ; 
 
 And down the pleasant river, and up the slanting hill, 
 
 The echoing chorus sounded, through the evening calm 
 and still ; 
 
 And her glad blue eyes were on me as we passed with 
 friend \y talk 
 
 Down many a path beloved of yore, and well remem- 
 bered walk, 
 
 And her little hand lay lightly, confidingly in mine : 
 
 But we'll meet no more at Bingen — loved Bingen on 
 the Rhine!" 
 
 His voice grew faint and hoarser, — his grasp was 
 
 childish weak, — 
 His eyes put on a dying look, — he sigh'd and ceased to 
 
 speak : 
 His comrade bent to lift him, but the spark of life had 
 
 fled,— 
 The soldier of the Legion, in a foreign land — was dead ! 
 And the soft moon rose up slowly, and calmly she 
 
 look'd down 
 On the red sand of the battle-field, with bloody corpses 
 
 strown ; 
 Yea, calmly on that dreadful scene her pale light 
 
 seem'd to shine, 
 As it shone on distant Bingen — fair Bingen on the 
 
 Rhine !

 Round about them orchards sweep, 
 Apple and peach tree fruited deep, 
 
 Fair as a garden of the Lord, 
 
 To the eyes of the faniish'd rebel horde, 
 
 On that pleasant morn of the early Fall, 
 When Lee march'd over the mountain wall, 
 
 Over the mountains winding down, 
 Horse and foot, into Frederick town. 
 
 Forty flags with their silver stars, 
 Forty flags with their crimson bars, 
 
 Flapp'd in the morning wind : the sun 
 Of noon look'd down, and saw not one. 
 
 Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then, 
 Bow'd with her fourscore years and ten, 
 
 Bravest of all in Frederick town, 
 
 She took up the flag the men haul'd down. 
 
 In her attic-window the staff she set, 
 To show that one heart was loyal yet. 
 
 Up the street came the rebel tread, 
 Stonewall Jackson riding ahead. 
 
 Under his slouch'd hat left and right 
 He glanced : the old flag met his sight. 
 
 " Halt I" — the dust-brown ranks stood fast ; 
 " Fire !" — out blazed the rifle-blast. 
 
 It shiver'd the window-pane and sash, 
 It rent the banner with seam and gash. 
 
 Quick as it fell from the broken staff, 
 Dame Barbara snatch'd the silken scarf. 
 
 She lean'd far out on the window-sill, 
 And shook it forth with a royal will.

 " Shoot, if yon must, this old gray head, 
 But spare your country's flag," she said. 
 
 A shade of sadness, a blush of shame, 
 Over the face of the leader came ; 
 
 The nobler nature within him stirr'd 
 To life at that woman's deed and word. 
 
 "Who touches a hair of yon gray head 
 Dies like a dog ! March on !" he said. 
 
 All day long through Frederick street 
 Sounded the tread of marching feet ; 
 
 All day long that free flag toss'd 
 Over the heads of the rebel host. 
 
 Ever its torn folds rose and fell 
 
 On the loyal winds that loved it well ; 
 
 And, through the hill-gaps, sunset light 
 Shone over it with a warm good-night. 
 
 Barbara Frietchie's work is o'er, 
 
 And the rebel rides on his raids no more. 
 
 Honor to her ! and let a tear 
 
 Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall's bier. 
 
 Over Barbara Frietchie's grave, 
 Flag of Freedom and Union, wave ! 
 
 Peace and order and beauty draw 
 Round thy symbol of light and law ; 
 
 And ever the stars above look down 
 On thy stars below in Frederick town.

 Beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth 
 Of simple beauty and rustic health. 
 
 Singing, she wrought, and her merry glee 
 The mock-bird echoed from his tree. 
 
 But, when she glanced to the far-off town, 
 White from its hill-slope looking down, 
 
 The sweet song died, and a vague unrest 
 And a nameless longing filled her breast — 
 
 A wish, that she hardly dared to own, 
 For something better than she had known. 
 
 The Judge rode slowly down the lane, 
 Smoothing his horse's chestnut mane. 
 
 He drew his bridle in the shade 
 
 Of the apple-trees, to greet the maid, 
 
 And ask a draught from the spring that flowed 
 Through the meadow across the road. 
 
 She stooped where the cool spring bubbled up, 
 And filled for him her small tin cup, 
 
 And blushed as she gave it, looking down 
 On her feet so bare, and her tattered gown. 
 
 " Thanks!" said the Judge, " a sweeter draught 
 From a fairer hand was never quaffed." 
 
 He spoke of the grass and flowers and trees, 
 Of the singing birds and the humming bees ; 
 
 Then talked of the ha}dng, and wondered whether 
 The cloud in the west would bring foul weather. 
 
 And Maud forgot her brier-torn gown, 
 And her graceful ankles bare and brown ; 
 
 And listened, while a pleased surprise 
 Looked from her long-lashed hazel eyes.

 At last, like one who for delay 
 Seeks a vain excuse, he rode away. 
 
 Maud Muller looked and sighed : " Ah, me ! 
 That I the Judge's bride might be ! 
 
 " He would dress me up in silks so fine, 
 And praise and toast me at his wine. 
 
 " My father should wear a broadcloth coat ; 
 My brother should sail a painted boat. 
 
 " I'd dress my mother so grand and gay ; 
 And the baby should have a new toy each day. 
 
 "And I'd feed the hungry and clothe the poor, 
 And all should bless me who left our door." 
 
 The Judge looked back as he climbed the hill, 
 And saw Maud Muller standing still. 
 
 " A form more fair, a face more sweet, 
 Ne'er hath it been my lot to meet. 
 
 " And her modest answer and graceful air 
 Show her wise and good as she is fair. 
 
 " Would she were mine, and I to-day, 
 Like her, a harvester of hay: 
 
 " No doubtful balance of rights and wrongs, 
 JSTor weary lawyers with endless tongues, 
 
 "But low of cattle and song of birds, 
 And health and quiet and loving words." 
 
 But he thought of his sisters proud and cold, 
 And his mother vain of her rank and gold. 
 
 So, closing his heart, the Judge rode on, 
 And Maud was left in the field alone. 
 
 But the lawyers smiled that afternoon, 
 When he hummed in court an old love-tune ;

 He wedded a wife of richest dower, 
 Who lived for fashion, as he for power. 
 
 Yet oft, in his marble hearth's bright glow, 
 He watched a picture come and go : 
 
 And sweet Maud Muller's hazel eyes 
 Looked out in their innocent surprise. 
 
 Oft, when the wine in his glass was red, 
 He longed for the wayside well instead ; 
 
 And closed his eyes on his garnished rooms, 
 To dream of meadows and clover-blooms. 
 
 And the proud man sighed, with a secret pain ; 
 " Ah, that I were free again ! 
 
 "Free as when I rode that day, 
 
 Where the barefoot maiden raked her hay." 
 
 She wedded a man unlearned and poor, 
 And many children played round her door. 
 
 But care and sorrow, and childbirth pain, 
 Left their traces on heart and brain. 
 
 And oft, when the summer sun shone hot 
 On the new-mown hay in the meadow lot, 
 
 And she heard the little spring brook fall 
 Over the roadside, through the wall, 
 
 In the shade of the apple-tree again 
 She saw a rider draw his rein. 
 
 And, gazing down with timid grace, 
 She felt his pleased eyes read her face.

 Stretched away into stately halls ;

 And for him who sat by the chimney lug, 
 Dozing and grumbling o'er pipe and mug, 
 
 A manly form at her side she saw, 
 And joy was duty and love was law. 
 
 Then she took up her burden of life again, 
 Saying only, " It might have been." 
 
 Alas for maiden, alas for Judge, 
 
 For rich repiner and household drudge ! 
 
 God pity them both ! and pity us all, 
 Who vainly the dreams of youth recall. 
 
 For of all sad words of tongue or pen, 
 
 The saddest are these : " It might have been !" 
 
 Ah, well ! for us all some sweet hope lies 
 Deeply buried from human eyes ; 
 
 And, in the hereafter, angels may 
 Roll the stone from its grave away !

 An' because they loved Erin, an' scorned to sell it, 
 
 A prey for the bloodhound, a mark for the bullet — ■ 
 
 Unsheltered by night, and un rested by clay, 
 
 With the heath for their barrack, revenge for their pay ; 
 
 An' the bravest an' hardiest boy iv them all 
 
 Was Shamus O'Brien, from the town iv Grlingall. 
 
 His limbs were well set, an' his body was light, 
 
 An' the keen-fanged hound had not teeth half so white ; 
 
 But his face was as pale as the face of the dead, 
 
 And his cheek never warmed with the blush of the red. 
 
 An' for all that he wasn't an ugly young bye, 
 
 For the divil himself couldn't blaze with his eye, 
 
 So droll an' so wicked, so dark and so bright, 
 
 Like a fire-flash that crosses the depth of the night ! 
 
 An' he was the best mower that ever has been, 
 
 An' the illigantest hurler that ever was seen, 
 
 An' his clancin' was sich that the men used to stare, 
 
 An' the women turn crazy, he done it so quare ; 
 
 An', by gorra, the whole world gev it into him there. 
 
 An' it's he was the boy that was hard to be caught, 
 
 An' it's often he run, an' it's often he fought, 
 
 An' it's many the one can remember right well 
 
 The quare things he done : an' it's often I heerd tell 
 
 How he lathered the yeomen, himself agin four, 
 
 An' stretched the two strongest on old Galtimore. 
 
 But the fox must sleep sometimes, the wild deer must 
 
 rest, 
 An' treachery prey on the blood iv the best ; 
 Afther man}'- a brave action of power and pride, 
 An' many a haid night on the mountain's bleak side, 
 An' a thousand great dangers and toils overpast, 
 In the darkness of night he was taken at last. 
 
 Now, Shamus, look back on the beautiful moon, 
 For the door of the prison must close on you soon, 
 An' take your last look at her dim lovely light, 
 That falls on the mountain and valley this night ; 
 One look at the village, one look at the flood, 
 An' one at the sheltering, far-distant wood ;

 Bringing fresh to his heart merry da}^s long gone by,

 But the tears didn't fall, for the pride of his heart 
 Would not suffer one drop down his pale cheek to start ; 
 An' he sprang to his feet in the dark prison cave,

 For one minute he turned his eye round on the throng, 
 
 An' he looked at the bars, so firm and so strong, 
 
 An' he saw that he had not a hope nor a friend, 
 
 A chance to escape, nor a word to defend ; 
 
 An' he folded his arms as he stood there alone, 
 
 As cairn and as cold as a statue of stone; 
 
 And they read a big writin', a yard long at laste, 
 
 An' Jim didn't understand it, nor mind it a taste, 
 
 An' the judge took a big pinch iv snuff, and he says, 
 
 " Are you guilty or not, Jim O'Brien, av you plase ?" 
 
 An' all held their breath in the silence of dhread, 
 
 An' Shamus O'Brien made answer and said: 
 
 " My lord, if you ask me, if in my life-time 
 
 I thought any treason, or did any crime 
 
 That should call to my cheek, as I stand alone here, 
 
 The hot blush of shame, or the coldness of fear, 
 
 Though I stood by the grave to receive my death-blow, 
 
 Before God and the world I would answer you, no ! 
 
 But if you would ask me, as I think it like, 
 
 If in the rebellion I carried a pike, 
 
 An' fought for ould Ireland from the first to the close, 
 
 An' shed the heart's blood of her bitterest foes, 
 
 I answer you, yes ; and I tell you again, 
 
 Though I stand here to perish, it's my glory that then 
 
 In her cause I was willing my veins should run dhry, 
 
 An' that now for her sake I am ready to die." 
 
 Then the silence was great, and the jury smiled bright, 
 
 And the judge wasn't sorry the job was made light ; 
 
 By my sowl, it's himself was the crabbed ould chap ! 
 
 In a twinklin' he pulled on his ugly black cap. 
 
 Then Shamus' mother in the crowd standin' by, 
 
 Called out to the judge with a pitiful cry : 
 
 "0, judge ! darlin', don't, 0, don't say the word!

 An' God will forgive you — 0, don't say the word !" 
 That was the first minute that O'Brien was shaken, 
 When he saw that he was not quite forgot or forsaken ; 
 An' down his pale cheeks, at the word of his mother, 
 The big tears wor runnin' fast, one afther th' other ; 
 An' two or three times he endeavored to spake, 
 But the sthrong, manly voice used to falther and break ; 
 But at last, by the strength of his high-mounting pride, 
 He conquered and masthered his grief's swelling tide, 
 "An'," says he, "mother, darlin', don't break your 
 
 poor heart, 
 For, sooner or later, the dearest must part ; 
 And God knows it's betther than wandering in fear 
 On the bleak, trackless mountain, among the wild deer, 
 To lie in the grave, where the head, heart, and breast, 
 From thought, labor, and sorrow, forever shall rest. 
 Then, mother, my darlin', don't cry any more, 
 Don't make me seem broken, in this, my last hour ; 
 For I wish, when my head's lyin' under the raven, 
 No thrue man can say that I died like a craven !" 
 Then towards the judge Shamus bent down his head, 
 An' that minute the solemn death-sentince was said. 
 
 The mornin' was bright, an' the mists rose on high, 
 
 An' the lark whistled merrily in the clear sky ; 
 
 But why are the men standin' idle so late ? 
 
 An' why do the crowds gather fast in the street ? 
 
 What come they to talk of ? what come they to see ? 
 
 An' why does the long rope hang from the cross-tree ? 
 
 O, Shamus O'Brien ! pray fervent and fast, 
 
 May the saints take your soul, for this day is your last ; 
 
 Pray fast an' pray sthrong, for the moment is nigh, 
 
 When, sthrong, proud, an' great as you are, you must

 An' fasther an' fasther, the crowd gathered there, 
 Boys, horses, and gingerbread, just like a fair ; 
 An' whiskey was sellin', and cussamuck too,

 Bringing to Winchester fresh dismay, 
 The affrighted air with a shudder bore, 
 Like a herald in haste to the chieftain's door, 
 The terrible grumble, and rumble, and roar, 
 Telling the battle was on once more, 
 And Sheridan twenty miles away. 
 
 And wider still those billows of war, 
 
 Thundered along the horizon's bar ; 
 
 And louder yet into Winchester rolled 
 
 The roar of that red sea uncontrolled, 
 
 Making the blood of the listener cold, 
 
 As he thought of the stake in that fiery fray, 
 
 And Sheridan twenty miles away. 
 
 But there is a road from Winchester town, 
 
 A good, broad highway leading down ; 
 
 And there, through the flush of the morning light; 
 
 A steed as black as the steeds of night, 
 
 Was seen to pass, as with eagle flight, 
 
 As if he knew the terrible need ; 
 
 He stretched away with his utmost speed ; 
 
 Hills rose and fell ; but his heart was gay, 
 
 With Sheridan fifteen miles away.

 The dust, like smoke from the cannon's mouth ; 
 
 Or the trail of a comet, sweeping faster and faster, 
 
 Foreboding to traitors the doom of disaster. 
 
 The heart of the steed, and the heart of the master 
 
 Were beaten like prisoners assaulting their walls, 
 
 Impatient to be where the battle-field calls ; 
 
 Every nerve of the charger was strained to full play, 
 
 With Sheridan only ten miles away. 
 
 Under his spurning feet, the road

 And the landscape sped away behind 
 
 Like an ocean flying before the wind, 
 
 And the steed, like a bark fed with furnace ire, 
 
 Swept on, with his wild eye full of fire. 
 
 But lo ! he is nearing his heart's desire ; 
 
 He is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray, 
 
 With Sheridan only five miles away. 
 
 The first that the General saw were the groups 
 Of stragglers, and then the retreating troops ; 
 What was done ! what to do ? a glance told him both, 
 Then striking his spurs, with a terrible oath, 
 He dashed down the line, 'mid a storm of huzzas, 
 And the wave of retreat checked its course there, because 
 The sight of the master compelled it to pause. 
 With foam and with dust the black charger was gray ; 
 By the flash of his eye, and the red nostril's play, 
 He seemed to the whole great army to say, 
 " I have brought you Sheridan all the w r ay 
 From Winchester, down to save the dajr." 
 
 Hurrah! hurrah for Sheridan! 
 
 Hurrah ! hurrah for horse and man !

 DRIFTING. 
 
 (T. BUCHANAN READ.) 
 
 My soul to-day 
 
 Is far away, 
 Sailing the Vesuvian Baj 7- ; 
 
 My winged boat, 
 
 A bird afloat, 
 Swims round the purple peaks remote 
 
 Round purple peaks 
 
 It sails, and seeks 
 Blue inlets and their crystal creeks, 
 
 Where high rocks throw, 
 
 Through deeps below, 
 A duplicated golden glow. 
 
 Far, vague, and dim, 
 The mountains swim ; 
 
 While on Vesuvius' misty brim, 
 With outstretched hands 
 The gray smoke stands 
 
 O'erlooking the volcanic lands. 
 
 Here Ischia smiles 
 
 O'er liquid miles ; 
 And 3 r onder, bluest of the isles, 
 
 Calm Capri waits, 
 
 Her sapphire gates 
 Beguiling to her bright estates. 
 
 I heed not, if 
 
 My rippling skiff 
 Float swift or slow from cliff to cliff;— 
 
 With dreamful eyes 
 
 My spirit lies 
 Under the walls of Paradise.

 Under the walls 
 
 Where swells and falls 
 The Bay's deep breast at intervals 
 
 At peace I lie, 
 
 Blown softly by, 
 A cloud upon this liquid sky. 
 
 The clay so mild, 
 
 Is Heaven's own child, 
 With earth and ocean reconciled ; — 
 
 The airs I feel 
 
 Around me steal 
 Are murmuring to the murmuring keel. 
 
 Over the rail 
 
 My hand I trail 
 Within the shadow of the sail, 
 
 A joy intense, 
 
 The cooling sense 
 Glides down my drowsy indolence. 
 
 With dreamful eyes 
 
 My spirit lies 
 Where summer sings and never dies, — 
 
 O'erveiled with vines, 
 
 She glows and shines 
 Among her future oil and wines. 
 
 Her children, hid 
 
 The cliffs amid, 
 Are gambolling with the gambolling kid ; 
 
 Or down the walls, 
 
 With tips}^ calls, 
 Laugh on the rocks like waterfalls. 
 
 The fisher's child, 
 
 With tresses wild, 
 Unto the smooth, bright sand beguiled, 
 
 With glowing lips 
 
 Sings as she skips, 
 Or gazes at the far-off ships.

 And a disposition like a cross-cut saw. 
 The appellation of this lovely dame 
 Was Nancy ; don't forget the name. 
 
 Her brother David was a tall, 
 Good-looking chap, and that was all : 
 One of your great big nothings, as we say 
 Here in Rhode Island, picking up old jokes 
 And cracking them on other folks. 
 Well, David undertook one night to play 
 The Ghost, and frighten Abel, who, 
 He knew, 
 
 Would be returning from a journey through 
 A grove of forest wood 
 That stood 
 Below 
 The house some distance, — half a mile, or so.

 With both ends made to meet

 He took 
 His station near 
 A huge oak-tree, 
 Whence he could overlook 
 The road and see 
 Whatever might appear. 
 
 It happened that about an hour before, friend Abel 
 Had left the table 
 
 Of an inn, where he had made a halt, 
 With horse and wagon, 
 To taste a flagon 
 Of malt

 He went on, 
 
 Caring no more for twenty ghosts, 
 Than if they were so many posts. 
 
 David was nearly tired of waiting ; 
 His patience was abating ; 
 At length, he heard the careless tones 
 Of his kinsman's voice, 
 And then the noise 
 Of wagon-wheels among the stones. 
 Abel was quite elated, and was roaring 
 With all his might, and pouring 
 Out, in great confusion, 
 Scraps of old songs made in "the Revolution." 
 
 His head was full of Bunker Hill and Trenton ; 
 And jovially he went on, 
 Scaring the whip-po-wills among the trees 
 With rhymes like these : — [Sings.] 
 
 " See the Yankees 
 Leave the hill, 
 
 With baggernetts declining, 
 With looped-clown hats 
 And rusty guns, 
 
 And leather aprons shining. 
 " See the Yankees — Whoa ! Why, what is that ?" 
 Said Abel, staring like a cat, 
 As, slowly, on the fearful figure strode 
 Into the middle of the road. 
 
 " My conscience ! what a suit of clothes ! 
 Some crazy fellow, I suppose. 
 
 Hallo! friend, what's your name! by the powers of gin, 
 That's a strange dress to travel in." 
 " Be silent, Abel ; for I now have come 
 To read your doom ;

 THE SMACK IN SCHOOL. 
 
 A district school, not far away, 
 
 'Mid Berkshire hills, one winter's day, 
 
 Was humming with its wonted noise 
 
 Of three-score mingled girls and boys ; 
 
 Some few upon their tasks intent, 
 
 But more on furtive mischief bent. 
 
 The while the master's downward look

 With stolen chattels on his back,

 Oh, it was grand !

 Prone on the soldier's couch, ah, how can I rest

 LAMENT OF THE IRISH EMIGRANT 
 (DUFRRIX.) 
 
 I'm sitting on the stile, Mary, 
 
 Where we sat side b} T side, 
 On a bright Ma} T morning, long ago, 
 
 When first you were my bride ; 
 The corn was springing fresh and green, 
 
 And the lark sang loud and high ; 
 And the red was on your lip, Mary, 
 
 And the love-light in your eye. 
 
 The place is little changed, Mary, 
 
 The day as bright as then , 
 The lark's loud song is in my ear, 
 
 And the corn is green again ; 
 But I miss the soft clasp of your hand, 
 
 And your breath warm on my cheek ; 
 And I still keep listening for the words 
 
 You never more will speak. 
 
 'Tis but a step down yonder lane, 
 
 And the little church stands near — 
 The church where we were wed, Mary; 
 
 I see the spire from here. 
 But the graveyard lies between, Mary, 
 
 And my step might break your rest — 
 For I've laid you, darling, down to sleep, 
 
 With your baby on your breast. 
 
 I'm very lonely now, Mary, 
 
 For the poor make no new friends ; 
 But, ! they love the better still 
 
 The few our Father sends ! 
 And you were all I had, Mary — 
 
 My blessing and my pride : 
 There's nothing left to care for now, 
 
 Since my poor Mary died.

 Yours was the good, brave heart, Mary, 
 
 That still kept hoping on, 
 When the trust in God had left my soul, 
 
 And my arm's young strength was gone ; 
 There was comfort ever on your lip, 
 
 And the kind look on your brow — 
 I bless you, Mary, for that same, 
 
 Though you cannot hear me now. 
 
 I thank you for the patient smile 
 
 When your heart was lit to break — 
 When the hunger pain was gnawing there, 
 
 And you hid it for my sake ; 
 I bless you for the pleasant word, 
 
 When your heart was sad and sore — 
 O ! I'm thankful you are gone, Mary, 
 
 Where grief can't reach you more 1 
 
 I'm bidding you a long farewell, 
 
 My Mary — kind and true ! 
 But I'll not forget you, darling, 
 
 In the land I'm going to ; 
 They say there's bread and work for all, 
 
 And the sun shines always there — 
 But I'll not forget old Ireland, 
 
 Were it fifty times as fair ! 
 
 And often in those grand old woods 
 
 I'll sit, and shut my eyes, 
 And my heart will travel back again 
 
 To the place where Maiy lies ; 
 And I'll think I see the little stile 
 
 Where we sat side by side, 
 And the springing corn, and the bright May morn, 
 
 When first you were my bride.

 To hear his dying moan, 
 And catch, while chanting at his side,

 Was greater than a king ! — and once again —

 But no one cares for Gretchen, and no one looketh forth. 
 Within those dark, damp houses are merry faces bright, 
 And happy hearts are watching out the old year's latest night.

 With the little box of matches she could not sell all day, 
 And the thin, thin tattered mantle the wind blows every way, 
 She clingeth to the railing, she shivers in the gloom, — 
 There are parents sitting snugly by firelight in the room; 
 And children with grave faces are whispering one another 
 Of presents for the New Year, for father or for mother. 
 But no one talks to Gretchen, and no one hears her speak, 
 No breath of little whisperers comes warmly to her cheek. 
 
 No little arms are round her : ah me ! that there should be, 
 With so much happiness on earth, so much of misery ! 
 Sure they of many blessings should scatter blessings round, 
 As laden boughs in autumn fling their ripe fruits to the ground, 
 And the best love man can offer to the God of love, be sure, 
 Is kindness to his little ones, and bounty to his poor. 
 Little Gretchen, little Gretchen goes coldly on her way ; 
 There's no one looketh out at her, there's no one bids her stay. 
 
 Her home is cold and desolate ; no smile, no food, no fire, 
 But children clamorous for bread, and an impatient sire. 
 So she sits down in an angle where two great houses meet, 
 And she curleth up beneath her, for warmth, her little feet ; 
 And she looketh on the cold wall, and on the colder sky, 
 And wonders if the little stars are bright fires up on high. 
 She hears a clock strike slowly, up in a far church tower, 
 With such a sad and solemn tone, telling the midnight hour. 
 
 And she remembered her of tales her mother used to tell, 
 And of the cradle songs she sang, when summer's twilight fell ; 
 Of good men and of angels, and of the Holy Child, 
 Who was cradled in a manger, when winter was most w r ild ; 
 Who was poor, and cold, and hungry, and desolate and lone ; 
 And she thought the song had told he was ever with his own ; 
 And all the poor and hungry and forsaken ones are his, — 
 " How good of Him to look on me in such a place as this !" 
 
 Colder it grows and colder, but she does not feel it now, 
 For the pressure at her heart, and the weight upon her brow ; 
 But she struck one little match on the wall so cold and bare, 
 That she might look around her, and see if He were there. 
 The single match has kindled, and by the light it threw 
 It seemed to little Gretchen the wall was rent in two ; 
 And she could see folks seated at a table richly spread, 
 With heaps of goodly viands, red wine and pleasant bread.

 She could sraell the fragrant savor, she could hear what thev 
 
 did say, 
 Tnen all was darkness once again, the match had burned away, 
 She struck another hastily, and now she seemed to see 
 Within the same warm chamber a glorious Christmas tree. 
 The branches were all laden with things that children prize, 
 Iv right gifts for boy and maiden — she saw them with her eyes, 
 And she almost seemed to touch them, and to join the wel- 
 come shout, 
 When darkness fell around her, for the little match was out. 
 
 Another, yet another, she has tried — they will not light ; 
 Till all her little store she took, and struck with all her might ; 
 And the whole miserable place was lighted with the glare, 
 And she dreamed there stood a little child before her in the a1¥. 
 There were blood-drops on his forehead, a spear-wound in his 
 
 side. 
 And cruel nail-prints in his feet, and in his hands spread wide. 
 And he looked upon her gently, and she felt that he had 
 
 known 
 Pain, hunger, cold, and sorrow — ay, equal to her own. 
 
 And he pointed to the laden board and to the Christmas tree, 
 Then up to the cold sky, and said, " Will Gretchen come with 
 
 me?" 
 The poor child felt her pulses fail, she felt her eyeballs swim, 
 And a ringing sound was in her ears, like her dead mother's 
 
 hymn : 
 And she folded both her thin white hands, and turned from 
 
 that bright board, 
 And from the golden gifts, and said, ''With thee, with thee, 
 
 Lord !" 
 The chilly winter morning breaks up in the dull skies 
 On the city wrapt in vapor, on the spot where Gretchen lies. 
 
 Tn her scant and tattered garment, with her back against the 
 
 wall, 
 She sitteth cold and rigid, she answers to no call. 
 They have lifted her up fearfully, they shuddered as they said, 
 "It was a bitter, bitter night ! the child is frozen dead." 
 The angels sang their greeting for one more redeemed from sin; 
 Men said. " It was a bitter night ; would no one let her in?" 
 And they shivered as they spoke of her, and sighed They 
 
 could not see 
 How much of happiness there was after that misery.

 THE BLACK REGIMENT. PORT HUDSON, May 21, 1863 
 (GEO. H. BOKER.) 
 
 Dark as the clouds of even, 
 Ranked in the western heaven, 
 Waiting the breath that lifts 
 All the dread mass, and drifts 
 Tempest and falling brand 
 Over a ruined land ; — • 
 So still and orderly, 
 Arm to arm, knee to knee, 
 Waiting the great event 
 Stands the black regiment. 
 
 Down the long dusky line 
 Teeth gleam and eye-balls shine, 
 And the bright bayonet, 
 Bristling, and firmly set, 
 Flashed with a purpose grand, 
 Long, ere the sharp command 
 Of the fierce rolling drum 
 Told them their time had come, 
 Told them what work was sent 
 For the black regiment. 
 
 "Now," the flag-sergeant cried, 
 
 " Though death and hell betide, 
 
 Let the whole nation see 
 
 If we are fit to be free 
 
 In this land ; or bound 
 
 Down, like the whining hound, — 
 
 Bound with red stripes of pain 
 
 In our old chains again !" 
 
 Oh ! what a shout there went 
 
 From the black regiment ! 
 
 " Charge !" trump and drum awoke, 
 Onward the bondmen broke : 
 Bayonet and sabre stroke 
 Vainly opposed their rush.

 Through the wild battle's crush, 
 With but one thought aflush, 
 Driving their lords like chaff, 
 In the guns' mouths they laugh ; 
 Or at the slippery brands 
 Leaping with open hands, 
 Down they tear man and horse, 
 Down in their awful course ; 
 Trampling with bloody heel 
 Over the crashing steel, 
 All their eyes forward bent, 
 Rushed the black regiment. 
 
 " Freedom !" their battle-cry, — 
 " Freedom ! or learn to die !" 
 Ah ! and they meant the word, 
 Not as with us 'tis heard, 
 Not a mere party shout : 
 They gave their spirits out ; 
 Trusted the end to God, 
 And on the gory sod 
 Rolled in triumphant blood. 
 Glad to strike one free blow, 
 Whether for weal or woe ; 
 Glad to breathe one free breath, 
 Though on the lips of death. 
 Praying — alas ! in vain ! — 
 That they might fall again, 
 So they could once more see 
 That burst to liberty ! 
 This was what " Freedom" lent 
 To the black reo-iment. 
 
 Hundreds on hunrdeds fell, 
 But they are resting well ; 
 Scourges and shackles strong 
 Never shall do them wrong. 
 O, to the living few, 
 Soldiers, be just and true !

 SPEECH OF SERGEANT BUZFUZ. 
 
 Yon heard from my learned friend, Gentlemen of the 
 Jury, that this is an action for a breach of promise of 
 marriage, in which the damages are laid at fifteen 
 hundred pounds. The plaintiff, Gentlemen, is a widow; 
 yes, Gentlemen, a widow. The late Mr. Bardell, some 
 time before his death, became the father, Gentlemen, 
 of a little boy. With this little boy, the onl3 r pledge 
 of her departed exciseman, Mrs. Bardell shrunk from 
 the world and courted the retirement and tranquillity of 
 G os well street ; and here she placed in her front parlor- 
 window a written placard, bearing this inscription, — 
 "Apartments furnished for a single gentleman. 
 Inquire within.'' 
 
 Mrs. Bardell's opinions of the opposite sex, Gentle- 
 men, were derived from a long contemplation of 
 the inestimable qualities of her lost husband. She 
 had no fear, — she had no distrust, — all was confidence 
 and reliance. "Mr. Bardell," said the widow, "was a 
 man of honor, — Mr. Bardell was a man of his word, — • 
 Mr. Bardell was no deceiver, — Mr. Bardell was once a 
 single gentleman himself: to single gentlemen I look 
 for protection, for assistance, for comfort, and conso- 
 lation ; in single gentlemen I shall perpetually see 
 something to remind me of what Mr. Bardell was, 
 w r hen he first won mj T young and untried affections ; 
 to a single gentleman, then, shall my lodgings be let." 
 
 Actuated by this beautiful and touching impulse 
 (among the best impulses of our imperfect nature, 
 Gentlemen), the lonely and desolate widow dried her 
 tears, furnished her first floor, caught her innocent bojr 
 to her maternal bosom, and put the bill up in her 
 parlor-window. Did it remain there long ? IS"o. The 
 serpent was on the watch, the train was laid, the mine

 was preparing, the sapper and miner was at work. 
 Before the bill had been in the parlor-window three 
 days, Gentlemen, — a being, erect upon two legs, and 
 bearing all the outward semblance of a man, and not of a 
 monster, knocked at the door of Mrs. Bardell's house ! 
 He inquired within ; he took the lodgings ; and on the 
 very next day he entered into possession of them. 
 This man was Pickwick, — Pickwick the defendant ! 
 
 Of this man I will say little. The subject pre- 
 sents but few attractions ; and I, Gentlemen, am 
 not t v he man, nor are you, Gentlemen, the men, to 
 delight in the contemplation of revolting heartlessness, 
 and of systematic villainy. I say systematic villainy, 
 Gentlemen ; and when I say systematic villainy, let me 
 tell the defendant Pickwick, if he be in court, as I am 
 informed he is, that it would have been more decent in 
 him, more becoming, if he had stopped away. Let me 
 tell him, further, that a counsel, in the discharge of 
 his duty, is neither to be intimidated, nor bullied, nor 
 put down ; and that any attempt to do either the one or 
 the other will recoil on the head of the attempter, be he 
 plaintiff or be he defendant, be his name Pickwick, 
 or Nokes, or Stoaks, or Stiles, or Brown, or Thomp- 
 son. 
 
 I shall show you, Gentlemen, that for two }^ears 
 Pickwick continued to reside constantly, and without 
 interruption or intermission, at Mrs. Bardell's house. 
 I shall show you that Mrs. Bardell, during the whole 
 of that time, waited on him, attended to his comforts, 
 cooked his meals, looked out his linen for the washer- 
 woman when it went abroad, darned, aired and pre- 
 pared it for wear when it came home, and, in short, 
 enjoyed his fullest trust and confidence. I shall show 
 you that, on many occasions, he gave half-pence, and 
 on some occasions even sixpence, to her little boy. I 
 shall prove to you, that on one occasion, wheu he 
 returned from the country, he distinctly and in terms 
 offered her marriage, — previously, however, taking 
 special care that there should be no witnesses to their 
 solemn contract ; and I am in a situation to prove to

 you, on the testimony of three of his own friends,— 
 most unwilling witnesses, Gentlemen — most unwilling 
 witnesses, — that on that morning he was discovered 
 by them holding the plaintiff in his arms, and soothing 
 her agitation by his caresses and endearments. 
 
 And now, Gentlemen, but one word more. Two 
 letters have passed between these parties, — letters that 
 must be viewed with a cautious and suspicious eye, — 
 letters that were evidently intended, at the time, by 
 Pickwick, to mislead and delude any third parties into 
 whose hands they might fall. Let me read the first : — 
 " Garraway's, twelve o'clock. — Dear Mrs. B. — Chops 
 and Tomato sauce. Yours, Pickwick." Gentlemen, 
 what does this mean ? Chops and Tomato sauce ! 
 Yours, Pickwick ! Chops! Gracious heavens! And 
 Tomato sauce. Gentlemen, is the happiness of a 
 sensitive and confiding female to be trifled away by 
 such shallow artifices as these ? 
 
 The next has no date whatever, which is in itself 
 suspicious : — " Dear Mrs. B., I shall not be at home to- 
 morrow. Slow coach." And then follows this very 
 remarkable expression, — " Don't trouble yourself about 
 the warming-pan." The warming-pan ! Wiry, Gentle- 
 men, who does trouble himself about a warming-pan ! 
 Why is Mrs. Bardell so earnestly entreated not to 
 agitate herself about this warming-pan, unless (as is 
 no doubt the case) it is a mere cover for hidden fire — 
 a mere substitute for some endearing word or promise, 
 agreeably to a preconcerted system of correspondence, 
 artfully contrived by Pickwick with a view to his 
 contemplated desertion ? And what does this allusion 
 to the slow coach mean? For aught I know, it may 
 be a reference to Pickwick himself, who has most un- 
 questionably been a criminally slow coach during the 
 whole of this transaction, but whose speed will now be 
 very unexpectedly accelerated, and whose wheels, 
 Gentlemen, as he will find to his cost, will very soon 
 be greased by you ! 
 
 But enough of this, Gentlemen. It is difficult to 
 smile with an aching heart. My client's hopes and

 prospects are ruined, and it is no figure of speech to 
 say that her occupation is gone indeed. The bill is 
 down ; but there is no tenant ! Eligible single gentle- 
 men pass and repass ; but there is no invitation for 
 them to inquire within, or without ! All is gloom and 
 silence in the house : even the voice of the child is 
 hushed ; his infant -sports are disregarded, when his 
 mother weeps. 
 
 But Pickwick, Gentlemen, Pickwick, the ruthless 
 destroyer of this domestic oasis in the desert of Gos- 
 well street, — Pickwick, who has choked up the well, 
 and thrown ashes on the sward, — Pickwick who comes 
 before you to-day with his heartless tomato sauce and 
 warming-pans, — Pickwick still rears his head with 
 unblushing effrontery, and gazes without a sigh on the 
 ruin he has made ! Damages, Gentlemen, heavy 
 damages, is the only punishment with which you can 
 visit him, — the only recompense you can award to my 
 client ! And for those damages she now appeals to an 
 enlightened, a high-minded, a right-feeling, a consci- 
 entious, a dispassionate, a sympathizing, a contempla- 
 tive Jury of her civilized countrymen ! 
 
 THE DYING GLADIATOR. 
 (LORD BYRON.) 
 
 The seal is set, — ISTow welcome, thou dread power. 
 
 Nameless, yet thus omnipotent, which here 
 Walk'st in the shadow of the midnight hour 
 
 With a deep awe, yet all distinct from fear ; 
 
 Thy haunts are ever where the dead walls rear 
 Their ivy mantles, and the solemn scene 
 
 Derives from thee a sense so deep and clear, 
 That we become a part of what has been, 
 And grow unto the spot, all-seeing, but unseen. 
 
 And here the buzz of eager nations ran, 
 In murmured pit}^ or loud-roared applause, 
 
 As man was slaughtered by his fellow-man. 
 
 And wherefore slaughtered? wherefore, but because

 Such were the bloodj- circus' genial laws, 
 And the imperial pleasure. Wherefore not? 
 
 What matters where we fall to fill the maws 
 Of worms — on battle-plains or listed spot ? 
 Both are but theatres where the chief actors rot. 
 
 I see before me the gladiator lie : 
 
 He leans upon his hand ; his manly brow 
 Consents to death, but conquers agony, 
 
 And his drooped head sinks gradually low; 
 
 And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow, 
 From the red gash, fall heavy, one hy one, 
 
 Like the first of a thunder-shower ; and now 
 The arena swims around him: he is gone, 
 Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hailed the wretch 
 who won. 
 
 He heard it, but he heeded not ; his eyes 
 
 Were with his heart, and that was far away: 
 
 He recked not of the life he lost, nor prize ; 
 But where his rude hut by the Danube lay, 
 There were his young barbarians all at play, 
 
 There was their Dacian mother — he, their sire, 
 Butchered to make a Roman holiday. 
 
 All this rushed with his blood. Shall he expire, 
 
 And unavenged ? Arise, ye Goths, and glut your ire! 
 
 THE INQUIRY. 
 (CHARLES MACKAY.) 
 
 Tell me, ye w T inged winds, that round my pathway roar, 
 Do ye not know some spot where mortals weep no more ? 
 Some lone and pleasant dell, some valley in the west, 
 Where, free from toil and pain, the weary soul may rest? 
 The loud wind dwindled to a whisper low, 
 And sighed for pity as it answered — "No." 
 
 Tell me, thou mighty deep, whose billows round me play, 
 Know'st thou some favored spot, some island far away,

 Where weary man may find the bliss for which he sighs ; 
 
 Where sorrow never lives, and friendship never dies ? 
 The loud waves, rolling in perpetual flow, 
 Stopped for a while, and sighed to answer — "No." 
 
 And thou, serenest moon, that, with such lovely face, 
 Dost look upon the earth, asleep in night's embrace ; 
 Tell me, in all thy round, hast thou not seen some spot, 
 Where miserable man might find a happier lot ? 
 Behind a cloud the moon withdrew in woe, 
 And a voice, sweet, but sad, responded — " No." 
 
 Tell me, my secret soul ; — oh ! tell me, Hope and Faith, 
 Is there no resting-place from sorrow, sin, and death ? 
 Is there no happy spot, where mortals may be blessed, 
 Where grief may find a balm, and weariness a rest? 
 Faith, Hope, and Love, best boons to mortals given, 
 Waved their bright wings, and whispered — " Yes, 
 in Heaven !" 
 
 LOVE. 
 (COLERIDGE.) 
 
 All thoughts, all passions, all delights, 
 Whatever stirs this mortal frame, 
 
 All are but ministers of Love, 
 And feed his sacred flame. 
 
 Oft in my waking dreams do I 
 Live o'er again that happy hour, 
 
 When midway on the mound I lay, 
 Beside the ruined tower. 
 
 The moonshine, stealing o'er the scene, 
 Had blended with the lights of eve ; 
 
 And she was there, my hope, my joy, 
 My own dear Genevieve!

 She leaned against the armed man,

 Few sorrows hath she of her own. 
 
 My hope ! my joy ! mj T Genevieve ! 
 She loves me best whene'er I sing 
 
 The songs that make her grieve. 
 
 I played a soft and doleful air ; 
 
 I sang an old and moving stoiy — 
 And old, rude song, that suited well 
 
 That ruin wild and hoaiy. 
 
 She listened with a flitting blush, 
 
 With downcast eyes and modest grace ; 
 
 For well she knew I could not choose 
 But gaze upon her face. 
 
 I told her of the knight that wore 
 Upon his shield a burning brand ; 
 
 And that for ten long years he w T ooed 
 The Lady of the Land. 
 
 I told her how he pined — and ah 1 
 The deep, the low, the pleading tone 
 
 With which I sang another's love, 
 Interpreted my own.

 With downcast eyes and modest grace ;

 And sometimes from the darksome shade, 
 
 And sometimes starting up at once 
 In green and sunny glade, —

 An angel beautiful and bright ; 
 And that he knew it was a fiend, 
 
 This miserable knight 1 
 
 And that, unknowing what he did, 
 
 He leaped amid a murderous band, 
 And saved from outrage worse than death, 
 
 The Lady of the Land. 
 
 And how she wept, and clasped his knees ; 
 
 And how she tended him in vain — 
 And ever strove to expiate 
 
 The scorn that crazed his brain ; — 
 
 And that she nursed him in a cave ; 
 
 And how his madness went away, 
 When on the yellow forest-leaves 
 
 A dying man he lay. 
 
 His dying words — but when I reached 
 That tenderest strain of all the ditty, 
 
 My faltering voice and pausing harp 
 Disturbed her soul with pity ! 
 
 All impulses of soul and sense 
 
 Had thrilled my guileless Genevieve ; 
 
 The music and the doleful tale, 
 The rich and balmy eve ; 
 
 And hopes, and fears that kindle hope, 
 
 An undistinguishable throng, 
 And gentle wishes long subdued,

 She wept with pitj^ and delight — 
 
 She blushed with love, and virgin shame ; 
 
 And like the murmur of a dream, 
 I heard her breathe my name. 
 
 Her bosom heaved ; she stepped aside — 
 As conscious of my look she stept — 
 
 Then suddenly, with timorous eye, 
 She fled to me and wept. 
 
 She half inclosed me with her arms : 
 She pressed me with a meek embrace ; 
 
 And bending back her head, looked up, 
 And gazed upon my face. 
 
 'Twas partly love, and partly fear, 
 And parti} 7 'twas a bashful art, 
 
 That I might rather feel, than see, 
 The swelling of her heart. 
 
 I calmed her fears, and she was calm, 
 And told her love with virgin pride ; 
 
 And so I won my Genevieve, 
 My bright and beauteous bride.

 In there came old Alice the nurse,

 So many years from his due."

 " But keep the secret for your life, 
 And all you have will be Lord Ronald's

 THE DROWNED MARINER. 
 
 (MRS. smith.) 
 
 A mariner sat in the shrouds one night, 
 
 The wind was piping free ; 
 Now bright, now dimmed was the moonlight pale, 
 And the phosphor gleamed in the wake of the whale, 
 
 As it floundered in the sea ; 
 The scud was flying athwart the sky, 
 The gathering winds went whistling by, 
 And the wave, as it towered then fell in spray, 
 Looked an emerald wall in the moonlight ray. 
 
 The mariner swayed and rocked on the mast, 
 
 But the tumult pleased him well : 
 Down the yawning wave his eye he cast, 
 And the monsters watched, as they hurried past, 
 
 Or lightly rose and fell, — 
 For their broad, damp fins were under the tide. 
 And they lashed, as they past, the vessel's side,

 And their filmy eyes, all huge and grim, 
 Glared fiercely up, and they glared at him. 
 
 Now freshens the gale, and the brave ship goes 
 
 Like an uncurbed steed along ; 
 A sheet of flame is the spraj?- she throws, 
 As her gallant prow the water plows ; 
 
 But the ship is fleet and strong ; 
 The topsails are reefed, and the sails are furled, 
 And onward she sweeps o'er the watery world, 
 And dippeth her spars in the surging flood ; 
 But there conieth no chill to the mariner's blood. 
 
 Wildly she rocks, but he swingeth at ease, 
 And holds him by the shroud ; 
 
 And, as she careens to the crowding breeze, 
 
 The gaping deep the mariner sees, 
 
 And the surging heareth loud. 
 
 Was that a face, looking up at him 
 
 With its pallid cheek, and its cold eyes dim ? 
 
 Did it beckon him down f Did it call his name ? 
 
 Now rolleth the ship the way whence it came. 
 
 The mariner looked, and he saw, with dread, 
 
 A face he knew too well ; 
 And the cold eyes glared, the eyes of the dead, 
 And its long hair out on the waves was spread. 
 
 Was there a tale to tell ? 
 The stout ship rocked with a reeling speed — 
 And the mariner groaned, as well he need — 
 For ever down, as she plunged on her side, 
 The dead face gleamed from the briny tide. 
 
 Bethink thee, mariner, well of the past : 
 
 A voice calls loud for thee ; 
 There's a stifled pra3 T er, the first, the last ; 
 The plunging ship on her beam is cast — 
 
 Oh, where shall tlry burial be ? 
 Bethink thee of oaths, that were lightly spoken ; 
 Bethink thee of vows, that were lightly broken ; 
 Bethink thee of all that is dear to thee, 
 For thou art alone on the raging sea.

 Alone in the dark, alone on the wave 
 
 To buffet the storm alone ; 
 To struggle aghast at thy watery grave, 
 To struggle and feel there is none to save ! 
 
 God shield thee, helpless one ! 
 The stout limbs yield, for their strength is past. 
 The trembling hands on the deep are cast ; 
 The white brow gleams a moment more, 
 Then slowly sinks — the struggle is o'er. 
 
 Down, clown, where the storm is hushed to sleep, 
 Where the sea its dirge shall swell ; 
 
 Where the amber-drops for thee shall weep, 
 
 And the rose-lipped shell its music keep ; 
 There thou shalt slumber well. 
 
 The gem and the pearl lie heaped at thy side ; 
 
 They fell from the neck of the beautiful bride, 
 
 From the strong man's hand, from the maiden's brow, 
 
 As they slowly sunk to the wave below. 
 
 A peopled home is the ocean-bed ; 
 
 The mother and child are there : 
 The fervent 3 T outh and the hoary head, 
 The maid with her floating locks outspread, 
 
 The babe with its silken hair : 
 As the water moveth they slightly sway, 
 And the tranquil light on their features play : 
 And there is each cherished and beautiful form, 
 Away from decay, and away from the storm. 
 
 THE DIVER. 
 
 (SCHILLER.) 
 
 " Oh, where is the knight or the squire so bold, 
 As to dive to the howling charybdis below? — 
 
 I cast into the whirlpool a goblet of gold, 
 And o'er it already the dark waters flow: 
 
 Whoever to me may the goblet bring, 
 
 Shall have for his guerdon that gift of his king."

 He spoke, and the cup from the terrible steep, 
 That rugged and hoary, hung over the verge 
 
 Of the endless and measureless world of the deep, 
 Swirled into the maelstrom that maddened the surge. 
 
 " And where is the diver so stout to go — 
 
 I ask }^e again — to the deep below ?" 
 
 And the knights and the squires that gathered around, 
 Stood silent — and fixed on the ocean their eyes; 
 
 They looked on the dismal and savage profound, 
 
 And the peril chilled back every thought of the prize. 
 
 And thrice spoke the monarch — " The cup to win, 
 
 Is there never a wight who will venture in ?" 
 
 And all as before heard in silence the king — 
 
 Till a } T outh, with an aspect unfearing but gentle, 
 
 'Mid the tremulous squires, stept out from the ring, 
 Unbuckling his girdle, and doffing his mantle; 
 
 And the murmuring crowd, as they parted asunder. 
 
 On the stately boy cast their looks of wonder. 
 
 As he strode to the marge of the summit, and gave 
 One glance on the gulf of that merciless main; 
 
 Lo ! the wave that forever devours the wave, 
 Casts roaringly up the chary bdis again ; 
 
 And, as with the swell of the far thunder-boom, 
 
 Rushes foamingl}^ forth from the heart of the gloom. 
 
 And it bubbles and seethes, and it hisses and roars, 
 As when fire is with water commixed and contending ; 
 
 And the spray of its wrath to the welkin up-soars, 
 And flood upon flood hurries on, never ending. 
 
 And it never will rest, nor from travail be free, 
 
 Like a sea that is laboring the birth of a sea. 
 
 And at last there lay open the desolate realm ! 
 
 Through the breakers that whitened the waste of the 
 swell, 
 Dark — dark yawned a cleft in the midst of the whelm, 
 
 The path to the heart of that fathomless hell.

 Round and round whirled the waves — deep and deeper 
 
 still driven, 
 Like a gorge thro' the mountainous main thunder-riven, 
 
 The youth gave his trust to his Maker ! Before 
 That path through the riven abyss closed again — 
 
 Hark! a shriek from the crowd rang aloft from the 
 shore, 
 And, behold ! he is whirled in the grasp of the main ! 
 
 And o'er him the breakers mysteriously rolled, 
 
 And the giant-mouth closed on the swimmer so bold. 
 
 O'er the surface grim silence lay dark and profound, 
 But the deep from below murmured hollow and fell ; 
 
 And the crowd, as it shuddered, lamented aloud — 
 " Gallant youth — noble heart — fare-thee-well, fare- 
 thee-well I" 
 
 And still ever deepening that wail as of woe, 
 
 More hollow the gulf sent its howl from below. 
 
 If thou should 'st in those waters thy diadem fling, 
 And cry, " Who may find it shall win it, and wear;" 
 
 God 's wot, though the prize were the crown of a king — . 
 A crown at such hazard were valued too dear. 
 
 For never did lips of the living reveal, 
 
 What the deeps that howl yonder in terror conceal. 
 
 Oh, many a ship, to that breast grappled fast, 
 
 Has gone down to the fearful and fathomless grave; 
 
 Again, crashed together, the keel and the mast, 
 To be seen, tossed aloft in the glee of the wave. — 
 
 Like the growth of a storm ever louder and clearer, 
 
 Grows the roar of the gulf rising nearer and nearer. 
 
 And it bubbles and seethes, and it hisses and roars, 
 As when fire is with water commixed and contending ; 
 
 And the spray of its wrath to the welkin up-soars, 
 And flood upon flood hurries on, never ending. 
 
 And, as with the swell of the far thunder-boom, 
 
 Rushes roaringly forth from the heart of the gloom.

 What gleams on the darkness so swanlike and white ?

 It is he — it is he ! — in his left hand behold,

 They gaze on each other — they shout as they throng — 
 " He lives — lo the ocean has rendered its prej' !

 And he comes with the crowd in their clamor and glee,

 The Yeil which is woven with Night and with Terror ! 
 
 " Quick-brightening like lightning — it tore me along, 
 Down, down, till the gush of a torrent at play, 
 
 In the rocks of its wilderness caught me — and strong 
 As the wings of an eagle, it whirled me away. 
 
 Vain, vain were my struggles — the circle had won me, 
 
 Round and round in its dance the wild element spun 
 me. 
 
 " And I called on my God, and my God heard my 
 prayer, 
 In the strength of my need, in the gasp of my 
 breath — 
 And showed me a erase that rose up from the lair, 
 And I clung to it, trembling — and baffled the death !

 And, safe in the perils around me, behold 
 On the spikes of the coral the goblet of gold.

 Spread the gloomy, and purple, and pathless obscure ! 
 
 A Silence of Horror that slept on the ear,

 Salamander — snake — dragon — vast reptiles that dwell 
 
 In the deep — coiled about the grim jaws of their hell. 
 
 " Dark-crawled — glided dark the unspeakable swarms, 
 Like masses unshapen, made life hideously —

 A hundred-limbed creature caught sight of its prey, 
 And darted — God ! from the far-flaming bough 
 
 Of the coral, I swept on the horrible way; 
 And it seized me, the wave with its wrath and its roar, 
 It seized me to save — King, the danger is o'er !" 
 
 On the youth gazed the monarch, and marveled — quoth 
 .he, 
 
 " Bold Diver, the goblet I promised is thine, 
 And this ring will I give, a fresh guerdon to thee, 
 
 Never jewels more precious shone up from the mine ; 
 If thou'lt bring me fresh tidings, and venture again, 
 To say what lies hid in the innermost main 1"

 Then out spake the daughter in tender emotion, 
 
 " Ah ! father, my father, what more can there rest ? 
 Enough of this sport with the pitiless ocean — 
 
 He has served thee as none would, thyself hast con- 
 fest. 
 If nothing can slake thy wild thirst of desire, 
 Be your knights not, at least, put to shame by the 
 squire !" 
 
 The king seized the goblet — he swung it on high, 
 And whirling, it fell in the roar of the tide : 
 
 " But bring back that goblet again to my eye, 
 
 And I'll hold thee the dearest that rides by my side ! 
 
 And thine arms shall embrace as thy bride, I decree, 
 
 The maiden whose pity now pleadeth for thee." 
 
 In his heart, as he listened, there leapt the wild joy — 
 And the hope and the love through his eyes spoke in 
 fire, 
 On that bloom, on that blush, gazed, delighted, the 
 boy ; 
 The maiden she faints at the feet of her sire ! 
 Here the guerdon divine, there the danger beneath ; 
 He resolves ! — To the strife with the life and the death! 
 
 They hear the loud surges sweep back in their swell ; 
 
 Their coming the thunder-sound heralds along ! 
 Fond eyes yet are tracking the spot where he fell — 
 
 They come, the wild waters, in tumult and throng, 
 Rearing up to the cliff — roaring back as before ; 
 But no wave ever brought the lost youth to the shore.

 How silently ! Around thee and above 
 Deep is the air and dark, — substantial black, — 
 An ebon mass ; methinks thou piercest it, 
 As with a wedge ! But when I look again, 
 It is thine own calm home, thy crystal shrine, 
 Thy habitation from eternity !

 Word was brought to the Danish king 
 
 (Hurry !) 
 That the love of his heart lay suffering, 
 And pined for the comfort his voice would bring ; 
 
 (0 ! ride as though you were flying !) 
 Better he loves each golden curl 
 On the brow of that Scandinavian girl 
 Than his rich crown jewels of ruby and pearl ; 
 
 And his Rose of the Isles is dying ! 
 
 Thirty nobles saddled with speed ; 
 
 (Hurry !) 
 Each one mounting a gallant steed 
 Which he kept for battle and days of need ; 
 
 (0 ! ride as though you were flying !) 
 Spurs were struck in the foaming flank ; 
 Worn-out chargers staggered and sank ; 
 Bridles were slackened, and girths were burst ; 
 But ride as they would, the king rode first, 
 
 For his Rose of the Isles lay dying ! 
 
 His nobles are beaten, one by one ; 
 
 (Hurry!) 
 They have fainted, and faltered, and homeward gone; 
 His little fair page now follows alone, 
 
 For strength and for courage trying. 
 The king looked back at that faithful child ; 
 Wan was the face that answering smiled ; 
 They passed the drawbridge with clattering din, 
 Then he dropped ; and only the king rode in

 No answer came ; but faint and forlorn 
 An echo returned on the cold gray morn, 
 
 Like the breath of a spirit sighing. 
 The castle portal stood grimly wide ; 
 None welcomed the king from that weary ride ; 
 For dead, in the light of the dawning day, 
 The pale sweet form of the welcomer lay, 
 
 Who had yearned for his voice while dying ! 
 
 The panting steed, with a drooping crest, 
 
 Stood weary. 
 The king returned from her chamber of rest, 
 The thick sobs choking in his breast ;

 The tears gushed forth which he strove to check ;

 " Speed !" echoed the wall to us galloping through; 
 Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest, 
 And into the midnight we galloped abreast. 
 
 Not a word to each other ; we kept the great pace — 
 Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our

 I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight, 
 Then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right, 
 Rebuckled the check-strap, chained slacker the bit, 
 Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.

 'Twas moonset at starting ; but while we drew near 
 Lokeren, the cocks crew and twilight dawned clear ; 
 At Boom, a great yellow star came out to see ; 
 At Puffeld 'twas morning as plain as could be ; 
 And from Mechlen church-steeple we heard the half- 
 chime — 
 So Joris broke silence with "Yet there is time!" 
 
 At Aerschot, up leaped of a sudden the sun, 
 And against him the cattle stood black every one, 
 To stare through the mist at us galloping past ; 
 And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last, 
 With resolute shoulders, each butting away 
 The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray. 
 
 And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent 
 
 back 
 For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track; 
 And one eye's black intelligence, — ever that glance 
 O'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance ; 
 And the thick heavy spume-flakes, which a}^e and anon 
 His fierce lips shook upward in galloping on. 
 
 By Hasselt Dirck groaned ; and cried Joris, " Stay 
 
 spur! 
 Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her ; 
 We'll remember at Aix" — for one heard the quick 
 
 wheeze 
 Of her chest, saw the stretched neck, and staggering 
 
 knees, 
 And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank, 
 As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank. 
 
 So we were left galloping, Joris and I, 
 
 Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky ; 
 
 The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh ; 
 
 'Neath our feet broke the brittle, bright stubble like 
 
 chaff; 
 Till over by Dalhem a dome-spire sprang white, 
 And " Gallop!" gasped Joris, "for Aix is in sight!

 Rolled neck and croup over, la}' dead as a stone ; 
 And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight 
 Of the news which alone could save Aix from her fate, 
 With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim, 
 And with circles of red for his ej^esockets' rim. 
 
 Then I cast loose my huff-coat, each holster let fall, 
 Shook off both my Jack-boots, let go belt and all, 
 Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear, 
 Called my Roland his pet-name, my horse without 
 
 peer ; 
 Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad 
 
 or good, 
 Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood. 
 
 And all I remember is friends nocking round, 
 As I sate with his head 'twixt m} T knees on the ground ; 
 And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine, 
 As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine, 
 Which (the burgesses voted by common consent) 
 Was no more than his due who brought good news

 Cat. [haughtily rising.'] Come, consecrated lictors, 
 from your thrones : [ To the Senate. 
 
 Fling down your sceptres : — take the rod and axe, 
 And make the murder as you make the law. 
 
 Gic. [interrupting him.] Give up the record of his 
 banishment. [ To an officer. 
 
 [The officer gives it to the Consul.] 
 Cat. Banished from Rome ! What's banished, but 
 set free 
 From daily contact of the things I loathe? 
 " Tried and convicted traitor I" Who says this ? 
 Who'll prove it, at his peril, on my head ? 
 Banished — I thank 3 r ou for 't. It breaks my chain ! 
 I held some slack allegiance till this hour — 
 But now my sword's my own. Smile on, my lords ! 
 I scorn to count what feelings, withered hopes, 
 Strong provocations, bitter, burning wrongs, 
 I have within my heart's hot cells shut up, 
 To leave you in your lazy dignities. 
 But here I stand and scoff } t ou : here I fling 
 Hatred and full defiance in your face. 
 Your Consul's merciful. For this, all thanks. 
 He dares not touch a hair of Catiline. 
 
 [ The Consul reads'] : — " Lucius Sergius Catiline : by 
 the decree of the Senate, you are declared an en- 
 emy and alien to the State, and banished from the 
 territory of the Commonwealth."

PRACTICAL ELOCUTION. 571 
 
 The Consul. Lictors, drive the traitor from the 
 
 temple ! 
 Cat. \_ furious.'] " Traitor I" I go — but I return. 
 This— trial ! 
 Here I devote your Senate ! I've had wrongs 
 To stir a fever in the blood of age, 
 Or make the infant's sinews strong as steel, 
 This day's the birth of sorrows ! — this hour's work 
 Will breed proscriptions : — look to your hearths, my 
 
 lords ! 
 For there, henceforth, shall sit, for household gods, 
 Shapes hot from Tartarus ! — all shames and crimes ! 
 Wan Treacher}^ with his thirsty dagger drawn ; 
 Suspicion, poisoning his brother's cup ; 
 Naked Rebellion, with the torch and axe, 
 Making his wild sport of your blazing thrones ; 
 Till Anarchy comes down on you like Night, 
 And Massacre seals Rome's eternal grave ! 
 
 [ The Senators rise in tumult and cry out, 
 Go, enemy and parricide, from Rome ! 
 
 Cic. Expel him, lictors ! Clear the Senate-house ! 
 
 [ They surround him. 
 Cat. [struggling through them]. I go, but not to 
 leap the gulf alone. 
 I go — but when I come, 'Twill be the burst 
 Of ocean in the earthquake — rolling back 
 In swift and mountainous ruin. Fare you well ! 
 You build n^ funeral-pile, but 3 7 our best blood 
 Shall quench its flame. Back, slaves ! [ To the lictors.] 
 — I will return ! \_He rushes out.] 
 
 THE END.
