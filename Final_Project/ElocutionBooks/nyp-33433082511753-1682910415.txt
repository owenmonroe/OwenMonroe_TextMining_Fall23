A
S Some Account of every Work,
that's made publick, is always
expeeted to be given, you have here,
Gentlemen, humbly offer'd to you,
THE ART OF RHETORIC, or,
The Elements of Oratory, not only
colleeted and compoſed from the whole
Body of Orators and Rhetoricians an-
cient and modern, but accompanied
likewiſe with Examples from the Claf-
fics and Scriptures, and briefly com-
priz'd in a Short, Plain, Comprehen-
five and Regular Method.
Here, Young Gentlemen, you'll meet
with the Precepts, Animadverſions,
Remarks, and Hints of ISOCRATES,
ARISTOTLE, CICERO, QUINTI-
LIAN, LONGINUS, and others of
the Ancients; together with VOSSIUS,

RAMUS, FARNABY, and all the
principal Modern Rhetoricians : Whoſe
Rules are all along ſupported, demon-
ſtrated, and illuſtrated by Inſtances
taken from the flowery: Fields of the
Poets, Orators, and Hiſtorians; For,
as Lucretius ſays,
Floriferis ut Apes in Saltibus omnia libant,
Omnia nos itidem depaſcimus aurea Dicta.
Whence may appear what Grace and
Beauty are to be met with in FIGURES,
what Delight and extenſive Significancy
are contain'd in TROPES, what ner-
vous Force and harmonious Pith we
experience in REPETITIONS orTurns,
and what Power and inexpreffible In-
fluence of Perfuafion in proper PRO-
NUNCIATION and conſonant Action.
In ſhort, you have here a brief and
lively Repreſentation of Univerſal Elo-
quence; from which you may eaply and
readily, with a little Pains, underſtand
all the Oratorial Beauties of Excellent
Writers, and, when underſtood, make
'em your own by frequent Compoßtion
and an attentive ſedulous Imitation.

The PREFACE.
OBJ. But are there not Rhetorical
Treatiſes enough already extant for
this Purpoſe? What Occaſion have we
then for your's?
ANSW. 'Tis own'd there are enough,
and ſome of 'em exceedingly good in
their Way, but not One, that I've had
the Happineſs to meet with, in every
Reſpect adapted to the Capacity, or
fitted for the Uſe, of Youth in Gram,
mar Schools; eſpecially in this Day,
when School-Boys are expeEted to be led,
footh’d, and entic'd to their Studies by
the Eaſineſs and Pleaſure of the Prac-
tice, rather than by Force or barſ
Diſcipline drove, as in Days of rore.
For wbile ſome of them are too Copious
in Things not ſo, immediately the Con-
cern of Boys at School, moſt are too
Brief in Things really neceſſary for
Youth to be inform’d of, and none at
all ſo happy or methodical as to diſtin-
guiſh betwen One and T'other.
Theſe Deficiencies, Gentlemen, I've
endeavour'dtoʻremedy in the following
Manner.
FIRST,
a 2


## p. (#12) #################################################

The PRE FACE.
FIRST, That we might always
keep in View the glorious and extenſive
Plan of the Ancients, ſtriet Care has
been taken to follow their Method en-
tirely, and (by leaving out the copious
Parts of their Works, which were
principally deſign'd as Models for Men
and Proficients, thö jumbled together
by modern Rhetoricians among their
Precepts for the Uſe of Boys) to ex-
tract from them all the Terms we
make uſe in our Diviſions and Sub-
diviſions of the Art. Theſe are all
along ſupported by Annotations in their
own Words; by which means the ſedulous
Youth may not only imbibe their Scheme
of Oratory, but be made ſomewhat
acquainted with their Style before it
would otherwiſe bave been his Time,
and be thereby perhaps encourag'd and
allur'd bereafter to a thorough Peruſal
of their inimitable Writings.
SECONDLY, That Nothing might
be wanting that's neceſſary for the young
Scholar to be here inform’d of, or what
perchance he cannot obtain elſewhere
7
with-

The PREFACE.
without abundance more Trouble, I have
not only inſerted thoſe Tropes, Figures,
and Repetitions, which the learned and
judicious Mr. BLACKWALL with his
Followers call the Chief and Principal,
but likewiſe all others, great and little,
the leſs uſeful as well as the more uſe-
ful; however with this Caution, that
they're diſtributed according to their
ſeveral Degrees of Merit and Diſtinc-
tion. So that, Young Gentlemen, you'll
meet with here about 250 Figures, &c.
that is all, and indeed many more than
all that are treated of in any other One
Book, as may readily be perceived by
the Index. I have likewiſe given more
Examples to’em, from the Claſſics and
Scriptures, than perhaps you'll find
in all the Rhetoricians put together :
Which laſt was thought proper to be
done, ta the end that in going thrò the
Book, in order to infix 'em in the Me-
mory, the Learner might mark out the
Examples in bis Schocl-Authors, as
well as in his Septuagint, bis Latin or
Greek Teſtament, his Latin or Engliſh
Bible;

Bible; the Examples from Scripture
being mark'd only Chapter and Verſe
for this very Purpoſe, as alſo to keep the
Volume from ſwelling, and thereby to
Jave Expence. In marking which I
have been very exact, and hope my
Printer has been fo too.
THIRDLY, As to Method, That a
proper Diſtinɛtion may be made be-
tween Things of ordinary Uſe and ſuch
as are rare and extraordinary, I pro-
poſe Nothing to be got by Heart but
the Principal Matters wbich are printed
in the largeſt Character, the Lines ſet
at a greater Diſtance, and mark'd
with A, B, C, &c. All which ſhould
be brought into Practice and explained
by the Examples annex’d, as the Learner
The Chief Tropes, Figures,
and Repetitions, for the more eaſy at-
taining and the longer retaining them
in Memory, are briefly defined and
comprized each in one Verle, in this
large Character. The reſt may be moſt
readily found on Occaſion by the IN-
DEX, where they're deſcrib'd and ex-
plain'd;

of leſs Moment, muſt be left to the in-

be at proper Times to put his Scholars

which when I had finiſhed, there ſtill
ſeemed to be ſomething wanting towards
perfecting a Compleat Compendium of
Rhetoric, and that was, To point out
to the young Student The Height and
Excellency of good Writings. To per-
form which, I bumbly conceive Nothing
could be more properly introduced than
the Subſtance of the Celebrated LON-
GINUS on the Sublime. Tois there-
fore I have propoſed for BOOK II.

Whole.
The Difference of Quantity and Ac-
cent among the Greeks has occafioned
the Names of ſome of the Figures, &C.
to be pronounced differently by diffe-
rent Authors; to prevent Ambiguity
in which for the Future, I have ac-
cented them all as they are now gene-
ratly pronounced, in the INDEX at
the End, which be pleaſed to conſult
upon this and every other Occaſion.

The STATING OF A CASE is the Iſſue
it is brought to from the Accuſer's Complaint and
the Accuſed's Defence. Thus, Milo' was accuſed
for killing Clodius ; Milo confeſs'd be killd him, but
faid he did it juftly. Now the Stating the Caſe
here is-Whether Milo kill'd Clodius juſtly or un-
juſtly?
A CASE may be Stated four Ways, viz. Con-
jeĉtural, Finitive, In Quality, In Quantity.
1. A Caſe is CONJECTURAL, when it is
inquir’d Whether the Thing was done or no, as,
Whether Milo kill'd Clodius?
2. A Cafe is FINITIVE, when we inquire
into the Name, Nature, and Definition of the Crime;
as, I own I took it, but I did not commit Theft.
Where Theft muſt be defin'd, &c.
3. A Caſe in QUALITY is, where we in-
quire in what Manner a Fact was done ; as, Milo
kill'd Clodius, but he did it juftly. Here we muſt
inquire into the Circumſtances, and prove from Law
what in this Caſe may be deem'd Just or Unjuft.

Telling the whole Caſe in brief as it ſtands, from
beginning to end. Which ought to be plain that it
may be underſtood, likely that it may be credited,
pleaſing that it may be liſten'd to, and port that
it mayn't tire.
The PROPOSITION propoſes the Purport
or Sum of the whole Diſcourſe, or Thing in Dif-
pute. If it divides the Oration inco Parts, which
ought never to exceed three or four at moſt, 'tis
calI'd Partition.
The CONFIRMATION is to ſtrengthen
and confirm our Subject by all the Proofs and Ar-
guments we can obtain from Invention. In doing
which Rhetoricians adviſe to place our Strongeſt in
the Front, our Weakeſt in the Middle, and to keep

Trope is more frequent or florid than the Meta-
phor; for it is a ſhort and ſprightly Reſemblance
or Similitude in one Word, and may, as has been
hinted, be transferd or taken from any Objeet of
Senſe whatever ; but that of Sight is reckond moſt
lively. Hence Odoror, Teneo, Guſto, & Audio, are
often met with for Intelligo ; tho-hideo, Cerno, or
Perſpicio much oftener. See 1 Kings x. 4. Hagg. i. 9.
1 Chron. xvi. 32. N. 2. It is by this Trope that
Cbrift in Scripture is calld a Vine, Door, Rock,
Lamb, Lion, &c. And Man, a Shadow, Flower,

I'll beg leave to conclude my Explication of theſe
Tropes in the Words of the elegant and very judi-
cious Mr. BLACKWALL.
By this ſhort Account 'tis plain, that there is
a general Analogy and Relation between all Tropes,
and that in all of them a Man uſes a foreign or
ſtrange Word inſtead of a proper one; and there-
fore lays one thing, and means ſomething diffe-
When he ſays one thing and means another
almoſt the ſame, 'cis a Synecdoche : When he ſays
one thing and means another mutually depending,
’tis a Metonimy: When he ſays one thing and
means another oppoſite or contrary, 'cis an Irony:
When he ſays one thing and means another like to
it, it is a Metaphor: A Metaphor continued and
often repeated becomes an Allegory : A Metaphor
carried to a great Degree of Boldneſs is an Hyper-
bole; and when at firſt Sound it ſeems a little harſh
and ſhocking, and may be imagin'd to carry ſome
Impropriety in it, 'tis a Catachreis.” Introd, to

det in domo lacunar, wants only a Syllable to make
it a perfect lambick. 2. HYPERCATALEXIS,
or HYPERMETRON, where a Verſe has a
Syllable too much, from unèpo ſupra, & mérgey,
Menſura ; as, this of Horace, firboribuſque coma,
is a DaEtylit Dimeter with a Syllable too much.

it be thought a Thing incredible with you, that God
ſhould raiſe the Dead? When God himſelf has
given Aſſurance of it unto all Men, in that he hath
raiſed Chriſt from the Dead. CONFIRM. As for
my own Part; Moft Noble FESTUS, I own I
once verily thought that even I myſelf ought to do
many Things contrary to the Name of Jeſus of Na-
zareth. Which Thing I alſo did in Jeruſalem. I
puniſh'd the Saints oft in every Synagogue, and
compelled them to blaſpheme; and being exceed-
ingly mad againſt them, I perfecuted them even
unto ſtrange Cities. In Purſuit of which, as I went
to Damaſcus, with Authority and Commiſſion from
the chief Prieſts; At Mid-day, O King, I ſaw in
the Way a Light from Heaven, above the Bright-
neſs of the Sun, ſhining round about me, and them
which journeyed with me. And when we were all
fallen to the Earth, I heard a Voice ſpeaking unto
me, and ſaying in the Hebrew Tongue, Saul, Saul,
wby perfecuteſt thou me? It is bard for thee to kick
againſt the Pricks. And I ſaid, Who art thou Lord?
And he ſaid, I am Jeſus whom thou perſecuteſt. But
riſe and ſtand upon tby Feet : For I have appeared
unto thee for this Purpoſe, to make thee a Miniſter
and a Witneſs both of theſe Things which thou baft
ſeen, and of thoſe Things in which I will appear unto
thee. Whereupon, 0 King AGRIPPA, I was
not diſobedient to the Heavenly Viſion : But ſhewed
firſt unto them of Damaſcus, and at Jeruſalem; and
throughout all the Coaſts of Judea, and then to the
Gentiles, that they ſhould repent and turn to God.
REFUTATION. For theſe Cauſes the Jews
caught me in the Temple, and went about to kill
me. Having therefore obtained Help of God, I
continue unto this Day, witneſſing both to Small
and Great, ſaying none other Things than thoſe
which the Prophets and Moſes did ſay ſhould come:
That

PERORATION. This, Moſt excellent Auditors, is
the real Truth: Believe me, I am no Peſtilent Fel-
low, nor Mover of Sedition ; but always endeavour
all that lies in me to preſerve a Conſcience void of
Offence towards God and towards Man : Nor can
the Jews prove the Things whereof they now accuſe
me. Neither am I, FESTUS, beſides myſelf;
but ſpeak thus freely before the King, becauſe he
knows theſe Things to be Fact, yea I am fully per-
ſuaded the King knows 'em all to be Fact: For they
were not done in a Corner. King AGRIPPĂ,
believeſt thou the Prophets? I know that thou be-
lieveſt. And, would to God that not only Thou,
but alſo All, that hear me this Day, were altogether
ſuch as I am, except theſe Bonds.

THESIS and Subſtance taken from 1 Esdras,
Chap. iv. in the Apocrypha.
Μεγάλη η Αλήθεια, και ισχυροτέρα παρά πάλα.
Great is the TRUTH, and Stronger than all Things.
PROP. SRUTH is great and mighty above all
Things. All the Earth calleth upon

tremble at it, and with it is no unrighteous Thing.

CONCLUSION. Since therefore, All other
Things that Men count laſting, great and ſtrong,
are found to be frail, weak and wicked; Wine is
wicked, Kings are wicked, Women are wicked, All
the Children of Men are wicked, and ſuch are all
their wicked Works, all which muſt periſh; but as
for Truth, it endureth, and is always ſtrong; it liv-
eth, and conquereth for evermore : I conclude, and

above all Things. Bleſſed be the GOD of Truth.

That the Force of Genius or meer Strength of
Natural Parts produces it ; and that Learning
is ſo far from contributing any thing thereto,
that by its Precepts, and Rules it rather cramps

He owns, that in all Productions Nature
ought to act freely and unconfin'd; however,
not ſo headlong or irrational, as to be ſubject
to no Laws of Method. He confeſſes indeed
the Force of Genius to be the Foundation and
primogenial Principle of all that can be callid

what Manner, Time and Place, for what End,
and under what Reſtrictions it ought to be

Natural Abilities frequently want Ballaſt as
well as Sail, a Bridle as well as a Spur. And
that what DEMOSTHENES ſaid of Common

the Prudent Skill to manage it, which if want-

He contemns the Danger he may

LONGINUS concludes this Section with
obſerving that the ODYSSES, which Homer
writ in his Decline of Life, has little or no-
thing of that Magnanimous Sublimity, which
is frequently to be met with in the ILIAD,
which was wrote in the Bloom and Vigour of
his Days : Not but that ſome of his Deſcrip-
tions of Storms, his Fable of the Cyclops, and
ſome other Repreſentations in his ODYSSES
are very excellent : However, far otherwiſe are
his Æolus's bladdering up the Winds, Circe's
turning Ulyſſes's Friends into Swine (whom
ZOILUS merrily ftiles χοιρίδια κλαίοντα, ,
forieking Pigs) with Jupiter's being fed by
Doves, Ulyſſes faſting ten Days after he was
caft away, and other Inconſiſtencies in killing
Penelope's Sweethearts. In ſhort, ſays he, Ham
mer in the Odyſes may be compared to the
ſetting Sun, who, tho it abates of its Heat,
retains ſtill the fame Magnitude. And tho'
theſe Narrations were the Effects of old Age,
yet remember'twas the old Age of an HOMER.

ſublime in their Way. Cicero, ſays he (ei ry
huivos“Erano iv écitaú to govcácxeiv, If we Gre-
be allow'd to know any Thing of Latin
Writers) differs in Sublimity from Demoſthenes
in this. Derofthenes is fublime in the conciſe
cloſe Way, but Cicero in the diffuſive. De-
moſthenes's Talent of Sublimity conſiſts in ſtrong
Exaggerations and forcible warm Paffions, where
’tis neceſſary on all Sides to move the Auditory:
But Cicero's Talent lies in an extenſive Amplify-
ing, where 'tis proper to ſmooth and mollify;
a Stile well adapted and fitted for Deſcriptions,
Addreffes, Narrations, Hiſtory, Natural Phi-
loſophy, and moſt other Things in the Demon-

IN SECTION XVI. he paſſes to his third
Fountain of Sublimity, viz.
THE PROPER MANAGEMENT OF
FIGURES.
But, as the Figures that may be made uſe of
ini Diſcourſe are almoſt innumerable, he pur-
poſes to treat only of a few of the chief, being
ſuch as contribute moſt towards Sublimity. And
here he mentions APOSTROPHE or Addrefs.
An Apoſtrophe is when an Author in ſome
Commotion turns himſelf from his main Sub-
ject, and addreſſes on all ſides, viz. to the
Heavens, Earth, Rocks, Forefts, Things fen-
ſible, inſenſible, and what not?
APOSTROPHE turns off to make Addreſs :
She lives! How ſhall I, Heav’ns, my Thanks expreſs?
LONGINUS mentions here an Oath of DE-
MOSTHENES as a ſublime Apoſtrophe, 8
έσιν όπως ημάρετε, έ μα τες εν Μαραθωνι προ-
xnvduvetoavas, Ye have not acted wrong ; No,
I ſwear it by thoſe mighty Chiefs that fell at
Marathon. Where he compliments his An-
ceſtors as Gods in ſwearing by 'em. But ob-
ſerve, ſays our Critic, 'tis not every ſilly Oath
that's ſo fublime, for this of EUPOLIS is
quite flat,
Μα την Μαραθώνι την εμήν μάχην, ,
I ſwear it by my Marathonian Fight.
IDARE fay, SIR, you'll excuſe me, if
for the future, inſtead of LONGINUS's In-
ſtances out of the Ancients, I ſhould produce
Examples from a Modern Author equally Sub-

lime. For, indeed, ſuch to me appear the Pal-
ſages that I ſhall tranſcribe from Mr. JAMES
THOMSON on the Seaſons, viz. Spring,
Summer, Autumn, Winter; late Pieces of Poe-
try, which, according to LONGINUS's Cri-
terion of Sublimity, have upon a repeated Pe-
ruſal irreſiſtably forced myAttention and laſting
Admiration. [N. B. They are taken from his
firſt Edition.]
The following ſublime APOSTROPHES
are his.
The firſt in Praiſe of Agriculture. After
having deſcribed the preparative Effects of the
Spring, and Labours of the Huſbandman in
plowing, ſowing, harrowing, &c.—he ſays-
BE gracious, HEAV’N! for now laborious Man
Has
done bis Due. Ye foſtering Breezes, blow !
Ye ſoftening Dews, ye tender Showers, deſcend !
And temper all, thou world-reviving Sun,
Into the perfeet Year! Nor, ye who live
In Luxury and Eaſe, in Pomp and Pride,
Think theſe loft Themes unworthy of your Ear.
'Twas ſuch as theſe the Rural MARO ſung
To the full ROMAN Court, in all it's Height
Of Elegance and Taſte. The ſacred Plow
Employ'd the Kings and Fathers of Mankind,
In ancient Times. And ſome with whom compar'd
You're but the Beings of a Summer's Day,

Of mighty War, then with deſcending Hand,

ATHROISMUS various Things collects in One:--

ANTIMETABOLE exchanges Words :
They're Slaves in Lordſhip, and in Slavery Lords.

of Words from their cuſtomary Signification,
and applying them to other Things than what
they properly mean, on account of ſome Re-
ſemblance or Reference theſe Things have with
each other : So that we may reckon there are
as many ſorts of Tropes as there are different
References ; tho' it has pleaſed Rhetoricians to
eſtabliſh but few. The proper uſe of all which
contributes
very much towards Sublimity. The
moſt conſiderable of 'em are a META-

OUR Critic proceeds in SECTIONS
XXXIX, XL, XLI, XLII, and XLIII. to his
fifth and laſt Fountain of Sublimity, which is -
A Lofty and MAGNIFICENT COM-
POSITION.
By which he means, A certain Happineſs in
diſpoſing of our Expreſons into juſt Periods, or,
An Harmonious Diſtribution of Words agree-
able to the Senſe and Meaning of Sentences. For
doubtleſs when Sounds agree with the Things
that are expreſs’d by them, the Diſcourſe muſt
become more ſignificative and lively. There is
a kind of Sympathy betwixt the Soul, and the
Numbers of Proſe as well as Poetry, which
Numbers are therefore Inſtruments very proper
to provoke and agitate the Paſſions. The Ideas
of Things have a ſecret Alliance and Connection
among themſelves, and do excite one another:
Thus the Sound of a Trumpet puts us in mind,
and provokes us to Combat : when we hear the
Noiſe of the Sea we imagine it preſently, tho'
perhaps it is out of Sight. Without doubt then
certain Sounds, certain Numbers, and certain
Cadences do contribute to raiſe the Images of
Things with which they have Alliance and
Connection; and ought particularly to be re-
garded by him that would write Sublimely.

The firſt is a Storm of Thunder and Light-

'TIS dumb Amaze, and liſtening Terror all i
When to the quicker Eye the livid Glance
Appears far South, emiſſive thro' the Cloud;
And, by the powerful Breath of God inflate,
The Thunder raiſes his tremendous Voice ;
At firſt low-muttering ; but at each approach,
The Lightnings flaſh a larger Curve, and more
The Noiſe aſtounds; till over bead a Sheet
Of various Flame diſcloſes wide, then ſhuts
And opens wider, Smuts and opens fill
Expanſive, wrapping Æther in a Blaze.

Enlarging, deepening, mingling Peal on Peal
Cruß'd berrible, convulling Heav'n and Earth.

UP-SPRING S the Lark,
Shrill-voic'd, and loud, the Meſſenger of Morn;
E’er yet the Shadows fly, He mounted ſings
Amid the dawning Clouds, and from their Haunts
Calls up the tuneful Nations. Every Cople
Thick wove, and Tree irregular, and Buſh,
Are prodigal of Harmony. The Thruſ
And Wood-Lark, o'er the kind-contending Throng
Superior heard, run thro' the ſweeteſt Lengths ;
The Blackbird whiſtles from the thorny Brake;
The mellow Bull-Finch anſwers from the Grove:
Nor are the Linnets, o'er the flowering Furze
Pour'd out profuſely, filent. Join'd to theſe
Thouſands beſide. The Jay, the Rook, the Daw,
And each barſh Pipe, diſcordant beard alone,
Here aid the Concert: While the Stock-Dove breathes
A melancholy Murmur thro' the whole.
