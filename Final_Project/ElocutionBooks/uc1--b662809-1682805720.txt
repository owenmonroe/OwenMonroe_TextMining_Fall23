Much declamation has been employed, to convince the world's
of a very plain truth, that to be able to speak well is an orna- ';
mental and useful accomplishment. · Without the labored pan: 0
egyrics of ancient or modern orators, the importance of good at
elocution is sufficiently obvious to all. Every one will acknowley
edge it to be of some consequence, that what a man has hourly 1,1;
occasion to do, should be done wall. Every private company, 11:51
aud almost every public assembly, afford opportunities for re-, vit
marking the difference between a correct and expressive, and a imate
aulty and unnatural elocution, and there are few persons, who ::
do 1.0t daily experience the advantages of the former, and the parende
inconvenieuces of the latter. The great difficulty is, not to :
prove that it is a desirable thing to be able to read and speaking
well, but to point out a practicable and easy method, by whieht;
this accomplishment may be acquired. Prije samo sad?;?. 1:1250,44 torres
Walker's System of Inflection is bothing more than an analt, iris
ysis, as it were, of the manner in which the best speakers who
are free from provincial accent, modulate their voice. In their
speaking, the voice either rises or falls, or continues in the same i
tone. When it rises, or takes the upward turn, it is saiil to : 'ts,
have the rising inflection;, and whu it falls, or takes the down tosi
ward turn, it is said to have the falling inflection .; i bnt when it be
continues in the same tone, neither rising nor falling, it is said !,!1,
to be in a nionotone. In some cases there is va union of the ri.
siul au falling ivflections on the same syllable, which is called ,
the circumflex inflection, and it is distinguishable into the ri- tione
sing and alling circumflex, according as it commences with the State
rising or falling inflection. But it is an error to say that the soul
inflections are essential to the sense, and for this palpable rea- 1 1

venting thousands from thinking rationally, or thinking at all
on the subject. It never could make a good reader, reciter, or
speaker. On the contrary, the study of it, has rendered the de-
livery of many, unnatural and rediculous, who otherwise, might
have been good speakers. His interininable rules may ser vejas
a proof of the soundness of the observation of Condillac, “that
we have never so much to say, as when we set out from false
principles.”
Speak in your own natural voice. Do not assume an artificial
one, nor imitate the p:culiarity of another person's voice. That
which sits well upon him, and, in fact, fo:ms a part of his idio-
syncrasy, will be unnatural if assumed by you. Seek tü im-
prove the good qualities of your own voice, and to correct it's
faults, but still let it be your voice. Observe how you form
those tones, which your judgement, after some practice, will tell
you are natural.
In order to produce a good voice, and to speak with ease,
keep erect, but n:it p'rpendicular, whether you stand or sit.
strained manner; the shoulders depressed and thrown back;
the mouth must be well opened by lowering the under jaw, but
without distorting the features. If the mouth be not sufficiently
opened, the voice will not have full power; if too much, the fea-
tures will be distorted ; and in either case, the articulation and
quality of the voice wiil be injured.
Let your lips perform their proper part in articulating. Many
persons open their mouths well, but scarcely move their lips,
and consequently, although the voice produced may be good, the
words are not distinct. Speak as it were, further back, but
with the throat expanded, not contracted. You will thus produce
a more sonorous voice, which will fill a large building, with less
fatigue to you, than by your speaking in the light, lip voice of
ordinary conversation. But take care to avoid monotony, and
not to confound this orotund quality of voice with tone,
the latter belonging to feelmg.
Take breath quietly. Avoid all gasping or drawing in of the
breath with perceptible effort. Generally, the lungs will supply
themselves with breath, if you only give them time to do so, by
pausing in the proper places. To hurry on, phrase after phrase,
without allowing yourself time to breathe, is not only very disa-
greeable to your hearers, but highly injurious to your lungs. If

you distress yourself, your hearers will feel your uneasiness.
For so strong is the sympathy between the organs of speech ånd
those of hearing, that the least uneasiness in one is immediately
perceived by the other. Reading aloud, long continued, with
the lungs but partially distended, is very injurious to these or-
gans ; it is apt to occasion a spitting of blood, which is often a
precursor of pulmonary comsumption. But reading aloud, with
proper management of the breath, is a healthful exercise. Be-
sides strengthening the muscles which it calls into action, it pro-
motes the decarbonization of the blood, and consequently exerts
a salutatory influence on the system.
Read conversational dialogues and dramatic scenes,' which are
effective means of breaking up monotonous and mechanical tones.
Learn to read one character well, then another, then all ; mod-
ulating the voice for the different characters.
Avoid all nostrums for 'improving the voice. Many are
highly injurious, containing opium or other deleterious drugs ;
and although they may at first appear to improve the voice, they
wili ultimately and permanently injure it. Exercise and temper-
ance are the only sure strengtheners. Whatever improves the gen-
eral state of the health will equally improve the vocal organs.
Practice with moderation, and rest before the voice becomes fa-
tigued. Do not load the stomach before speaking Cravats
should not be thick, as such weaken the vocal organs, nor worn
so tight as to impede their action. But avoid a slovenly looseness.
Snuff is very injurious to the voice.
Most vocal complaints arise from over exertion, or from too
little practice. In the first case, rest—in the latter, daily practice
will effect a cure.
True impressiveness is only to be given to words by uttering
them expressively, that is, in tones expressing the feeling of the
passage ; in the pitch of the voice natural to the feeling or senti-
ment to be expressed ; in the movement, or degree of slowness or
fasta-ss appropriate to the words ; and with that degree of force
which is equal to the energy of the language.
These terms are frequntly misapplied. It is a common blun-
der to confound pitch, with power. A speaker is often said to
have spoken in too low a tone to be heard, which is incorrect.
High and low refer to the degrees of pitch or acuteness and grav-
ity of sounds, and loud and soft to the degrees of power. You
may speak in a large room upon the lowest pitch of your voice, and

be heard if you use sufficient power, and upon your highest pitch
in a small room without annoying your auditors, you use power
,only sufficient to fill the place.
rectly indicates the feeling of the speaker, as a tone of grief, rage,
despair, melancholy, confidence, arrogance, &c. Follow nature :
consider how she teaches you to utter any sentiment or feeling of
your heart. Whether you speak in a private room, or in a great
assembly, remember that you still speak, and speak naturally.
As in pathology, so is it in oratory, what comes from the
heart goes to the heart. Conventional tones and action have
been the ruin of delivery in the pulpit, the senate, the bar, and
on the stage. Tone is distir ct from quality of the voice, or
that peculiari:y which distinguishes the speaker's idiosyncrasy.
This quality should not be imitated by any one, for that which
sits well upon one person will be unnatural in another of differ-
ent characteristics.
Tone is of the highest importance; it is the great secret of
power ul delivery. There is as great a difference between a fine
passage read in expressive tones and in the usual conventional
tones adopted by most readers, as there is between an air of
Handel sung by Jenny Lind and the most common-place vocalist.
Pitch, movement, and force are also of great iinportance.
The four form infinite variety for the expression of feeling and
sentiment, and are to be acquired to a great degree Ly study and
practice. The highest degrees of expression in tone and force
are the prerogatives of genius ; but even then polish is required
to approach perfection.
but it requires great art and practice to bring the voice lower,
when it is once raised too high. It ought, therefore, to be a first
principle rather to begin under the common level of the voice,
than above it.
If you are naturally weak in voice, or through habit have fal-
len into a weak utterance; read, or speak daily, and if posssible,
in a large room, gradually increasing the power ; for the meth-
od of increasing by degrees is easy in this as in everything else,
when sudden transitions are impracticable ; and every new acqui-
sition of power will enable you the better to go on to the next de-
gree. When you have attained that loudness, beyond which you

cannot go without forcing your voice,there stop, and in that, or :
little under that degree, practice for some time, but not untill fa
tigued.
The middle pitch of the voice should first be strengthened, then
the lower and higher pitches, Take particular care not to raise the
pitch of the voice, but only to add power. If you have the oppor
tunity practice in the open air, or on the sea-shore, and with the
face to the wind. When the voice has acquired considerable
power, occasionally speak aloud while walking up an ascent,

est part of huse theatres, and producell a greater effect than the
loudest I awl of those who tore passion to tatters, to the rags, to
split the ears of the groundlings. Although the higher notes are
not so often required as the middle or lower, they must be
perfectly under command. Nothing can be worse in a public speak
er than the breaking or changing of his “big manly voice," to
"childish treble," when it should rouse like a trnmpet.
Proportion the loudness of your voice to the size and peculiari
ties of the place, so that you neither fatigue your-self and annoy
your audience by unnecessary loudness, nor remain unheard by
many, by using too little power. In echoing buildings, be very
distinct and slow : make frequent and long pauses ; be as smooth
as possible; use little power and attend to the returning sound.
Study the peculiarities of the place in which you have to speak
either by practicing there or observing another speaker, and from
different parts of the building.

Demonsthenes first spoke in public, he could not even pronounce
the first letter of his art, Rhetoric; and, to this day, people are
told that this was a natural defect in his organs; but had that been
the case, it would have been impossible that he ever should have
corrected 'it, which he did by indefatigable pains. In several
countries and counties the natives cannot pronounce certain letters.
It would be strange to suppose that all those people were
born with a peculiar defect in their organs, when the matter is so
plainly to be accounted for, upon the principle of imitation and

habit.
Parents should assist their children in their first attempts to
articulate words; and make them proceed regularly, in the for.
mation of such sounds only as are most easy, and require least
exertion of the organs. By suffering chem to try to pronounce
any words whatever, or even often urging them to speak such
as are too difficult, they cause false articulation,
Writers on elocution have frequently attempted to describe the
formation of the various articulate sounds, for the benefit of those
whose articulation is imperfect; but it is almost impossi le to
clearly describe the formation by words, and engravings show
but part of the process. The best inethod of correcting defective
speech, when not arising from organic defect, is to imitate the
pupil's mode of pronour cing to show him what is wrong, and
then to pronounce the word correctly, to show him by the move.
ment of your own mouth, how he should speak. Defective ar-
ticulation frequently arises from endeavouring to speak too fast. !
Time is not given for the organs to form the correct sounds, and
habit confirms the false. Children ought not to be
allowed to repeat their lessons in a hurried manner, either while
committing them to memory, or repeating them to the teacher.
Mrs. Siddon's first direction to her pupils was, “Take time.”
Where there is a uniformly rapid utterance, it is absolntely im-4
possible that there should be strong emphasis, natural tones, or
good elocution. Aim at nothing higher, till you can read distinct-
ly and deliberately.
“Learn to speak slow, all other graces s
Will follow in their propor places."
The best method of correcting or preventing careless articula-
tion, is to repeat a few words daily, loudly and distinctly, taking
them promiscuously from your reading lesson, and attending whol-
ly to pronouncing them well, without any regard to the context,
If you pronounce any particular sound amiss, let words contain-
ing it predominate, but do not utter too many of these successive-
ly. Speak the words in various pitches, tones, rates of utterance,
and degrees of force. Write down all the words you are in the
habit of misprononncing, and read them over two or three times
daily until corrected. After a time read over the list again, to
ascertain whether the correct pronunciation has been acquirerl.
Stammerers, instead of speaking immediately after inspira-
tion, as they should do, often attempt to speak immediately after

ing. The method of cure isto keep the lungs well filled, to draw
frequent long breaths, to speak loud, and to pause on the instant
ot finding embarrassment in the speech, taking a long inspiration
before you go on again.
It is not easy to fix upon any standard, by which the proprie-
ty of pronunciation may be determined, A rigorous adherence
to etymology, or to analogy, would often produce a pedantic
pronunciation of words. The fashionable world has too much
caprice and affectation to be implicitly followed. If there be any
true standard of pronunciation, it must be sought for amongst
those, who unite the accurancy of learning with the eleegance of
polite conversation.
The instance of bad pronunciation which is most common, and
therefore requires particular notice, is the mis-application of the
aspirate h. This defect sometimes occasions ludicrous, and even
serious mistakes. It is an omission which materially affects the
energy of the speaker; the expression of emotions and passions,
often depending upon the vehemence with which the aspirate is
uttered.
In the majority of words containing the letter h, either at the
beginning, middle, &c., the h should be aspirated.
In the following words, h is silent :-heir, heirloom ; herb,
herbage; honest, honestly ; honor, honorable, honorably ;
hospital ; hostler ; hour hourly, humorist, humorously; and their
other derivatives. The h in humble was formerly silent, but it is
now aspirated. Humble pie is an incorrect spelling of umble-
pie, a pie made of umbles, a plural noun, meaning a deer's entrails ;
the h is a wrong spelling, and should be omitted.
The h in the following words, is silent, though not initials-
asthma, dishabille, isthmus, rhapsody, rhetoric, rheumatism,
Rhine, rhinoceros, rhomb, rhubarb, rhyme. rhythm, Thames,
Thomas. Also in such words asmah, catarrh, Micah, Sarah,
&c.
Many omit the aspirate, not only at the beginning of words, but
after the w, as in where, &c.; and in the middle of words, as in
forehead, which they mispronounce fored, instead of forehead;
in abhor, behold, exhaust, inhabit, un horse, &c. Others not
only omit the aspirate where it should be sounded, but aspirate

where there is no ih, or where it should be silent, as hend for
ond, &c. This is the grossest fault,
Be careful not to mistake loudness for aspiration. Hold up
the finger a few inches i from your mouth, and pronounce.any
word containing the h. If you aspirate, you will feel the breath
against your finger, but not it you merely speak louder. ..
Many often substitute the sound of w for 25 and v for 20. To
cure this often repeat a few words beginning with or containing
the V, and bite the under hip while sounding the v, until the let-
ter be well pronounced ; then repeat words beginning with or con.
taining the 20, which must be pronounced by: a pouting out of the
lips, without suffering them to touch the teeth. Vis formed by
pressing the lower part of the upper teeth against the inside of the

R has two sounds—the strong vibratory r, heard at the begin.
ning of words and of syllables, as ir rage, error; and the smooth
yo, which is heard at the termination of words, or when it is suic-
ceeded by a consonant. The first is formed byjarring the tongue
tagainst the roof of the mouth, near the fore teeth ; and the second
bya vibration of the tongue near the root against the inward re
gion of the palate. In some parts of Ireland, the p before the fi-
pal consonant, as in card, is pronounced with the force of the
commencing r, accompanied by a strong aspiration as the begin-
ning of the letter ; whereas in England, and particularly in London,
åt is entirely sunk, and the ord sounds as if written card. The
Scotch frequently give it with more roughness and clearness at the
termination than at the beginning. But the sound they give at the
commencement is not the English terminational sound; it is a
Legligent and imperfect quiverivg of the first English r. In such
words as thorn, worm, inany of the Scotch as well as the Irish;
sound the rn, as if they formed a seperate syllable. Many per-
sons, from indolence or inattention, instead of quivering the
tip of the tongue in this letter, give it a burring sound by quiv.
ering the epiglottis. In looking into the mouth of these persons,
on desiring them to sound r, the tongue is seen thrust behind the
lower teeth ; by causing them to lift up the tongue, balance it in
the mouth, and then breathe strongly, they will frequently at once
give the true sound of the letter. The difficulty afterwards lies
in teaching the terminational r, which they will for a time give
With the old sonnd ; in such cases they should use the first , though
it is harsh, and soften it gradually.

Give full expression to the words by pronouncing them slow or
fast, as may be proper, and giving each letter which is not silent,
it's due sound. The English language is most expressive if prop:
erly spoken. It abounds in words which seem to paint things for
which they stand. We are apt to slur the vowels in long words
where they are of most use. The consonants may be styled the
bones of the language, and the vowels it's flesh. As for perfect
beanty of form in the human figure, both are required, so are they
to leauty of sound in a language. The English language is in this
respect nearer to perfection than any modern tongue, and next af-
ter the Greek. I mean in sound, for our language is not the same
in sound, when well spoken, as it looks upon paper.
Consonants should not be preceded or terminated by any con.
fused sound of their own. Thus: 8-such, this-8.
Expression does not reside in the mere letters which compose
the word ; it depends on the due force given to them in utterance.
No letter so harsh, which may not be softened; so strong, which
may not be weakened ; and vice versa. The long may be short-
ened, and the short lengthened. Whenever the power of the con-
sonants is particularly suited to the expression, their sound should
be enforced; when otherwise, softened.
As Shakespeare says, “Speak the speech I pray you, as I pro-
nounced it to you, trippingly on the tongue; bit if you mouth it,
as many of your players do, I had as lief the town crier had spo-
ken my lines," By 'trippingly on the tongue,' he means the boug-
ding from accent to accent.; tripping from syllable to syllable,
without resting on them; and by 'mouthing is meant, dwelling
upon syllables that have no accent, and ought therefore, to be ut-
tered as quickly as is consistent with distinct articulation; or pio.
longing the sounds of the accented syllables beyond their due pro-
portion of time.
Do not depend on the punctuation, for the pauses in speaking,
delivery of a sentence, and points to it's grammatical construction.
The punctuation is usually made by the printer, according to rule,
few authors paying any attention to it. Divide the sentence into
groups of words, and pause at each group, thus :-"To leor
not to be that is the question-whether-'tis nobler in the mind
to suffer the slings add arrows-of outrageous fortnne-or to
take arms against a sea of troubles--and by opposing-end
them.” The Kemble School pronounced whole sentences with-

out a pause, frequntly causing the words to be weakened for want
of breath. This style has a monotonous grandeur analogous to a
vast building without architectural divisions, as a large pyramid.
The Macready School paused at almost every word, giving undce
force to many words. This style hail a monotonous smalloess.
These actors were great despite their artificial styles. Each
phrase should, by having it's pause, be simply distinct, and form
a part of one grand whole.
The following passage from the Tragedy of “Isabella,”I by
T. Southern, is one of great beauty :
“Sooner or later, all things pass away,
And are no more. The beggar and the king,
With equal steps, tread forward to their end; ***
The reconciling grave
Swallows distinction first, that made us foes,
Then all alike lie down in peace together.
When will that hour of peace arrive for me?: WIJ
In heaven I shall find it:not in heaven
IKT
If my old tyrant father can dispose
Of things above. But there his interest and
May be as poor as mine, and want a friend
As much as I do here!”.
At this point we will also give a quotation from the Tragedy
“The Serf,"by Talbot. It has the merit of being not only po-
etical, but true.
E'en as a picture, while the canvass yet
Is unprepard, lives in the painter's eye
Distinct in it's gradations, from the sharp foreground,
Each distance finely stealing from the next,
'Til all are melted in the dim horizon,
So is the life of man, or ere his birth
Mysteriously shadow'd forth by fate,
Through every stage: and all that intervenés,
Between the earliest wail and dying groan,
is
Is merely coloring."
- Let the length of the pause be proportioned to the connection
between the groups; the more distant the groups, the longer
should be the pause, and vice versa. Thus the phrases or
groups of words become distinct to the ear as the groups in a
good picture to the eye.
Pause should ever be proportioned to quantity. As longer
quantity is given, the pauses between the words, and, particu-
larly between the logical words, or different thoughts, should
be lengthened. It is a common fault, in the endeavor to be more
deliberate in the pronunciation, the pauses only, or the quantity
only, is lengthened.

A pause for effect may often be made where a pause is not re-
quired. The full power of expression of the voice should be con-
centrated upon the following word, thus-"yet what to me, is
this quintessence of-dust.” “It is a tale, told by an idiot, sig.
nifying-nothing."
A succession of pauses and concentrations each increasing in
force to a climax is exceedingly effective, but must be used spar-
ingly, and in only in high-wrought passion.
Pauses are not only nescessary, in order to enable the speaker
to take breath without inconvenience, and hereby preserve the
command of the voice, but in order to give the hearer a distinct
perception of the construction and meaning of each sentence, and
a clear understanding of the whole. An uninterrupted rapidity of
utterance is one of the worst faults in elocution. A speake, who
has this fault, may be compared to an alarm bell, which, when
once put in motion, clatters on till the weight that moves it is run
down. Without pauses, the spirit of what is delivered must be
lost, and the sense must appear confused and may even be misrep-
rseented in a manner most absurd and contradictory. There
have been recitaters, who have made Douglas say to Lord Ran-
dolph :-
“We fought and conquered ere a sword was drawn.
An arrow from my bow had pierced their chief," &c.
. We fought and conquered-ere a sword was drawn,

A mechanical attention to punctuation has, perhaps, been one
cause of monotony, by leading the reader to a uniform cadence at
every full period

and emphasize the same words as in prose. The accent may be
changed when the ear would be more annoyed with the harshness
of the verse, if the right accent were preserved, than with a wrong
accent which preserves the melody of the verse. "Where a word
admits of some diversity in placing the accent, the verse ought to
decide; but when the poet has contrived that his numbers shall
be harsh, in order to correspond to the ideas they suggest, the
common accentuation must be preserved.
Do not pause at the end of a line (verse) unless there be a pause
in the sentence. The best pronouncers of tragedy have never
observed this pause. The numbers of the verse, the dignity of
the language, and an inversion of the common order of the words,
constitute the verse.
All verse requires a stated regular march of the syllables, and
and it is in this march that the grandeur and beauty of the verse
consists. In reading blank verse, care must be taken to steer be-
tween the one extreme of ending every line with a pause, and the
other, of running one line into another more rapidly than if they
were prose, as some do in seeking to avoid the fault.
In reading rhymed verse, where rhymes recur at regular inter.
vals, and are well defined, as in Campbell's “Hohenlinden," do
not dwell upon them, but read the rhymes smoothly. They will
shew themselves. Where the rhymes recur at irregular intervals,
as in Dryden's “Alexanders' Feast," or when not well defined
slightly dwell upon them,
Action is important to the orator, but it is an error to suppose
that the ancients considered it the most important requisite in
speaking. This mistake has probably arisen from a common
mistranslation in the anecdote related both by Cicero and Quin.
tilian, “When Demosthenes was asked what was the first point
of eloquence, the second, and the third, he answered, 'Action, ac-
tion, action,'”-Guthrie's Cicero. Actio, with the Romans,
comprised the general delivery, or what is now styled elocution ;
and elocution, the choice of words, or diction. Dr. Blair, in
giving the anecdote, translates action delivery. That this is the
trne meaning is evident ; for Cicero in a succeding paragraph says
“But as to the advantages and excellency of action, the chief
and most desirable lice is a good voice."
It has been said that action should not be practised, but that if
the speaker be in earnest the action will follow. True, but it will
frequently be faulty. The action which we use in public, if we
are in earnest, will often be different to what we used when pract.

ising, but that exercise will improve our, involuntary gestures,
Observe the attitude and actions in paintings, and sculpture,
and of actors and orators. Adopt those that are expressive and
suit you. - Those that sit well on one person may appear absurd,
when used by another of different personal characteristics. Prac-
tice attitudes and actions by themselves without words, in the
same manner that a singer practices vocal expression apart from
songs, and a dancer practices steps and positions apart from the
dance of which they form parts. In speaking, let the action rise
impulsively, and if you feel naturally, it will be the proper action,
and come in the right place. From having been practiced it will
be well executed.
Support the body on one foot-generally the left-o firmly,
that the other can relieve it promptly and easily. Let the right
foot be a few inches outwards. Always face the audience, and
brace the figure proportionately to the energy of the language.
The head should be held in an erect and natural posture, neither
dropping on one side, nor thrown back. Do not shake or nod the
head frequently, toss it violently, or agitate the hair by rolling it
about. The hair should not be allowed to cluster or hang over
the forehead. Keep the elbow from inclining to the body. Avoid
swaying your body from side to side.
In all motions of the limbs,the movement ought generally to pro-
ceed from the superior part; that is, from the shoulder not the
elbow ; from the thigh, not the knee; from the knuckle, not the
finger joint; otherwise the movement will be angular and ungrace-
ful. Sometimes angular actions are natural.
The hands are capable of great expression, and ought not to be
covered. The right hand should perform the principal and great.
er number of gestures. Its action should be more forcible than
that of the left. Each arm may perform similar gestures when
the body of the speaker is presented towards the person addressed
precisely in front, but not otherwise ; for one arm would conceal
the other. Never mark a single idea or word with more than one
Changes of action must accord with the language. Sometimes
the transition must be instantaneous ; at others, modulating
through other grstures. The calmer the language, the slower:
should be the movements ; and vice versa.
Direct your eyes to those you address, unless the subject re
quires them to be raised &c. Never use any gestures merely for

your dress while speaking."
In painting descriptions by gestures, great judgmeat is necessa:
ry." In some cases, a most powerful and natural effect may be pro-
duced; whilst in others, descriptions realized would be most ridist
ulous. ****,
Generally, the voice, features, and limbs should simultaneously
express the same passion or thought. Sometime the action should
precede the voice, as in ill suppressed feeling. Wie i m
Decision of action is more important than grace. The mostat:
ungraceful action if decided, will be more effective than the most
graceful without decision. The two are seldom combined ind
their bighest degrees.
Study repose ; without it, both in action and speech, the eyes,
ears, and minds of the audience, and the powers of the speaker, :
are alike fatigued.'
The language of passion is uniformly taught by Nature, and is
everywhere intelligible. It consists in the use of tones, looks,
and gestures. When anger, fear, joy, grief, love, or any other
passion is raised within us, we naturally discover it by the man
ner in which we utter our words, by the features of the face, and
by other well known signs. The eyes and countenance as well as
the voice, are capable of endless variety of expression, suited to
every possible diversity of feeling, and with these the general air
and gesture naturally accord. The use of this language is not
confined to the more vehement passions. Upon every subject and
occasion on which we speak, some kind of feeling accompanies the
words, and this feeling, whatever it may be, has it's proper
expression.
It is an essential part of elocation, to imitate this language of
Nature. But precept can afford little assistance. To describe
in words the particular expression, which belongs to each emotion:
and passion, is wholly impracticable, All attempts to enable
men to become orators, by teaching them, in written rules, the
manner in which the voice. countenance, and hands, are to be ems
ployed in 'expressing the passion, must from the nature of the
thing, be exceedingly imperfect, and consequently ineffectual.
Therefore, observe the manner in which the several passions and.:
feelings are expressed in real life ; and when you attempt to ex-
press any passion, inspire yourself with that secondary kind of
feeling which imagination is able to excite; and follow your teel?

ings with no other restrain than “this special observance, that
you o’erstep not the modesty of nature.”
Study not only the effect of the passions, but also their effect on
your own face, that you may distinguish those which become, from
those which distort it. Distinguish the difference between a t al-
teration of the features expressing the feelings, and the grim aces
that attend a play of the muscles.
Take care not to work yourself up to tears; yet if they fw
naturally do not attempt to stop them. Whep tears flow naturally
they effect powerfully.
Above all, be in earnest. When the Bishop of London asked
Betterton, "What could be the reason that whole audiences should
be moved to tears, and have all sorts of passions excited, at the
representation of some story on the stage, which they knew to be
feigned, and in the event of which they were not at all concern :d ;
but that the same persons should sit so utterly unmoved at dis- :
courses from the pulpit, upon subjects of the utmost importancat o
them, relative not only to their temporal, but also their eternal in- :
terests?" he received from the tragedian this memorable reply, :
“My Lord, it is because we are in earnest.” But before re-
signing yourself to the sway of your feelings, be sure that you have
the power of guiding and correcting them when they are growing
impetuous. "For in the very torrent, tempest, and (as I may say)
the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a temper..
ance, that may give it smoothness."
Do not mistake loudness for intensity. Intensity relates to pag-
sion or feeling ; loudness to amount of voice. The former should
be proportioned to the language; the latter to the size of the place.
Their difference is that of passion and rant, nature and extrava-
gance, ..
Let there be variety in the pitch of your voice, high, low, &c., :
according to the nature of the language-variety in the toncs,
every feeling being expressed by its natural tone, as the tone of
anger, grief, &c. variety in the degree of force given to each
phrase according to its importance-variety in the movement,
slow, fast, &c., according to the subject : but let all this variety
be used only as required by the language, and never merely for
the sake of display.
All public speaking and reading, but especially acting and re..
citing,must be a little heightened above ordinary nature, the pauses
beiag longer and more frequent, the tones stronger, the action more

the same in quality, but larger in quantity. The greater number
of the auditors being at a distance, it must have stronger touches
and greater light and shade than would be correct or necessary
for a near view alone, but yet be so moderated as not to disgust the
nearest auditors by gross exaggeration--as a statue or picture,
placed at a distance, must be larger than life, but yet a perfect re- ,
semblance; the features must be colossal, but not different.
Action should not be used in ordinary or scriptural reading im-
passioned language where the reader, for the time is in the place
of the author, or in reading from a MS. address, as a sermon,
speech, &c., a moderate amount of action may be used, but it must
be impulsive.
In reading, the book should be held in the left hand, a few
iaches from the body, and as high as the center of the breast, the
face being nearly perpendicular. It should not, however, be held
so high as to prevent the audience from seeing the reader's mouth,
as the voice would there-by be more or less obstructed, and the ex-
pression of the features partly concealed. The head should neith.
er be thrown back, nor bent forward, but be easily erect. If you
stand before a desk, stand at sueh a distance from it, and let the
desk be of that beight, that you can see to read without stopping.
If your sight be not good, it will be better for you to wear spec-
tacles than to stoop to see. The fingers of the right hand may
hold the margin of the book lightly, so as to be ready to turn
over the leaves, or they may be placed just below the line the read-
er is pronouncing, to aid him in keeping his place. -
The eyes should occasionally be directed from the words of the
discourse to the audience.
It is impossible for anyone, however gifted, to become a finished
elocutionist, without considerable study and practice, It, per-
haps more than any other art, depends on the latter, without
which, theory will be unavailing.
In practice, do not pause to correct a fault, or a habit of hesi-
tating and correcting, often unnecessarily, will be formed. Fin-
ish the sentence, and then speak it again. In public, correcta
fault, if palpable, but not otherwise.
Let the length of the passage you select for practice be propor-
tioned to the time you can devote to it, so that you can repeat it
twice or thrice during the time. At first study well every sentence,
speaking carefully; afterwards, with more spirit. Bafore the
passage bụcomes irearisome, selected another, and after a tiine recur

to the former. If you have more time than you can exercise
without becoming fatigued, practice a portion in subdued manner,
· but with distinct articulation, expression &c.;
: The ancients had a method of practicing, styled "the silent pre-
paration of the voice." Cresolinus illustrates it by a story from
Plutarch:6A barber at Rome had a magpie,' possessing great
imitative'talents. The funeral procession of a rich citizen stopped
pear the barber's shop, and a solemn piece of music by trumpets
was performed. For three days afterwards the magpie kept such
profound silence, that it was fearod his ear had been stunned by the
trumpets, and that his talents and voice were lost; but after this
long silence, to the admiration and astonishment of all, he began
to imitate perfectly the whole music; so that his three days' silence,'
Plutarch observes, "arose from his mentally practicing the music.”
Mrs. Siddons, Garrick, and many eniinent orators pursued the
saine method.
In committing to memory, first read the whole passage; then
learn the first sentence or paragraph ; then the second ; then join
the latter to the former, and so on to the end always going back
to the first line. If very long, divide into sections, and learn one
at a time in the above manner. Learn aloud, but in a subdued
voice. Night is the best time for committing to memory. If you
have been imperfect in the words of a speech, &c., read them
over two or three times the same day or night, and they will be
fixed in your memory the next morning.
Endeavor to learn something from every one, either by imitat-
ing, but not servilely, what is good, or avoiding the bad. Re-
member that trifles make perfection, and that perfection is no trifle.
Never read a speech if you can avoid it. Use noies to refer to,
if you cannot dispense with all aid, To impart to the delivery of
a written discourse something of the vivacity and interesting effect
of real, earnest speaking, the reader must draw off his mind as
wuch as possible from the thought that he is reading, and from
too much thought respecting his utterance ; he must fix his mind as
earnestly as possible on the matter, and strive to adopt as his
own, at the moment of utterance, every sentiment he delivers.
Children should be early accustomed to read as they speak, and to
give up, as much as possible, purely mechanical reading.
Frequently recite compositions from memory. This method
has several advantages. It obliges the speaker to dwell upon the
ideas which he is to express, and hereby enables him to discern

their particular meaning and force, and gives him a previous kuowl-
edge of the saveral inflections, emphasis, and tones, which the
. lieves him from the ipfluence of the schoolboy habit of reading in
a different manner from that of conversation ; and it affords great-
er scope for expression in tones, looks, and gestures. Such reci-
tation, as the great Lord Clarendon says, is, t'the best! and most
natural way to introduce an assurance and confidence in speaking
with that leisure and tone of pronunciation that is decent and gra-
ceful, and in which so few men are excellent, for want of infor-
mation and care when they are young.”.
