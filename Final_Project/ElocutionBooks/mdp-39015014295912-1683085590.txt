FRANÇOIS DELSARTE.
François Delsarte was born November II, 1811, at
Solesme, a little town of the Department of the North, in
France. His father, who was a renowned physician and
the author of several inventions, might have secured a
fortune for his family, had he been more anxious for the
morrow, but he died in a state bordering upon poverty.
In 1822, François was apprenticed to a porcelain painter
of Paris, but, yielding to a taste and aptitude for music, in
the year 1825, he sought and obtained admission to the
Conservatory as a pensioner. Here a great trial awaited
him—a trial which wrecked his musical career. but was.a.
decided gain for his genius. He had been placed in the
vocal classes, and in consequence of faults in method and
direction, he lost his voice. He was inconsolable, but,
without making light of his sorrow, we may count that
loss happy, which gave the world its first law-giver in the
art of oratory. - - - - - - - - -
The young student refused to accept this calamity
without making one final effort to retrieve it. He pre-
sented himself at the musical contest of 1829. His im-
paired voice rendered success impossible, but kind words
from influential friends in a great measure compensated
for defeat.
The celebrated Nourrit said to him : “I have given you

xviii BIOGRAPHICAL.
my vote for the first prize, and my children shall have no
singing-master but you.”
“Courage,” said Madame Malibran, pressing his hand.
“You will one day be a great artist.”
But Delsarte knew that without a voice he must re-
nounce the stage, and yielding to the inevitable, he gave
up the rôle of the actor to assume the functions of the
professor. After his own shipwreck upon a bark without
pilot or compass, he summoned up courage to search into
the laws of an art which had hitherto subsisted only upon
Caprice and personal inspiration.
After several years of diligent study, he discovered and
formulated the essential laws of all art; and, thanks to
him, aesthetic science in our day has the same precision
as mathematical science. He had numerous pupils,
many of whom have become distinguished in various
public careers—in the pulpit, at the bar, on the stage, and
at the tribune. *
Madame Sontag, when she wished to interpret Gluck's
music, chose Delsarte for her teacher. Rachel drew
inspiration from his counsels, and he became her guardian
of the sacred fire. He was urgently solicited to appear
with her at the Theatre-Français, but religious scruples
led him to refuse the finest offers.
Madame de Giradin (Delphine Gay), surnamed the
Muse of her country, welcomed him gladly to her salon,
then the rendezvous of the world of art and letters, and
regretted not seeing him oftener. He was more than
once invited to the literary sessions of Juilly college, and,
under the spell of his diction, the pupils became animated
by a new ardor for study.
Monseigneur Sibour had great esteem and affection for
Delsarte, and made him his frequent guest. It was in

the salon of this art-loving archbishop that Delsarte
achieved one of his most brilliant triumphs. All the
notable men of science had gathered there, and the con-
versation took such a turn that Delsarte found opportu-
nity to give, without offence, a challenge in these two
lines of Racine:
Z’onde approche, se àrise, et zomit dº nos yeux,
A armi des ſlots d'écume, un monstre furieux.
}
(“The wave draws near, it breaks, and casts before our eyes,
Amid the floods of foam, a monster grim and dire.”)
|
“Please tell me the most emphatic and significant
word here,” said Delsarte. &
All reflected, sought out and then gave, each in turn,
his chosen word. Every word was selected save the Con-
junction ef (and). No one thought of that.
Delsarte then rose, and in a calm and modest, but
triumphant tone, said: “The significant, emphatic word
is the only one which has escaped you. It is the con-
junction and, whose elliptic sense leaves us in appre-
hension of that which is about to happen.” All owned
themselves vanquished, and applauded the triumphant
artist.
Donoso Cortés made Delsarte a chosen confidant of
his ideas. One day, when the great master of oratorical
diction had recited to him the ZXies /ræ, the illustrious
philosopher, in an access of religious emotion, begged
that this hymn might be chanted at his funeral. Delsarte
promised it, and he kept his word.
When invited to the court of Louis Philippe, he re-
plied: “I am not a court buffoon.” When a generous
compensation was hinted at, he answered: “I do not sell
my loves.” When it was urged that the occasion was a
birth-day féte to be given his father by the Duke of

Orleans, he accepted the invitation upon three con-
ditions, thus stated by himself: “Ist. I shall be the only
singer; 2d. I shall have no accompaniment but the
opera chorus; 3d. I shall receive no compensation.”
The conditions were assented to, and Delsarte surpassed
himself. The king paid him such marked attentions that
M. Ingres felt constrained to say: “One might declare in
truth that it is Delsarte who is king of France.”
Delsarte's reputation had passed the frontier. The
king of Hanover committed to his instruction the greatest
musical artiste of his realm, and was so gratified with her
improvement that, wishing to recompense the professor,
he sent him the much prized Hanoverian medal of arts
and sciences, accompanied by a letter from his own royal
hand. Delsarte afterwards received from the same king
the cross of a Chevalier of the Guelph order.
Delsarte's auditors were not the only ones to sound
his praises. The learned reviews extolled his merits.
Such writers as Laurentie, Riancey, Lamartine and
Théophile Gautier awarded him the most enthusiastic
praise. Posterity will perpetuate his fame.
|M. Laurentie writes: “I heard Delsarte recite one
evening ‘J//ligenia's Z), eam,’ which the audience had
besought of him. The hall remained thrilled and breath-
less under this impaired and yet sovereign voice. All
yielded in rapt astonishment to the spell. There was no
prestige, no theatrical illusion. Iphigenia was a professor
in a black frock coat; the orchestra was a piano, giving
forth here and there an unexpected modulation. This
was his whole force; yet the hall was mute, hearts beat,
tears flowed from many eyes, and when the recital ended,
enthusiastic shouts arose, as if Iphigenia in person had
just recounted her terrors.

BIOGRAPHICAL. xxi
After Delsarte had gathered so abundant a harvest
of laurels, fate decided that he had lived long enough.
When he had reached his sixtieth year, he was attacked
by hypertrophy of the heart, which left his rich organiza-
tion in ruins. He was no longer the artist of graceful,
supple, expressive and harmonious movements; no longer
the thinker with profound and luminous ideas. But in the
midst of this physical and intellectual ruin, the Christian
sentiment retained its strong, sweet energy. A believer in
the Sacraments which he had received in days of health,
he asked for them in the hour of danger, and many times
he partook of that sacrament of love whose virtue he had
taught so well.
Finally, after having lingered for months in a state
that was neither life nor death, surrounded by his pious
wife, and his weeping, praying children, he rendered his
soul to God on the 20th of July, 1871.
Delsarte never could be persuaded to write anything
upon themes foreign to those connected with his musical
and vocal work. The author of this volume desires to
save from oblivion the most wonderful conception of this
superior intellect: his Course of Æsthetic Oratory. He
dares promise to be a faithful interpreter. If excuse be
needed for undertaking a task so delicate, he replies that
he addresses himself to a class of readers who will know
how to appreciate his motives.
The merit of Delsarte, the honor of his family, the
gratification of his numerous friends, the interests of
Science, the claims of friendship, demand that this light
should not be left under a bushel, but placed upon a
Candlestick—this light which has shed so brilliant a glow,
and enriched the arts with a new splendor.

good is the true end of Oratorical art. In truth, what is
art P Art is the expression of the beautiful in ideas; it is
the true. Plato says the beautiful is the splendor of the
true.
What is art P. It is the beautiful in action. It is the
good. According to St. Augustine, the beautiful is the
lustre of the good.
Finally, what is art P. It is the beautiful in the harmo-
nies of nature. Galen, when he had finished his work
On the structure of the human body, exclaimed : “Behold
this beautiful hymn to the glory of the Creator l’’
What, then, is the true, the beautiful, the good P. We
/might answer, it is God. Then virtue and the glory of
God should be the one end of the orator, of the good
man. A true artist never denies God. y
Eloquence is a means, not an end. We must not love
art. for its own sake, that would be idolatry. Art gives
wings for ascent to God. One need not pause to con-
template his wigs. -
Art is an instrument, but not an instrument of vanity
or complaisance. Truth, alas ! compels us to admit that
eloquence has also the melancholy power of Corrupting
souls. Since it is an art, it is also a power which must
produce its effect for good or evil.
It has been said that the fool always finds a greater
fool to listen to him. We might add that the false, the
ugly and the vicious have each a fibre in the human heart
to serve their purpose. Then let the true orator, the good
man, armed with holy eloquence, seek to paralyze the
fatal influence of those orators who are apostles of false-
hood and corruption. ¥

im on the title-page of my work. It contains its raison
d'être, its justification. Men are poets at birth, but elo-
quence is an art to be taught and learned. All art pre-
supposes rules, procedures, a mechanism, a method which
must be known.
We bring more or less aptitude to the study of an art,
but every profession demands a period more or less pro-
longed. We must not count upon natural advantages;
none are perfect by nature. Humanity is crippled; beauty
exists only in fragments. Perfect beauty is nowhere to
be found; the artist must create it by synthetic work.
You have a fine voice, but be certain it has its defects.
Your articulation is vicious, and the gestures upon which
you pride yourself, are, in most cases, unnatural. Do not
rely upon the fire of momentary inspiration. Nothing is
more deceptive. QThe great Garrick said: “I do not de-
pend upon that inspiration which idle mediocrity awaits.”
Talma declared that he absolutely calculated all effects,
leaving nothing to chance. While he recited the scene
between Augustus and Cinna, he was also performing an
arithmetical operation. When he said:
“Take a chair, Cinna, and in everything
Closely observe the law I bid you heed ”—
he made his audience shudder. *

bad. For example, you are told that the greater the
emotion, the stronger should be the voice. Nothing is
more false. In violent emotion the heart seems to fill the
larynx and the voice is stified. In all such counsels it
behooves us to search out their foundation, the reason
that is in them, to ask if there is a type in nature which
serves as their measure.
We hear a celebrated orator. We seek to recall, to
imitate his inflections and gestures. We adopt his man-
nerisms, and that is all. We see these mannerisms every-
where, but the true type is nowhere.
GAfter much unavailing search, I at last had the good
fortune to meet a genuine master of eloquence. After
giving much study to the masterpieces of painting and
sculpture, after observing the living man in all his moods
and expressions, he has known how to sum up these
details and reduce them to laws. This great artist, this
unrivaled master, was the pious, the amiable, the lamented
Delsarte.`
There certainly was pleasure and profit in hearing this
master of eloquence, for he excelled in applying his prin-
ciples to himself. Still from his teachings, even from the
dead letter of them, breaks forth a light which reveals
horizons hitherto unknown.
This work might have been entitled: Philosophy of
Oratorica/Art, for one cannot treat of eloquence without
entering the domain of the highest philosophy.
\What, in fact, is oratorical art P. It is the means of
expressing the phenomena of the soul by the play of the
organs. It is the sum total of rules and laws resulting
from the reciprocal action of mind and body. Thus man
must be considered in his sensitive, intellectual and moral
state, with the play of the Organs corresponding to these

states. Our teaching has, then, for its basis the science of
the soul ministered to by the organs. This is why we
present the fixed, invariable rules which have their sanc-
tion in philosophy. This can be rendered plain by an
exposition of our method.
The art of oratory, we repeat, is expressing mental
phenomena by the play of the physical organs. It is SS “
translation, the plastic form, the language of human
nature. º
us in three phases: the sensitive, intellectual and moral.
Man feels, thinks and loves. He is en rapport with the
physical world, with the spiritual world, and with God.
He fulfils his course by the light of the senses, the reason, \ ...--
or the light of grace. - A
We call life the sensitive state, mind the intellectua
state, and soul the moral state. Neither of these three
terms can be separated from the two others. They inter-
penetrate, interlace, correspond with and embrace each
other. Thus mind supposes soul and life. Soul is at the
same time mind and life. In fine, life is inherent in mind
and soul. Thus these three primitive moods of the soul
are distinguished by nine perfectly adequate terms. The
soul being the form of the body, the body is made in the
image of the soul. The human body contains three
organisms to translate the triple form of the soul.
The phonetic machinery, the voice, sound, inflections,
are living language. The child, as yet devoid of intelli-
gence and sentiment, conveys his emotions through cries
and moans. -
The myologic or muscular machinery, or gesture, is the
language of sentiment and emotion. When the child
recognizes its mother, it begins to Smile.

xxviii PREFACE.
The buccal machinery, or articulate speech, is the lan-
guage of the mind.
X Man, neither by voice nor gesture, can express two
opposite ideas on the same subject; this necessarily
involves a resort to speech: Human language is com-
posed of gesture, speech and singing. The ancient melo-
drama owed its excellence to a union of these three lan-
guages.
Each of these organisms takes the eccentric, concen-
tric, or normal form, according to the different moods of
the soul which it is called to translate.
In the sensitive state, the soul lives outside itself; it has
relations with the exterior world. In the intellectual state,
the soul turns back upon itself, and the organism obeys
this movement. Then ensues a contraction in all the
agents of the organism. This is the concentric state. In
the moral or mystic state, the soul, enraptured with God,
enjoys perfect tranquility and blessedness. All breathes
peace, quietude, serenity. This is the normal state,<
the most perfect, elevated and sublime expression of
which the organism is capable.
Let us not forget that by reason of a constant transition,
each state borrows the form of its kindred state. Thus
the normal state can take the concentric and eccentric
form, and become at the same time, doubly normal; that
is, normal to the highest degree. Since each state can
take the form of the two others, the result is nine distinct
gestures, which form that marvelous accord of nine,
which we call the universal criterion.
In fine, here is the grand law of organic gymnastics:
The triple movement, the triple language of the organs
is eccentric, concentric, or normal, according as it is the
expression of life, Soul or spirit. --

PREFACE. xxix
Under the influence, the occult inspiration of this law,
the great masters have enriched the world with miracles
of art. Aided by this law the course followed in this
work, may be easily understood.
Since eloquence is composed of three languages, we
divide this work into three books in which voice, gesture
and speech are studied by turns. Then, applying to them
the great law of art, our task is accomplished.
The advantages of this method are easily understood.
There is given a type of expression not taken from the
individual, but from human nature synthetized. Thus
the student will not have the humiliation of being the
slave or ape of any particular master. He will be only
himself. Those who assimilate their imperfect natures to
the perfect type will become orators. Fºunt Oratores.
Success having attended the first efforts, let the would-
be orator assimilate these rules, and his power will be
doubled, aye increased a hundredfold. And thus having
become an Orator, a man of principle, who knows how
to speak well, he will aid in the triumph of religion, jus-
tice and virtue.

CHAPTER I
PRELIMINARY IDEAS — CRITERION OF THE ORA-
TORICAL ART.
Let us note an incontestable fact. The science
of the Art of Oratory has not yet been taught.
Hitherto genius alone, and not science, has made
great orators. Horace, Quintilian and Cicero among
the ancients, and numerous modern writers have
treated of oratory as an art. We admire their writ-
ings, but this is not science; here we seek in vain
the fundamental laws whence their teachings pro-
ceed. There is no science without principles which
give a reason for its facts. Hence to teach and to
learn the art of oratory, it is necessary:
I. To understand the general law which controls
the movements of the organs; *
2. To apply this general law to the movements
of each particular organ;
3. To understand the meaning of the form of
each of these movements;


## p. 4 (#38) ###############################################

4 PRELIMINARY IDEAS.
4. To adapt this meaning to each of the different
States of the soul.
The fundamental law, whose stamp every one of
these organs bears, must be kept carefully in mind.
Here is the formula:
The Sensitive, mental and moral state of man are
rendered by the eccentric, concentric or normal
form of the organism.”
Such is the first and greatest law. There is a
Second law, which proceeds from the first and is
similar to it:
Each form of the organism becomes triple by
borrowing the form of the two others.
It is in the application of these two laws that the
entire practice of the art of oratory consists. Here,
then, is a science, for we possess a criterion with
which all phenomena must agree, and which none
can gainsay. This criterion, composed of our
double formula, we represent in a chart, whose ex-
planation must be carefully studied.
The three primitive forms or genera which affect
the organs are represented by the three transverse
lines.
* The sensitive is also called the vital, the mental the reflective, and the moral the
affective state. The vital sustains, the mental guides, the moral impels.-TRANS-
LATOR.

The subdivision oft the three genera into nine spe-

form, III the normal form. -
The Arabic figures have the same signification.
The normal form, either in the genus or the spe-
cies, we place in the middle column, because it
serves as a bond of union between the two others,
as the moral state is the connecting link between
the intellcctual and vital states.


## p. 6 (#40) ###############################################

Thus the first law relative to the primitive forms
of the organs is applied in the three transverse col-
umns, and the second law relative to their Com-
pound forms is reproduced in the three vertical
Columns.
§
}
As may be easily proven, the eccentric genus /
produces three species of eccentric forms, marked
in the three divisions of the lower transverse column.
Since the figure I represents the eccentric fºrm,
I-I will designate the form of the highest degree Of
eccentricity, which we call eccentro-eccentric.
Since the figure 3 represents the normal form,
the numbers 3-I will indicate the normo-eccentric
form. -
Since the figure 2 designates the form which
translates intelligence, the figures 2-I indicate the
concentro-eccentric form as a spedºes. As the species
proceeds from the genus, we begin by naming the
species in order to bring it back to the genus.
Thus, in the column of the eScentric genus the
figure I is placed after the numbers 3 and 2, which
belong to the species. We must apply the same
analysis to the transverse column of the normal
genus, as also to that of the concentric genus.
Following a diagonal from the bottom to the top
and from left to right, we meet the most expressive
form of the species, whether eccentric, normal or
Concentric, marked by the figures I-I, 3-III, 2-II,
and by the abbreviations Ecc.-ecc. (Eccentro-eccem-
Zric), Worm.–norm. (Mormo-normal), Conc.-conc.

(Concentro-concentric). It is curious to remark
how upon this diagonal the organic manifestations
corresponding to the Soul, that is to love, are found
in the midst, to link the expressive forms of life and
mind.

This chart sums up all the essential forms which
can affect the organism. This is a universal alge-
braic formula, by which we can solve all organic
problems. We apply it to the hand, to the shoul-
der, to the eyes, to the voice — in a word, to all the
agents of Oratorical language. For example, it suf-
fices to know the eccentro-eccentric form of the hand,
of the eyes; and we reserve it for the appropriate
Occasion.
CAll the figures accompanying the text of this
work are only reproductions of this chart affected
by such or such a particular organ. A knowledge
of this criterion gives to our studies not only sim-
plicity, clearness and facility, but also mathematical
precision. ,
In proposing the accord of nine formed by the
figure 3 multiplied into itself, it must be understood
that we give the most elementary, most usual and
least complicated terms. Through natural and suc-
cessive subdivisions we can arrive at 8 I terms.
Thus multiply 9 by 3; the number 27 gives an
accord of 27 terms, which can again be multiplied
by 3 to reach 81. Or rather let us multiply 9 by 9,
and we in like manner obtain 81 terms, which be-
come the end of the series. This is the alpha and

omega of all human Science. Huc usque venies, ef
ibi confringes fumentes fluctus tuos. (“Thus far
shalt thou come, and here shall thy proud waves
be stayed.”)
It is well to remark that this criterion is applied
to all possible phenomena, both in the arts and
sciences. This is reason, universal synthesis. All
phenomena, spiritual as well as material, must be
considered under three or nine aspects, or not be
understood. Three genera and nine species; three
and nine in everything and everywhere; three and
nine, these are the notes echoed by all beings.
We do not fear to affirm that this criterion is divine,
since it conforms to the nature of beings. Then,
with this compass in hand, let us explore the vast
field of oratorical art, and begin with the voice.
NOTE TO THE STUDENT.-Do not go on without a perfect under-
standing of this explanation of the criterion. as well as the exposition
of our method which closes the preface.

CHAPTER II.
OF THE VOICE.
The whole secret of captivating an audience by
the charms of the voice, consists in a practical
knowledge of the laws of sound, inflection, respira-
tion and silence. The voice first manifests itself
through sound; inflection is an intentional modifi-
cation of sound ; respiration and silence are a means
of falling exactly upon the suitable tone and in-
flection.
Sound being the first language of man in the
cradle, the least we can demand of the orator is,
that he speak intelligently a language whose author
is instinct. The orator must then listen to his own
voice in order to understand it, to estimate its value,
to cultivate it by correcting its faults, to guide it—
in a word, to dispose of it at will, according to the
inclination of the moment. We begin the study of
the voice with Sound, and as sound may be viewed
under several aspects, we divide this heading into as
many sections.
Compass of the Voice — Organic Apparatus of the
Voice.
This apparatifs is composed of the larynx, the
mouth and the lungs. Each of these agents derives

its value from mutual action with the others. The
larynx of itself is nothing, and can be considered
only through its participation in the simultaneous
action of the mouth and lungs.
Sound, then, is formed by a triple agent — pro-
jective, vibrative and reflective.
The lungs are the soliciting agent, the larynx is
the vibrative agent, the mouth is the reflective
agent. These must act in unison, or there is no
result. The larynx might be called the mouth of
the instrument, the inside of the mouth the pavilion,
the lungs the artist. In a violin, the larynx would
be the string, the lungs the bow, the mouth the in-
strument itself.
The triple action of these agents produces pho-
nation. They engender sounds and inflections.
Sound is the revelation of the sensitive life to the
minutest degree; inflections are the revelation of
the same life in a higher degree, and this is why
they are the foundation and the charm of music.
Such is the wonderful organism of the human
voice, such the powerful instrument Providence has
placed at the disposal of the orator. But what
avails the possession of an instrument if one does
not know how to use it, or how to tune it? The
Orator, ignorant of the laws of sound and inflection,
resembles the debutant who places the trumpet to
his lips for the first time. We know the ear-tortur-
ing tones he evolves. &
The ear is the most delicate, the most exacting

of all our senses. The eye is far more tolerant.
The eye resigns itself to behold a bad gesture, but
the ear does not forgive a false note or a false in-
flection. It is through the voice we please an
audience. If we have the ear of an auditor, we
easily win his mind and heart. * The voice is a mys-
terious hand which touches, envelops and caresses
the heart. )
Of the Voice in Relation to Compass.
All voices do not have the same compass, or the
same range. By range we mean the number of
tones the voice can produce below and above a
given note on the staff, say A, second space of the
treble clef.
There are four distinct kinds of voices: Soprano,
alto, tenor and bass. There are also intermediate
voices, possessing the peculiar quality of the kind
to which it belongs, for example: Mezzo-soprano,
with the quality of the soprano and only differing
from the soprano in range, the range of this voice
being lower than the soprano and a little higher
than the alto. Then comes the alto or contralto.
In the male voice we have the tenor robusto, a
little lower than the pure tenor and more powerful;
next the baritone, a voice between the tenor and
bass, but possessing very much the quality of the
bass.
The tones in the range of every voice can be
divided into three parts — the lower, medium and

higher. Thus we would say of a performer, he or
she used the lower or higher tones, or whatever the
case may be. This applies to every kind of voice.
The soprano voice ranges generally from the
middle C, first added line below on the treble clef,
upwards to A, first added line above the staff.
Contralto voices range generally from G, below
middle C in the treble clef, up to F, the upper line
Of the clef.
The tenor voice ranges from C, second space of
the F clef, to D, second space in the treble clef.
The bass voice ranges from lower F, first space
below of the F or bass clef, to D, second space
above of this clef.”
The first perception of the human voice impera-
tively demands, I. That the voice be tried and its
Compass measured in order to ascertain to what
Species it belongs. Its name must be known with
absolute certainty. It would be shameful in a mu-
sician not to know the name of the instrument he
uses. 2. That the ear be trained in order to distin-
guish the pitch upon which one speaks.
We should be able to name a sound and to sound
a name. The Orientals could sing eight degrees of
tone between C and D. There may be a whole scale,
a whole air between these two tones. It would be
* The registers here given undoubtedly refer to the singing voice, as the range of
notes in the speaking voice is very much more limited. Very frequently voices are
found whose range in singing is very much greater than that which the author has
given here; however, on the other hand, many are found with even a more limited
range.—TRANSLATOR.

unpardonable not to know how to distinguish or at
least to Sound a semitone.
There is a fact proved by experience, which must
not be forgotten. The high voice, with elevated
brows, serves to express intensity of passion, as well
as small, trivial and also pleasant things.
The deep voice, with the eyes open, expresses
worthy things.
The deep voice, with the eyes closed, expresses
odious things.
The Vozce 272 Relation to Vozve/s.
As already stated, the vocal apparatus is com-
posed of the lungs, the larynx and the mouth ; but
its accessories are the teeth, the lips, the palate and
the uvula. The tip and root of the tongue, the
arch of the palate and the nasal cavities have also
their share in perfecting the acoustic apparatus.
In classifying the different varieties of voice, we
have considered them only in their rudimentary
state. Ability to name and distinguish the several
tones of voice is the starting point. We have an
image more or less perfect, leaving the mould ; we
have a canvas containing the design, but not the
embroidery—the mere outline of an instrument, a
body without a soul. The voice being the language
of the sensitive life, the passional state must pass
entirely into the voice.
We must know then how to give it an expressioſ,
a color answering to the sentiment it conveys. But

this expressive form of the voice depends upon the
sound of its vowels.
There is a mother vowel, a generative tone. It is
a (Italian a). In articulating a the mouth opens
wide, giving a sound similar to a in arm.
The primitive a takes three forms. The unac-
cented, Italian a represents the normal state; a with
the acute accent (') represents, the eccentric state;
a with the grave accent (\) represents the concen-
tric state.
These three als derived from primitive a become
each in turn the progenitor of a family with triple
Sounds, as may be seen in the following genealogi-
cal tree:

Eccentric. Normal. Concentric.
This is the only simple sound, but four other
sounds are derived from it. The three als articu-
lated by closing the uvula, give the nasal am. Each
family also gives its special nasal sound: in for the
eccentric voice, on for the normal state, uſe for the
concentric. All other sounds are derived from
combinations of these. The mouth cannot possibly
produce more than three families of sounds, and in
each family it is a united with the others that forms
the trinity.

The variety of sounds in these three families of
vowels arises from the difference of the opening of

The voice takes different names, according to
the different sounds in each family of vowels: the
chest-voice, the medium voice and the head-
voice.
These names imply no change in the sort of
voice, but a change in the manner of emission.
The head, medium or chest-voice, indicates only

variety in the emission of vowels, and may be
applied to the high as well as the deep and medium
voice. Thus the deep voice may produce sounds
in the head-voice, as well as in the medium and
chest voices. -
The head-voice is produced by lowering the lar-
ynx, and at the same time raising the uvula. In
Swallowing, the larynx rises by the elevation of the
uvula, without which elevation there can be no
head-tones.
Practical Conclusions.
I. It is highly important to know how to assume
either of these voices at will. The chest-voice is
the expression of the sensitive or vital life, and is the
interpreter of all physical emotions.2. The medium
voice expresses sentiment and the moral emotions.
The head-voice interprets everything pertaining to
scientific or mental phenomena. By observing the
laugh in the vital, moral and intellectual states, we
shall see that the voice takes the sound of the
vowel corresponding to each state. *
We understand the laugh of an individual; if
upon the i (e long), he has made a sorry jest; if
upon 6 (a in fate), he has nothing in his heart and
most likely nothing in his head; if upon & ( a
short), the laugh is forced. O, &, (a long) and ou
are the only normal expressions. Thus every one
is measured, numbered, weighed. There is reason
in everything, even when unknown to man. In

physical pain or joy, the laugh or groan employs
the vowels ē, e, i.”
2. The chest-voice should be little used, as it is a
bestial and very fatiguing voice.
3. The head-voice or the medium voice is pref-
erable, it being more noble and more ample, and
not fatiguing. In these voices there is far less dan-
ger of hoarseness. The head and medium voices
proceed more from the mouth, while the chest-voice
has its vibrating point in the larynx.
4. The articulation of the three syllables, /a, mo
and po, is a very useful exercise in habituating one
to the medium voice. Besides reproducing the
tone of this voice, these are the musical consonants
par excellence. They give charm and development
to the voice. We can repeat these tones without
fatiguing the vocal chords, since they are produced
by the articulative apparatus.
5. It is well to remark that the chest, medium

and head voices are synonymous with the eccen-
tric, normal or concentric voice.
6. It is only a hap-hazard Sort of Orator who
does not know how to attain, at the outset, what is
called the white voice, to be colored afterward at
will. The voice should resemble the painter's pal–
let, where all the colors are arranged in an orderly
manner, according to the affinities of each. A
colorless tint may be attained in the same way as a
pure tint. It may be well to remark here, although
by anticipation, that the expressions of the hand
and brow belong to the voice. The coloring of the
larynx corresponds to the movements of the hand
or brows.
Sound is painting, or it is nothing. It should be
in affinity with the subject.

CHAPTER III.
THE VOICE IN RELATION TO INTENSITY OF SOUND.
What is Understood by Intensity of Sound.
The voice has three dimensions — height, depth
and breadth; in other terms, diapason, intensity and
duration ; or in yet other words, tonality, timbre
and succession.
Intensity may be applied alike to the voice and
to sound. The voice is strong Or weak, according
to the mechanism of the acoustic apparatus. The
strength or weakness of sound depends upon the
speaker, who from the same apparatus evolves
tones more or less strong. It is the forfe, piano
and pianissimo in music. Thus a loud voice can
render weak tones, and a weak voice loud tones.
Hence the tones of both are capable of increase or
diminution.
Means of Augmenting the Timbre of the Voice.
I. A stronger voice may be obtained by taking
position not upon the heel or flat of the foot, but
upon the ball near the toes—that attitude which
further on we shall designate as the third. The
chest is eccentric; that is, convex and dilated. In
this position all the muscles are tense and resemble
the chords of an instrument whose resonance is pro-
portional to their tension.


## p. 20 (#54) ##############################################

2O VOICE.
2. There are three modes of developing the voice.
A voice may be manufactured. A natural voice is
almost always more or less changed by a thousand
deleterious influences.
I. In volume, by lowering the larynx, elevating
the soft-palate and hollowing the tongue.
2. /72 intensity.—A loud voice may be hollow.
It must be rendered deep, forcible and brilliant by
these three methods: profound inspiration, explo-
sion and expulsion. The intensity of an effect may
depend upon expulsion or an elastic movement.
Tenuity is elasticity. It is the rarest and yet the
most essential quality of diction.
3. In compass.-There are three ways of increas-
ing the compass of the voice:
I. By the determination of its pitch;
2. By practicing the vocal Scale;
3. By the fusion of the registers upon the key-
note.
The first of these methods is most effective. The
Second consists in exercising upon those notes
which are near the key-note. Upon this exercise
depends in great measure the homogeneity of the
voice. Taking /a for the diapason, the voice which
extends from the lowest notes to upper re is the
chest-voice, since it suffers no acoustic modification.
From mi to la the voice is modified; it is the me-
dium voice, or the second register, which gives full
and supple tones. The head or throat-voice, or the
third register, extends from si to the highest and

INTENSITY OF SOUND. 2 I
sharpest notes. Its tones are weak, and should be
avoided as much as possible. There are then only
four good notes — those from mi to /a, upon which
the voice should be exercised. By uniting the reg-
isters, an artificial, homogeneous voice may be cre-
ated, whose tones are produced without compression
and without difficulty. This being done, it is evi-
dent that every note of the voice must successively
indicate the three registers — that is, it must be
rendered in the chest, medium and head voices.
There is also a method of diminishing the voice.
As the tone is in proportion to the volume of air in
the lungs, it may be weakened by contracting the
epiglottis or by suppressing the respiration.
Rules for /ntensity of Sound.
1. The strength of the voice is in an inverse ratio
to the respiration. The more we are moved, the less
loudly we speak; the less the emotion, the stronger
the voice. In emotion, the heart seems to mount
to the larynx, and the voice is stifled. A soft tone
should always be an affecting tone, and consist only
of a breath. Force is always opposed to power. It
is an error to suppose that the voice must be in-
creased as the heart is laid bare. The lowest tones
are the best understood. If we would make a low
voice audible, let us speak as Softly as we can.
Go to the sea-shore when the tempest rages.
The roar of the waves as they break against the
vessel's side, the muttering thunders, the furious

wind-gusts render the strongest voice impotent.
Go upon a battle-field when drums beat and trum-
pets sound. In the midst of this uproar, these dis-
cordant cries, this tumult of Opposing armies, the
leader's commands, though uttered in the loudest
tones, can scarce be heard; but a low whistle will
be distinctly audible. The voice is intense in seren-
ity and calm, but in passion it is weak.
Let those who would bring forward subtle argu-
ments against this law, remember that logic is often
in default when applied to artistic facts.
A concert is given in a contracted space, with an
orchestra and a double-bass. The double-bass is
very weak. Logic would suggest two double-basses
in order to produce a stronger tone. Quite the
contrary. Two double-basses give only a semitone,
which half a double-bass renders of itself. So
much for logic in this case.
The greatest joy is in sorrow, for here there is
the greatest love. Other joys are only on the sur-
face. We suffer and we weep because we love.
Of what avail are tears? The essential thing is
to love. Tears are the accessories; they will come
in time, they need not be sought. Nothing so
wearies and disgusts us, as the lachrymose tone. A
man who amounts to anything is never a whimperer.
Take two instruments in discord and remote from
each other. Logic forbids their approach lest their
tones become more disagreeable. The reverse is
true. In bringing them together, the lowest be-


## p. 23 (#57) ##############################################

INTENSITY OF SOUND. 23
comes higher and the highest lower, and there is an
accord.
Let us suppose a hall with tapestries, a church
draped in black. Logic says, “sing more loudly.”
But this must be guarded against lest the voice be-
come lost in the draperies. The voice should scarce
reach these too heavy or too Sonorous partitions,
but leaving the lips softly, it should pulsate through
the audience, and go no farther.
An audience is asleep. Logic demands more
warmth, more fire. Not at all. Keep silent and
the sleepers will awaken.
2. Sound, notwithstanding its many shades, should
be homogeneous; that is, as full at the end as at the
beginning. The mucous membrane, the lungs and
the expiratory muscles have sole charge of its trans-
mission. The vocal tube must not vary any more
for the loud tone than for the low tone. The
opening must be the same. . The low tone must
have the power of the loud tone, since it is to be
equally understood. The acoustic organs should
have nothing to do with the transmission of sound.
They must be inert so that the tone may be homo-
geneous. The speaker or singer should know how
to diminish the tone without the contraction of the
back part of the mouth.
To be homogeneous the voice must be ample.
To render it ample, take high rather than low notes.
The dipthong eu (like as in muff), and the vowels at
and o give amplitude to sound. On the contrary,


## p. 24 (#58) ##############################################

24 VOICE.
the tone is meagre in articulating the vowels ē, and
4. To render the voice ample, we open the throat
and roll forth the sound. The more the sound is
circumzvoluted, the more ample it is. To render the
voice resonant, we draw the tongue from the teeth
and give it a hollow form; then we lower the lar-
ynx, and in this way imitate the French horn.
3. The voice should always be sympathetic, kind-
ly, calm, and noble, even when the most repulsive
things are expressed. A tearful voice is a grave
defect, and must be avoided. The same may be
said of the tremulous voice of the aged, who em-
phasize and prolong their syllables. Tears are out
of place in great situations; we should weep only
at home. To weep is a sure way of making people
laugh.

CHAPTER IV.
THE VOICE IN RELATION TO MEASURE.
Of Slowness and Rapidity in Oratorical Delivery.
The third and last relation in which we shall
study voice, is its breadth, that is, the measure or
rhythm of its tones.
The object of measure in oratorical diction is to
regulate the interval of sounds. But the length of
the interval between one sound and another is sub-
ject to the laws of slowness and rapidity, respira-
tion, silence and inflection.
Let us first consider slowness and rapidity, and
the rules which govern them.
I. A hasty delivery is by no means a proof of
animation, warmth, fire, passion or emotion in the
orator; hence in delivery, as in tone, haste is in an
inverse ratio to emotion. We do not glide lightly
over a beloved subject; a prolongation of tones is
the complaisance of love. Precipitation awakens
suspicions of heartlessness; it also injures the effect
of the discourse. A teacher with too much facility
or volubility puts his pupils to sleep, because he
leaves them nothing to do, and they do not under-
stand his meaning. But let the teacher choose his
words carefully, and every pupil will want to suggest
some idea; all will work. In applauding an Orator


## p. 26 (#60) ##############################################

26 VOICE.
we usually applaud Ourselves. He says what we
were just ready to say; we seem to have suggested
the idea. It is superfluous to remark that slowness
without gesture, and especially without facial ex-
pression, would be intolerable. A tone must always
be reproduced with an expression of the face.
2. The voice must not be jerky. Here we must
keep jealous watch over ourselves. The entire in-
terest of diction arises from a fusion of tones. The
tones of the voice are sentient beings, who love,
hold converse, follow each other and blend in a
harmonious union.
3. It is never necessary to dwell upon the sound
we have just left; this would be to fall into that
jerky tone we wish to avoid.
Of Respiration and Silence.
We place respiration and silence under the same
head because of their affinity, for respiration may
often be accounted silence.
Of silence.—Silence is the father of speech, and
must justify it. Every word which does not pro-
ceed from silence and find its vindication in Silence,
is a spurious word without claim or title to our
regard. Origin is the stamp, in virtue of which we
recognize the intrinsic value of things. Let us, then,
seek in silence the sufficient reason of speech, and
remember that the more enlightened the mind is,
the more concise is the speech that proceeds from
it. Let us assume, then, that this conciseness keeps

OF RESPIRATION AND SILENCE. 27.
pace with the elevation of the mind, and that when
the mind arrives at the perception of the true light,
finding no words that can portray the glories open
to its view, it keeps silent and admires. It is
through silence that the mind rises to perfection, for
silence is the speech of God.
Apart from this consideration, silence recom-
mends itself as a powerful agent in oratorical effects.
By silence the orator arouses the attention of his
audience, and often deeply moves their hearts.
When Peter Chrysologue, in his famous homily
upon the gospel miracle of the healing of the issue
of blood, overcome by emotion, paused suddenly
and remained silent, all present immediately burst
into sobs.
Furthermore, silence gives the orator time and
liberty to judge of his position. An orator should
never speak without having thought, reflected and
arranged his ideas. Before speaking he should de-
cide upon his stand-point, and see clearly what he
proposes to do. Even a fable may be related from
many points of view; from that of expression as
well as gesture, from that of inflection as well as
articulate speech. All must be brought back to a
Scene in real life, to one stand-point, and the orator
must Create for himself, in some sort, the rôle of
Spectator.
Silence gives gesture time to concentrate, and do
good execution.
One single rule applies to silence: Wherever


## p. 28 (#62) ##############################################

28 VOICE.
there is ellipsis, there is silence. Hence the inter-
jection and conjunction, which are essentially ellip-
tic, must always be followed by a silence. -
A'espiration.— For the act of respiration, three
movements are necessary: inspiration, suspension
and expiration. -
Its importance.—Respiration is a faithful render-
ing of emotion. For example: He who reigns in
the Skies. Here is a proposition which the com-
posed Orator will state in a breath. But should
he wish to prove his emotion, he inspires after every
word. He – who — reigns – in — the – skies. Multi-
plied inspirations can be tolerated on the strength
of emotion, but they should be made as effective as
possible.
Inspiration is allowable:—
I. After all words preceded or followed by an
ellipse;
2. After words used in apostrophe, as Monsieur,
Madame ;
3. After conjunctions and interjections when there
is silence;
4. After all transpositions; for example: To live,
one must work. Here the preposition to takes the
value of its natural antecedent, work, that is to say,
six degrees, since by inversion it precedes it, and
the gesture of the sentence bears wholly on the
preposition;
5. Before and after incidental phrases;
6. Wherever we wish to indicate an emotion.


## p. 29 (#63) ##############################################

INFLECTIONS. 29
To facilitate respiration, stand on tip-toe and ex-
pand the chest.
Inspiration is a sign of grief; expiration is a sign
of tenderness. Sorrow is inspiratory; happiness,
expiratory.
The inspiratory act expresses Sorrow, dissimulation
The expiratory act expresses love, expansion,
sympathy.
The suspensory act expresses reticence and dis-
quietude. A child who has just been corrected de-
servedly, and who recognizes his fault, expires.
Another corrected unjustly, and who feels more
grief than love, inspires.
Inspiration is usually regulated by the signs of
punctuation, which have been invented solely to
give more exactness to the variety of sounds.
Inſections.
Their importance.—Sound, we have said, is the
language of man in the sensitive state. We call
inflections the modifications which affect the voice
in rendering the emotions of the senses. The tones
of the voice must vary with the sensations, each of
which should have its note. Of what use to man
would be a phonetic apparatus always rendering
the same sound? Delivery is a sort of music whose
excellence consists in a variety of tones which rise
or fall according to the things they have to express.
Beautiful but uniform voices resemble fine bells
whose tone is sweet and clear, full and agreeable,

but which are, after all, bells, signifying nothing,
devoid of harmony and consequently without vari-
ety. To employ always the same action and the
same tone of voice, is like giving the same remedy
for all diseases. “Annui was born one day from
monotony,” says the fable.
Man has received from God the privilege of re-
vealing the inmost affections of his being through
the thousand inflections of his voice. Man's least
impressions are conveyed by signs which reveal har-
mony, and which are not the products of chance.
A sovereign wisdom governs these signs.
With the infant in its cradle the signs of sensi-
bility are broken cries. Their acuteness, their as-
cending form, indicate the weakness, and physical
Sorrow of man. When the child recognizes the
tender cares of its mother, its voice becomes less
shrill and broken; its tones have a less acute range,
and are more poised and even. The larynx, which
is very impressionable and the thermometer of the
sensitive life, becomes modified, and produces sounds
and inflections in perfect unison with the sentiments
they convey.
All this, which man expresses in an imitative fash-
ion, is numbered, weighed and measured, and forms
an admirable harmony. This language through the
larynx is universal, and common to all sensitive be-
ings. It is universal with animals as with man. Ani-
mals give the identical sounds in similar positions.

and calling his mother to admire him, rises to the
fourth note of the scale. If his delight becomes
more lively, to the sixth ; if the mother is less
pleased than he would have her, he ascends to the
third minor to express his displeasure. Quietude
1s expressed by the fourth note. -
Every situation has its interval, its corresponding
inflection, its corresponding note: this is a mathe-
matical language.
Why this magnificent concert God has arranged
in our midst if it has no auditors? If God had
made us only intelligent beings, he would have
given us speech alone and without inflections. Let
us further illustrate the rôle of inflection.
A father receives a picture from his daughter.
He expresses his gratitude by a falling inflection:
“Ah well ! the dear child.” The picture comes
from a stranger whom he does not know as a painter;
he will say, “Well now ! why does he send me
this?” raising his voice.
If he does not know from whom the picture
comes, his voice will neither rise nor fall; he will
say, “Well well well !”
Let us suppose that his daughter is the painter.
She has executed a masterpiece. Astonished at
the charm of this work and at the same time grate-
ful, his voice will have both inflections.
If surprise predominates over love the rising in-
flection will predominate. If love and surprise are
equal, he will simply say, “Well now !”


## p. 32 (#66) ##############################################

32 VOICE.
A an in Chinese signifies at the same time the
roof of a house, a cellar, well, chamber, bed — the
inflection alone determines the meaning. Roof is
expressed by the falling, cellar by the rising inflec-
tion. The Chinese note accurately the depth and
acuteness of sound, its intervals and its intensity.
We can say: “It is pretty, this little dog ' " in 675
different ways. Some one would do it harm. We
say: “This little dog is pretty, do not harm it!”
“It is pretty because it is so little.” If it is a mis-
chievous or vicious dog, we use pretty in an ironi-
cal sense. “This dog has bitten my hand. It is a
pretty dog indeed '' etc.
Rules of Inflection.
I. Inflections are formed by an upward or down-
ward slide of the voice, or the voice remains in
monotone. Inflections are, then, eccentric, concen-
tric and normal.
2. The voice rises in exaltation, astonishment,
and conflict.
3. The voice falls in affirmation, affection and de-
jection.
4. It neither rises nor falls in hesitation.
5. Interrogation is expressed by the rising inflec-
tion when we do not know what we ask; by the
falling, when we do not quite know what we ask.
Por instance, a person asks tidings of his friend's
health, aware or unaware that he is no better.
6. Musical tones should be given to things that


## p. 33 (#67) ##############################################

INFLECTIONS. 33
are pleasing. Courtiers give musical inflections to
the words they address to royalty.
7. Every manifestation of life is a song; every
sound is a song. But inflections must not be multi-
plied, lest delivery degenerate into a perpetual sing-
song. The effect lies entirely in reproducing the
same inflection. A drop of water falling constantly,
hollows a rock. A mediocre man will employ
twenty or thirty tones. Mediocrity is not the too
little, but the too much. The art of making a pro-
found impression is to condense; the highest art
would be to condense a whole scene into one inflec-
tion. Mediocre speakers are always seeking to en-
rich their inflections; they touch at every range,
and lose themselves in a multitude of intangible
effects.
8. In real art it is not always necessary to fall
back upon logic. The reason needs illumination
from nature, as the eye, in order to see, needs light.
Reason may be in contradiction to nature. For
instance, a half-famished hunter, in sight of a good
dinner, would say: “I am hungry,” emphasizing
/...ungry, while reason would say that am must be
emphasized. A hungry pauper would say: “I am?
hungry,” dwelling upon am and gliding Over hatre-
gry. If he were not hungry, or wished to deceive,
he would dwell upon hungry.

Special //aftections.
Among the special inflections we may reckon : —
I. Barclamations.—Abrupt, loud, impassioned
Sounds, and improvisations.
2. Cries.— These are prolonged exclamations
called forth by a lively sentiment of some duration,
as acute suffering, joy or terror. They are formed
by the Sound &. In violent pain arising from a
physical cause, the cries assume three different
tones: one grave, another acute, the last being the
lowest, and we pass from one to the other in a chro-
matic order.
There are appealing cries which ask aid in peril.
These cries are formed by the sounds é and Ö.
They are slower than the preceding, but more acute
and of greater intensity. *
3. Groans.—Here the voice is plaintive, pitiful,
and formed by two successive tones, the one sharp,
the final one deep. Its monotony, the constant
recurrence of the same inflection, give it a remark-
able expression.
4. Zamentation is produced by a voice loud,
plaintive, despairing and obstinate, indicating a
heart which can neither contain nor restrain itself.
5. The soë is an uninterrupted succession of
sounds produced by slight, continuous inspirations,
in some sort convulsive, and ending in a long, vio-
lent inspiration.

interrupted series of slight expirations, rapid and
somewhat convulsive, of a tone more or less acute
and prolonged, and produced by a deep inspiration.
8. Singing is the voice modulated or composed
of a series of appreciable tones.

CHAPTER I.
OF GESTURE IN GENERAL.
Human word is composed of three languages.
Man says what he feels by inflections of the voice,
what he loves by gesture, what he thinks by articu-
late speech. The child begins with feeling; then
he loves, and later, he reasons. While the child
only feels, cries suffice him ; when he ioves, he
needs gestures; when he reasons, he must have
articulate language. The inflections of the voice
are for sensations, gesture is for sentiments; the
buccal apparatus is for the expression of ideas.
Gesture, then, is the bond of union between inflec-
tion and thought. Since gesture, in genealogical
Order, holds the second rank in human languages,
we shall reserve for it that place in the series of our
Oratorical studies.
We are entering upon a subject full of impor-
tance and interest. We purpose to render familiar
the heart language, the expression of love.


## p. 40 (#74) ##############################################

4O GESTURE.
We learn dead languages and living languages:
Greek, Latin, German, English. Is it well to know
conventional idioms, and to ignore the language of
nature? The body needs education as well as the
mind. This is no trivial work. Let it be judged
by the steps of the ideal ladder we must scale
before reaching the perfection of gesture. Observe
the ways of laboring men. Their movements are
awkward, the joints do not play. This is the first
Step.
At a more advanced stage, the shoulders play
without the head. The individual turns around
with a great impulse from the shoulders, with the
leg raised, but the hand and the rest of the body
remain inert. Then come the elbows, but without
the hand. Later come the wrist-joint and the torso.
With this movement of the wrist, the face becomes
mobilized, for there is great affinity between these
two agents. The face and hand form a most inter-
esting unity. Finally, from the wrist, the articula-
tion passes to the fingers, and here is imitative
perfection. If we would speak our language elo-
quently, we must not be beguiled into any patois of
gesture.
Gesture must be studied in order to render it fault-
lessly elegant, but in such a thorough way as not to
Seem studied. It has still higher claims to our
regard in view of the services it has rendered to
humanity. Thanks to this language of the heart,
thousands of deaf-mutes are enabled to endure their

affliction, and to share our social pleasures. Blessèd
be the Abbé de l'Epée, who, by uniting the science
of gesture to the conventional signs of dactyology,
has made the deaf hear and the dumb speak | This
beneficent invention has made gesture in a twofold
manner, the language of the heart.
Gesture is an important as well as interesting
study. How beautiful it is to see the thousand

Surely is a joy in knowing how to appreciate an
image of Christ on the cross, in understanding the
attitudes of Faith, Hope and Charity. We can note
a mother's affection by the way she holds her child
in her arms. We can judge of the sincerity of the
friend who grasps our hand. If he holds the thumb

CHAPTER II.
DEFINITION AND DIVISION OF GESTURE.
Gesture is the direct agent of the heart, the inter-
preter of speech. It is elliptical discourse. Each
part of this definition may be easily justified.
1. Gesture is the Direct Agent of the Heart.—Look
at an infant. For some time he manifests his joy or
sorrow through cries ; but these are not gesture.
When he comes to know the cause of his joy or
sorrow, sentiment awakens, his heart Opens to love
or hatred, and he expresses his new emotion not by
cries alone, nor yet by speech; he smiles upon his
mother, and his first gesture is a Smile. Beings
endowed only with the sensitive life, have no smile ;
animals do not laugh.
This marvelous correspondence of the organs
with the sentiment arises from the close union of
soul and body. The brain ministers to the opera-
tions of the soul. Every sentiment must have its
echo in the brain, in order to be unerringly trans-
mitted by the organic apparatus.
AEr visu cognosciºur vir. (“The man is known
by his face.”) The rôle of dissimulation is a very
difficult one to sustain.

powerless to express. For example: / /ove. This
phrase says nothing of the nature of the being loved,
nothing of the fashion in which one loves. Gesture,
by a simple movement, reveals all this, and says it
far better than speech, which would know how to
render it only by many successive words and phras-
es. A gesture, then, like a ray of light, can reflect
all that passes in the soul.
Hence, if we desire that a thing shall be always
remembered, we must not say it in words; we must
let it be divined, revealed by gesture. Wherever an
ellipse is supposable in a discourse, gesture must
intervene to explain this ellipse.
3. Gesture is an E//iptical Zangºtage.——We call
ellipse a hidden meaning whose revelation belongs
to gesture. A gesture must correspond to every
ellipse. For example: “This medley of glory and
gain vexes me.” If we attribute something igno-
minious or abject to the word medley, there is an
ellipse in the phrase, because the ignominy is im-
plied rather than expressed. Gesture is then neces-
sary here to express the value of the implied adjec-
tive, ignominious.
Suppress this ellipse, and the gesture must also
be suppressed, for gesture is not the accompaniment
of speech. It must express the idea better and in
another way, else it will be only a pleonasm, an after
conception of bad taste, a hindrance rather than an
aid to intelligible expression.


## p. 45 (#79) ##############################################

DIVISION OF GESTURE. 45
Division of Gesture,
Every act, gesture and movement has its rule, its
execution and its raison d'être. The imitative is
also divided into three parts: the static, the dy-
namic and the Semeiotic. The static is the base,
the dynamic is the centre, and the semeiotic the
summit. The static is the equiporideration of the
powers or agents; it corresponds to life.
The dynamic is the form of movements. The
dynamic is melodic, harmonic and rhythmic. Ges-
ture is melodic by its forms or its inflections. To
understand gesture one must study melody. There
is great affinity between the inflections of the voice
and gesture. All the inflections of the voice are
common to gesture. The inflections of gesture are
oblique for the life, direct for the soul and circular
for the mind. These three terms, oblique, direct
and circular, correspond to the eccentric, normal
and concentric states. The movements of flection
are direct, those of rotation, circular, those of ab-
duction, oblique.
Gesture is harmonic through the multiplicity of
the agents which act in the same manner. This
harmony is founded upon the convergence or oppo-
sition of the movements. Thus the perfect accord
is the consonance of the three agents, head, torso
and limbs. Dissonance arises from the divergence
of one of these agents.
Finally, gesture is rhythmic because its move-

ments are subordinated to a given measure. The
dynamic corresponds to the soul.
The Semeiotic gives the reason of movements,
and has for its object the careful examination of
inflections, attitudes and types.
Under our first head, we treat of the static and
of gesture in general; under our second, of the
dynamic, and of gesture in particular; and finally,
under our third head, of the Semeiotic, with an ex-
position of the laws of gesture.

CHAPTER III.
ORIGIN AND ORATORICAL VALUE OF GESTURE.
Origin.
The infant in the cradle has neither speech nor
gesture: — he cries. As he gains sensibility his
tones grow richer, become inflections, are multiplied
and attain the number of three million special and
distinct inflections. The young infant manifests
neither intelligence nor affection; but he reveals his
life by sounds. When he discerns the source of
his joys or sufferings, he loves, and gesticulates to
repulse or to invite. The gestures, which are few
at first, become quite numerous. It is God's art he
follows; he is an artist without knowing it.
Oratorical Value of Gesture.
The true aim of art is to move, to interest and to
persuade. Emotion, interest and persuasion are
the first terms of art. Emotion is expressed by the
voice, by sounds; interest, by language; persuasion
is the office of gesture.
To inflection belongs emotion through the beau-
tiful; to logic, interest through the truth; to plastic
art, persuasion through the good.
Gesture is more than speech. It is not what we wº
say that persuades, but the manner of saying it.
The mind can be interested by speech, it must be


## p. 48 (#82) ##############################################

48 GESTURE.
persuaded by gesture. If the face bears no sign of
persuasion, we do not persuade.
Why at first sight does a person awaken our
Sympathy or antipathy P. We do not understand
why, but it is by reason of his gestures.
Speech is inferior to gesture, because it corre-
sponds to the phenomena of mind; gesture is the
agent of the heart, it is the persuasive agent.
Articulate language is weak because it is succes-
sive. It must be enunciated phrase by phrase; by
words, Syllables, letters, consonants and vowels—
and these do not end it. That which demands a
volume is uttered by a single gesture. A hundred
pages do not say what a simple movement may ex-
press, because this simple movement expresses our
whole being. Gesture is the direct agent of the
soul, while language is analytic and successive.
T.e., leading quality of mind is number; it is to
speculate, to reckon, while gesture grasps every-
thing by intuition,-sentiment as well as contempla-
tion. There is something marvelous in this lan-
guage, because it has relations with another sphere;
it is the world of grace.
An audience must not be supposed to resemble
an individual. A man of the greatest intelligence
finding himself in an audience, is no longer himself.
An audience is never intelligent; it is a multiple
being, composed of sense and sentiment. The
greater the numbers, the less intelligence has to do.
To seek to act upon an individual by gesture would


## p. 49 (#83) ##############################################

ORATORICAL VALUE OF GESTURE. 49
be absurd. The reverse is true with an audience;
it is persuaded not by reasoning, but by gesture.
There is here a current none can control. We
applaud disagreeable things in Spite of Ourselves —
things we should condemn, were they said to us in
private. The audience is not composed of intellec-
tual people, but of people with Senses and hearts.
As sentiment is the highest thing in art, it should
be applied to gesture. -- - *
If the gestures are good, the most wretched
speaking is tolerated. So much the better if the
speaking is good, but gesture is the all-important
thing. Gesture is superior to each of the other
languages, because it embraces the constituent parts
of our being. Gesture includes everything within
us. Sound is the gesture of the vocal apparatus.
The consonants and vowels are the gesture of the
buccal apparatus, and gesture, properly so called, is
the product of the myological apparatus.
It is not ideas that move the masses; it is gestures. .
We easily reach the heart and soul through the
senses. Music acts especially on the senses. It
purifies them, it gives intelligence to the hand, it
disposes the heart to prayer. The three languages
may each move, interest and persuade.
Language is a sort of music which moves us
through vocal expression; it is besides normal
through the gesture of articulation. No language
is exclusive. All interpenetrate and communicate
their action. The action of music is general.
4.


## p. 50 (#84) ##############################################

5O GESTURE.
The mind and the life are active only for the
Satisfaction of the heart; then, since the heart con-
trols all our actions, gesture must control all other
languages.
Gesture is magnetic, speech is not so. Through
gesture we subdue the most ferocious animals.
The ancients were not ignorant of this all-power-
ful empire of gesture over an audience. Therefore,
Sometimes to paralyze, sometimes to augment this
magic power, orators were obliged to cover their
faces with a mask, when about to speak in public.
The judges of the Areopagus well knew the power
of gesture, and to avoid its seductions, they adopted
the resource of hearing pleas only in the darkness.
The sign of the cross made at the opening of a
Sermon often has great effect upon good Catholics.
Let a priest with his eyes concentric and introspec-
tive make deliberately the sign of the cross while
solemnly uttering these words: “In — the – name —
of— the – Father; ” then let his glance sweep the
audience. What do they think of him? This is
no longer an ordinary man; he seems clothed with
the majesty of God, whose orders he has just re-
ceived, and in whose name he brings them. This
idea gives him strength and assurance, and his audi-
ence respect and docility.


## p. 51 (#85) ##############################################

CHAPTER IV.
THE LAWS OF GESTURE.
The static treats of the laws of gesture which are
six in number, viz.: Priority, retroaction, the oppo-
sition of agents, unity, stability and rhythm.
The Priority of Gesture to Speech.
Gesture must always precede speech. In fact,
speech is reflected expression. It must come after
gesture, which is parallel with the impression re-
ceived. Nature incites a movement, speech names
this movement. Speech is only the title, the label
of what gesture has anticipated. Speech comes
only to confirm what the audience already compre-
hend. Speech is given for naming things. Gesture
asks the question, “What?” and speech answers.
Gesture after the answer would be absurd. Let the
word come after the gesture and there will be no
pleonasm.
Priority of gesture may be thus explained : First
a movement responds to the sensation; then a ges-
ture, which depicts the emotion, responds to the
imagination which colors the sensation. Then
comes the judgment which approves. Finally, we
consider the audience, and this view of the audience
suggests the appropriate expression for that which
has already been expressed by gesture.


## p. 52 (#86) ##############################################

52 GESTURE.
The basis of this art is to make the auditors
divine what we would have them feel.
Every speaker may choose his own stand-point,
but the essential law is to anticipate, to justify speech
by gesture. Speech is the verifier of the fact ex-
pressed. The thing may be expressed before an-
nouncing its name. Sometimes we let the auditors
divine rather than anticipate, gazing at them in
order to rivet their attention. Eloquence is com-
posed of many things which are not named, but
must be named by slight gestures. In this elo-
quence consists. Thus a Smack of the tongue, a
blow upon the hand, an utterance of the vowel 7,
as if one would remove a stain from his coat. The
writer cannot do all this. The mere rendition of the
written discourse is nothing for the orator; his tal-
ent consists in taking advantage of a great number
of little nameless sounds.
A written discourse must contain forced epithets
and adjectives to illustrate the subject. In a spoken
discourse a great number of adjectives are worse
than useless. Gesture and inflection of the voice
supply their place. The sense is not in the words;
it is in inflection and gesture.
A'ezroactionz.
We have formulated this general law: The
eccentric, normal and concentric expression must
Correspond to the sensitive, moral and intellectual
state of man. When gesture is concerned, the law


## p. 53 (#87) ##############################################

RETROACTION. 53
is thus º In the sensitive state, the gesture,
which is haturally eccentric, may become concen-
tric, as the Orator is passive or active.
He is passive when subject to any action what-
ever, when he depicts an emotion.
He is agent when he communicates to the au-
dience the expression of his own will or power; in
a word, at all times when he controls his audience.
When the Orator assumes the passive rôle, that is,
when he reflects, he gazes upon his audience; he
makes a backward (or concentric) movement; when
he assumes the active rôle, he makes a forward (or
eccentric) movement. When one speaks to others,
he advances; when one speaks to himself, he recoils
a step, his thought centres upon himself.
In the passive state, one loves. But when he
loves, he does not move forward. A being who
feels, draws back, and contemplates the object
toward which the hand extends. Contemplation
makes the body retroact.
Hence in the passive state, the Orator must step
backward. In the opposite state he moves forward.
Let us apply this law: A spendthrift officer meets
his landlord, whom he has not yet paid, and greets
him with an—“Ah, good day, sir!” What will be
his movement? It must be retroactive. In the joy
of seeing a friend again, as also in fright, we start
back from the object loved or hated. Such is the
law of nature, and it cannot be ignored.
Whence comes this law P To behold a loved

54 GESTURE.
object fully, we must step back, remove to some
little distance from it. Look at a painter admiring
his work. It is retroaction at sight of a beloved
person, which has led to the discovery of the phe-
nomena of life, to this triple state of man which is
found in like manner, everywhere: Concentric, ec-
centric, and normal.
The concentric is the passive state, for when one
experiences a deep emotion, he must retroact.
Hence a demonstration of affection is not made
with a forward movement. If so, there is no love.
Expiration is the sign of him who gives his heart.
Hence there is joy and love. In inspiration there
is retroaction, and, in some sort, distrust. The hand
extends toward the beloved object; if the hand
tend toward itself, a love of self is indicated. Love
is expressed by a retroactive, never by a forward
movement. In portraying this sentiment the hand
must not be carried to the heart. This is nonsense;
it is an oratorical crime. The hand must tend
toward the loved being to caress, to grasp, to reas-
sure or to defend. The hand is carried to the heart
Only in case of suffering there.
Take this passage from Racine's Phèdre:
Ziez–gue me puis-je a l'ombre des forêts,
Suivre de l'aºi/ men char ſityant dams /a carrière—
(“ God—may I not, through the dim forest shades,
With my glance follow a fleet chariot's course.”)
Here the actor does not follow affectionately, but

with the eye, and then by recoiling and concentrat-
ing his thought upon himself.
In the rôle of Emilie.
“Aſe may in ſal/ing crusſ, thee 'meat/, / is fa//,”
at sight of her crushed lover Emilie must recoil in
terror, and not seem to add the weight of her body
to that which crushes the victim.
Augustus, on the contrary, may say:
“I might in falling crush thee 'neath my fall,”
pausing upon a forward movement, because he is
here the agent.
Let us note in passing that the passive attitude is
the type of energetic natures. They have some-
thing in themselves which suffices them. This is a
sort of repose; it is elasticity.
Opposition of Agents.
The opposition of the agents is the harmony of
gesture. Harmony is born of contrasts. From
opposition, equilibrium is born in turn. Equilib-
rium is the great law of gesture, and condemns par-
allelism; and these are the laws of equilibrium :
I. The forward inclination of the torso corre-
sponds to the movement of the leg in the opposite
direction.
2. When one arm is added to the weight of the
already inclined torso, the other arm must rise to
form a counterpoise.
3. In gazing into a well, the two arms must be


## p. 56 (#90) ##############################################

56 GESTURE.
drawn backward if the body is equally supported
by the two legs; in like manner the two arms may
be carried in front if the torso bends backward.
This is allowable only in the first attitude of the
base, or in a similar attitude.
The harmonic law of gesture is the static law par
exce//ence.
It is of childlike simplicity. We employ it in
walking; also when we carry a weight in One hand,
the other rises. The law consists in placing the
acting levers in Opposition, and thus realizing equi-
librium. All that is in equilibrium is harmonized.
All ancient art is based upon this opposition of
levers. Modern art, with but few exceptions, is
quite the contrary.
Here is an example of the observance of this
rule: If the head and arms are in action, the head
must move in opposition to the arms and the hand.
If both move in the same direction, there is a defect
in equilibrium, and awkwardness results.
When the arm rises to the head, the head bends
forward and meets it half-way. The reverse is true.
Every movement in the hand has its responsive
movement in the head. If the head advances, the
hand withdraws. The movements must balance, so
that the body may be in equilibrium and remain
balanced.
Here is the difference between ancient and
modern art. Let us suppose a statue of Corneille
reading his works. To-day we should pose it with


## p. 57 (#91) ##############################################

NUMBER OF GESTURES. 57
one leg and arm advanced. This is parallelism.
Formerly the leg would have been opposed to this
movement of the arm, because there should be here
the expansion of the author toward his work, and
this expansion results precisely from an opposition
of levers. -
We know the ancient gladiator; we do exactly
the opposite from him in fencing.
Modern art makes the man walk with leg and
arm parallel. Ancient art would have the leg
opposed to the arm.
It is through opposition that the smile expresses
moral sadness. This law of opposition must be
observed in the same member. For example, the
hand should be opposed to the arm. Thus we have
magnificent spheroidal movements which are grace-
ful and also have considerable force. Thus all the
harmonies occur in one same whole, in one same
truth. In a word, all truths interpenetrate, and
when a thing is true from one point of view, it is so
from all.
AVumber of Gestures.
Many reasons go to prove that gestures need not
be multiplied:
A.—We are moved by only one sentiment at a
time; hence it is useless to multiply gestures.
B.—But one gesture is needed for the expression
of an entire thought; since it is not the word but
the thought that the gesture must announce; if it


## p. 58 (#92) ##############################################

58 GESTURE.
expressed only the word, it would be trivial and
mean, and also prejudicial to the effect of the phrase.
In these phrases: “What do you seek in the
world, happiness? It is not there,” that which
first strikes us is the absence of happiness. Gesture
must indicate it in advance, and this should be the
dominating movement.
The intelligent man makes few gestures. To
multiply gestures indicates a lack of intelligence.
The face is the thermometer of intelligence. Let
as much expression as possible be given to the face.
A gesture made by the hand is wrong when not
justified in advance by the face. Intelligence is
manifested by the face. When the intelligent man
speaks, he employs great movements only when they
are justified by great exaltation of sentiment; and,
furthermore, these sentiments should be stamped
upon his face. Without expression of the face, all
gestures resemble telegraphic movements.
C.—The repeated extension of the arms denotes
but little intelligence, little suppleness in the wrist
and fingers. The movement of a single finger indi-
cates great finesse.
It is easy to distinguish the man of head, heart
and actions. The first makes many gestures of the
head; the second many of the shoulders; the last
moves the arms often and inappropriately.
D.—Gesture is allowable only when an ellipse of
the word or phrase admits of an additional value.
E.—Effects must not be multiplied; this is an


## p. 59 (#93) ##############################################

NUMBER OF GESTURES. 59
essential precaution. Multiplied movements are
detrimental when a graver movement is awaited.
F.—The Orator is free to choose between the rôle
of actor or that of mere spectator or narrator. Neither
the one nor the other can be forced upon him. The
actor's rôle arises not from intelligence but simply
from instinct. The actor identifies himself with the
personages he represents. He renders all their sen-
timents. This rôle is the most powerful, but, before
making it the object of his choice, there must be
severe study; he must not run the risk of frivolity.
We can dictate to the preacher and mark out his
path. He must not be an actor, but a doctor. Hence
his gestures must never represent the impressions of
those of whom he speaks, but his own. Hence he
should proportion the number of his gestures to the
number of his sentiments.
G.—If the orator would speak to any purpose,
he must bring back his discourse to some picture
from nature, some scene from real life.
There must be unity in everything; but a rôle
may be condensed in two or three traits; therefore
a great number of gestures is not necessary.
Let it be carefully noted: the expression of the
face should make the gesture of the arms forgotten.
Here the talent of the Orator shines forth. He must
captivate his public in such a way that his arm ges-
tures will be ignored. He must so fascinate his
auditors that they cannot ask the reason of this fas-
cination, nor remark that he gesticulates at all.


## p. 60 (#94) ##############################################

6O GESTURE.
H.—Where there are two gestures in the same
idea, one of them must come before the proposition,
the other in its midst.
If there is but one gesture and it precedes the
proposition, the term to which it is applied must be
precisely indicated.
For example: Would he be sensible to friendship?
Although friendship may in some degree be quali-
fied as the indirect regimen, gesture should portray
it in all its attributes. -
Duration of Gesture.
The suspension or prolongation of a movement is
one of the great sources of effect. It is in suspen-
sion that force and interest consist. A good thing
is worth being kept in sight long enough to allow an
enjoyment of the view.
The Orator should rest upon the preceding ges-
ture until a change is absolutely required.
A preoccupied man greets you with a smile, and
after you have left, he smiles on, until something
else occurs to divert his mind.
The orator's abstraction should change the face,
but not the gesture. If the double change takes
place simultaneously, there will be no unity. The
gesture should be retained and the expression of the
face changed.
A variety of effects and inflections should be
avoided. While the speaker is under the influence
of the same sentiment, the same inflection and ges-

THE RHYTHM OF GESTURE. 6 I
ture must be retained, so that there may be unity
of style.
Art proposes three things: to move, to interest,
to persuade by unity of inflection and gesture.
One effect must not destroy another. Divergence
confuses the audience, and leaves no time for
sentiment. .*
It is well to remember that the stone becomes
hollowed by the incessant fall of the drop of water
in the same place.
The Rhyſ/km of Gesture.
Gesture is at the same time melodic, or rather
inflective, harmonic and rhythmic. It must em-
brace the elements of music, since it corresponds to
the soul; it is the language of the soul, and the soul
necessarily includes the life with its diverse methods
of expression, and the mind. Gesture is melodic or
inflective through the richness of its forms, har-
monic through the multiplicity of parts that unite
simultaneously to produce it. Gesture is rhythmic
through its movement, more or less slow, or more
or less rapid.
Gesture is, then, inevitably synthetic, and conse-
quently harmonic; for harmony is but another
name for synthesis.
Each of the inflective, harmonic and rhythmic
modes has its peculiar law.
The rhythmic law of gesture is thus formu-
lated :


## p. 62 (#96) ##############################################

62 GESTURE.
“The rhythm of gesture is proportional to the
mass to be moved.”
The more an organ is restrained, the more vehe-
ment is its impulse.
This law is based upon the vibration of the pen-
dulum. Great levers have slow movements, Small
agents more rapid ones. The head moves more
rapidly when the torso and the eye have great
facility of motion. Thus the titillations of the eye
are rapid as lightning.
This titillation always announces an emotion.
Surprise is feigned if there is no titillation.
For example, at the unexpected visit of a friend
there is a lighting up of the eye. Wherefore?
Because the image is active in the imagination.
This is an image which passes within Ourselves,
which lies in inward phenomena.
So in relation to material phenomena: there is a
convergence, a direction of the eyes toward the
object; if the object changes place, the eyes cannot
modify their manner of convergence; they must
close to find a new direction, a convergence suited
to the distance of the object.
There is never sympathetic vision. The phe-
nomena of the imagination are in the imagination
at a fixed distance. When an image changes place
in the idea, it produces a titillation equal to that
which would be produced in the order of ma-
terial things. For example, let us quote these
lines:


## p. 63 (#97) ##############################################

IMPORTANCE OF THE LAWS OF GESTURE. 63
“At last I have him in my power,
This fatal foe, this haughty conqueror
Through him my captives leave their slavery.”
Here the body must be calm ; there is a sort of
vehemence in the eyes; it will be less in the head
than in the arms. All these movements are made,
but the body remains firm. Generally the reverse
takes place; the whole body is moved; but this is
wrong. t -
In these words: “Where are they, these wretch-
es?” there must be great violence in the upper
part of the body, but the step is very calm.
To affect a violent gait is an awkward habit.
A modified slowness in the small agents creates
emphasis; if we give them too great facility of
movement, the gestures become mean and wretched.
Rhythm is in marvelous accord with nature under
the impulse of God.
Importance of the Laws of Gesture.
We never really understand an author's meaning.
Every one is free to interpret him according to his
individual instinct. But we must know how to jus-
tify his interpretation by gesture. Principles must
aid us in choosing a point of view in accordance
with his individual nature; otherwise incoherence is
inevitable. Hence rules are indispensable. But
when the law is known, each applies it in accordance
with his own idea.
The author himself cannot read without rules, in


## p. 64 (#98) ##############################################

64. GESTURE.
such a manner as to convey the ideas he intended to
express. Only through rules can we become free in
our interpretation; we are not free without law, for
in this case we are subject to the caprice of Some
maSter.
The student of oratory should not be a servile
copyist. In the arrangement of his effects, he must
copy, imitate and compose. Let him first reproduce
a fixed model, the lesson of the master. This is to
copy. Let him then reproduce the lesson in the
absence of the master. This is to imitate. Finally,
let him reproduce a fugitive model. This is to com-
pose.
Thus to reproduce a lesson, to give its analysis
and synthesis, is to disjoint, to unite and to reunite ;
this is the progressive order of work.
The copying and imitative exercises should be
followed by compositions, applying the principles
already known. The orator may be allowed play
for his peculiar genius; he may be sublime even in
employing some foolish trick of his art. But what-
ever he does, he must be guided by fixed rules.

The dynamic apparatus is composed of the head,

The dynamic apparatus produces gesture, which
renders the moral or normal state; as the voice
expresses inflection and reveals the sensitive state.
The head must be studied under two relations:
as the agent of expression through its movements,
and as the centre of attraction; that is, the point of
departure or arrival for the different gestures of the
a1‘IIl.
Let us now apply ourselves to the signification of
the movements of the head and eyes, the face and
lips.
The Movements of the Head.
There are two sorts of movements of the head :
movements of attitude and fugitive movements.
Movements of Attitude.—The head has nine pri-
mary attitudes, from which many others proceed.
In the normal attitude, the head is neither high
nor low.
In the concentric attitude the head is lowered ;
this is the reflective state.
5


## p. 66 (#100) #############################################

66 GESTURE.
In the eccentric attitude the head is elevated;
this is the vital state.
Soldiers and men of robust physique carry the
head high. &
Here are three genera, each of which gives three
Species.
The AVormal State.
When the head is erect, it is passive and neutral.
The head inclining laterally toward the interlocu-
tor indicates affection. -
If in the inverse direction, opposite the interlocu-
tor, sensualism is indicated. This is in fact retroac-
tion; in the first case we love the soul, in the latter
the form.
The Eccentric State.
If the head bends backward it is the passional or
vehement state.
The head inclined toward the interlocutor, denotes
abandon, confidence. -
The head turned away from the interlocutor, de-
notes pride, noble or base. This is a neutral
expression which says something, but not the
whole.
The Concentric State.
The head lowered, that is, inclined forward, de-
notes the reflective state.
If the head inclines toward the interlocutor, it is
veneration, an act of faith in the object we love.


## p. 67 (#101) #############################################

MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAD. 67
If the head inclines away from the interlocutor,
it is stratagem or suspicion.
All other attitudes of the head are modifications
of these. These nine attitudes characterize states,
that is, sentiments, but sentiments which are fugi-
tive. Either of these attitudes may be affected
until it becomes habitual. But there are movements
which cannot be habitually affected, which can only
modify types and attitudes of the inflections of the
head. These are fugitive movements.
There are nine inflections or fugitive movements
of the head :-
I. If a forward movement, it ends in an upright
one, with elevated chin, and indicates interrogation,
hope, appellation, desire.
2. The same movement with the chin lowered,
indicates doubt, resignation.
3. A nod of the head, a forward movement,
means confirmation, yes, or zwell.
4. If the movement is brusque forward, it is the
menace of a resolute man.
5. The head thrown back means exaltation.
6. If the movement is brusque backward, it is the
menace of a weak man. s
7. There are rotative inflections from one shoul-
der to the other; this is impatience, regret.
8. The rotary movement of the head alone signi-
fies negation, that is no.
If the movement ends toward the interlocutor, it
is simple negation.


## p. 68 (#102) #############################################

68 GESTURE.
If the movement ends opposite to him, it is nega-
tion with distrust.
9. The rotative and forward inflection would de-
note exaltation.
The sense of this response,_* I do not know,”
when tidings of a friend are asked, may be divined
by an inflection of the head.
It is well to note how these movements are trans-
mitted from agent to agent.
All movements which severally affect the head,
the hand, the body and the leg, may affect the whole.
Thus the movement of negation is made by the
hand. This movement is double. There is nega-
tion with direct resolution, and negation with inverse
resolution, which is elliptical. The hand recoils as
the head recoils, and when the head makes the
movement of impatience, the hand rises with the
head and says:—“Leave me alone, I do not wish
to hear you.”
It is curious to see an inflection pass successively
from the head to the hand, from the hand to the
eye, from the eye to the shoulders, from the shoul-
ders to the arms, from the arms to the legs, from
the legs to the feet.
For example: Above we have indicated a double
menace made by the head. One might transfer this
menace to the hand and say: “You will have a
quarrel to settle with me!”
Each agent has its rôle, and this is why they
transmit their movements.


## p. 69 (#103) #############################################

MOVEMENTS OF THE HEAD. 69
When the head has a serious part to play, it com-
municates an inflective movement to the hand, which
renders it terrible.
A man who menaces with the head is not sure
of his aim, but he who menaces with the hand is
sure of striking right. In order to do this, the eye
must be firmly fixed, as the eye necessarily loses
its power and accuracy by a movement of the
head.
There is great power in the menace communica-
ted to the hand, a power not found in the other
movement. The head-menace is more physical,
and the hand-menace more intellectual; in the one
the eye says a great deal, while in the other it says
nothing.
The Orator cannot always make these gestures
with facility. The menace may be elliptical. Then
it must be made by the head, and expressed through
the eyes. This is why the speaker gazes downward
as he makes it.
It is the same downward or upward movement
which is reproduced when the menace is concentric
or elliptical. -
The menace may be made in yet another way.
The speaker does not wish to express his opinion,
and for fear of compromising himself with his eyes,
he does not gaze at his interlocutor; he turns aside
his glance, and the menace is communicated to the
shoulder. This has less strength, because it is ren-
dered by one of the sensitive agents.


## p. 70 (#104) #############################################

7O GESTURE.
The man who threatens with the shoulder is more
passionate; but he is not the agent, he is passive.
A simple menace may be made by the knee.
The foot is susceptible of great mobility. A slight
movement quickly changes its significance; in pass-
ing from one agent to another, it is modified by
many ellipses.

rôle of the agent set in motion, while inflection is
universal.
The head alone expresses trouble, dejection.
Dejection is in the head, as firmness is in the
reins and exaltation in the shoulders.
All the movements of the head are communicated
to all the active organs. The head is always in
opposition to the arms. The head must be turned
away from the leg which is advanced.
Men of small brain habitually carry their heads
high. The head is lowered in proportion to the
quantity of intelligence.
Examine the criterion for the fixed attitudes of
the head.
Of the Eyes.
The eye, in common with all the other agents, has /
nine primary expressions, three genera and nine
species. -
The eye contains three agents: The optic or
visual, the palpebral or pupil, and the eyebrow
agent. Each of these has its peculiar sense, and
we shall show how they are united.
The optic agent has three direct or convergent
glances. The eyes converge toward the object they
examine, at such a point that if the object were
there they would squint. A skilled observer can
determine the distance of the object, upon seeing
the two eyes.
There is a revolving or divergent glance. If

both eyes project in parallel lines, they see double.
A drunken man sees double because the eyes do
not converge.
Between these two glances there is the ecstatic or
parallel vision; but the object is not so far away
that its distance may not be determined. The con-
vergence is not appreciable. This is the dreamy
expression. We shall here treat of one only, to
which we refer the three others. Let us take the
direct glance, passing by the optic agent, since it is
direct in all the phenomena we have to consider.
There are three phenomena in the eyebrow:
eccentric, concentric and normal. From these we
derive nine terms. If the eye is normal, it is a pas-
sive expression which determines nothing. If, with
the same eye, the eyebrow is eccentric, there is a
difference; one part of us tends vehemently toward
something, and the other says: “It is not worth the
trouble.” The sensitive part aspires, while the in-
tellect says, “This amounts to nothing.”
The concentric eyebrow indicates a mind discon-
certed by fatigue or enmui, a contention of one part
of the nature with the other, which resists, and says:
“I do not wish to be troubled about this; it wearies
me.”
The normal brow and the eccentric eye indicate
stupor.
Here there is again contrariety. One part of the
being ardently aspires toward some object, while the
other is powerless to aid it.


## p. 73 (#107) #############################################

OF THE EYES. 73
The eye is purely an intellectual agent, denoting
the various states of the mind.
The eccentric eye and the elevated eyebrow de-
note vehemence. This is an active state that will
become astonishment. Many phenomena will arise
and be subordinate to this movement; but it is
vehemence par earcellence, it is aspiration.
If the brow lowers vehemently with the eyes
open, it is not rage, but a state of mind independent
of everything the senses or the heart can say.
This is firmness of mind, a state of the will inde-
pendent of every outside influence. It may be
attention, or anger, or many other things.
If the eye is concentric and the eyebrow in the
normal state, it is slumber, fatigue.
If the eyebrow is eccentric and the eye concen-
tric, it will represent not indifference only, but
scorn, and after saying, “This thing is worthless,”
will add, “I protest against it, I close my eyes.”
If both the eye and eyebrow are concentric,
there is contention of mind. This is a mind which
seeks but does not possess.
This explanation may be rendered more clear and
easier to retain in mind by the following resumé:

The nine expressions of the eye correspond to
each of the nine movements of the head. Thus the
eye may give nine types of affection, nine of pride,
nine of sensualism, etc. This gives eighty-one ex-
pressions of the eye. Hence, knowing eighteen
elements, we inevitably possess eighty-one.
The nine expressions of the eye may be verified
by the criterion.
As a model, we give the nine expressions of the
eye in the subjoined chart.

there may be an inclination either way. The top
of the eyebrow may be lifted.
Thus in the concentric state, three types may be
noted, and these go to make twenty-seven primary
movements. The lower eyelid may be contracted ;
the twenty-seven first movements may be examined
with this, which makes 2 × 27.
A movement of the cheek may contract the eye
in an opposite direction, and this contraction may
be total, which makes eighty-one expressions be-
longing to the normal glance alone.
This direct glance may also be direct on the infe-
rior plane, which makes 2 × 8 I ; for these are dis-
tinct expressions which cannot be confounded.
This movement could again be an upward one,
which would make 3 × 8 I.
The movement may be outward and superior, or
it may be simply outward; it may also be outward
and inferior. A special sense is attached to each
of these movements, a sense which cannot be con-
founded with any of the preceding movements.
By making the same computation for the three
glances above noted, we shall have from eight to
nine hundred movements.
All this may appear complicated, but with the key
of the primary movements, nothing can be more
simple than this deduction.
The above chart with its exposition of the phases
of the eye explains everything. A small eye is a
sign of strength; a large eye is a sign of languor.


## p. 77 (#111) #############################################

OF THE EYEBROWS. 77
A small oblique eye (the Chinese eye), when asso-
ciated with lateral development of the cranium,
and ears drawn back, indicates a predisposition to
murder.
The eye opens only in the first emotion; then it
becomes calm, closing gradually; an eye wide open
in emotion, denotes stupidity.
Of the Eyebrows.
There are three thermometers: the eyebrow is
the thermometer of the mind; the shoulder is the
thermometer of the life; the thumb is the ther-
mometer of the will.
There is parallelism between the eye and the
voice. The voice lowered and the brow lifted,
indicate a desire to create surprise, and a lack of
mental depth.
It is very important to establish this parallelism
between the movements of the brow and voice.
The lowered brow signifies retention, repulsion:
it is the signification of a closed door. The eleva-
ted brow means the open door. The mind opens
to let in the light or to allow it to escape. The
eyebrow is nothing less than the door of intelli-
gence. In falling, the voice repels. The efforts in
repulsion and retention are equal.
The inflections are in accord with the eyebrows.
When the brows are raised, the voice is raised.
This is the normal movement of the voice in rela-
tion to the eyebrow.


## p. 78 (#112) #############################################

78 GESTURE.
Sometimes the eyebrow is in contradiction to the
movement of the voice. Then there is always
ellipse; it is a thought unexpressed. The contra-
diction between these two agents always proves
that we must seek in the words which these phe-
nomena modify, something other than they seem to
say. For instance, when we reply to a story just
told us, with this exclamation: “Indeed /*
If the brow and voice are lowered, the case is
grave and demands much consideration.
If brow and voice are elevated, the expression is
usually mild, amiable and affectionate.
If the voice is raised and the brow lowered, the
form is doubtful and suspicious. With the brow
concentric, the hand is repellent.
Both brow and hand concentric denote repulsion
or retention; this is always the case with a door.
Both brow and hand eccentric mean inspiration,
or allowing departure without concern.
There is homogeneity between the face, the eye-
... brow and the hand.
The degree and nature of the emotion must be
shown in the face, otherwise there will be only
rimace.
The hand is simply another expression of the
face. The face gives the hand its significance.
Hand movements without facial expression would
be purely automatic. The face has the first word,
the hand completes the sense. There are eighty-
one movements of the hand impossible to the face;


## p. 79 (#113) #############################################

OF THE FACE. 79
hence, without the hand, the face cannot express
everything. The hand is the detailed explanation
of what the face has sought to say.
There are expressions of the hand consonant with
the facial traits, and others dissonant: this is the
beautiful.
The weak hand and the strong face are the sign
of impotence.
The weak hand and the strong face are the sign
of perfidy.
The tones of the voice vary according to the ex-
pression of the face. The face must speak, it must
have charm.
In laughing, the face is eccentric; a sombre face
is concentric.
• The face is the mirror of the soul because it is
the most impressionable agent, and consequently
the most faithful in rendering the impressions of the
Soul.
Not only may momentary emotions be read in
the expression of the features, but by an inspection
of the conformation of the face, the aptitude,
thoughts, character and individual temperament
may be determined.
The difference in faces comes from difference in
the configuration of profiles.
There are three primitive and characteristic pro-
files, of which all others are only derivations or
shades. There is the upright, the concave and the
convex profile. Each of these genera must pro-

duce three species, and this gives again the accord
of 7zine.
These different species arise from the direction
of the angles, as also from the position of the lips
and nose.
Uprightness responds to the perpendicular pro-
file; chastity, to the concave; sensualism, to the
COI) Vé X.
Let it be understood that we derogate in no way
from the liberty of the man who remains always
master of his will, his emotions and his inclinations.
A criterion of the face is indispensable to the
intelligent physiognomist, and as the lips and nose
have much to do with the expression of the face,
we offer an unerring diagnosis in the three following
charts: -

CHAPTER VI.
OF THE TORSO.
The torso includes the chest, and shares the
shoulder movements with the arms.
The Chest—There are three chest attitudes, eccen–
tric, concentric and normal. *
I. If the chest is greatly dilated, this is the
eccentric state—the military attitude, the sign of
energy.
2. The normal, when the chest is in a state more
homogeneous, less contentious, more sympathetic,
as in the statue of Antinous.
3. The concentric, when the chest is hollow, with
the shoulders elevated and inclining forward.
The convex eccentric chest is the sign of the
agent, or of him who gives.
The convex concentric chest or the pathetic, is
the sign of the sufferer, or of him who receives.
The chest drawn in with the shoulders elevated,
is the expression of the sublime.
From these three positions, the eccentric, the con-
centric and the normal, are derived nine degrees or
species. Thus in each of these genera, the torso is
inclined toward the speaker, or away from him,
lmence we have three times three, or nine, or the
triple accord.


## p. 85 (#119) #############################################

OF THE TO RSO. 85
The chest need not be lowered ; it is here that all
the energy concentrates. -
The Shoulders.- Every sensitive, agreeable or
painful form is expressed by an elevation of the
shoulders. The shoulders are the thermometer of
the sensitive and passional life. If a man's shoul-
ders are raised very decidedly, we may know that
he is decidedly impressed.
The head tells us whether this impression is joy-
ous or sorrowful. Then the species belongs to the
head, and the genus to the shoulder.
If the shoulder indicates thirty degrees, the
head must say whether it is warmth or cold-
ness. The face will specify the nature of the sor-
row or joy whose value the shoulders have deter-
mined.
The shoulder is one of the great powers of the
Orator. 3.
By a simple movement of the shoulder, he can
make infinitely more impression than with all the
outward gestures which are almost always theatrical,
and not of a convincing sort.
The shoulder, we have said, is the thermometer
of emotion and of love. The movement is neutral
and suited to joy as well as to sorrow ; the eyes
and mouth are present to specify it.
The shoulder, like all the agents, has three and
hence nine distinct phases.
The torso is divided into three parts: the thoracic,
the epigastric and abdominal.


## p. 86 (#120) #############################################

86 GESTURE.
We shall state farther on, the rôle of these three
important centres.
Liars do not elevate their shoulders to the re-
quired degree, hence the truth or falsity of a senti-
ment may be known.
Raphael has forgotten this principle in his
“Moses Smiting the Rock.” None of his figures,
although joyous, elevate the shoulder.


## p. 87 (#121) #############################################

CHAPTER VII.
OF THE LIMBS.
The limbs hold an important place in oratorical
action.
The study of the rôle of the arms and limbs
therefore deserves serious attention.
The Armes.
In the arms we distinguish the deltoid or shoulder
movement, the inflection of the fore-arm, the elbow,
the wrist, the hand and the fingers.
Inflections of the Fore-Arma.
We have treated of what concerns the shoulder
in the chapter upon the torso.
The arm has three movements: an upward and
downward vertical movement, and a horizontal
Oſle.
These movements derive their significance from
the different angles formed by the fore-arm in
relation to the arm. Let us first represent these
different angles, and then we will explain the
chart.


## p. 88 (#122) #############################################

88 GESTURE.
All these different angles have their meaning,
their absolute significance in affirmation.
The movement at the right angle signifies: To be.
Lower: Perhaps.
Lower still: I doubt if it is so.
Lower: It is improbable.
Lower: It is not.
Lower: It is not possible.
Ascending: This is proven, I have the proof in
my hand. -
Higher: This is superlatively beautiful.
Higher: It is enchantingly beautiful.
The degree of certainty in the affirmation varies



## p. 89 (#123) #############################################

OF THE ELBOW. 89
with the angle which the fore-arm forms with the
all II).
All these modes of affirmation may be applied to
negation. For example: -
“It is impossible that this should not be. This
cannot be.” -
Thus all states of being, all forms of affirmation,
belong to the acuteness or opening of an angle.
The hanging arm signifies depression. The two
arms should never extend the same way. If they
follow each other, one should be more advanced
than the other. Never allow parallelism. The ele-
mentary gestures of the arms are represented in the
foregoing chart.
Of the Elbow.
The elbow has nine movements, three primitive,
as genera, and nine derivative, as species. There are
the forward and backward movements of the normal
state. There are three degrees of height, and finally
the forward and backward movements of extension.
The elbow movements are relational. The epi-
condyle is called the eye of the arm.
Man slightly moves the torso, then the shoulder,
and finally the elbow.
Among persons who would fain crush others,
there is an elbow movement which seems to say, “I
annihilate thee, I am above thee.”
The elbow turned outward signifies strength, pow-
er, audacity, domination, arrogance, abruptness,


## p. 90 (#124) #############################################

90 GESTURE.
activity, abundance. The elbow drawn inward,
signifies impotence, fear, subordination, humility,
passiveness, poverty of spirit.
Modest people have a slight outward movement
of the elbow. The humble make an inward move-
ment. The elbow thrust forward or backward, indi-
Cates a yielding character.
These movements should not be taken alone;
they must be verified by the torso and the head.
The shoulder characterizes the expression of the
elbow movements, just as the elbow verifies marked
exaltation, by the elevation of the shoulder.
It is by these little things that we determine mil-
lions of movements and their meaning. We finally
determine and class precisely five million move-
ments of the different agents of the arm. This
would seem enormous; but it is nothing at all; it
is childlike simplicity. The elements being known,
the process is always the same. Hence the advan-
tage of possessing a criterion. With this criterion,
we have everything. If we possess nine, we possess
twenty millions, which are no more than nine.
Of the Wrist.
The wrist is a directing instrument for the fore-
arm and the hand.
V The wrist has its three movements.
It is eccentric when the extensor muscles are in
motion.
It is normal in the horizontal position.


## p. 91 (#125) #############################################

OF THE HAND. 9 I
It is concentric when the flexor muscles are in
action.
In the concentric position the wrist is in prona-
tion, for the thumb is turned downward; this is the
sign of a powerful will, because the pronator muscles
have more power than the flexors.
In the eccentric position the wrist is in supination;
that is, the back of the hand is downward; this is
the sign of impotence.
The wrist has also forward and backward move-
ments, either in pronation, in supination, or the nor-
mal state. Thus there are nine phases for the wrist.
It is through the aid of the wrist that the aspects
of the hand, placed upon the cube, receive, as we
shall see, their precise signification.
The Orator needs great suppleness in wrist move-
ments to give grace to the phases of the hand.
Of the Hand.
Man is perforce painter, poet, inspired dreamer
Or mystic, and scientist.
He is a painter, to reveal the phenomena of the
sensitive life; a poet, to admire the mysteries of
grace; a scientist, to make known the conceptions
of the mind. Thus the hand has three presenta-
tions, neither more nor less, to render that which
passes in man in the sensitive, moral or intellectual
State.
Let us now examine the three presentations of an
Open hand: its palmar, dorsal and digital aspect.


## p. 92 (#126) #############################################

92 GESTURE.
The same thing may be expressed by these three
presentations, but with shades of difference in the
meaning.
If we say that a thing is admirable, with the
palms upward, it is to describe it perfectly. This is
the demonstrative aspect.
If we say the same thing, displaying the back of
the hand, it is with the sentiment of impotence.
We have an idea of the thing, but it is so beautiful
we cannot express it. This is the mystic aspect.
If we present the digital extremity, it is as if we
said: “I have seen, I have weighed, I have num-
bered the thing, I understand it from certain knowl-
edge; it is admirable, and I declare it so.” These
are the three aspects: the palmar, dorsal and dig-
ital.
Each of these attitudes of the hand may be pre-
sented under three forms: the eccentric, normal and
concentric.
Each of these forms as genera, produces three
species; this gives the hand nine intrinsic attitudes,
whose neutral signification will be specified and de-
termined by the presentation of the hand upon the
cube.
Let us first take the normal state as genus, and
we shall have the normal hand as species in the
normal genus. This will then be the normo-normal
attitude.

abandon.
Let us now take the eccentric species, still in the
normal genus.
Raise the hand somewhat with a slight parting of
the fingers, and we have the eccentro-normal hand,
which signifies expansion.
Finally, let us consider the concentric species, still
in the normal state.
Present the hand lifeless and you have the con-
centro-normal attitude, which signifies prostration.
Let us pass on to the concentric genus.
By closing the fingers with the thumb inward
upon the middle one, we shall have the normo-con-
centric hand, which signifies the ſonic or power.
To close the hand and place the thumb outside
upon the index finger, signifies conflict. This is the
concentro-concentric hand.
To bend the first joint with the fingers somewhat
apart, indicates the eccentro-concentric hand. This
is the convulsive state.
Let us pass on to the eccentric genus.
The fingers somewhat spread, denote the normo-
eccentric hand. This is exaltation.
To spread the fingers and fold them to the
second joint, indicates the concentro-concentric
hand. This is retraction.
To spread the fingers as much as possible, gives
the eccentro-eccentric hand. This is exasperation.
In the subjoined charts we can see an illustration
of the different attitudes of the hand.

The hand is raised. Why? For what purpose?
The presentation of the hand upon the surfaces of
the cube will decide and specify.


## p. 96 (#130) #############################################

96 GESTURE.
By this presentation the nine movements of the
hand correspond with the expressive movements of
the arm.
Take any cube whatever, a book, a Snuff-box,
or rather cast your eyes upon the foregoing chart,
and examine it carefully.
There are three directions in the cube: horizon-
tal, vertical and transverse. Hence there are six
faces, anterior, Superior, inferior, interno-lateral and
externo-lateral.
Of what use are angles and faces? All this is
necessary for those who would know the reason
of the sentiments expressed by the hand. There
are twenty-seven sorts of affirmation. We give nine
of them with the six faces of the cube.
The Digita/ Face.
To place the hand, whether eccentric, concentric
or normal, upon the upper face of the cube, is to
hold, to protect, to control; it is to say: “I hold
this under my protection.”
To place the hand upon the external side-face of
the cube, signifies to belong; it says: “All this be-
longs to me.” It is the affirmation of the man who
knows, who has had the thing in dispute under his
Own eyes, who has measured it, examined it in all
its aspects. It is the affirmation of the connoisseur.
To apply the hand to the inner side of the face is
to let go. Here is the sense of this affirmation:
“You may say whatever you will, but I affirm in

OF THE HAND. 97
spite of every observation, in spite of all objection;
I affirm whether or no.”
The Back Face.
There are three ways of touching the front face
of the cube with the hand.
A.—To touch it with the end of the fingers up-
ward and the thumb inward, is to obtain : “I have
obtained great benefits, I do not know how to ex-
press my gratitude.” Or rather: “I keep the
object for myself; I do not care to let it be seen.”
This is the mystic face. Or yet again: “I contem-
plate.”
B.—To place the hand horizontally on the same
face of the cube, is to restrain, or bound. “Go no
farther, if you please; all this belongs to me.”
C.—To place the hand upon the same anterior
face of the cube, but with the extremities of the
fingers vertically downward, means to retain. It
says: “I reserve this for myself.” Here, then,
are three aspects for the anterior face of the cube.
The Pa/mar Face.
A.—To place the lower face of the cube in the
hand, is to sustain. It is to say: “I will sustain
you in misfortune.”
B.—To apply as much as possible the palm upon
the same posterior face of the cube, with the fingers
downward, is to maintain : “I maintain what I have
said.”
C.—To apply the hand upon the same face with

the extremities of the fingers upward, is to con-
tain, is to show the object — it is to disclose: “I
affirm ; you cannot doubt me; I open my heart;
behold me !”
There are, then, nine affirmations, which are ex-
plained by a mere view of the cube and its faces.
The twelve edges of the cube give a double affir-
mation; the angles, a triple affirmation. Example
for the edges: To place the hand on the back edge,
means: “I protect and I demonstrate.” -
There are three movements or inflections of the
hand which must be pointed out: to hover, to insin-
uate, to envelop.
The three rhythmic actions of the hand must not
be passed over in silence: to incline, to fall, to be
precipitated.
The aspects of the hands would be simply tele-
graphic movements, were it not for the inflections
of the voice, and, above all, the expression of the
eyes. The expressions of the hand correspond to
the voice. The hands are the last thing demanded
in a gesture; but they must not remain motionless,
as (if they were stiff, for instance) they might say
more than was necessary.
The hands are clasped in adoration, for it seems
as if we held the thing we love, that we desire.
The rubbing of the hands denotes joy, or an
eager thirst for action; in the absence of anything
else to caress, we take the hand, we communicate
our joy to it.


## p. 99 (#133) #############################################

OF THE FINGERS. 99
There is a difference between the caress and the
rubbing of the hands.
In the caress, the hand extends eagerly, and
passes lightly, undulatingly, for fear of harming.
There is an elevation of the shoulders.
The hand is an additional expression of the face.
The movement must begin with the face, the hand
Only completes and interprets the facial expression.
The head and hand cannot act simultaneously to
express the same sentiment. One could not say no
with head and hands at the same time. The head
commands and precedes the movement of the hand.
The eyes, and not the head, may be parallel with
the hand and the other agents.
The hand with its palm upward may be caressing,
if there is an elevation of the eyebrow; repellent
with the eyebrow concentric.
The waving hand may have much sense, accord-
ing to the expression of the face.
The eye is the essential agent, the hand is only
the reverberatory agent; hence it must show less
energy than the eye.
Of the Fingers.
Each finger has its separate function, but it is
exclusive of the great expressions which constitute
the accords of nine. These are interesting facts,
but they do not spring naturally from the fountain
of gesture. They are more intellectual than moral.

In a synthetic action all the fingers converge. A
very energetic will is expressed by the clenched fist.
In dealing with a fact in detail, as we say:
“Remark this well,” all the fingers open to bid us
concern ourselves only with the part in dispute.
This is analysis; it is not moral, it is intellectual.
If we speak of condensation we close the hand.
If we have to do with a granulated object, we test it
with the thumb and index finger.
If it is carneous, we touch it with the thumb and
middle finger.
If the object is fluid, delicate, impressionable, we
express it by the third finger.
If it is pulverized, we touch it with the little
finger.
We change the finger as the body is solid, humid,
delicate, or powdery.
The Orator who uses the fingers in gesticulation,
gives proof of great delicacy of mind.
Of the Zegs.
The legs have nine positions which we call base
attitudes.
We shall give a detailed description, summing up
in a chart of the criterion of the legs at the end of
this section.
First Attitude.—This consists in the equal balance
of the body upon its two legs. It is that of a child
posed upon its feet, neither of which extends farther
than the other. This attitude is normal, and is the

sign of weakness, of respect; for respect is a sort
of weakness for the person we address. It also
characterizes infancy, decay.
Second Attitude.—In this attitude the strong leg is
backward, the free one forward. This is the attitude
of reflection, of concentration, of the strong man.
It indicates the absence of passions, or of concen-
tred passions. It has something of intelligence;

it is neither the position of the child nor of the
uncultured man. It indicates calmness, strength,
independence, which are signs of intelligence. It is
the concentric state.
Third Attitude.—Here the strong leg is forward,
the free leg backward. This is the type of vehe-
mence. It is the eccentric attitude.
|
The orator who would appear passive, that is, as
experiencing some emotion, or submitting to some
action, must have a backward pose as in figure 2.
If, on the contrary, he would communicate to his
audience the expression of his will or of his own
thought, he must have a forward poise as in figure 3.
Pourth Attitude.—Here the strong leg is behind,
as in the second attitude, but far more apart from
the other and more inflected.
This is very nearly the attitude of the fencing

master, except the position of the foot, which is
straight instead of being turned outward.
/
This is a sign of the weakness which follows
vehemence.
Natural weakness is portrayed in figure I ; Sud-
den weakness in figure 4.
Pºſtſ. Attitude.—This is necessitated by the incli-
nation of the torso to one side or the other. It is

a third to one side. It is a passive attitude, pre-
paratory to all oblique steps. It is passing or transi–
tive, and ends all the angles formed by walking. It
is in frequent use combined with the second.
Sixth Attitude.—This is one-third crossed. It is
an attitude of great respect and ceremony, and is
effective only in the presence of princes.
/
Seventh Attitude.—This is the first position, but
the legs are farther apart. The free limb is turned
º




## p. 105 (#139) ############################################

OF THE LEGS. IO5
to one side; both limbs are strong. This denotes
intoxication, the man overwhelmed with astonish-
ment, familiarity, repose. It is a double fifth.
Fighth Attitude.—This is the second, with limbs
farther apart. It is the alternative attitude. The
body faces one of the two legs. It is alternative
from the fact that it ends in the expression of two
extreme and opposite sentiments; that is, in the
third or the fourth. It serves for eccentricity with
reticence, for menace and jealousy. It is the type
of hesitation. It is a parade attitude. At the same
time offensive and defensive, its aspect easily im-
presses and leaves the auditor in doubt. What is
going to happen? What sentiment is going to arise
from this attitude which must have its solution
either in the third or fourth P
AWinth Aſtitude.—This is a stiff second attitude,
in which the strong leg and also the free one are

equally rigid. The body in this attitude bends
backward; it is the sign of distrust and scorn.
The legs have one aspect. If, in the second, the
strong leg advances slowly to find the other, it is the
tiger about to leap upon his prey; if, on the con-
trary, the free leg advances Softly, the vengeance is
retarded.
The menace made in figure 3, with inclination of
the head and agitation of the index finger, is that
of a valet who wishes to play some ill turn upon his
master; for with the body bent and the arm ad-
vanced, there is no intelligence. But it is ill-suited
to vengeance, because that attitude should be strong
and solid, with the eye making the indication better
than the finger.

CHAPTER VIII.
OF THE SEMEIOTIC, OR THE REASON OF GESTURE.
The Types which Characterige Gesture.
The semeiotic is the science of signs, and hence
the science of the form of gesture. Its object is to
give the reason for the forms of gesture according
to the types that characterize it, the apparatus that
modifies it, and the figures that represent it.
There are three sorts of types in man : constitu-
tional or formal, fugitive or passional, and habitual.
The constitutional type is that which we have at
birth. -
The passional type is that which is reproduced
under the sway of passion.
The habitual types are those which, frequently
reproduced, come to modify even the bones of the
man, and give him a particular constitution.
Habit is a second nature, in fact, a habitual
movement fashions the material and physical being
in such a manner as to create a type not inborn,
and which is named habitual.
To recognize constitutional types, we study the
movements of the body, and the profound action
which the habit of these movements exercises upon
the body; and, as the type produced by these
movements is in perfect analogy with the formal,


## p. 108 (#144) ############################################

IO8 GESTURE.
constitutional types, we come through this analogy
to infer constant phenomena from the passional
form. Thus all the formal types are brought back
to the passional types.
Passional types explain habitual types, and these
last explain constitutional types. Thus, when we
know the sum of movements possible to an Organ,
when we know the sense of it, we arrive at that
semeiotic through which the reason of a form is per-
fectly given.
Of Gesture Relative to its Modifying Apparatus.
Every gesture places itself in relation with the
subject and the object.
It is rare that a movement tending toward an
object does not touch the double form. Thus, in
*aying that a thing is admirable, we start from a
multitude of physical centres whose sense we are to
determine. When this sense is known, understand-
ing the point of departure, we understand still better
that of arrival.
This division, which is not made at random, is
reproduced in the subjoined diagram.
I represents the vital expression; 2, the intel-
lectual; 3, the moral. We divide the face into
three zones: the genal,” buccal, and frontal.
The expression is physical, moral and intellectual.
In the posterior section of the head we have the
* From y&vetov, the chin.


## p. 109 (#145) ############################################

DIVISIONS OF THE BODY. IO9
occipital, parietal and temporal zones. The life is
in the Occiput, the Soul in the parietal zone, and the
mind holds the temporal region near the forehead
as its inalienable domicile.
The chest is divided into the thoracic centre for
the mind, into the epigastric for the Soul, and into
the abdominal for the life.
The arm is divided into three sections: the del-
toid, brachial and carpal.
This division is a rational one. Let us suppose
this exclamation: “It is admirable !” Some say it
starting from the shoulder, others from the chest,
others from the abdominal focus. These are three
very distinct modes. There is more intelligence
when the movement is from the thoracic centre.
This concerns the honor, the dignity.
When the movement is from the epigastrium, it is

moral in a high degree. For example: “This is
beautiful It is admirable ! I know not why, but
this gives me pleasure l’’
The movement from the abdomen indicates sen-
suality, good nature, and stupidity.
The movement is the same with the head. In
emotion it proceeds from the chin; it is the life.
movement, it is instinct. That from the cheeks, in-
dicates sentiments, the most noble affections.
Carrying the hand to the forehead indicates intel-
ligence. Here we seek relief from embarrassment,
in the other head movements we do not seek it.
The one is a mental, the others are purely physical
efforts. In the latter case one becomes violent and
would fain give blows with his fist.
An infinite number of movements proceed from
these various seats.
We have now reached the semeiotic standpoint,
that of these very clear plans, the very starting
point of gesture.
The articular centres of the arms are called ther-
mometers: the wrist, that of the organic physical
life; the shoulder, that of the sensitive life; and
the elbow, that of the relative life.
The thumb has much expression; drawn back-
ward it is a symbol of death, drawn forward it is the
sign of life. Where there is abundance of life, the
thumb stands out from the hand. If a friend
promises me a service with the thumb drawn inward,
he deceives. If with the thumb in the normal state,

he is a submissive but not a devoted friend. He
cannot be very much counted upon. If the thumb
Stands outward, we may rely upon his promise.
We still find life, soul and mind in each division
of the body.
There are also a buccal, an occipital and an
abdominal life.
The body of man, with all its active and attractive
foci, with all its manifestations, may be considered
an ellipse.
These well-indicated divisions may be stated in an
analytic formula:
LIFE : Occipital.
MIND : Temporal. }
SOUL : Parietal.
MIND : Frontal.
SouL ; Buccal. }
LIFE : Genal.
MIND : Thoracic.
Attractive centres. (Soul: Epigastric. }
LIFE : Abdominal.
LIFE : Shoulders.
SOUL : Elbows. }
MIND : Wrists.
LIFE: Thigh.
SOUL : Knee. }
MIND : Foot.
Expressive centres,
This is the proper place to fix the definition of
each division by some familiar illustration.
Let us take an individual in a somewhat embar-
rassed situation. He is a gentleman who has been
overcome by wine. We see him touching the tem-

poral bone, or the ear, as if to seek some expedient:
the strategic mind is there.
Let us begin with the descending gamut, and let
the hand pass over all the divisions of the attractive
CentreS.
At the occiput: Here is an adventure | I have
really had too strong a dose of them
At the parietal bone: What a shame !
At the temporal bone: What will the people say
Of me?
At the forehead: Reason however tells me to
pause.
At the buccal zone: How shall I dare reappear
before those who have seen me in this state |
At the genal zone: But they did serve such good
wine !
At the breast: Reason long ago advised temper-
ance to me. *
At the epigastrium: I have so many regrets
every time I transgress |
At the abdomen : The devil | Gourmandism I
am a wretched creature
The same illustrations may be reproduced in the
rising scale.
When the parietals are touched, the idea and the
sentiment are very elevated. As the foci rise, they
become more exalted.
Let this be considered from another point of view.
We shall reproduce gratitude by touching all the
CentreS.

They have been centres of attraction, we shall
render them points of departure. * : *
“I thank you !” The more elevated the move-
ments, the more nobility there is in the expression
of the sentiment. The exaltation is proportional
to the section indicated.
The posterior region is very interesting. There
are three sorts of vertebrae : cervical, dorsal and
lumbar.
This apparatus may first be considered as a lever.
But taking the vertical column alone, we shall have
twenty-four special and distinct keys whose action
and tonality will be entirely specific. From these
twenty-four vertebrae proceed the nervous plexi, all
aiding a particular expression; so that the vertebral
column forms the keys of the sympathetic human
instrument.
If the finger is cut, there is a special emotion in
one place of the vertebral column.
If the finger is crushed by the blow of a hammer,
the emotion will affect a special vertebra.
The nose is one of the most complex and impor-
tant agents.
There are here nine divisions to be studied. (See
page 82.)


## p. 114 (#150) ############################################

CHAPTER IX.
OF GESTURE IN RELATION TO THE FIGURES WHICH
REPRESENT IT,
Gesture through its inflections may reproduce all
the figures of geometry. We shall confine our-
selves to a description of the primary and most
usual imitative inflections.
These inflections comprise three sorts of move-
ments affected by each gesture, which usually unite
and constitute a synthetic form. These three move-
ments agree with the three primary actions which
characterize the manifestations of the soul, the
mind and the life. These are direct, circular and
oblique inflections.
The flexor movements are direct, the rotary
movements circular, the abductory movements ob-
lique. The sum of these movements constitutes
nine co-essential terms, whose union forms the ac-
cord of nine.
There are rising, falling and medium inflections.
Gesture does everything that the voice does in
rising. Hence there is great affinity between the
voice and the arms. Vocal inflection is like the
gestures of the blind; in fact, with acquaintance,
one may know the nature of the gesture from the
sound of the voice.


## p. 115 (#151) ############################################

THE INFLECTIONS OF GESTURE. II 5
We exalt people by a circle. We say that a thing
is beautiful, noble, grand—making circles which grow
higher and broader as the object is more elevated.
We choose the circle for exalting and caressing,
because the circle is the most agreeable form to
touch and to caress. For example, an ivory ball.
This form applies to all that is great.
For God there is no circle, there can be none.
But we outline a portion of an immense circle, of
which we can touch but one point. We indicate
only the inner periphery of a circle it is impossible
to finish, and then retrace our steps.
When the circle is made small, we make it with
one, two, three or four fingers, with the hand, with
the arm. If the circle is vast as can be made
with the arms, it is homogeneous.
But a small circle made with the arm will express
stupidity. Thus we say of a witty man: “This is a
witty man,” employing the fingers.
Stupidity wishing to simulate this, would make a
broad movement.
Let us take the fable of Captain Renard as an
example of this view of the circle.
I depict the cunning nature of this captain with
my fingers. Without this he would not be a captain;
but at most a corporal.
—“He went in company
With his friend He-Goat of the branching horns.
The one could see no farther than his nose;
The other was past master in deceit.”


## p. 116 (#152) ############################################

I IO GESTURE.
As they go along, the fox relates all his exploits
to the goat, and the goat surprised, and wishing an
end of the recital, sees fit to make a gesture, as he
Says:
“I admire people full of sense like you.”
In making the small circle, he employs not only
the fingers, but the arm, the shoulder, the whole
body. He is an imbecile. He wastes too much
effort in making a small circle.
Let us take a situation from an opera. When
Robert enters and sees Isabella, he says of her:
“This peaceful sleep, this lull of every sense,
Lends a yet sweeter charm to this young face.”
The gesture is in the form of a geometrical
figure.
In another place, Robert says:
“Thy voice, proud beauty, few can understand.”
Here a spheroidal and then a rectangular move-
ment must be made. We close the door. “Her
voice will be understood by me, alone.” He might
say: “Thy voice, proud beauty, will not be under-
stood. It will be elevated for me, and not for
Others.”
Every sentiment has its form, its plastic expres–
sion, and as its form is more or less elaborated, we
may judge of the elevation of the speaker's thought.
If we could stereotype gesture, we might say:
“This one has the more elevated heart, that one the


## p. 117 (#153) ############################################

DELINEATION OF GESTURE. II 7
least elevated; this one in the matter, that one in
the spirit of his discourse.”
All gestures may be very well delineated. An
orator gesticulating before the public, resembles a
painter who pencils outlines and designs upon a
wall.
This reproduction of the figures of gesture is
called Chorography. We give in the subjoined
chart some types of gesture. These are a few
flowers culled from a rich garden.
To express sensual grace the gesture takes the
downward spheroidal form. The virtuous form
would be upward.
If we wish to express many attractive things, we
make many spheroidal gestures.
What is called the culminating point of the ges-
ture, must not be forgotten. This is a ring in the
form of the last stroke of the German letter Q),
which is made by a quick, electric movement of the
wrist.
We refer the student to the close of the volume,
for a model of exercises comprising a series of ges-
tures which express the most eloquent sentiments
of the human heart.
This exercise in gesture has two advantages: it
presents all the interest of the most fascinating
drama, and is the best means of gaining suppleness
by accustoming ourselves to the laws of gesture.

The oblique line 4 rejects things which oppress us, of which we
would be freed.
5. The quarter-circle, whose form recalls that of the hammock,
expresses well-being, happiness, confidence.
6. The curvilinear eccentric quarter-circle expresses secrecy, si-
lence, possession, domination, stability, imposition, inclusion.
7. The curvilinear outside quarter-circle expresses things slender,
delicate (in two ways); the downward movement expresses moral
and intellectual delicacy.
8. The outside quarter-circle expresses exuberance, plenitude,
amplitude, generosity.
9. The circle which surrounds and embraces, characterizes glorifi-
cation and exaltation.

CHAPTER I.
ORIGIN AND ORGANIC APPARATUS OF LANGUAGE.
Man reveals his life through more than four mil-
lions of inflections ere he can speak or gesticulate.
When he begins to reason, to make abstractions,
the vocal apparatus and gesture are insufficient; he
must speak, he must give his thought an outside
form so that it may be appreciated and transmitted
through the senses. There are things which can be
expressed neither by sound nor gesture. For in-
stance, how shall we say at the same time of a
plant: “It is beautiful, but it has no smell.”
Thought must then be revealed by conventional
signs, which are articulation. Therefore, God has
endowed man with the rich gift of speech.
Speech is the sense of the intelligence; sound the
Sense of the life, and gesture that of the heart.
Soul communicates with soul only through the
Senses. The senses are the condition of man as a
pilgrim on this earth. Man is obliged to materialize

all : the sensations through the voice, the sentiments
through gesture, the ideas through speech. The
means of transmission are always material. This is
why the church has Sacraments, an exterior worship,
chants, ceremonies. All its institutions arise from a
principle eminently philosophical.
Speech is formed by three agents: the lips, the
tongue and the soft-palate.
It is delightful to study the special rôle of these
agents, the reason of their movements.
They have a series of gestures that may be per-
fectly understood. Thus language resembles the
hand, having also its gesture.


## p. 125 (#161) ############################################

CHAPTER II.
ELEMENTS OF ARTICULATE LANGUAGE.
Every language is composed of consonants and
vowels. These consonants and vowels are gestures.
The value of the consonant is the gesture of the
thing expressed. But as gesture is always the
expression of a moral fact, each consonant has the
intrinsic character of a movement of the heart. It
is easy to prove that the consonant is a gesture.
For example, in articulating it, the tongue rises to
the palate and makes the same movement as the arm
when it would repel something.
The elements of all languages have the same
meaning. The vowels correspond directly to the
moral state.
There is diversity of language because the things
we wish to express vary from difference in usage
and difference of manner and climate. What we
call a shoe, bears among northern people a name
indicating that it protects the feet from the cold;
among southern people it protects the feet from the
heat. Elsewhere the shoe protects the feet against
the roughness of the soil; and in yet other places,
it exists only as a defensive object— a weapon.
These diverse interpretations require diverse signs.
This does not prove the diversity of language, but


## p. 126 (#162) ############################################

I 26 ARTICULATE LANGUAGE
the diversity of the senses affected by the same
object.
Things are perceived only after the fashion of the
perceiver, and this is why the syllables vary among
different peoples.
Nevertheless, there is but one language. We find
everywhere these words: / an active personality, me
a passive personality, and mine an awarding person-
ality. In every language we find the subject, the
verb and the adjective.
Every articulate language is composed of substan-
tive, adjective and copulative ideas.
All arts are found in articulation. Sound is the
articulation of the vocal apparatus; gesture the
articulation of the dynamic apparatus; language the
articulation of the buccal apparatus. Therefore,
music, the plastic arts and speech have their origin
and their perfection in articulation.
It is, then, of the utmost importance to understand
thoroughly the elements of speech, which is at the
same time a vocalization and a dynamic. Without
this knowledge no oratorical art is possible.
Let us now hasten to take possession of the riches
of speech.


## p. 127 (#163) ############################################

CHAPTER III.
THE ORATORICAL VALUE OF SPEECH.
The privilege of speech may be considered under
a double aspect, in itself and in its relations to the
art of Oratory. -
I. In Itself—Speech is the most wonderful gif
of the Creator. Through speech man occupies the
first rank in the scale of being. It is the language
of the reason, and reason lifts man above every
creature. Man through speech incarnates his mind
to unite himself with his fellow-men, as the Son of
God was incarnated to unite with human nature;
like the Son of God who nourishes humanity with
his body in the eucharist, so man makes his speech
understood by multitudes who receive it entire,
without division or diminution.
Eternal thanks to God for this ineffable gift, so
great in itself, of such value in the art of Oratory !
2. What is the oratorical value of speech P In
oratorical art, speech plays a subordinate but indis-
pensable rôle.
Let us examine separately the two members of
this proposition.
A.—In the hierarchy of oratorical powers, speech
comes only in the third order. In fact, the child

I 28 ARTICULATE LANGUAGE.
begins to utter cries and to gesticulate before he
Speaks.
The text is only a label. The sense lies not in
speech, but in inflection and gesture. Nature insti-
tutes a movement, speech names the movement.
Writing is a dead letter.
Speech is only the title of that which gesture has
announced; speech comes only to confirm what is
already understood by the auditors.
We are moved in reading, not so much by what is
said, as by the manner of reading. It is not what
we hear that affects us, but that which we ourselves
imagine.
An author cannot fully express his ideas in writ-
ing; hence the interpretation of the hearer is often
false, because he does not know the writer.
It is remarkable, the way in which we refer every-
thing to ourselves. We must needs create a sem-
blance of it. We are affected by a discourse because
we place the personage in a situation our fancy has
created. Hence it happens that we may be wrong
in our interpretation, and that the author might say:
“This is not my meaning.”
In hearing a symphony we at once imagine a
Scene, we give it an aspect; this is why it affects us.
A written discourse requires many illustrative
epithets; in a spoken discourse, the adjectives may
be replaced by gesture and inflection.
Imitation is the melody of the eye, inflection is
the melody of the ear. All that strikes the eye has

ORATORICAL VALUE OF SPEECH. I29
a sound; this is why the sight of the stars produces
an enchanting melody in Our Souls.
Hence in a discourse, speech is the letter, and it
is inflection and gesture which give it life. Never-
theless:—
B.—The rôle of speech, although subordinate, is
not only important, but necessary. In fact, human
language, as we have said, is composed of inflection,
gesture and speech.
Language would not be complete without speech.
Speech has nothing to do with sentiment, it is true,
but a discourse is not all sentiment; there is a place
for reason, for demonstration, and upon this ground
gesture has nothing to do; the entire work here falls
back upon speech.
Speech is the crown of oratorical action; it is this
which gives the final elucidation, which justifies ges-
ture. Gesture has depicted the object, the Being,
and speech responds: God.


## p. 130 (#166) ############################################

CHAPTER IV.
THE VALUE OF WORDS IN PHRASES.
Expression is very difficult. One may possess
great knowledge and lack power to express it. Elo-
quence does not always accompany intellect. As a
rule, poets do not know how to read what they have
written. Hence we may estimate the importance of
understanding the value of the different portions of
a discourse. Let us now examine intellectual lan-
guage in relation to intensity of ideas.
There are nine species of words, or nine species
of ideas. The article need not be counted, since it
is lacking in several languages. It is the accord of
nine which composes the language, and which cor-
responds to the numbers. Every word has a deter-
minate, mathematical value.
As many unities must be reckoned on the initial
Consonant as there are values in the word.
Thus the subject has less value than the attribute.
The attribute has a value of six degrees and rep-
resents six times the intensity of the subject. Why?
Because God has willed that we should formulate
our idea with mathematical intensities.
The value rests only upon the initial consonant


## p. 131 (#167) ############################################

VALUE OF WORDS IN PHRASES. I3 I
of the word. Words have only one expressive por-
tion, that is, the initial consonant. It receives the
whole value, and is the invariable part of the word.
It is the root. Words are transformed in passing
from language to language, and nevertheless retain
their radical.
How shall we say that a flower is charming?
Do not demand of intensity of sound a value it
does not possess. It suffices to await the articula-
tion of the consonant.
The most normal phenomena remain true to
mechanical laws. The mere articulation of the word
expresses more than all the vocal and imitative
effects that can be introduced.
Most speakers dwell upon the final word; this
habit is absolutely opposed to the nature of heart
movements. This school habit is hard to correct,
and if Rachel became a great artiste, it was because
she did not have this precedent.
The subject represents one degree; it is the
weakest expression.
The verb represents two degrees; the attribute
six. Let us illustrate the manner of passing from
One to six as follows:
A rustic comes to visit you upon some sort of
business. This man has a purpose. As you are a
musician he is surprised by his first sight of a piano.
He says to himself: “What is this? It is a singular
object.”
It is neither a table nor a cupboard. He now


## p. 132 (#168) ############################################

I32 ARTICULATE LANGUAGE.
perceives the ivory keys and other keys of ebony.
What can this mean? He stands confounded before
an instrument entirely new to him. If it were given
to him, he would not know what to do with it; he
might burn it. The piano interests him so much
that he forgets the object of his visit.
He sees you arrive. You occupy for him the place
of the verb in relation to the object which interests
him. He passes from this object to you. Although
you are not the object which engrosses him, there
is a progression in the interest, because he knows
that through you he will learn what this piece of
furniture is. “Tell me what this is l’’ he cries.
You strike the piano; it gives forth an accord.
O heavens, how beautiful! He is greatly moved, he
utters many expressions of delig't, and now he
would not burn the instrument.
Here is a progression. At first the piece of fur-
niture interests him ; then its owner still more; at
last the attributes of the piano give it its entire
value.
But why six degrees upon the last term P The value
of a fact comes from its limitation; the knowledge
of an idea also proceeds from its limitation. A fact
in its general and vague expression, awakens but
little interest. But as it descends from the genus
to the species, from the species to the individual, it
grows more interesting. It comes more within our
capacity. We do not embrace the vast circle of a
generic fact.


## p. 133 (#169) ############################################

VALUE OF WORDS IN PHRASES. I 33
Let us take another proposition: “A flower is
pleasing.”
I 2 3 4 5 6

——Flower is pleasing
*" |

4.

it is faded Oh I
The word flower alone says nothing to the imag-
ination. Is it a rose or a lily of the valley P. The
expression is too vague. When the idea of genus
is modified by that of species, we are better satisfied.
* Let us say: “The flower of the forest.” This
word forest conveys an idea to the mind. We can
make our bouquet. We think of the lily of the
valley, of the violet, the anemone, the periwinkle.
This restriction gives value to the subject. Forest is
more important than the verb which does not com-
plete the idea, and less important than pleasing.
Therefore we place 3 upon forest, and shall rank
pleasing from 3 to 4, since it closes the assertion.
If we individualize by the word this, we augment
the value by giving actuality to the word ſlower.
This has more value than the forest, because it des-
ignates the subject. Hence this has four degrees.
As pleasing forms the very essence of our prop-
osition, we are obliged to give it five degrees.
The idea is still somewhat vague. If I specify it


## p. 134 (#170) ############################################

I34. ARTICULATE LANGUAGE.
still further by saying this little ſlower, little has a
higher value than all the other words.
What value shall we give this adjective? We have
reached five, but have not yet fully expressed the
idea which impresses us. Little must therefore have
six degrees.
This is the sole law for all the languages of
the world. There are no two ways of articulating
the words of a discourse. When we learn a dis-
course by heart in order to deliver it, and take no
account of the value of the terms, the divine law is
reversed.
Now, if we could introduce an expression here,
which would at once enhance the value of the word
//easing, it would evidently be stronger than all the
others. In fact, if the way in which a thing is pleas-
ing can be expressed, it is evident that this manner
of being pleasing will rise above the word itself.
We do not know the proportion in which the
flower is pleasing. We will say that it is very pleas-
ing. This adverb gives the word pleasing a new
value. It is in turn modified. If we should say
2mmensely, or use any other adverb of quantity, the
value would remain the same. It would still be a
modification. Thus, when we say of God that he is
good, immense, infinite, there is always a limitation
attached to the idea of God, a limitation necessary
to our nature. For God is not good in the way we
understand goodness or greatness; but our finite
minds need some expression for our idea.


## p. 135 (#171) ############################################

THE CONJUNCTION. I 35
We see the word pleasing modified in turn, and
the term which modifies it, is higher than itself.
Very pleasing, -what value shall we give it? We
can give it no more than seven here.
A single word may obliterate the effect produced
by all these expressions. A simple conjunction may
be introduced which will entirely modify all we have
taken pains to say. It is a buz. But is an entire
discourse. We no longer believe what has been said
hitherto, but what follows this word. This conjunc-
tion has a value of eight degrees, a value possible
to all conjunctions without exception. It sums up
the changes indicated by subsequent expressions, and
embraces them synthetically. It has, then, a very
great Oratorical value.
The Conjunction.
I. We refer here only to conjunctions in the ellip-
tical sense. The conjunction is an ellipse, because
it is the middle term between two members of the
sentence which are the extremes; it recalls what has
just been said, and indicates what is to come. Con-
sidered in itself, the word and, when elliptical, em-
braces what has just been said, and what is about to
be said. All this is founded upon the principle that
the means are equal to the extremes. +
2. The copulative or enumerative conjunctions,
have only two degrees. We see that a conjunction
is not elliptical when, instead of uniting propositions,
it unites only ideas of the same character.


## p. 136 (#172) ############################################

I36 ARTICULATE LANGUAGE.
3. Determinative conjunctions have only three
degrees. For example: “It is necessary that I
should work.” That has only three degrees.
4. The values indicated can be changed only by
additional values justified by gesture. Thus in the
phrase: “This medley of glory and honor,”—the
value of the word medley can and must be changed;
but a gesture is necessary, for speech is only a feeble
echo of gesture. Only gesture can justify a value
other than that indicated in this demonstration.
This value is purely grammatical, but the gesture
may give it a superlative idea, which we call addi-
tional value. The value of consonants may vary in
the pronunciation according to their valuation by
the speakers.
More or less value is given to the degrees noted and
to be noted, as there is more or less emotion in the
speaker. This explains why a gesture, which expresses
an emotion of the soul, justifies changing the gram-
matical value in the pronunciation of consonants.
5. Even aside from additional values, the gesture
must always precede the articulation of the initial
consonant. Otherwise to observe the degree would
be supremely ridiculous. The speaker would re-
semble a skeleton, a statue. The law of values
becomes vital only through gesture and inflection.
Stripped of the poetry of gesture and inflection, the
application of the law is monstrous.
To place six degrees upon pleasing without ges-
ture, is abominable.


## p. 137 (#173) ############################################

THE CONJUNCTION. I 37
We now understand the spirit of gesture, which is
given to man to justify values. It is for him to de-
cide whether the proposition is true or not. If we
deprive our discourse of gestures, no way is left to
prove the truth of values. Thus gesture is prescribed
by certain figures, and we shall now see from a prop-
osition, how many gestures are needed, and to what
word the gesture should be given.
The Congjunction Continated—Various Examples.
The degree of value given to the conjunction,
may be represented by the figure 8.
Let us justify this valuation by citing these two
lines of Racine:
“The wave comes on, it breaks, and vomits
'neath our eyes,
Amid the floods of foam, a monster
grim and dire.”
The ordinary reader would allow the conjunction
and to pass unperceived, because the word is not
sonorous, and we accord oratorical effects only to
sonorous words. But the man who sees the mean-
ing fully, and who adds and, has said the whole.
The other words are important, but everything is
implied in this conjunction.
Racine has not placed and here to disjoin, but to
unite.
We give another example of the conjunction:
Augustus says to Cinna:
“Take a chair Cinna, and in all things heed
Strictly the law that I lay down for thee.”


## p. 138 (#174) ############################################

I38 ARTICULATE LANGUAGE.
Let us suppress the isolation and silence of the
conjunction, and there is no more color.
Augustus adds:
“Hold thy tongue captive, and if silence deep
To thy emotion do some violence”—
Suppress the silence and isolation of the conjunc-
tion and, and how poor is the expression
In the fable of “The Wolf and the Dog:”
“Sire wolf would gladly have attacked and slain
him, but it would have been necessary to give battle,
and it was now almost morning.”
The entire significance lies in the silence which
follows the conjunctions.
We speak of a sympathetic conjunction, and also
of one denoting surprise or admiration; but this
conjunction differs from the interjection, only in this
respect: it rests upon the propositions and unites its
terms. Like the interjection, it is of a synthetic and
elliptic nature; it groups all the expressions it unites
as interjectives. It is, then, from this point of view,
exclamative. -
In the fable of “The Wolf and the Lamb,” the
wolf says:
“This must be some one of your own race, for
you would not think of sparing me, you shepherds
and you dogs.”
Here is an interjective conjunction. Suppress the
Complaint after for, and there is no more effect.
The conjunction is the soul of the discourse.


## p. 139 (#175) ############################################

THE INTERJECTION. I 39
In the exclamation in “Joseph Sold by his Breth-
ren,” we again find an interjective conjunction.
“Alas . . . . . . . . . . azed
The ingrates who would sell me !”
Here the conjunction and yields little to the inter-
jection alas. It has fully as much value.
The Interſection in Åelation to its Degree of Value.
The interjection has 9 degrees; this is admirably
suited to the interjection, an elliptical term which
comprises the three terms of a proposition. In
summing up the value of a simple proposition, we
have (a noteworthy thing) the figure 9. This gives
the accord of 9. The subject I, the verb 2, and 6
upon the attribute, equal 9. Thus the equation is
perfect.
Gesture is the rendering of the ellipse. Gesture
is the elliptical language given to man to express
what speech is powerless to say.
We have spoken of additional figures. Each of
these figures supposes a gesture. There is a gesture,
an imitative expression wherever there is an addi-
tional figure. An ellipse in a word, such as is met
with in the conjunction and the interjection, demands
a gesture.
9 is a neutral term which must be sustained by
gesture and inflection. Gesture would be the inflec-
tion of the deaf, inflection the gesture of the blind.
The orator should, in fact, address himself to the
deaf as well as to the blind. Gesture and inflection

I4O ARTICULATE LANGUAGE.
should supplement physical and mental infirmities,
and God in truth has given man this double means
of expression. There is also a triple expression,
which is double in view of this same modification of
speech. Let us suppose this proposition:
“How much pain. I suffer in hearing ! ”
&c.
According to the rules laid down, we have 3 upon
pain, 6 upon Suffer, and 6 again upon hearing.
It is said that Talma brought out the intensity of
his suffering by resting on the word pain. This was
wrong. We should always seek the expression
equivalent to that employed, to attain a certain
value.
If, instead of the determinate conjunction that, we
should have ſhow much (combien), this would evi-
dently be the important word. This word has an
elliptical form. It evidently belongs to a preceding
proposition. It means: “I could not express all
that I suffer.” Then 6 must be placed upon how
much and not upon pain.
But the figure 6 here is a thermometer which indi-
cates a degree of vitality; it does not express the
degree of vitality; that is reserved for gesture. We
need not ask what degree this can give; its office is
a value me-
to express — and this is a good deal
chanical and material, but very significant. A rever-
Sion of values may constitute a falsehood. Stage
actors are sometimes indefinably comic in this way.

DEGREES OF VALUE. I4. I
A Resumé of the Degrees of Value.

guage, we give in a table, a resumé of the different

relative to the initial consonant.

The pronoun is either subject or complement, and
therefore included in the rest. As for the article, it
is not essential to a language; there is no article in
Latin.
Thus the value of our ideas is expressed by
figures. We have only to reckon on our fingers.
We might beat time for the pronunciation of the
consonants as for the notes of music. Let the pupil
exercise his fingers, and attain that skill which allows
the articulation of a radical consonant only after he

to its figure. If difficulties present themselves at
first, so much the better; he will only the more
accurately distinguish the value of the words.

CHAPTER V.
FRENCH AND LATIN PROSODY.
French Prosody.
Prosody is the rhythmic pronunciation of syllables
according to accent, respiration, and, above all, quan-
tity. ºr
In the Italian there are no two equal sounds; the
quantity is never uniform. Italian is, therefore, the
most musical of languages. Where we place one
accent upon a vowel, the Italians place ten.
There is a euphonic law for every language; all
idioms must have an accent. In every language
there are intense sounds and subdued sounds; the
Italians hold to this variety of alternate short and
long Sounds. Continuous beauty should be avoided.
A beautiful tone must be introduced to relieve the
others. Monotony in sounds as well as in pronun-
ciation, must be guarded against. Harmony lies in
Opposition.
There is but one rule of quantity in French pro-
nunciation. Here is the text of this law :
There are and can be only long initial or fina/
vowels — whence we conclude:
I. Every final is long and every penultimate is
final, since e mute is not pronounced.


## p. 144 (#180) ############################################

I 44 ARTICULATE LANGUAGE.
2 The length of initial vowels depends upon the
value of the initial consonants which they precede.
A word cannot contain two long vowels unless it
begins with a vowel. In this case, the vowel of the
preceding word is long, and prepares for the enun-
ciation of the consonant according to its degree.
Every first consonant in a word is strong, as it
constitutes the radical or invariable part of the word.
The force of this consonant is subordinate to the
ruling degree of the idea it is called to decide. But
every vowel which precedes this first consonant is
long, since it serves as a preparation for it. But to
what degree of length may this initial vowel be car-
ried? The representative figure of the consonant
will indicate it.
Usually, the first consonant of every word is rad-
ical. Still there might be other radical consonants
in the same word. But the first would rise above
the others.
The radical designates the substance of being, and
the last consonant the manner.
The whole secret of expression lies in the time
we delay the articulation of the initial consonant.
This space arrests the attention and prevents our
catching the Sound at a disadvantage.
/latin Prosody.
I. The final of a word of several syllables is
usually short.
2. In words of two syllables, the first is long. In


## p. 145 (#181) ############################################

LATIN PROSODY. I45
Latin words of two syllables, the first almost always
contains the radical.
3. In words of three and more syllables, there is
one long syllable: Sometimes the first, sometimes
another. We rest only upon this, all the others
being counted more or less short.
In compound words no account need be made of
prefixes. There are many compound words; and,
consequently, it is often the last or next to the last
consonant which is the radical.
The last consonant represents always, in variable
words, quality, person, mode or time. The radical,
on the contrary, represents the sum and substance.
4. Monosyllables are long, but they have, espe-
cially when they follow each other, particular rules,
which result from the sense of the phrases, and from
the mutual dependence of words.

CHAPTER VII.
A SERIES OF GESTURES FOR EXERCISES.
Preliminary Reſections.
We know the words of Garrick:
“I do not confide in myself, not I, in that inspira-
tion for which idle mediocrity waits.”
Art, then, presents a Solid basis to the artist, upon
which he can rest and reproduce at will the history
of the human heart as revealed by gesture.
This is true, and it is as an application of this truth
that we are about to consider the Series, which is an
exposition of the passions that agitate man, an ini-
tiation into imitative language. It is a poem, and
at the same time it lays down rules through whose
aid the Self-possessed artist can regain the gesture
which arises from sudden perturbation of the heart.
It is a grammar which must be studied incessantly,
in order to understand the origin and value of imita-
tive expressions.
The development of the series is based upon the
static, the semeiotic and the dynamic.
The static is the life of gesture; it is the science
of the equipoise of levers, it teaches the weight of
the limbs and the extent of their development, in

order to maintain the equilibrium of the body. Its
criterion should be a sort of balance.
The semeiotic is the spirit and rationale of ges-
ture. It is the science of signs.
The dynamic is the action of equiponderant forces
through the static; it regulates the proportion of
movements the soul would impress upon the body.
The foundation and criterion of the dynamic, is
the law of the pendulum.
The series proceeds, resting upon these three pow-
ers. The Semeiotic has given the signs, it becomes
aesthetic in applying them. The Semeiotic says:
“Such a gesture reveals such a passion ; ” and ges-
ture replies: “To such a passion I will apply such
a sign.” And without awaiting the aid of an inspira-
tion Often hazardous, deceitful and uncertain, it
moulds the body to its will, and forces it to repro-
duce the passion the soul has conceived. The se-
meiotic is a science, the aesthetic an act of genius.
The series divides its movements into periods of
time, in accordance with the principle that the more
time a movement has, the more its vitality and power;
and so every articulation becomes the object of a
time. -- ~~
The articulations unfold successively and harmo-
niously. Every articulation which has no action,
must remain absolutely pendent, or become stiff.
Grace is closely united to gesture; the manifold
play of the articulations which constitutes strength,
also constitutes grace. Grace subdues only because

SERIES OF GESTURES FOR EXERCISES. I.49
sustained by strength, and because strength naturally
subdues. Grace without strength is affectation.
Every vehement movement must affect the verti-
cal position, because obliquity deprives the move-
ment of force, by taking from it the possibility of
showing the play of the articulations.
The demonstration of movement is in the head.
The head is the primary agent of movement; the
body is the medium agent, the arm the final agent.
Three agents in gesture are especially affected
in characterizing the life, mind and soul. The
thumb is the index-sign of life; the shoulder is the
sign of passion and sentiment; the elbow is the sign
of humility, pride, power, intelligence and sacrifice.
The first gesture of the series is the interpellation,
the entrance upon the scene. The soul is scarce
moved as yet, and still this is the most difficult of
gestures, because the most complex. It must indi-
cate the nature of the interpellation, its degree and
the situation of the giver and receiver of the sum-
mons in regard to each other.
A study of the signs which distinguish these dif-
ferent shades will teach us the analysis of gesture.
Aside from simple interpellation, the series passes
successively from gratitude, devotion, etc., to anger,
menace and conflict, leaving the Soul at the point
where it is subdued and asks forgiveness.
The passional or fugitive type forms the constant
subject of the study of this series.

THE SERIES OF GESTURES APPLIED TO THE SENTI-
MENTS OFTENEST EXPRESSED BY THE ORATOR.
FIRST GESTURE.
Interpellation.
Interpellation embraces five steps :
The first consists in elevating the shoulder in
token of affection. If the right shoulder, as-in
figure 2 with the right leg weak.
The second step consists in a rotary movement of
the arm, its object being to present the epicondyle
(elbow-joint) to the interlocutor. For this reason
the epicondyle is called the eye of the arm.
The third stage consists in substituting the articu-
lation of the wrist for the epicondyle. In making
the forward movement of the body, the epicondyle
must resume its natural place.
The fourth step consists in extending the hand
toward the speaker in such a way as to present to
him the extremities of the fingers.
The fifth step is formed by a rapid rotation of the
hand.
SECOND GESTURE.
7%anks—Affectionate and Ceremonzoats.
This gesture consists of six steps:
I. Consists in lifting the hand and lowering the
head.
2. Consists in raising the hand to the hip.
3. The head inclines to one side, and the elbow

at the same time rises to aid the hand in reaching
the lips.
4. In this, the head resumes its normal position,
while the elbow is lowered to bring back the hand
to the same position.
5. In this, the hand passes from the horizontal to
the vertical position, rounding toward the arm.
6. In this, the arm is developed, and then the
hand.
THIRD GESTURE.
Attraction.
In this gesture there are three steps:
I. The hand turns toward the interlocutor with an
appealing aspect.
2. The hand opens like a fan with the little finger
tending toward the chest.
3. The elbow is turned outward, and the hand
passes toward the breast. -
FOURTH GESTURE.
Surprise and Assurance.
I. This consists in elevating the shoulders, open-
ing the eyes and mouth and raising the eyebrow;
the whole in token of surprise.
2. Raise the passive hand above the chin, making
it turn around the wrist.
3. The hand still passive, is directed toward the
person addressed, the elbow being pressed against
the body.


## p. 152 (#188) ############################################

4. The arm is gradually extended toward the per-
Son addressed, while the hand is given an opposite
direction; that is, the palm of the hand is toward
him.
FIFTH GESTURE.
ADevotion.
This gesture embraces seven movements:
I. This consists in raising the passive hand to the
level of the other hand, but in an inverse direction.
2. This consists in turning back the hand toward
one's self.
3. This consists in drawing the elbows to the
body, and placing the hands on the chest.
4. This is produced by taking a step backward,
“ . . . - - • * : : i le * • * - te e
| and turning a third to one side; during the execu-
tion of this step, the elbows are raised, and the head
is lowered.
5. This consists in drawing the elbows near the
body, and placing the hands above the shoulders.
6. This consists in developing the arms.
7. This consists in developing the hands.
SIXTH GESTURE.
Interrogative Surprise.
This surprise is expressed in two movements:
I. This is wholly facial.
2. This is made by advancing the hand and draw-
ing the head backward.

SEVENTH G ESTU R.E.
Reiterated /m/errogation.
This gesture signifies: I do not understand, I
cannot explain your conduct to me.
It embraces five steps:
I. This consists in placing both hands beneath the
chin, and violently elevating the shoulders.
2. This consists in bringing the hands to the level
of the chest, as if in search of something there.
3. This consists in extending both hands toward
the interlocutor, as if to show him that they contain
nothing.
4. This consists in extending one hand in the
opposite direction, and letting the head and body
follow the hand. -
5. This consists in turning the head vehemently
toward the interlocutor, and suddenly lowering the
shoulders.
EIGHTH GESTURE.
Anger.
This gesture is made in three movements:
I. This consists in raising the arm.
2. This consists in catching hold of the sleeve.
3. This consists in carrying the clenched hand to
the breast, and drawing back the other arm.
NINTH GESTURE.
Menace.
This gesture consists of a preparatory move-
ment, which is made by lowering the hand while the

arm is outstretched toward the interlocutor, then the
finger is extended, and the hand is outstretched in
1I] CIla Cé.
The eye follows the finger as it would follow a
pistol; this occasions a reversal of the head propor-
tional to that of the hand.
TENTH GESTURE.
An Order for Zeaving.
This is executed :
I. By turning around on the free limb.
2. By carrying the body with it.
3. By executing a one-fifth sideward movement—
the right leg very weak. All these movements are
made by retaining the gesture of the preceding men-
ace. Then only the menacing hand is turned in-
ward at the height of the eye, at the moment when
it is about to pass the line occupied by the head;
the elbow is raised to allow the hand a downward
movement, which ends in an indication of departure.
In this indication the hand is absolutely reversed,
that is, it is in pronation. Then only does the head,
which has hitherto been lowered, rise through the
opposition of the extended arm.
ELEVENTH GESTURE.
A'eiteration.
I. The whole body tends toward the hand which
is posed above the head. The right leg passes from
weak to strong.


## p. 155 (#191) ############################################

SERIES OF GESTURES FOR EXERCISES. I 55
2. The head is turned backward toward the inter-
locutor.
3. It rises.
4. The arm extends. -
5. The hand in supination gives intimation of the
order.
TWELFTH GESTURE.
Fright.
The right hand pendent. The left hand rises.
Tremor. ‘. . . . . . .
The first movement is executed in one-third ; the
body gently passes into the fourth, and as the fifth
is being accomplished, the arm is thrust forward as
if to repel the new object of terror.
At this moment a metamorphose seems to take
place, and the object which had occasioned the
fright, seems to be transfigured and to become the
subject of an affectionate impulse. The hands
extend toward this object not to repel it, but to im-
plore it to remain; it seems to become more and
more ennobled, and to assume in the astonished eyes
of the actor, a celestial form—it is an angel. There-
fore the body recoils anew one-fourth ; the hands
fall back in token of acquiescence; then, while draw-
ing near the body, they extend anew toward the
angel (here a third in token of affection and venera-
tion). Then a prayer is addressed to it, and again
the arms extend toward it in entreaty. (Here the
orator falls upon his knees.)


## p. 156 (#192) ############################################

I 56 ARTICULATE LANGUAGE.
The series can be executed beginning with the
right arm or the left, being careful to observe the
initial and principal movement, with the arms at
the side where the scene opened. This gives the
same play of organs only in an inverse sense.
Important Remarks.
Should any student despair of becoming familiar
with our method, we give him three pieces of ad-
vice, all easy of application:
I. Never speak without having first expressed
what you would say by gesture. Gesture must
always precede speech.
2. Avoid parallelism of gesture. The opposition
of the agents is necessary to equilibrium, to har-
mony.
3. Retain the same gesture for the same senti-
ment. In Saying the same thing the gesture should
not be changed.
Should the student limit himself to the application
of these three rules, he will not regret this study
of the
PRACTICE OF THE ART OF ORATORY.

We close this book with an appendix which will
serve for Ornament. Before delivering up a suite
of rooms, we are wont to embellish them with rich

I 58 APPENDIX.
In the literary world, color gives forms of speech
consecrated by frequent usage. Thus we very often
say: a florid style, a brilliant orator. This figurative
language signifies that in order to shine, the Orator
must be adorned with the lustre of flowers. And as
one flower excels others and pleases us by the
beauty of its colors, so the Orator must excel, and
please by the brilliant shades of his diction. It is
as impossible to give renown to a monotonous and
colorless orator as to a faded, discolored flower.
Would you give to the phenomena of your or-
ganism this beautiful corolla of the flower of your
garden, throw your glance upon nature.
Nature speaks to the eye through an enchanting
variety of colors, and these colors in turn teach man
how he may himself speak to the eyes. The whole
man might recognize himself under the smiling
emblem of colors. Imagine him in whatever state
you will, a color will give you the secret of his
aspirations. And so it has been easy for us to show
you the orator imaged in this colored chart, and we
shall have no trouble in justifying our choice of
colors.
Since man, as to his soul, presents himself in three
states: the sensitive, intellectual and moral; and in
his organism in the eccentric, concentric and normal
states; a priori, you may conclude that nature has
three colors to symbolize the three states, and ex-
perience will not contradict you.
In fact, red, yellow and blue are the primitive


## p. 159 (#195) ############################################

SYMBOLISM OF COLORS. I 59
colors. All others are derived from these three
rudimentary Colors.
Why have we painted the column that corresponds
to the life red P Because red is the color of blood,
and the life is in the blood. But life is the fountain
of strength and power. Hence red is the proper
symbol of strength and power in God, in man and
in the demon.
Why blue in the column of the concentric state,
the mind? Because blue, from its transparency, is
most soothing to our eyes.
Why yellow in the column of the soul? Because
yellow has the color of flame; it is the true symbol
of a soul set on fire by love. Yellow is, then, the
emblem of pure love and of impure flames.
Why not use white in our chart? Because white
is incandescence in the highest degree. We say
of iron that it is at a red or a white heat. But in
this world it is rare to see a heart at a white heat.
Earthly thermometers do not mark this degree
of heat.
It cannot be denied that red, yellow and blue are
the three elementary colors, whose union gives birth
to all the varieties that delight our eyes. We have
proof of this in one of nature's most beautiful phe-
nomena — the rainbow.
The rainbow is composed of seven colors. Here
we distinguish the red, yellow and blue in all their
purity; then from the fusion of these three primary
colors, we have violet, Orange, green and indigo.


## p. 160 (#196) ############################################

I6O APPENDIX.
This is the order in which the seven colors of the
rainbow appear to us:
Violet (red), orange (yellow), green (b/ue), indigo.
Orange is composed of yellow and red. Yellow
mixed with blue, produces green. Blue when satu-
rated, becomes indigo. Upon closer investigation,
we may easily find the nine shades which correspond
perfectly to the nine operations of our faculties, and
to the nine functions of angelic minds.
By complicating and blending the mixture of
these colors, we shall have all the tints that make
nature so delightful a paradise.
The seven notes of music sound in accord with
the seven colors of the rainbow. There is a broth- .
erhood between the seven notes and the seven colors.
The voice-apparatus, with that of speech and ges-
ture, is for the Orator a pallet like that upon which
the painter prepares and blends those colors which,
under the brush of a Raphael, would at Once glow
forth in a masterpiece. g
Delsarte's criterion is true; still more, it is beauti-
ful, especially so with its brilliant adornment of the
colors of the rainbow.
We verify our judgment by an explanation of the
Colored chart.
As may be seen, this chart is an exact reproduc-
tion of the criterion explained at the beginning of
this book, only we have adorned it with colors anal-
Ogous to the different states of the soul that art is
called upon to reproduce.

SYMBOLISM OF COLORS. I6 I
Beginning with the three transverse columns cor-
responding to the genus, we have painted the lower
column red, the middle column yellow, and the upper
one blue. These are the three colors that symbol-
ize the life, soul and mind, as well as the genera.
Passing to the vertical columns which correspond
to species, we have painted the first column red, the
second yellow, and the third blue, passing from left
to right. The blending of these colors produces the
variety of shades we might have in this representa-
tion.
Blue added to blue gives indigo ; blue with yellow
gives a deep green; with red, violet. Yellow passed
over to the middle column, gives bright green upon
blue; pure yellow, when passed upon yellow, and
Orange upon red.
Thus pure red will be the expression of the sen-
sitive state or the life. Orange will render soul from
life, and violet will be the symbol of mind from life.
Applying this process of examination to the two
Other columns, we shall know by one symbolic color,
what the soul wishes at the present hour, and these
same colors will, besides, serve to regulate the atti-
tude of our organs.
Honor and thanks to the genius which gives us
this criterion, where is reflected the harmony of all
worlds !

E P I L O G U E.
In this rational grammar of the art of oratory, I
have given the rules of all the fine arts. All arts
have the same principle, the same means and the
same end. They are akin, they interpenetrate, they
mutually aid and complete each other. They have
a common Scope and aim. Thus, music needs speech
and gesture. Painting and sculpture derive their
merit from the beauty of attitudes. There is no
masterpiece outside the rules here laid down.
It is not enough to know the rules of the art of
oratory. He who would become an Orator, must
make them his own. Even this is not enough for
the free movement of the agents which reveal the
mind, the soul and the life. The method must be
so familiar as to seem a second nature. Woe to the
orator if calculation and artifice be divined in his
speech ! How shun this quicksand P By labor and
exercise. The instruments and the manner of using
them are in your hands, student of oratory. Set
about your work. Practice gymnastics, but let them
be gymnastics in the service of the soul, in the serv-

ice of noble thoughts and generous sentiments—
divine gymnastics for the Service of God. &
Renew your nature. Lay aside the Swaddling-
bands of your imperfections, conform your lives to
the highest ideals of uprightness and truth. Exercise
your voice, your articulation and your gestures. If
need be, like Demosthenes, place pebbles in your
mouth ; repair like that great orator to the sea-shore,
brave the fury of the billows, accustom yourself to
the tumult and roar of assemblies. Do not fear the
fracture or dislocation of your limbs as you seek to
render them supple, to fashion them after the model,
the type you have before your eyes. Labor omnia
zyżſzczz.
In any event, be persevering. Novitiate and ap-
prenticeship in any profession, are difficult. In
every state the bitterness of trial is to be expected.
To arrive at initiation has its joys, to arrive at per-
fection is a joy supreme. Beneath the rind of this
mechanism, this play of Organs, dwells a vivifying
spirit. Beneath these tangible forms of art, the
Divine lies hidden, and will be revealed. And the
soul that has once known the Divine, feels pain no
longer, but is overwhelmed with joy.
Art is the richest gift of heaven to earth. The
true artist does not grow old; he is never too old
to feel the charm of divine beauty. The more a
soul has been deceived, the more it has been
chastened by suffering, the more susceptible it is to
the benefits of art. This is why music soothes our

sorrows and doubles our joys. Song is the treasure
of the poor.
Return, then, with renewed enthusiasm to your
work | The end is worth the pains. The human
organism is a marvelous instrument which God has
given for Our use. It is a harmonious lyre, with
nine chords, each rendering various sounds. These
three chords for the voice, and three for both
gesture and speech, have their thousand resonances
at the service of the life, the soul and the mind.
As these chords vibrate beneath your fingers, they
will give voice to the emotions of the life, to the
jubilations of the heart and the raptures of the
mind. This delightful concert will lend enchant-
ment to your passing years, throwing around them
all the attractions of the Good, the True, and the
Beautiful. .
We may well salute the three Graces and the
nine Muses as gracious emblems, but it is far
better to discern in art, the reflected image of the
triple celestial hierarchy with its nine angel cho-
1*11SCS.
Honor, then, to the fine arts Glory to eloquence
Praise to the good man who knows how to speak
well ! Blessed be the great orator Like our
tutelary angel, he will show us the path that con-
ducts or leads back to God.

THE DELSARTE SYSTEM.

ANGELIQUE ARN AUD,
(Pupil of Delsarte).
TRANSLATED BY A B B Y L. A. L. G. E. R.

## p. 171 (#207) ############################################

CHAPTER I.
THE BASES OF THE SCIENCE.
Delsarte published no book upon art. The bases
of the science which he created are contained in a
synthetical table. Other tables develop each branch
of it considered separately.
Starting from an undeniable law—that which
regulates the constitution of man,—Delsarte applies
it to aesthetics; he designates man as “the object
of art,” and groups in series the Organic agents that
co-operate in the manifestation of human thought,
sentiment and passion; declaring the purpose of
these manifestations, now become artistic, to be the
amelioration of our being by throwing into relief
and light the splendors of moral beauty and the
horrors of vice. -
Delsarte defines art in several ways. He has
been reproached for his over-amplitude of definition,
and his development of it in a sense too metaphysi-
cal for a science which he himself calls “positive.”
I give here only such definitions as seem to me
most clear and important
“Art is at once the knowledge, the possession
and the free direction of the agents by virtue of
which are revealed the life, soul and mind. It is
the appropriation of the sign to the thing. It is the

172 ARN AUD ON DELSARTE.
relation of the beauties scattered through nature to
a Superior type. It is not, therefore, the mere
imitation of nature.”
The word /ăſe, in the sense employed above, is the
equivalent of sensation, of //lysical manifestations.
Man being the object of art, it is from the work-
ing of the various faculties of the human organism
that Delsarte deduces the task , of the artist; as
from the knowledge of the essential modalities of
the ego, he deduces his law of general aesthetics.
Delsarte teaches, therefore, that man is a triplicity
of persons; that is, he contains in his indestructible
unity, three principles or aspects, which he calls
Zife, soul and mind, in other words, // ysica/, /dora!
and inſe//ec//a/ persons.
In this statement this master agrees with the
philosophers who give a triplicity of essential prin-
ciples as the base of Ontology. Pierre Leroux
names them as follows: Sensation, Sentiment, coſt-
Scious/less.
That which is personal to Delsarte is the deriva-
tion of the law of aesthetics from this conception of
being. -
The primal faculties once ascertained, he devotes
himself to an analysis of the organism ; he describes
the harmony of each of these faculties with the
apparatus which serves it as agent for manifesting
itself, and demonstrates the fitness of each organ for
the task assigned it. The master establishes that
the inflections of the voice betray more especially


## p. 173 (#209) ############################################

THE BASES OF THE SCIENCE. I 73
the sensitive nature; that gesture is the interpreter
of emotion; that articulation—a special element of
speech—is in the direct service of intelligence and
thought. He gave the name of vocal to the active
apparatus of sensation; dynamic to that of Senti-
ment; buccal to that of articulation.
From the union of the faculties and their agents
arise three modes of expression : the Zanguage of
affection, the language of ellipsis (or gesture) and
the language of //i/osophy. They respond to the
three states which Delsarte recognizes in man, and
which the artist is to translate: the sensitive Szałe,
corresponding to the Zife, the mora/ stafe, to the
soul , the inte//ectual state, to the 772.Ézzd.
But this division into three modalities or into three
states is far from giving the number of the manifes-
tations of being. Nature is not reduced to this
indigence. From the fusion of these three states,
in varying and incessant combination, and from the
predominance of one of the primitive modalities,
whether accidental or permanent, countless indivi-
dualities are formed, each with its personal constitu-
tion, its shades of difference of education, habits,
age, character, etc.
It seems at the first glance as if the mind must be
confused by these varieties, whose possible number
fades into infinity; but the teacher does not open
this labyrinth to his disciples without providing them
with i.
Independently of these modalities, of these states,


## p. 174 (#210) ############################################

I 74 ARN AUD ON DELSARTE.
which form the basis of the system, Delsarte traces
triune subdivisions, which serve as a point of Con-
vergence; thus the intermediary rays of the compass
or mariner's card are multiplied, and receive special
names, without ceasing to belong to one of the four
cardinal points.
Whatever, for instance, may be the tendency of
the individual whom we desire to portray, or to
represent by any art whatsoever, we can think of
him in his normal state, as well as in a concentric or
eccentric state : this is a first distinction.
Each of these states is itself subject to shades
of difference, to modifications. The normal state
of a diplomat and that of an artist could not be the
same. The one, by the very effect of his profes-
sion, will incline to concentration ; the other will
tend to expansion, if not to eccentration. Hence a
simple normal state which is the most common; a
normal-concentric state, a normal-eccentric state :
here we have a second distinction.
Delsarte, in order to avoid confusion between the
word state applied to primordial modalities—which
he defines as sensitive, ſ/zora/ and 272/e//cc//a/ states,
—often uses the word element in place of that of
state in speaking of concentration, eccentration and
ſtormality, which, in this case, he also calls ca/7/2 ;
but, in teaching, he was always accustomed to use
these more exact terms: normal state, concentric
state, eccentric state.
These differences may occur in regard to each of


## p. 175 (#211) ############################################

THE BASES OF THE SCIENCE. I 75
the other terms. Thus we may have the simple
concentric state, the concentro-concentric state, etc.
It is upon this mutual interpenetration of the
various states in the triple unity, that the master
founds the idea which dominates and pervades his
whole system ; the three isolated and independent
terms do not, to his thinking, constitute the integral-
ity of the human ego. To constitute, according to
Delsarte's theory, three, the vital number, it must,
by its very essence, and by inherent force, raise itself
to its multiple nine. This is what the master calls
the minefold accord. e
Medicine—a science which also derives its justifi-
cation from the human organism—from certain
points of view affords us analogies to this mixture
of primordial components; for example, nervous
and sanguine temperaments which are blended in
the Sanguo-nervous, etc.
If we refer to our own faculties, does it not strike
us indeed, that neither life—nor sensation—nor senti-
ment, nor intellect can manifest itself without the
aid of its congeners or co-associates?
Is intelligence evident elsewhere than in a sensi-
tive being (life) P And even when considering the
most abstract things, does it not bear witness of its
taste, its power of choice (sentiment) P Can senti-
ment be absolutely disengaged from impression
(life) P And if it is not always under the sway of the
idea, is it not certain that it gives rise to it, by pro-
voking observation and reflection (intellect) P


## p. 176 (#212) ############################################

176 ARN AUD ON DELSARTE.
Finally, can an adult—save in the case of absolute
idiocy—exist by sensitive life alone outside of all
sentiment and all thought (soul, intellect) P
It is by the harmony of the modalities among
themselves, and the contribution of each to the
unity, that every individual type is formed. Del-
Sarte thought that he could fix their numerical
Scale; but he was not permitted to carry his scien-
tific studies thus far; still, it is not indispensable to
art, which demands above all things very marked
types, that verification should be carried to its
farthest limits. It will not be difficult, guided by
the knowledge which Delsarte has left us, to
classify artistic personages as physical, intellectual
and moral or sentimental types; and, in the same
category, to differentiate those belonging to the
concentric state from those falling more particularly
into the eccentric or normal states: the Don Juans,
Othellos, Counts Ory, etc. Delsarte, in practice,
excelled in characterizing these shades of difference.
These prolegomena would not perhaps alone
suffice to give this teacher a claim to the title of
creator of a science. Although they give the theory
of the system, they are far from containing all its
developments. But Delsarte did not stop here.
In appropriate language—wherein new words are
not lacking for the new science—he takes apart
each of the agents of the organism, enumerated
above; he examines them in their details, and
assigns them their part in the sensitive, moral, or

intellectual transmission with which they are charged.
Thus gesture—the interpreter of sentiment—is pro-
duced by means of the head, torso and limbs; and
in the functions of the head are comprised the
physiognomic movements, also classified and de-
scribed, with their proper significance, such as anger,
hate, contemplation, etc., and the same with the
Other agents.
Each part observed gives rise to a special chart,
where we see, for instance, what should be the posi-
tion of the eye in exaltation, aversion, intense appli-
cation of the mind, astonishment, etc. The same
labor is given to the arms, the hands and the atti-
tudes of the body, with the mark, borrowed from
nature, of the slightest movement, partial or total,
corresponding to the sensation, the sentiment, the
Jught that the artist wishes to express.

expansion of art, do but enlarge its horizons, and
prepare a broader field for its harmonies. They
leave freedom to the opinions most difficult of
seizure, the most unforeseen creations; because, re-
sponding to every faculty of being, this science,
while it corrects imagination, respects its legitimate
power.
Finally, what is this science which analyzes every
spring and every part brought to play in the mani-
festation of life? A compass to guide us to the
desired goal; a measure of proportion to fix each
variety in the immensity of types; a touchstone by
which to judge of each man's vocation.

prises and subjugates us in these privileged persons is
the secret of nature; it is not to be written down,
not to be demonstrated; this unknown quantity, this
mystery, reveals itself at its own time by flashes,
and with different degrees of intensity during the
career of the same artist. Some have thought to
explain the prodigy by that superior instinct known
as intuition; but the discovery of the word does not
open the arcanum.

science created by Delsarte, to put upon the track
such minds as are apt for the subject, and endowed
with sufficient penetration to assimilate it; but it
must not be disguised that even should the whole
work be collected together, the science must still
await its examination, its verification and its Com-
plements; for a science at its birth is like a pro-
gram given out for the study of present and future
generations. Delsarte was still working on his to
the last years of his life. Every day he gained fresh
insight; he added branches and accessories. Yet
the criticisms of details which will come later—even
when they are justified,—will not rob the inventor
of the glory of his scientific discovery. Let genius

CHAPTER II.
THE METHOD.
I have shown Delsarte as a composer, as pre-emi-
nently an artist, who, as a certain critic says, “was
never surpassed; ” I have insisted upon the two
titles which form his special glory: that of revealer
of the laws of aesthetics, and that of creator of a
science to support his discoveries; a science whose
application relates particularly to the dramatic and
lyric arts, although at its base, and especially when
considered as law, it embraces all the liberal arts.
It remains for me to speak of his method, properly
so called; of his precepts, his maxims, his opinions
and his judgments; of that, in a word, which con-
stitutes the personal manner of each master, and
his mode of instruction; for if the law is single in
its essential and constitutive ideas, it radiates into
diversity in its individual manifestations; it has inft-
mite possibilities. *.
Delsarte considered art as the surest, purest and
most constant good in life. He required much time
to complete the education of a pupil, because he
knew how long it had taken him to master the
methods of translating, through that noble interpre-
ter, art, the best and most sublime possibilities of
the human soul; and because he knew as well all

that is inherent in our nature of vice and imperfec-
tion. He held that the truth, be it good or bad, is
always instructive.
In regard to truth he says: “A man may possess
remarkable qualities, may have grace, expression,
charm and elegance, but they are all as nothing if
he does not interpret the truth.” He desired the
artist to study beauty in every form, to seek and dis-
cover its secrets. He tells us that he himself
studied the poses of the statues of antiquity for fif-
teen years. -
It was in consequence of this period of study,
assuredly, that the master condemned the parallel
movement of the limbs in gesture, and recommended
attitudes which he called inverse, if, for instance,
the actor leans on his left leg, the corresponding
gesture must necessarily be entrusted to the right
a1 II]. 3.
The master taught that the gesture—the true
interpreter of the sentiment—should precede the
word. He added: “The word is but an echo, the
thought made external and visible, the ambassador
of intelligence. Every energetic passion, every
deep sentiment, is accordingly announced by a sign
of the head, the hand or the eye, before the word
expresses it.” Thus, the actor and the orator, if
they do not conform to this precept, have failed to
attain to art.
Delsarte proves his assertion by giving examples,
somewhat overdrawn, in a sense the inverse of this

theory. Nothing was more amusing than to see
him execute one of these dilatory gestures; for
instance, this phrase, uttered by the lackey of some
comedy, delivering a message: “'Sir, here is a letter
which I was told to deliver to you at once.” The
hand extending the note unseasonably, produced so
ridiculous an effect that the heartiest laughter never
failed to follow.
On E//ipsis.
The preceding steps lead us to ellipsis, which plays
an important part in the method of Delsarte.
All the thoughts and sentiments contained in lit-
erature, in one comprehensive word, are entrusted
to the mimic art of the actor, whose essential agent
is gesture. The conjunction and interſection are
alike elliptical; thus in the phrase: “Ah! ” “
how unhappy I am | * * * “‘Ah !” should imply
a painful situation before the explanatory phrase
begins. In his course of applied asthetics, Delsarte
gives us the striking effects of the elliptic conjunc-
tion.
On Shades and Inflections.
The shade, that exquisite portion of art, which is
rather felt than expressed, is the characteristic sign
of the perfection of talent; it forms a part of the
personality of the artist. You may have heard a
play twenty times with indifference, or a melody as
often, only to be bored by it; some fine day a great
actor relieves the drama of its chill, its apparent

nullity; the commonplace melody takes to itself
wings beneath the magic of a well-trained, expres-
sive and sympathetic voice. Delsarte possessed this
artistic talent to a Supreme degree, and it was one
of the remarkable parts of his instruction; he had
established typical phrases, where the mere shade
of inflection gave an appropriate meaning to every
variety of impression and sentiment which can pos-
sibly be expressed by any one set of words. One
of these phrases was this: “That is a pretty dog l’”
A very talented young girl succeeded in giving to
these words a great number of different modulations,
expressing endearment, coaxing, admiration, ironi-
cal praise, pity and affection. Delsarte, with his far-
reaching comprehension, conceived of more than
6OO ways of differentiating these examples; but he
stopped midway in the execution of them, and cer-
tainly no one else will ever pursue this outline to its
farthest limits.
The second phrase was: “I did not tell you that
I would not | *
This time the words were given as a study for
adults; they lent themselves to other sentiments;
they revealed, as the case might be, indifference,
reproach, encouragement, the hesitation of a troubled
soul, etc.
It was by means of these manifold shades that
the artist-professor established characteristic differ-
ences in parts wherein so many actors had seen but
the identical fact of a similar passion or a similar

vice. To his mind, all misers were not the same
miser, nor all seducers the same seducer. In sing-
ing particularly, with what art Delsarte used the in-
flection
Ozz Vocal Music.
In regard to lyric art especially, Delsarte had his
peculiar and personal theories. Singing was not to
him merely a means of displaying the singer's voice
or person; it was a Superior language, charged
with the rendition, in its individual charm, of all the
greatest creations of literature and poetry; all the
sweet, tender, or cruel sentiments possible to hu-
manity.
This exceptional singer attained his effects partly
by means of certain modifications of the rhythm,
which caused inattentive critics to say: “Delsarte
does not observe the measure.” What they them-
selves failed to note, was that the first beat was
always given firmly ; and that it was in the divisions of
one measure, and by subtle compensations, that he
made the difference. Far from having cause for com-
plaint, the composer gained thereby, a more clear
expression of his thought, a more persuasive expan-
sion of his sentiment, and the respiration appeared
more easy. It was something similar—with a greater
value—to that personal punctuation with which skil-
ful readers often divide the text which they translate.
It was particularly in recitative, the style, more-
over, least subject to precise laws, that Delsarte

used this license; and it was in this stylé that he
especially excelled.
And is it not in what remains unwritten that the
singer's true greatness is revealed? What dilettante
has not felt the power of a more incisive attack of
the note; of that prolongation of the note, held
imperceptibly, which, having captured it, holds the
attention of the listener?
But, to hear these things, it is not necessary, as
the saying is, “to bestride technique.” In so far as
the training of the voice is concerned, Delsarte gave
himself a scientific basis. He was the first to think
that it would be well to know the mechanism of the
organ, that it might be used to the best advantage,
both by avoiding injurious methods of exercising it,
and by aiding the development of the tone by ap-
propriate work.
In his rooms were to be seen imitations of the
larynx—in pasteboard—of various sizes. His pu-
pils, it seems to me, could profit but little by these
far from pleasing sights. At the utmost it increased
their confidence in the man who desired an inti-
mate acquaintance with everything relating to the
art which he taught. It is to teachers particularly
that the introduction of this auxiliary into the study
of the vocal mechanism may have been of some
value. I have lately learned that several singing
teachers use these artificial larynxes. Can priority
be claimed for Delsarte P I can only affirm that he

refers to them in a treatise signed by himself, and
dated in the year 183 I.
I shall not enter into the details of this contin-
gent side of the method; the statement of the facts
is enough to lead all those who are interested, to
devote thought and study to the matter. I prefer
to dwell upon the things which Delsarte carried
with him into the grave, having written them only
On the memories of certain adepts destined to dis-
appear soon after him.
On A'espiration.
Delsarte established his theory of diaphragmatic
&reaſ/king in accordance with his anatomical knowl-
edge. It consists in restoring the breath, without
effort, from the commencing lift of the diaphragm to
the production of the tone. He opposed it to the cos-
fa/ breathing, which brings the lungs suddenly into
action by movements of the chest and shoulders, and
causes extreme fatigue. “The chest,” he says,
“should be a passive agent; the larynx and mouth,
aiding the diaphragm, alone have a right to act in
breathing; the action of the larynx consists of a
depression, that of the mouth should produce the
canalization (concavity) of the tongue and the ele-
vation of the veil of the palate.”
To this first idea is attached what the master
taught in regard to the distinction between vital
breath and artificia/ breaſ/º. It is certain that
one may sing with the natural respiration ; but it is

rapidly exhausted if not augmented by additional
inhalation; for it results in dryness and breathless-
ness, which cause suffering alike to singer and
listener. The artificial breath, on the contrary, pre-
serves the ease and freshness of the voice.
On the Position of the Zone.
The placing of the tone was one of Delsarte's
great anxieties. According to his theory, the attack
should be produced by explosion. He rejected that
stress which induces the squeezing out of the
tone after it is produced. The way to avoid it is to
prepare rapidly and in anticipation of the emission
of the note. +.
These ideas demand oral elucidation; but it is
enough to declare them, for teachers and singers to
recognize their meaning.
On the Preparation of the Initial Consonant.
The preceding lines refer to vocalization; but
Delsarte applied the same process to pronunciation.
He directed that the initial consonant should be pre-
pared in the same way as the attack on the tone; it
was thus produced distinctly and powerfully, that
is, in less appreciable extenſ of time. Such is the
Concentration of the archer preparing to launch an
arrow ; of the runner about to leap a ditch. The
master in no case permitted that annoying compass
of the voice before a consonant, so frequently
employed by ordinary singers. The Italians justly

translate this disagreeable performance by the word
strascinato (dragged out or prolonged).
Fatercises.
Delsarte has been severely blamed for the way in
which he trained the voice. I have nothing to say
in regard to those who imputed to him physical and
barbarous methods of developing it; but it may be
true that he endangered it by certain exercises or
by failure to cultivate the mechanism. I do not
feel myself competent to pronounce upon this tech-
nical point, but I can give an exact account of what
was done in his school.
Delsarte directed that the tones should be swelled
on a single note, E flat (of the medium); he
claimed that by strengthening this intermediary note
the ascending and descending scales were sympa-
thetically strengthened. He thus avoided, as he
said, breaking the high treble notes by exercises
which would render the cords too severely tense,
convinced morever, that at a given moment a burst
of enthusiasm and will-power would take the place
of assiduous practice.
He also taught that this special exercise of the
medium would prevent the separation of the regis-
ters, that phylloxera of the vocal organ, which
wrecks So many singers, and causes them so many
Sorrows. This was the way to gain that mixed voice,
the ideal held up to the scholars as being the most
impressive and the most exquisite; that which at

the same time ravished the ear and charmed the
heart.
This master considered the chest-voice as more
particularly physical; and the head-voice, it must
be confessed, is too much like the voice of a bird,
to awaken sentiment and Sympathy.
Delsarte himself possessed this mixed voice; in
him, it seemed to start from the heart, and brought
tears to eyes which had never known them. The
power of that tone—allied to the perfection of shad-
ing, diction and lyric declamation—caused every
listening soul to vibrate with latent emotion which
might never have been waked to life save by that
appeal.
I return to the practice of swelled tones upon the
note E flat. This note certainly acquired broad and
powerful tones about which there was nothing forced,
and which were most agreeable. This develop-
ment was communicated to the neighboring notes.
But did not these advantages take from the compass
of the scale P If so, were they a counterbalance to
the injury? I repeat that I dare not affirm anything
in this respect.
Delsarte, assuredly, did not give as much space
to vocalization as other teachers, especially those of
the Italian school.
It is also undeniable, that dramatic singing—
the style which he preferred—is dangerous to the
vocal Organism; particularly when one practices the

shriek or scream, which produces a fine effect when
skilfully employed, but is most pernicious in excess.
Delsarte was too conscientious an artist not to
Sacrifice his voice, at certain moments, to his pa-
thetic effects; but he was very careful to warn his
scholars against the abuse of this method; he di-
rected them to use it but very rarely, and with the
greatest precaution.
I should also say, in his favor, that light voices
were very differently trained from heavy ones.
Madame Carvalho, who began her studies in his
school, did not alter the flexible but feeble Organ she
brought there. Mlle. Chaudesaigues and Mlle. Jacob,
under Delsarte's tuition, attained to marvels of flex-
ibility, without losing any of their natural gifts.
Appoggiatura.
Delsarte brought about a revolution in French
music in everything relating to appoggiatura, or
rather, he restored its primitive meaning. The way
in which he interpreted it has created a school.
He taught that the root of the word—appoggiatura
—being appuyer (to sustain), the chief importance
should be given in the phrase, to appoggiatura, by
extent and expression; the more so that this note
is generally placed on a dissonance; and, according
to this master's system, it is on the dissonance—
and not at random and very frequently, as is the
habit of many singers—that the powerful effect of
the vibration of sound should be produced.


## p. 191 (#227) ############################################

THE METHOD. I9 I
Contrary to this opinion, the appoggiatura was for
a long time used in France as a short and rapid
passing note; it thus gave the music a vivacious char-
acter, wholly discordant with the style of serious Com-
positions; the music of Gluck was particularly
unsuited to it.
Roulade and Martellato.
In every school of singing the roulade is effected
by means of the staccato and legato. Delsarte had
a marked prejudice in favor of the martellato, which
partakes of both. He compared it, in his pictur-
esque way of expressing his ideas, to pearls united
by an invisible thread.
A rozzzzzzciation.
The master's pronunciation was irreproachable;
not the slightest trace of a provincial accent; never
the least error of intonation, the smallest mistake in
regard to a long or short syllable. What is perhaps
rarer than may be thought, he possessed, in its abso-
lute purity, the prosody of his native language, alike
in lyric declamation and in the camzabile. His pene-
trating tones added another charm to the many
merits which he had acquired by study.
Pronunciation, therefore, was skilfully and care-
fully taught in Delsarte's school. The professor's
first care was to correct any tendency to lisp, which
he did by temporarily substituting the syllables
te, de, over and over again, for the faulty R. This


## p. 192 (#228) ############################################

I92 ARN AUD ON DELSARTE.
substitution brought the organ back to the requisite
position for the vibration of the R.
This process is now in common use; but I can-
not say whether it was employed before Delsarte's
day. He obtained very happy results from it.
A mute before a Consonant.
Delsarte did not allow that absolute suppression
of the E mute before a consonant, which seems to
prevail at present, and which produces so bad an
effect in delivery. As the evil, at the time of which
I speak, was yet comparatively unknown, he did not
make it a case of conscience; but if he never lent
himself to this ellipsis, he, “the lyric Talma,” “the
y
exquisite singer,” as he has frequently been called,
should we not regard his abstinence as a condemna-
tion from which there is no appeal? I do not
believe, moreover, that either Nourrit or Dupré
authorized by their example a habit so contrary to
the rules of French versification, so disagreeable
to the well-trained ear and so opposed to good taste.
Such young singers as have yielded to it, have only
to listen to themselves for one moment to abandon
it forever.
It is certain that E mute can in no instance be
assimilated to the accented E ; but to suppress it
entirely, is to break the symmetry of the verse, to
put the measure out of time. It is unmistakable
that the weakness of the vowel, or mute syllable,
concerns the sound, not the duration. Let it die


## p. 193 (#229) ############################################

THE METHOD. I93
away gently; but for Heaven's sake, do not murder
it! Voltaire wrote: “You reproach us with our E
mute, as a Sad, dull sound that dies on our lips, but
in this very E mute lies the great harmony of our
prose and verse.” Littré recognizes two forms of
the E mute: the E mute, faintly articulated as in
' and the E mute sounded as in me, ce, le;
but he does not allude to an E which is entirely
null.
Once more, then, that there may be no misunder-
standing, let me say that the word matte added to the
E, has but a relative sense, in view of the two vowels
“ &772e,”
of the same name and marked with an acute or a
grave accent.
One fact throws light on the question: did any
author ever make a character above the rank of a
peasant or a lackey, say:
‘‘J’aime’ benz Zāseţá'
J’crois qu’ell” m'en veut?”
Take an example from Voltaire (tragedy of the
Death of Caesar): “Voilà vos successeurs, Horace,
Décius.” Evidently, if the E mute had not been
counted, the second hemistich of the Alexandrine
verse would have had but five syllables instead of
six.
Would any one like to know how the heresiarchs
of the E mute would manage?
In this instance they would repeat the A of the
penultimate, aspirating it and pronouncing thus:
“ Vož/d vos successeurs, Hora . . . as', Décius.”


## p. 194 (#230) ############################################

I94 ARN AUD ON DELSARTE.
In this way they would have the requisite number
of syllables; but they would be wholly at odds with
the dictionary of the good actors of the Théâtre
Français. .
This falsification is especially common in singing,
though it is no less revolting in that field of art.
How often at concerts—the force of tradition saves
us at the theatre—do we hear even artists of great
reputation pronounce:
“Que/your prosp? . . er' plus de mystè . . er,” in-
stead of: “Que/your prospere p/us de mystère.” And,
in one of the choruses of the opera “Za Reine de
Chypre”:
“Jamais, jamais en Zºran . . . anç’
Jamais /'Anglais me régmera /*
Instead of: *A
“Jamais, jamais enz F. ance,
Jamzais /'Anglais me régizera /?”
This anomaly is most offensive in the final syl-
lable of a verse, because there the measure is more
impaired than ever, and in this way that alternation
of male and female rhymes is suppressed, which
produces so flowing and graceful a cadence in
French verse
A. mute before a Vozve/.
The encounter of E mute in a final syllable, with
the initial vowel of the word which follows it, makes
the defect more apparent and accordingly easier to
fight against.
Delsarte's process was as follows: When a silent

THE METHOD, I95
syllable is immediately followed by a word begin-
ning with another vowel, the E mute (by a pro-
longation of the sound of the penultimate) is
Suppressed with the next letter. Thus in the aria
of Joseph (opera by Méhul):
“Loín de vous a langui ma ſeame . . serilee, ” and
in Count Ory : “Salut, Ó vénéra . . . blermite.”
In these cases, by an unfortunate spirit of com-
pensation, the abettors of the innovation, suppress-
ing the grammatical elision, sing thus:
“Zoizz de voic: a langzei ma jeune . . . ess’exiſée-”
“Sa/att, 6 vénéra . . . a6/’erm? . . . if/?”
Littré's Dictionary gives us the same pronuncia-
tion as Delsarte; and his written demonstration is even
more positive. We find favorables auspices, arðres
abattus, written in this way: “fa-vo–ra—ble—g—auspi-
ces, aröre—g—abattus.”
It is, however, very difficult to express these dif-
ferences exactly, in type: what Littré expresses
7-adically by typographic characters, is blended with
most natural delicacy by the voice of a singer.
Thus, according to Delsarte, the E mute of a final
syllable should be suppressed before a vowel, on
condition of a prolongation of the sound, in har-
mony with the penultimate syllable.
According to Delsarte again, according to Vol-
taire, according to Littré, the E mute is weakened,
more or less, but never completely suppressed, be-
fore a consonant. :-

these matters, whose books are in the hands of the
whole world, has never entered into this leftricidal
Conspiracy.
I hope to be pardoned this long digression, think-
ing it my duty to protest against such a ludicrous
method of treating French prosody; I do so both
in the name of aesthetics and as a part of my task as
biographer of Delsarte.*
*Notes taken by his pupils, during the latter years of his lessons prove that the
master touched upon this question. I do not copy them because, being somewhat
confused, they might give rise to misunderstandings; neither do they in any way con-
tradict anything that I have said above; they confirm, on the contrary, what remains
in my memory of the interpretation of Delsarte, who never belied himself.

CHAPTER III.
WAS DELSARTE A PHILOSOPHER P
If we consider philosophy in the light of all the
questions upon which it touches, the subjects which
it embraces, we must answer “No ; ” but if we con-
centrate the word within the limits of aesthetics, we
may reply in the affirmative. Did not Delsarte point
out the Origin of art, its object and its aim P
Not that this master never exceeded the limits of
his Science and his method. He had sketched out
a “Treatise on Reason,” and had begun to classify
the faculties of being, entering into the subject more
profoundly than the categories of Kant; but all this
only exists in mere outline, in a technology whose
terms have not been weighed and connected to-
gether by a solid chain of reasoning: logic has
not uttered its final word therein.
A separate volume would be required to give an
idea of these gigantic sketches, which must remain
in their rudimentary state.
If Delsarte had finished his work, it would seem that
he must have leaned toward the scholastic method,
now so much out of favor; but certainly he would put
his own personality into this, as into everything that
he undertook to investigate; for he was held back on
the steeps of mysticism by the science which he had

created, and which could only afford a shelter to the
supernatural as an extension of those psychical
faculties which have been called intuition, imagina-
tion, etc.
Then the influence of Raymond Brucker, who
died shortly after Delsarte, being lessened, and con-
scientious and patient study having fed the flame in
that vast brain, we might have obtained affirmations
of a new order. And Delsarte might have met with
thinkers like Leibnitz, Descartes and Jean Reynaud,
on that height where religion is purged of Super-
stition and fanaticism, philosophy set free from
atheism and materialism
If Delsarte had a fault, it was that he regarded
all modern philosophy as sensuous naturalism; and
if reason sometimes seemed to him suspicious,
it was because he often confounded it with Sophistry,
which reasons indeed, but is far from being reason.
Let us regret that Delsarte never finished his com-
plete philosophy; but let us be grateful to him for
having raised his art and all arts to the level of
philosophy, by giving them truth as a basis and
morality as a final aim ; which fairly justifies, it
seems to me, the title of artist-philosopher, which I
have sometimes applied to him.
I should not neglect, in this connection, to set
down the explanation, given by Delsarte, of what
he meant by the word trinity, as used in his scien-
tific system. The reader cannot fail to see the ele-

ments of a system of philosophy in this succinct
statement, this outline to be filled up :
“The principle of the system lies in the statement
that there is in the world a universal formula which
may be applied to all Sciences, to all things possible:
—this formula is the trinity.
“What is requisite for the formation of a trinity?
“Three expressions are requisite, each presuppos-
ing and implying the other two. Each of three
terms must imply the other two. There must also
be an absolute co-necessity between them ; thus, the
three principles of our being—life, mind and soul—
form a trinity.
“Why?
“Because life and mind are one and the same soul;
soul and mind are one and the same life; life and
Soul are one and the same mind.”

CHAPTER IV.
COURSE OF APPLIED AESTHETICS.
Meeting of the Circle of Zearned Societies.
Independently of its method, which was especially
applicable to dramatic and lyric arts, Delsarte's doc-
trine, as we have seen, drew from the primordial
sources, which are the law of things, the principles
of all poetry, all art and all science. The intense
light which he brought thence was too dazzling for
young scholars, whose minds were rarely prepared
by previous education. It, nevertheless, overflowed
into the daily lessons, and gave them that peculiar
and somewhat singular aspect, which acted even
upon those whose intelligence could not cope with
it. Such is the mysterious magic of things which
penetrate before they convince.
But these lofty problems demanded an audience
in harmony with their elevation. Delsarte soon
attracted such. Under the title “Course of Applied
AEsthetics,” he collected in various places, notably
at the “Circle of Learned Societies,” profane and
sacred orators, and learned men of all sorts. There
he could develop points of view as new as they
seemed to be strikingly true. It was on leaving one
of these meetings, that a distinguished painter thus
expressed his enthusiasm : “I have learned so much

to-day, and it is all so simple and so true, that I am
amazed that I never thought of it before.”
The Course of Applied AEsthetics was addressed
to painters, sculptors, orators, as well as to musicians,
both performers and composers; and was finally
extended to literary men. This audience of Schol-
ars was no less astonished and enchanted than
others had been.
Theory of the Degrees.
The theory of degrees was largely developed at
these meetings, and I have purposely delayed it till
this chapter. To understand this theory—one of
the most striking points in Delsarte's method, and
original with him, one should have some idea of
the grammar which he composed for the use of his
pupils.
I will not say that this treatise was complete in
the sense usually attached to the word grammar.
There is no mention of orthography or of lexicol-
ogy; but all that is the very essence of language,
that from which no language, no idiom can escape—
the constituent parts of speech—are examined and
investigated from a philosophic and psychologic
point of view. Just as the author examined the
constituent modalities of our being in the light of
aesthetics, he seized the affinities between the laws
of speech, as far as regards the voice—logos—and
the moral manifestations of art.
This production of Delsarte has undergone the

fate of almost all his works—it has not been printed.
Indeed, I greatly fear that all his notes on the sub-
ject can never be collected; nevertheless that which
has been gathered together presents a certain devel-
opment. I will not enter into the purely metaphysi-
cal part, limiting myself, as I have done from the
beginning of this study, to making known the con-
ceptions of Delsarte only in so far as they refer to
the special field of aesthetics.
In this category, we find the following definitions
which serve to classify the quantitative values or
degrees: that is the extent assigned to each articu-
lation or vocal emission to enable it to express the
thoughts, sentiments and sensations of our being in
their truth and proportionate intensity:
I. Substantive is the name given to a group of
appearances, to a totality of attributes.
2. Adjective expresses ideas, simple, abstract,
general and modicative; it is an abstraction in the
substantive.
3. Verb is the word that affirms the existence and
the co-existence between the being existing and its
manner of existing: that is to say it connects the
subject with the attribute. The verb is not a sign
of action, but of affirmation and existence.
4. The participle alone is a sign of action.
5, 6, 7. The article, pronouze and preposition fit
into the common definitions.
8. The adverb is the adjective of the adjective
and of the participle (in so far as it is an attribute

of the verb); it modifies them both, and is not
modifiable by either of them; it is a sign of pro-
portion, an intellectual compass.
9. The conjunction has the same function as the
preposition: it unites one object to another object;
but it differs from it, inasmuch as the preposition
has but a single word for its antecedent, and a single
word for its objective case, while the conjunction
has an entire phrase for antecedent, and the same
for complement. It characterizes the point of view
under the sway of which the relations should be re-
garded : restrictive, as but , hypothetical or condi-
tional, as if? conclusive, as then, etc., etc. The
conjunction presents a general view to our thought,
it is the reunion of scattered facts; it is essentially
elliptical.
IO. The interſection responds to those circum-
stances where the soul, moved and shaken by a
crowd of emotions at once, feels that by uttering a
phrase it would be far from expressing what it
experiences. It then exhales a sound, and confides
to gesture the transmission of its emotion.
The interjection is essentially elliptical, because,
expressing nothing in itself, it expresses at the time
all that the gesture desires it to express, for ellipsis
is a hidden sense, the revelation of which belongs
exclusively to gesture.
It must first be noted that these degrees are num-
bered from one to nine, and that, of all the grammati-

cal values defined, the conjunction, interjection and
adverb are classed highest.
Delsarte made the following experiment one day
in the “Circle of Learned Societies,” during a lec-
ture :
“Which word,” he asked his audience, “requires
most emphasis in the lines—
“The wave draws near, it breaks, and vomits up before our eyes,
Amid the surging foam, a monster huge of size 2 ”
The absence of any rule applicable to the subject
caused the most complete anarchy among the listen-
ers. One thought that the word to be emphasized
must be monster—as indicating an object of terror;
another gave the preference to the adjective huge.
Still another thought that vomits demanded the
most expressive accent, from the ugliness of that
which it expresses.
Delsarte repeated the lines:
“The wave draws near, it breaks, and . . vomits up before our eyes.”
It was on the word and that he concentrated all the
force of his accent; but giving it, by gesture, voice
and facial expression, all the significance lacking
to that particle, colorless in itself, as he pronounced
the word, the fixity of his gaze, his trembling hands,
his body shrinking back into itself, while his feet
seemed riveted to the earth, all presaged some-
thing terrible and frightful. He saw what he was
about to relate, he made you see it; the conjunc-
tion, aided by the actor's pantomime, opened infinite
perspectives to the imagination; his words had

only to specify the fact, and to justify the emotion
which had accumulated in the interval.
But this particle, which here allows of eight de-
grees, is much diminished when it fills the office of
a simple copulative. The extent of the word or
the syllable is always subordinate to the sense of
the phrase; in the latter case it does not require
more than the figure 2.

CHAPTER V .
THE RECITATION OF FABLES.
Some years before his death Delsarte substituted
for his concerts, lectures in which he explained his
scientific doctrines and his philosophy of art. He
also supplied the place of song by the recitation of
certain fables selected from La Fontaine. He was
not less perfect in this style than in the interpreta-
tion of the great rôles of tragedy and grand lyric
poems; but it must be acknowledged, that under
this new guise, his talent could not display itself in
all its amplitude; save for the facial expression
which gave the lessons of the apologue a variety of
outline of which La Fontaine himself perhaps never
dreamed . . . . and in spite of the fine and Scholarly
accent which he could give to all those clever beasts,
he was, on many points, deprived of his power and
his prestige: how endow, a lion with the proud
poses of Achilles; and lend the foolish grasshopper
the satanic charm of Armida? -
Instead of noble or terrific attitudes, his gesture
was confined to a few movements of forearm or
hand; of his fingers, when the intentions were more
subtle, more refined . . . . Still it was always most
pleasant to hear him. It was Delsarte restrained,
but not diminished. If you did not recover in his
speaking voice that sort of enchantment with which

THE RECITATION OF FABLES. 2O7
his slightly-veiled tone pierced the soul, his accent
remained so pure, so intelligent, that you were none
the less ravished. -
When, in the fable of The Two Pigeons, he said:
“Absence is the greatest of ills, . .
Not so for you, cruel one!”
He discovered shades, hitherto unknown, with
which to paint reproach mingled with grief. And
when he said:
“The ant . . . is not a lender/. . .
A more affirmative and striking sense of the char-
acter attributed to our thrifty friend, was detached
from this delay, filled up by a negative movement of
the narrator's head.
If Delsarte had limited himself in his lectures, to
teaching men by means of the menagerie, which was
a sly burlesque of the courtiers of Louis XIV.,
perhaps he might have made idolatrous partisans
there as elsewhere; but it seems as if in the expo-
sition of his theory, he posed rather as a censor
than a teacher; he delighted in baffling the mind
by paradoxes. By annexes Superimposed and ill-
blended with his system, he sometimes compromised
those scientific truths whose splendor bursts forth
when they are freed from heterogeneous accessories.
We cannot otherwise explain the resistance of cer-
tain minds, distinguished otherwise, to the recogni-
tion in him of the artist who excited the enthusiasm
of all the most competent critics and brilliant
amateurs.

CHAPTER VI.
THE LAW OF AFSTHETICS.
However striking and superior the system of
François Delsarte has been shown to be, however
admirable and attractive the manifestation of art in
his person, — herein lie not his first rights to the
grateful sympathy which we owe to his memory.
His works and discoveries in aesthetics are a benefit
of general interest, while they disclose to us the
fruitful resources of his genius.
In the first place, what is a law? We have here to
deal, not with the legislation decreed by man for the
regulation of Social and political relations, but with
those laws deduced from a natural order, as the
principle of life itself, which govern the relations of
beings and of things. In religion these laws are its
dogmas and mysteries ; philosophically speaking,
the laws of things are the essentials of their nature,
their specific relations. -
Voltaire has written: “Law is the instinct by
which we feel justice.” In Littré's Dictionary we
find stated that “ laws are conditions imposed by
circumstances.” Another has said: “The constant,
uneludable succession in which phenomena occur,
takes the name of law.”
I would here state, that in no one of the last three
citations does the word “law " seem to me to be

THE LAW OF AESTHETICS. 2O9
precisely defined. From the different explanations
of the natural laws which I have been able to Com-
pare, I conclude that laws are forces containing in
themselves the reasons, to us unknown, of a power
and permanence which are unchangeable. Plato
named them ideas. We must now conclude that the
nature of a law, in the present acceptation of the
term, can be but imperfectly interpreted by exact
formulae. Laws are still much involved in the secrets
of creation. Here must we seek their origin or
Origins. •
But courage still ! Although these formulae but
imperfectly define law, the facts suffice to establish
them. They (facts) show the certain action and, as
stated heretofore, the uneludable nature of these
formulae.
But the discovery of Delsarte is the application
to aesthetics of a natural law, proven and established
by science. This law is that which governs the
system of man's Organism. Its present application
is justified by a series of scientifically coördinated
facts. Delsarte rests upon the principle that man is
the object of art. Thus the artist should aim to
manifest humaze ſtature in its three modalities, in its
three phases which the master named /ife, soul and
ſmind. In other words, the beings physical, moral
and mental.
These three expressions figure in the work of
Pierre Leroux (De l'Humanité) in the following
equivalent terms: sensation, sentiment, knowledge.
I 4


## p. 210 (#246) ############################################

2 IO ARN AUD ON DELSARTE.
But Leroux applied to ethics this law of human
organism, whereas Delsarte derived from it the law
of aesthetics. When two minds of this stamp are
thus led, each in his own way, to the same source of
analogous principles differently applied, is it not a
proof that they have stated truth? And in this case
it is more than presumable that the two men of
whom I speak had never worked together. Delsarte
was a philosopher in spite of himself. With Pierre
Leroux art was only an element contingent upon a
system which he elaborated.
Was Delsarte led to his classification of man's
nature by the doctrine of the three persons in the
Trinity combined in unity ? Was he, by his obser-
vations upon the human trip/icity, led on to consider
their infinite development in the divine person-
alities? I know not, nor is it of importance in con-
sidering the system.
Leroux affirmed a relation between the unity of
man and the universality of his pantheism; both
relying at the Outset upon an idea at once religious
and philosophical. But the research of Leroux was
philosophically inclined, while that of Delsarte was
of a character more especially religious.
Is it necessary to urge that you accept this obvi-
ously primitive classification of the human faculties?
Who, that shall have considered a moment to con-
vince himself, can doubt this truth, that Our
sensations, our sentiments, our understanding, are the
principal elements of our life, and that all that we are

able to know of ourselves is made known to us by
them directly, or by the result of their combina-
tions P This consideration will soon lead us to the
rational development of the theory of Delsarte. For
the present, it suffices to receive these principles as
they have been presented to us, and to admit that
art could not go far astray while following a clue
leading from a law invincible, and guiding to a sci-
ence as positive as that of the astronomer, derived
from the law of attraction, or that of the chemist,
depending upon the law of affinities. Here need be
no confusion. The science is positive. The mys-
tery of the natural law implies a hypothesis, even
were the proposition negative.
Delsarte insisted upon the influence of a religious
sentiment in art, as a part of the constitutive animat-
ing faculties of the human being. In the light of
this proposition his enemies maintain that he teaches
this heresy: that success in aesthetics depends upon
a definite faith—even upon the observance of the
Catholic religion / This distinction between relig-
ion and creed, between sentiment and assertion, I
have followed carefully since the beginning of my
study. Delsarte was able to so address his pupils
at the beginning of a lecture, as to arouse the apa-
thetic, and electrify the passionate; but his teaching
was far from dogmatic. I do not say that at times,
in his aspirations and dreams, which he regarded
perhaps as intuitions, this religious philosophy did
not make some incursions into the region of mys-

ticism. I have seen at his home charts named from
the circumincession,” and classifying celestial Spirits;
but these trans-mundane personifications found no
place in his practical lectures. They are not found
in the great synthetical chart which I possess, and
which recapitulates the system as the master arranged
it in the strength of his youth and genius, free from
all mystical element.
When, in 1859, I submitted to Delsarte my trea-
tise containing a succinct statement of his method,
he said to me: “You have not followed me so far
as the angels.”
I replied: “I have related and recognized as truth
all that I have heard you teach upon the laws of art
as deduced from the relations of the human faculties,
because I have observed and verified it among peo-
ple and upon myself. But I speak not of things
which you have never shown me, and whose exist-
ence you have never demonstrated. The angels are
of this number.”
Yet he received with no less approval my profane
work. And it is the judgment which he placed
upon that essay which authorizes my resuming the
subject, augmented by further developments and
evidence.
I should not state with so great confidence this
great truth — the application of a natural law to a
succession of discoveries constituting a science, an

incontestable innovation — were I not able to refer
to competent opinions supporting my statement.
A few of these opinions I would here quote from
some of the journals I have examined, many of
which thoroughly appreciated Delsarte throughout
the long period of his teaching.
It was said by Adolphe Guéroult (Presse, May 15,
1858): “To discover and produce wonderful ef.
fects, is prečminently the characteristic of great
artists, but never, so far as I can learn, has it Oc-
curred to any one, before Delsarte, to attach these
strokes of genius to positive laws.” And further:
“The eloquent secrets of pantomime, the impercep-
tible movements which, in great actors, so forcibly
impress us, coming under the observation of this
discoverer, were by him analyzed and synthetized
in accordance with laws whose clearness and sim-
plicity render them doubly admirable.”
I give also some statements from the journal des
Débats (May 10, 1859). Though in the following
the word “law” does not appear, it bears interest-
ingly upon the relations of the ideas and expressions
under consideration. The quotation is: —
“The audience was charmed and instructed. It
applauded the new definitions. It divined the es-
sence of each art, and comprehended that the vari-
ous manifestations of art are classified according to
the classifications of the human faculties. It knows
why each passion produces each accent: ‘because
the accent is the modulation of the soul,” and why a

given emotion produces a given expression of the
face, gesture and attitude of the body.”
When we allow that “the classifications of the
manifestations of art are made according to those
of the human faculties,” do we not also allow that
they are derived from one law P
Thus the fiat Zur (“let there be light”) is pro-
nounced. Art departs from chaos, escapes from
anarchy; it acts no longer only for the so-called
artist, but also for the actor and singer, whom we
are now to consider. Art has to do with the pose
Of the body, a graceful carriage, distinct pronunci-
ation and an unconscious Command of dramatic ef-
fects. For a tenor to phrase agreeably, vocalize
skilfully, giving us resonant chest-tones, no longer
suffices to gain for him the title of great singer.
The followers of art should be able, before and
above all, to portray humanity in its essential truth,
and according to the original tendency of each type.
Mannerism and affectation should forever be pro-
scribed — unless they are imzāţated as an exercise —
but all the excellence that chance has produced up
to the present time should be incorporated in the
new science. §
Moreover, by referring to a law the occasional
Successes which come to one, it becomes possible
to reproduce them at will.
The essential point is to get back to the truth, to
express the passions and emotions as nature mani-
fests them, and not to repeat mechanically a series

of conventional proceedings which are violations of
the natural law. “Effects should be the echoes of
a situation clearly comprehended and completely
felt,” — such was the import of this teaching.
One of the great benefits arising from the discov-
eries of Delsarte is the reconciliation of freedom
and restraint. If it bind the artist by determinate
rules, it is in Order to free him from routine, to
recall him to the general law of being and of his own
individuality. It is in order that he may study
himself, in the place of submitting to arbitrary pre-
scriptions. In such study every marked personality
will find itself in its native element.
As for those who have no vocation, and in whom
distinguishes itself so little from the
y
the “ego'
multitude that it remains lost in it, it is best that
they should withdraw, since they are not called.
They have in view only vanity or speculation, and
must always be intruders in the sacred temple of art.
“My glass is not large, but I drink from my
glass,” said Alfred de Musset. Very well let each
one drink from his glass, but observe it is not nec-
essary that in the true artist all should be individual
and peculiar. It is necessary only that there should
exist a degree of individuality, something novel, a
distinguishing tone and an artistic physiognomy
peculiarly his own. Servile imitations, plagiarism,
stupid adaptations, put to death all art and all
poetry. In literature particularly is such decline
most easy.

Hoping that, from what has been said, you have

Out of the ruts of routine, away from plagiarism and
from disorder and anarchy, one word upon the most
distasteful and effectual blight to which art is sub-
ject — the loss of naturalness, viz., affectation. Can
anything be more irritating than an affected actor or
singer, caterers to perverted tastes?
In Sculpture what is more displeasing than a dis-
torted figure, which aimed at grace and is become
a caricature ? Affectation is in the arts the equiva-
lant of sophistry in logic, of the false in morals, of
hypocrisy in religion. It is not extravagant to as-
sume that affectation, being a falsity, an active lie,
is a torture to the spirit which perceives it, and a
wrong to the honest souls who endure it. It should
be, therefore, for twofold cause, banished without
pity from the realm of aesthetics. Why should the
natural, which is the expression of truth, have SO
great an attraction iſ affectation — its enemy and
incumbrance — aroused not our impatience or dis-
dain P -
How is it that in children of all classes we find
grace, ravishing and inimitable? It is because in
them the accord is perfect between the look, the
smile, the gesture and the impression within, of
which they are the interpreters — the adequate
signs, as Delsarte would say—the perfidious flexibility
of words never interposing to alter the harmony.

True grace in adults is not that which is studied,
nor that which is artistically copied from a badly-
chosen type. Grace is born of itself, the natural
fruit of the culture of the mind, of elevated thoughts
and noble sentiments. It is a combination of ex-
cellences which come unconsciously to some
privileged beings. To imitate beautiful effects in
nature, to surprise their expressions, after having
observed and established the relation of cause to
effect, — this is the end to which the discovery of
Delsarte would lead us.
As it is difficult for each to find ready at his com-
mand the elements for such research, how can we
overestimate the great value of establishing schools
in which the instruction of students of the great art
shall be guided in accordance with the established
laws of aesthetics P. The time of greatest necessity
is the immediate present, since the voice of the
people cries loudly through the press, “Art is de-
caying and will surely die ”
“Barriers are also supports,” said Madame de
Staël ; and what more sure support in the deca-
dence which threatens us, than a positive science
deduced from irrefragable law I say irrefragable
with conviction. Though human laws be subject
to change, the laws of nature are shown to be im-
mutable, at least so far as the observations of learned
men of all ages have been able to establish them.
To such assertions one objection arises: Why,
admitting that the human organism furnishes exact

and complete means of manifesting art in all the
departments of aesthetics, should not others before
Delsarte have discovered that correlation ? I have
conscientiously considered and sought light in this
direction, and the result of my research furnishes
me Only a negation. Although I do not here
attempt a complete study of the philosophy of art,
nor a general history of the arts, I have sought to
discover all that could warrant one in presuming the
discovery of a law of aesthetics in antiquity, particu-
larly among the Greeks.
I find that in the writings of Socrates, Plato and
Aristotle — who are the best authorities — art was a
dependence upon philosophy; that is to say, one
with it, having no law outside of it. (Whereas, in
the work of Delsarte, aesthetics occupies the first
place, and philosophy becomes accessory.)
I will here enter into some details of the ancient
tèachings.
Socrates gave to his teachings a practical char-
acter founded upon the knowledge of man. He took
for his point of departure man himself, and estab-
lished (according to this idea) a morality with the
motto of the temple of Delphi, - “Know thyself.”
This doctrine related more especially to ethics than
to assthetics — as later did that of Pierre Leroux —
and it was far from being able to direct artists in
their work.
Plato often discoursed upon the True, the Beau-
tiful, the Good. He strove to disengage them from

the concrete that he might derive some general
formulae. To do this he employed the method of
“elimination,” a form of dialectics which I recom-
mend to no one, notwithstanding its great value and
the services it may render, after all, to those minds
endowed with patience. What does he conclude in
regard to art?
The Socratic and dogmatic dialogues — the
Phaedo, the Gorgias, the Symposium, Profagoras,
Joſe, Phaedrus — abound in allegories, aphorisms,
and in aspirations toward an ideal, more or less
clearly defined, which end, however, not by any
means in a discussion of art, but in such affir-
mations as that which closes the first Hippias: —
“Beautiful things are difficult.”
In the Symposium, we have a philosophical dis-
cussion interposed between two orgies. Socrates
there maintains his title of sage, but it is surely not
wisdom which presides at the feast. What light
upon my subject? Do we here find any con-
clusive decision regarding art? No! We have
instead such statements as this: “It is possible for
the same man to be both a tragic and a comic
poet.” Then are made some reflections upon time
in music. We can as yet discover nothing like a
law of aesthetics.
In this company, where are assembled the most
Cultivated of the Athenian citizens, they discuss love
and jealousy of a kind that the moral instinct of
modern Society can with difficulty comprehend.

But these dissertations are of no aid in the solution
which I seek.
And yet the spirit of Socrates at times attained
to great heights. He puts into the mouth of a
woman of Mantinea the theory which saps the old
doctrine and presents monotheism. It is but one
step thence to Christianity, and it was Apollonius
of Tyana, disciple of Pythagoras, who established a
connection between the idealism of the later Greek
philosophy and the spirituality of the new religion
taught by Jesus of Nazareth.
Socrates, after a discussion upon those interme-
diate deities, whom he called daimons, and among
whom he places love, assigns to love an origin and
strange attributes which, to a certain extent, explain
the remarkable workings of this passion at that
time. He at once exalts and seeks to make Com-
prehended the new god—“Beauty eternal, uncreated
and imperishable, a beauty having nothing sensuous,
nothing corporeal,—which exists absolutely and
eternally.” This is all.
Perhaps this ideal of love, as that of philosophy,
may have been expressed in the foundation of the
religious ideal of Delsarte, but this encounter in the
ethereal regions of theology and psychology—where
the human consciousness perceives nothing tangible,
and whence it derives only vague aspirations—im-
plies no knowledge of anything like a law, a Science
or a method, such as our artist-innovator of the nine-
teenth century conceived and taught.

THE LAW OF AESTHETICS. 22 I
Aristotle, disciple of the founder of the Academy
of Athens, divided the sciences into three classes—
logic, philosophy and morals. Within this classifi-
cation art is closely bound, but this philosopher
made no scientific demonstration of it. His work-
ings are not those of application and execution.
More than his predecessors, it is true, he considered
the human organism and, in this, his conception
bears a certain analogy to the system of Delsarte.
Aristotle, as well as Plato, advised the study of
nature, and seeking there the elements of the Beau-
tiful; but they had specially in view literature and
eloquence. Further than this, their precepts are
counsels and have reference to no definite law.
They have not shown the links of connection be-
tween the human faculties and the mechanism which
manifests them ; they have not taught man the
manner of using his Organs to express artistically
his sensations, emotions and thoughts.
The Greeks had every advantage of models and
philosophical schools, in which art was taught. But
they had no school of aesthetics. Artists of genius
taught the schools more than they learned of them ;
and these artists, so far as I can learn, have left no
trace of theoretical works, but, as before written,
genius precedes and exemplifies law. While Plato
and Aristotle placed a beacon light upon the road
leading to a law, they never touched the goal. Del-.
sarte proceeded otherwise. He starts with a principle
clearly defined and everything harmonizes with it.

Have the historians and critics of the Greek phi-
losophy discovered that which I vainly sought in its
initiators, La Zazy of asthetics 2 This is a question
to be answered.
Winkelmann, in his “History of Art,” says: “The
fine arts, in their rise and decadence, may be likened
unto great rivers which, at the point of fullest great-
ness, break up into innumerable tiny streams and -
are lost in the sands.” Still following this imagery,
he compares “Egyptian art to a fine tree whose
growth is stopped by a sting ; Etruscan art to a tor-
rent; Greek art to a limpid stream.”
Now, the law of life of trees, streams or torrents,
is not identical with that which governs the unity of
a human life.
Like Aristotle, Winkelmann states clearly the
principle that man is the measure of all things, but
he does not follow up the consequences; he reaches
no scientific demonstration upon any point. Far
from establishing the existence of a law of aesthetics
among the Greeks, he simply remarks upon the ex-
treme simplicity of their beginnings, and shows by
what gropings they came from Hermes to the most
perfect works of Phidias and Praxiteles.
Mengs states that “the first designs were of forms
approaching human semblance; ” and that the
sciences and philosophy must of necessity have
preceded the Beautiful in the arts. He thinks that
the Greeks established the proportions of their
figures by imitation of beautiful nature.


## p. 223 (#259) ############################################

THE LAW OF AESTHETICS. 223
From these two commentators we have a history
of the progression of the arts toward the Ideal.
Mengs states that the Greeks and the Etruscans
have given rules of proportion and style. But pro-
gression, proportion, style, L-all of which proceeding
from a fixed standard of beauty may guide artists—
the perception even of the ideal which each one in-
terprets in his own way—cannot be assimilated to
that original law which carries in itself all the
reasons of the concept, that which contains all
conditions and means of a true execution, — indi-
vidual even to the perfection of each type, genera/
and varied as the infinite shades of nature.
In response to the allegation of Mengs, that “the
Sciences and philosophy must necessarily have pre-
ceded the Beautiful in the arts,” I would call atten-
tion to the fact that celebrated artists—as Phidias
and Zeuxis for example—had produced their works
long before the dialogues between Socrates, Protag-
Oras, Hippias and others, upon the True, the Good
and the Beautiful. The great painter and the great
sculptor could only have proceeded by the intuition
of their genius, knowing nothing of a law of aesthetics.
In that which remains to us of antiquity, I find
nothing which implies such an application of the
human organism to the arts as that whose discovery,
promulgation, exemplification and teaching we owe
to Delsarte.
M. Eugène Véron, writer of our day, and author
of remarkable works on art, far from recognizing

224. ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
among the Greeks a law of aesthetics, writes of Plato:
“He considered ideas as species of divine beings,
intermediate between the Supreme Deity and the
world. Theirs is the power of creation and forma-
tion. . . . Matter unintelligent and self-formed is
nothing, and realizes existence only through the
operation of the idea which gives it its form. Aris-
totle begins by rejecting all this phantasmagory of
eternal and creative ideas. He fills the abyss between
matter and spirit. God, pure thought and being
prečminent, brings all into existence by his power
of attraction which gives to all activity and life.”
We wander farther and farther from a law of aes-
thetics and its means of application as established
by Delsarte.
Of all the writers who have thoroughly examined
antique art, Victor Cousin would seem the One
with whom Delsarte had most in common, if this
eminent philosopher were not a contemporary of the
master and had not attended his lectures, his artistic
sessions and his concerts. In his manner of treating
art, this is often shown by words and forms and flashes
of instinctive reminiscence which recall the great
school. In his book, “The True, the Beautiful and
the Good" (edition of 1858), the learned professor
writes: “The true method gives us a law to start
from man to arrive at things. All the arts, without
exception, address the soul through the body.”
He is on the way, but his position embraces neither
the starting-point, which is the law, nor any practi-

THE LAW OF AESTHETICS. 225
cal means toward an end. For the rest, the nearer
his propositions approach the law of Delsarte, the
easier it becomes to establish the radical differences
which separate them. Delsarte does not say that
“the law is to start from man to arrive at things,”
but that “man uses his corporeal organs to manifest
himself in his three constituent modalities, physi-
cal, mental and moral.”
It is very certain that works of art, like all con-
crete forms, can only be perceived by the senses.
Who does not know this? But that which is most
difficult to comprehend, is the just relation of cause
to effect—as to the faculty and its manifestation,--
and it is this which Delsarte discovered and made
clear. The one stated the action of art when per-
ceived; the other, the necessities of the artist in
order that art respond to the law.
I shall have more than once to render justice to
Victor Cousin. Inheritor of the Greek philoso-
phers, he allows dialectics too great margin. He
wanders in his premises and arrives at his conclu-
sions—when he can. (Here, of course, I speak only
of art.) In philosophy, Cousin, beginning with
effects, from induction to induction, often arrives
at causes and states some principles. Delsarte, per-
haps, proceeded thus while seeking to combine his
discoveries, but this accomplished, he placed in the
first line, synthesis, whence, all emanates, and this
focus of light radiating in all directions, illumines
even to its farthest limit, the vast field of aesthetics.
I 5


## p. 226 (#262) ############################################

226 ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
Cousin, after all, claims neither for the Greeks nor
for himself the discovery of a law.
Proudhon, who represented the Protagorean school
among us, humoring his whim, produced a work on
art. In this he declares that he has very little gift
in aesthetics, and asserts himself a dialectician, and
we cannot deny his power in logic while he regards
things from a proper stand-point. Very well !
Proudhon challenged the Academy “to indicate a
method”—with even more reason might he have said
Mazw of aesthetics.
Shall we, at last, find among the true critics of
French literature any synthetic basis which may
guide us in all branches of art? What do I find in
“The Poetic Art,” by Boileau, the great authority
of the Augustan age, – rhetoric, beautiful verses,
full of excellent counsel? I find there wisely arbi-
trated rules, a sieve through which it would be well
to pass the works of our own times, including the
verdicts which distribute the glory.
But the means of putting into practice these valu-
able precepts—the criterion to establish their truth,
the touchstone which may distinguish the pure gold
—does not appear ! In default of these means of
certitude, each may, according to his instinct or his
pride, insist that he has fulfilled the conditions pre-
scribed by the author of the Zutrān, and judge his
rivals by the sole authority of his prejudices.
La Harpe and his followers have distributed praise
and blame, and at the same time said what should
be done, but they have given no Aozw.

THE LAW OF AESTHETICS. 227
More grievous still are the meanderings of the crit-
ics of our public journals. They wander without com-
pass and without rudder, approving or condemning
according to their friendships and antipathies; Save
those connoisseurs émérites, whose fine, sure taste and
exceptional erudition are rarely able to supply a law
and state a reason for their judgment.
Among us, as among the Greeks, may be found
artists who have given proofs of the existence of the
supreme theory of which I now write. Talma and
Malibran—in another order, Déjazet, and Frederick
Lemaître, even Thérésa herself, have, in a greater or
less degree, exemplified this law imprescriptable.
These artists, marked by nature with the seal of
their vocation, possessed that force of truth which
produces sudden bursts of eloquence, great dra-
matic effects; in a word, as before expressed, “the
happy strokes of genius.” -
Yes, before and after Delsarte, there were and
shall be beings conforming by instinct to his law.
|But with him alone shall rest the honor of its dis-
covery and first teaching, and of the establishment
of the science upon strong foundations.
It remains for me to examine the relations between
the workings of Delsarte and those who have treated
the same questions concerning the terms (according
to him, accessory), the True, the Good and the
Beautiful; and also to consider the value of each
branch of aesthetics in the entirety of the system.


## p. 228 (#264) ############################################

CHAPTER VII.
THE EILEMENTS OF ART.
The True, the Good, the Beautiful.
Though Delsarte be acknowledged the discoverer
of the law of aesthetics, he may have held points in
common with many who before him had had pre-
sentiments of its coming and had instinctively experi-
enced its force. Premonitions precede the discovery
as complements should follow.
The True, the Good, the Beautiful, constituent
elements of aesthetics, have been diversely inter-
preted. From his intellectual observatory, a zenith
whence the artist-philosopher viewed clearly the
whole and the details, he may be supposed to have
gained light beyond any which could have come to
his predecessors.
I will, then, resume my parallel from this point
of view.
The True, the Good and the Beautiful were not
made, in the school of Delsarte, objects of special
teaching. By definitions, reflections and illustra-
tions of the master, they were shown to enter fully
into the science and method—a part of it distin-
guishable and inseparable. The master, in his
demonstrations, commonly employed various well-
known maxims which were always accredited to
their authors. Thus, from Plato: “The Beautiful

THE ELEMENTS OF ART. 229
is the splendor of the True.” From St. Thomas
Aquinas, in regard to Science: “In creation all is
done by number, weight and measure.” From St.
Augustine (for he often quoted from sacred works):
“Moral beauty is the brilliancy of the Good.”
But I must proceed in order. I owe it to the sin-
cerity of my endeavor to explain first the aesthetic
work of Delsarte as shown me by his own teachings.
The True.
The True Illuminates the Thought.
To determine the signification of the True, we
must first ask what is truth? It has been defined as:
“A fixed principle, an axiom.” The term truth has
been applied to such or such maxims; but there
are few assertions not subject to discussion or which
would be accepted as decisive without comment.
They have not that piercing clearness which deter-
mines conviction by simple apprehension or at first
sight.
The dictionary of the Academy is more explicit
in its statement: “Truth is the conformity of the
idea to its object.” But a preferable definition is
that of Madame Clémence Royer: “Truth is the
concept of the spirit in regard to the reality of
things and the laws which govern them.” This
philosophical statement is readily adapted to the
True in the arts, which is acquired by the observa-
tion of nature and adaptation of the lawful ideal.
How, then, may we recognize the True in aesthet-
ics according to this definition? The artist, first

23O ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
and above all, should disregard no law of nature,
but when he aspires to great works, “the concept
of his spirit in regard to the reality of things and
their laws” should lead him to idealize what he sees,
translating his personal conception of the Beautiful
and the Sublime, if his flight carry him so far.
The word Art is more comprehensive in that which
it expresses, than the word True. Art completes
itself by its other elements, the Beautiful and the
Good. Plato, and the philosophers in general,
treated of truth from the stand-point of philosophy
rather than of art. Still the great Athenian seemed
to believe in a sort of celestial museum, where the
artist, penetrating by intuition, was inspired by a
vision, more or less clear, of the masterpieces of
divine conception.
Delsarte approached in a certain sense this very
idea, but his doctrine of the True in art, although
depending upon the mystic basis of a holy Trinity,
brought forth developments both rational and scien-
tific which leave far behind the Platonic hypothesis.
In the system of Delsarte it is no longer a vague
ideal dimly perceptible, which must guide the artist
in the execution of his work, for the innovator says
expressly that “the divine thought is written in man
himself.” It is therefore at the command of every
one who seeks truth to make it manifest in art. In
the new system, man being at once the artist and
object of art, literary men, Sculptors and painters
proceed from a basis ever to be observed and studied,

THE EI.EMENTS OF ART. 231
to rise from the True to the Ideal. Here the flight
must be more rapid and, above all, less deceptive
than the purely mystic fancy of Plato.
We shall see in considering the Beautiful in the
arts, that far from giving rise to arbitrary and fan-
tastic conceptions, the great ideal must become,
according to the Science and method of the master,
—the aggrandizement and the harmony of the fac-
ulties of the human being.
The Good.
The Good Sanctifies the Soul.
What is the Good in art? Here again the philo-
sophical standard bars the way and demands priority.
What, then, is Good independent of varied feelings
and of all the varied and contradictory interests of
human subjectivity which encumber it in the minds
of the multitude of thinking people?
The Good, after this elimination, is reduced or
rather elevated to one simple idea, so general and
requisite is it. The Good seems to be that which
can give to the greatest number of beings, existing
in the universe (conformably to their hierarchy), the
greatest sum of happiness and perfection, consider-
ing, for humanity, the importance of the mutual
relations of the faculties. If this be true of the
Good in life, is not a way clearly traced for art,
whose mission is to embellish existence P And,
further, if it be incontestable, that man cannot
transgress the laws of his nature without wronging

his intelligence and his happiness, even his strength
and beauty, how shall art merit our love and homage
if its power be exerted to excite inferior faculties
and subversive passions? Are not poise and ſhar-
mony the best conditions of existence for the
human organism P. That which Plato demanded for
the Beautiful in favor of the True — namely,
splendor — Delsarte demanded also of art in favor
of the Good. His thought is summed up in this
formula, “Man is the object of art.” Man, being
artist, becomes the agent of aesthetics. Man, in his
humanity, is the goal toward which should tend all
the efforts and experiments of the art-moralizer.
The master maintained the possibility of reaching
this end by two opposing ways, not contradictory;
2. e., the production of the Beautiful under its
physical, mental and moral forms; and by the man-
ifestation of the Ugly under the same forms, exhib-
iting what he called the hideousness of vice. Im-
morality may be rendered poetical and artistic,
because of its being a corruption of the moral, often
preserving the imprint of its origin, even throughout
its greatest errors. Its agitation, its combats and its
defeats interest the judgment and the heart. The
Ugly or unseemly, morally speaking, is the synonym
of vice.
The Ugly in the language of the arts has many
diverse significations. It is in these shades and
variable proportions that it affects our subject, but
the depicting of repulsive things, foreign to morality,

THE ELEMENTS OF ART. 233
to sentiment and to passion, has no right to exist in
aesthetics. It may be possible to cure a vice by
showing its hideousness. But does this warrant
such exciting of the disgust of the senses? It is an
outrage to the worship of the Beautiful, without
compensation of any kind.
There can be no advantage to humanity in exhib-
iting the hideousness of disease or the monstros-
ities of certain natural phenomenal Open to them
the museums of comparative anatomy, but close the
galleries consecrated to the fine arts | There exist
also monstrosities which are not included in these
categories; they present no moral danger, but are
disagreeable and repulsive to good taste. They
consist of fantastic forms, in accordance with the
spirit of an inferior civilization, reminding one of the
misshapen and gigantic prehistoric animals, whose
bones astound us, and which disappeared from Our
globe that man might appear.
Among cultivated contemporaries these eccen-
tricities spring from an inclination toward original-
ity, caprice, grotesque taste; from a similar impulse
to that which directs literature toward burlesque
and parodies, and the plastic arts toward caricature.
Such productions may please some distinguished
and intelligent natures which cannot have been
highly favored in the distribution of the delicacies
of sentiment and the exquisite graces of wit. In a
word, the art indulging in this class of manifesta-
tions acts according to the mode simpliste. I bor-

row this term from Charles Fourier, and I say once
for all, that by it I mean not the entire, but the al-
most exclusive predominance of one or the other
of the modalities of the human being. Here the
simplisme being altogether intellectual, while it is
inferior to manifestations in which the being ex-
pands harmoniously, it wounds no essential in the
synthesis of the me, while a predomination of the
sensual to the same degree is most pernicious to that
which delights in it and antipathetic to those who do
not live solely in the material aspects of existence.
Existing among the elements of aesthetics, as the
faculties of man, are certain dependencies, connec-
tions, affinities, penetrations, which render an ab-
straction of one of them almost impossible. Thus
I have anticipated allusions to the Beautiful in con-
sidering the Good. By thus connecting them, the
better to distinguish them, I have reached the con-
clusion that moral evil should never be manifested
in the arts unless with the view of redressing it.
In this case the better its real characteristics are
studied, the more strongly they are accentuated
throughout, the more successful the work will be
from the plastic point of view, and the more power
it will have to repel those inward wrongs which it
denounces, and this even though the intention of
the artist should not touch this result.


## p. 235 (#271) ############################################

THE EI.EMENTS OF ART. 235
The Beautiful.
The Beautiful Purifies the Emotions.
At first glance, it might seem the privilege of
each one to say, “The Beautiful is that which ap-
pears to me as such.” I believe in this regard,
that the most capable artist, should he be also the
most perfect logician, would never be able to per-
suade sainted and simple ignorance that it should
not remain firmly grounded upon faith in its own
impressions.
Place Hugo, Mercié, Bonnat, Saint-Saëns, Mas-
senet, Joncières in the presence of simple country-
men—or, what is worse still, of inferior artists and
critics, of pretentious amateurs — and you will see
by what supercilious, incredulous gestures, being
incapable of argument, this satisfied ignorance will
repel all assertions of the great authorities.
Should we, therefore, disregard this reluctance to
recognize the features of the Beautiful in great
works P. We must at least deduce from it the fact
that the effect of art depends upon some relation
between the observer and the thing observed.
Notwithstanding the reality of the beauties of
such or such a work, in the eyes of many apprecia-
tors, the subjectivity of each observer should remain
decisive, vis-à-vis to himself, as long as he cannot be
convinced by the authority of a law; and, finally, it
is imperative that his comprehension of that law
should be rendered possible by preliminary studies.
On the contrary, shall that which has been recog-

nized as beautiful by the initiated ever since artists
created, and enlightened criticism discussed and
judged it, appear now before uncultivated criticism
as without authority?
In default of law and science, there is a sort of
universal consent among competent thinkers; and
their appreciation of the highest class of works is
maintained by a process of adhesion carried on by
every conversion from ignorant blindness to the light
of appreciation.
The question of subjectivity in the declared judg-
ments in aesthetics has given rise to incessant con-
troversics which began, perhaps, among the Greeks
and are going on among us. Though no absolute
decision has been reached, some excellent maxims
have resulted. In default of an irrefutable definition
of the Beautiful, there have been given us images,
analogies and thoughts upon the subject which ap-
proach and prepare for such definitions:
Victor Cousin has said: “It is reason which de-
cides as to the Beautiful and reduces it to the sensa-
tion of the agreeable, and taste has no further law.”
“Aversion accompanies the Ugly (unseemly) as
love walks hand in hand with the Beautiful.”
“The Beautiful inspires love profound but not
passionate.”
‘. The artist perceives only the Beautiful where the
sensual man sees only the attractive or frightful.”
And, again, “That is sublime which presents the
idea of the Infinite.”


## p. 237 (#273) ############################################

THE ELEMENTS OF ART. 237
This last thought brings us to Delsarte, who, per-
11aps, was its inspiration.
The following valuable thoughts of the master,
while not related Scientifically to his system, are
still allied to its physical and philosophical aspects:
“Form,” says the innovator in aesthetics, “is the
vestment of substance; it is the expressive symbol
of a mysterious truth; it is the stamp of a hidden
virtue, the actuality of being; in a word, form is the
plastic of the Ideal.” s'
“The Beautiful is the transparency of the apti-
tudes of the agent, and it radiates from the faculties
which govern it. It is order which results from the
dynamical disposition of forms.” **
“Beauty is the reason which presides at the cre-
ation of things; it is the invisible power which
draws us and subjugates us in them.” 3.
“The Beautiful comprises three characters, which
we distinguish under the following titles: Ideal,
moral and plastic beauty.”
By the enunciation of these three categories, Del-
sarte enters upon the positive aspect of his system.
As the result of the careful examination of the ap-
titudes or faculties of the Ego, approachable by
analysis and applied to aesthetics, he has established
this first class of manifestations (ideal beauty) as
requisite to art. This must result from a combina-
tion of the faculties; the possibilities of combina-
tion being infinite, but always in subjection to the
human being. The artist, according to this personal

238 ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
power of inspiration, should be able to portray a
totality of superior and harmonious qualities, such
as will oblige any competent observer to recognize it
as beautiful. We have taken a step into the realm
of the Ideal; that is to say, we have touched that
which, without departing from the law, surpasses
conventional rule and the natural types accepted for
the Beautiful.
Before following the Ideal into its ethereal region,
we will further consider the nature of its foundation,
which is a Combination of the three mother faculties
which Delsarte declares to be, in aesthetics, the cri-
terion of the law and the foundation of the science.
We already recognize these as the physical, mental
and moral aspects of the human being.
The plastic art allies itself particularly to the
physical constitution, but the physique cannot be
perfectly beautiful unless it manifests intellectual and
moral faculties.
Moral and intellectual beauty reveal themselves
in the human being under the empire of passion
and of sentiment, and the physique is momentarily
transformed. The artist should seize beauty at this
moment of fullest perfection, above the normal con-
ditions of human existence and perhaps beyond
possible plastic beauty.
Behold what glorious possibility for the direction
of the artist's aspirations toward the Beautiful
But even this happy chance by no means includes
all of the possible conceptions of the Ideal, and


## p. 239 (#275) ############################################

THE ELEMENTS OF ART. 239
neither does it furnish us any absolute idea or
definition. This vision of beauty, made ideal by
exaltation of the intelligence and the emotion, can
only be perceived by the artist of practiced obser-
vation and of that intuitive perception which is the
gift of nature.
Again considered, the Ideal, being relative as
well as the Beautiful, of which it is the exuberance,
we must remember that the word is far from cor-
responding to an idea of absolute beauty. Thus the
Ideal of an ordinary taste is not so high as that of a
person whose standard of beauty is superior, and
the two will be very distant from the image con-
ceived by the pen, the chisel or the brush of a great
artist. In many cases the Ideal is nothing but a
searching for the intention of nature, obliterated by
the circumstances and accidents of life. Then the
task of the artist should be to reëstablish the type
in his logic — a vulgar face may be portrayed by a
skilful brush — and, while preserving its features,
there may be put into it the culture of intellect and
noble sentiments.
An artist, for instance, will see in a woman,
whom time has tried, certain elements of beauty
which enable him to portray her nearly as she was
at the age of twenty years. He should be able to
divine in the young girl, according to the normal
development of her features, her appearance at the
complete unfolding of her beauty. Yes; in these
different cases the artist shall have idealized, since


## p. 240 (#276) ############################################

24O ARN AUD ON DELSARTE.
he shall have comprehended, penetrated, interpreted
and rectified nature. Still, he may not yet have
attained to the comprehension of perfect beauty,
such, at least, as human emotion and intellect can
conceive, and such as we love to imagine as inhab-
iting the superior spheres of the universe of which
we know nothing further than the dictate of our
reason, namely, that they are inhabited by beings
more or less like ourselves.
When these sublime effects appear in art, it is as
though a veil were torn, revealing glimpses of a
world of ideas, emotions and impressions, surpassing
Our Comprehension, approachable only by our as-
pirations.
Thus, Delsarte, superior to his science, has shown
us the artist in full possession of all that he has
acquired, and the inmost charm of that which is
revealed to him. In execution he proved this truth:
If talent may be born of science, it is genius which
- distinguishes the highest personalities, and to merit
the title of high artistic personality one must con-
tain in himself an essence indescribable, unutterable,
which constitutes the aureole of grand brows, and
the sign luminous of great works of art.
Thus, as virtue, art has its degrees.
Art, in its most simple expression, is the faithful
representation of nature. If the conception of a
work or of a type is elevated to a degree of perfec-
tion which satisfies at once the plastic sense, the
£motion and the intellect, we will call it Grand Art.


## p. 241 (#277) ############################################

THE EI.EMENTS OF ART. 24. I
Finally, if, in the presence of a creation, we
recognize perfect harmony (which goes beyond per-
fect proportion); if the work call forth in us that
contemplative ecstasy which gives us the impression
and, as it were, the vision of pure beauty, shall we
not recognize Supreme Art?
The system of Delsarte responds to all these de-
siderata of aesthetics. In his law he gives us the
necessary bases; by his science he indicates the
practical means, by his method and illustrations he
completes the science and demonstrates the law.
Where is place left for doubt or contradiction?
He stated what he knew and how he had learned
it. In his recitals occurred innumerable beautiful
proofs of his greatness and simplicity, oftentimes
more convincing than lengthy, involved argument
could ever be.
Some may ask: How can a positive science lead
toward an ideal which cannot be touched, heard nor
seen P Would not this science be the antipode (some
would say antidote) of the mystic dreams of Plato
and of Delsarte himself P
Reply is easy. Delsarte recognized in our mental
consciousness that desire for research into the un-
known which would sound the mysteries of nature.
He did not disregard that intuitive force of imagi-
nation which can often form from simple known
elements the concept of conditions superior to the
tangible.

touch, and that nature which the artist feels, im-
agines, and to which he aspires, Delsarte has placed
a ladder whose base is among us, and whose summit
is lost in the infinite spaces of fiction and poesy. By
this ascent into the realm of liberty, of personality
and of genius, the elect of aesthetics shall mount and
gain, and, still maintaining their relations with the
Real, shall bring down to us the glorious trophies of
their art.
Delsarte, foremost among men, had climbed the
magic ladder. His exquisite harmonies in the dra-
matic art and lyric declamation were beautiful in-
deed, but the aesthetic beauties which he brought
forth in the rôles that he interpreted, must, alas !
disappear with him. He has left us the bases of his

CHAPTER VIII.
APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE VARIOUS ARTS.
We have now to consider each branch of aesthetics
in the totality of the system, to be assured whether
or no this law discovered by Delsarte covers all de-
partures in the domain of art. First, then, the
starting-point around which all is centered and from
which flow all developments.
“Man is the object of art.” This proposition ap-
plies as readily to the conception of literature,
poetry and the plastic art as to the more active
manifestations of the dramatic, Oratorical or lyric
art. Man being thus the object of art in all of its
specialties, the part of the artist is to manifest that
which is revealed to him, through his three essential
modalities, – physical, moral and intellectual (in
the words of Delsarte, life, soul and spirit, with the
divisions and subdivisions that they allow), as has
been clearly stated in the chapter upon “The Law
of AEsthetics,” and further confirmed in the one
upon “The Bases of the Science.” But though all
of these primordial modalities appear in each con-
cept and in all artistic manifestations, the proportion
in which each appears is indefinitely variable. It is
a predominance of one or another of these which
classifies and specializes. It is the harmony, more
or less perfect, of the components of this triple unity

244 ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
which determines the value of artistic manifestations.
Under this law, then, come all of the arts, inasmuch
as each, differing in subjects treated and in means
of execution, still has a common mission, namely,
the revelation of impressions, the intelligible ex-
pression of the thoughts and feelings of man. To be
more clearly understood, I will from this point con-
sider separately the different branches of aesthetics.
Art — Dramatic, Lyric and Oratorical.
The proclivities necessary to an artist, actor or
orator (intelligence being the first consideration and
beauty of minor importance) are: expansion, sen-
sibility or at least impressionability; a ready com-
prehension of the works to be interpreted, if not the
requisite capacity to execute them. One's particu-
lar vocation (or congenial line of work) is the first
condition in either of these departments of art, and
into the consideration of this must enter that of
physical beauty such as the rôles demand; always
considering what has been named “the physique”
of the situation. In a word, these three aspects of
art correspond to the predominance of that modality
which Delsarte calls “life; ” this with the comple-
mentary share of the other essentials to maintain a
symmetry; this for the average “chosen.” As to
the individuality necessary for the creation of a rôle,
general statements cannot apply. It is one and en-
tire for each. Should it reproduce itself identically,
it would no longer be individual. The strength of


## p. 245 (#281) ############################################

APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE ARTS. 245
a powerful individuality lies in the revelation of a
type sui generis. -
Thus Delsarte can never be reproduced. If by
an impossibility an artist having seen him, and being
penetrated by his method, could assimilate the
sum total of his acquired qualities and his inmost
purposes, still he could be but a copy, however
perfect, since personality cannot be transmitted. I
could not pursue the demonstration of the applica-
tion of the laws of the human organism to the
generality of the liberal arts without meeting an
objection which we will consider just here. Some
one says: If the law of art is the same as that of
the human constitution, what need that Delsarte
teach that law—will it not suffice for each artist-
nature to study himself in order to determine satis-
factory means of transmitting (to spectators, audi-
ences or readers) the thoughts, passions or emo-
tions which he would reveal, either by his pen, his
chisel, his brush, or by the fictitious personages which
he incarnates? I answer, No | The expression of
nature by gesture, face, or voice will not come to
the artist by inspiration nor by reflection, especially
in extreme situations. He may chance upon agree-
able effects, and even moving expressions, but
rarely does a just and telling expression of that which
he would express result from mere chance. Caustic
truth or knack—more vulgarly, cheek—comes of
influence outside of one's self. Upon one occasion
Madame Pasta was heard to say: “I would be as

touching as that child in her tears. I should, in-
deed, be a great artist if I could imitate her.”
Rare, indeed, are the artists who know how to
weep. The sublimity of art responds to nature's
simplest impulses. By the study and work of
Delsarte a science has been created, every fleeting
sign of emotion has been fixed, and may be repro-
duced at will; and this for the instruction of the
artist who may never have observed them in
another, nor himself felt the impressions which give
rise to them.
Application of the Law to Literature.
It is hardly necessary to state that the predomi-
nance of one of the primordial faculties in the actor
would necessarily differ from that in the author of
the drama or opera which he would interpret.
Literary capability presupposes more or less of
philosophical aptitude and a predominance of the
intellectual faculties, and this not to the exclusion of
a certain amount of artistic and moral development
in the truly great writers. It is in the field of litera-
ture especially, that man attains to a creation , and
whether his object be a fellow-creature or an extended
and enlarged ideal,—in either and any case facts have
furnished repeated and incontestable evidence, in
support of the statement of Delsarte, that art is
always defective unless it be the product of the three
essential modalities of being, acting in their relative
proportions. This statement is not to be contested;


## p. 247 (#283) ############################################

APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE ARTS. 247
but here again these relations would vary among the
writers upon Science, ethics and poetry.
The epic, most synthetic of literary productions,
is no longer in fashion, because, perhaps, of the
growing rarity of heroes. On the contrary, sim-
p/isme is now deforming the greatest germs in the
drama and romance. The weakness often lies in the
morality of the production, or rather in its lack of
morality, often so lacking that the author sinks to
the level of producing repulsive works and cynical
pictures.
In view also of man's essential faculties, but from
another point of view, St.-Simonianism classed men
as Scholars, artists and artisans. Then were added the
priests of a new order whose nature, more perfectly
balanced, was to furnish the model type of future
humanity. This classification had brought.thinking
people to the consideration and criticism of a system
isolating and concentrating all development upon
one or another of the faculties. It was readily seen
that thus sentiment would rush to folly; sensibility
without a corrective would soon become weakness;
unbalanced industry would lead to disregard of
health and strength, while the triviality of the sen-
sual nature, unrestrained by mental or moral activ-
ity, would soon fall into hopeless degradation.
Herein was simplisme most bitterly condemned.
Delsarte, ever studying relations between coinci-
dences in art and the revelations of nature, arranged
a typical demonstration, as ingenious as logical, of


## p. 248 (#284) ############################################

248 ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
the action and play of opposing faculties. By most
wonderful pantomime he showed a man tempted
to sin; then, touched by pity for the victim of his
desire, at last transformed by the intervention of
the moral sense, he came by slow gradations to most
elevated sentiments. One saw clearly the courage
of resistance and triumph in the sacrifice. Then,
taking an inverse progression, he slid from this
height to the opposite extreme of culpable resolu-
tions.
Delsarte was the author of this mute scene
which contains the elements of a drama. The Con-
templation of this wonderful effect leads to the con-
viction of the great value to literature of the funda–
mental law, which may be applied to any and all
literature, as a permanent criterion by which produc-
tions may be classified and judged, in their depart-
ure from the simpliste form and approach to a con-
ception in which the constituent modalities of being
act in harmonious accord. Here, again, we have a
fresh distinction between scientific and ethical liter-
ature, and that which may be termed the literature
of art. To this latter class belong romances, dra-
matic productions and poems—works made up of
shades of meaning and just proportions, which
should be based on clear and sound philosophy,
prudently disguised but indisputable and imperish-
able. Here is place for the grace of an agreeable
wit and the elegant flexibility of a fruitful pen.
More imperative than in any other class of writing

APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE ARTS. 249
is the demand for individual touch and that harmony
of construction depending upon the proportionate
relations of those elements of aesthetics, the True,
the Good, and the Beautiful. Thus, through aesthet-
ics, it is elevated.
To this literature of art belong the sonnet of Ar-
vers, and “The Soul,” by Sully-Prudhomme. Mus-
set, in his grace or pathos, is not inferior to Victor
Hugo. There are, even in his faults, certain effect-
ive boldnesses to which the author of “ Notre Dame
de Paris” cannot aspire. Whence, then, comes the
immense distance between these poets? It lies in
the fact that Victor Hugo, while he is a finished
artist, shows himself also a thinker, philosopher,
man of science and erudition. Endowed with a
profound humanitarian feeling, he is prečccupied
with the evils of society, with its rights, its mistakes,
its tendencies and with their amelioration; while
the poet of “Jacques Rolla’’ — a refined sensualist
— devotes his verse to the unbridling of the tor-
ments of imagination in delirium, to the agitations
of hearts which have place only for love.
If comparison be made between novelists and
dramatists of diverse schools, why has not M. Zola,
who in so many regards should be considered a
master, attained the heights of eminence upon
which are enrolled the names of Shakespeare, Mo-
lière, Corneille, Schiller, Madame de Staël, and
George Sand? It is because M. Zola, profound
analyst and charming narrator, even more forcibly

than Musset breaks the aesthetic synthesis by the
absence of morality in his writings. His fatalism ar-
rests the flight of that which would be great; he
corrupts in the germ wonderful creative powers
M. Zola's great lack lies in his considering in man
his physical nature only. Between mind and mat-
ter he holds a magnifying lantern full upon the low-
est molecules, and rejects disdainfully the initiating
atom that Leibnitz has signalized as the centre of
life. M. Zola has created a detestable school which
already slides into the mire beneath the weight of
the crimes which it excites and the disgust which it
arouses. Should we blame Zola and his disciples
for the danger and the impotence of this method P
Should we not impute the wrong in greater measure
to philosophical naturalism?
In considering materialism and naturalism let us
not lose sight of the fact that while materialism is
simpliste, naturalism (in so much as it represents
nature) is essentially comprehensive and necessarily
synthetic; harmony of force and matter being an
invariable requisite of life.
Realism, another term Strangely compromised,
seems to proclaim itself under the banner of mate-
rialism, while the Real, implying the idea of the True,
cannot be contained in simplisme. It is a most
pernicious evil that writers, calling themselves real-
istic, still concentrate their talent upon the painting
of vicious types and characters drawn in an infernal
cycle of repulsive morals.

APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE ARTS. 25 I
“Man is the object of art.” Never could the
words of the master more appropriately 1nterpose
than before the encroachments of literary simplisme.
The man of whom Delsarte speaks is not confined to
such or such a category of the species. He pro-
poses that aesthetics should interpret an all-compre-
hensive human nature, which is not made up alone
of baseness, egotism and duplicity. Though it be
subject to perversion, it has its luminous aspects, its
radiant sides, and we should not too long turn our
eyes from them.
Artistically, evil or the Hideous (which is also
evil) should never be used except as a foil. There
is no immorality in exhibiting the prevailing vices
of the epoch, but this is the physician's duty. The
evil lies in presenting these evils under such forms
as may lead many to enjoy or tolerate them, giving
them the additional power of a charming style and
the specious arguments of fatality. This is precisely
the case of M. Zola. The glamor of his disturbing
theory, which annihilates free will, gives to his
works a philosophical appearance. He conceals its
vacuity beneath forms of a highly-colored style, an
amiable negligence and a facility that is benumbing
to thought. As he asserts nothing, no one dreams
of contradicting, and one finds himself entwined in
a network of repulsive depravity without a ray of
healthful protection or correction. In comparison
with the blight of this disastrous system of fatality,
the coarseness of the writer's language, so loudly

252 ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
censured, is relatively unimportant. The simplisme
of M. Zola is not absolute, as but one of the three
constituent modalities is omitted, that one being
morality. The lack is, however, no less fatal, inas-
much as the void produced by the absence of one
of the noblest faculties of human activity must
usually be filled by disturbing forces.
I have heard the theory, “art for art,” supported
by men otherwise very enlightened. “An artistic
production need not contain a moral treatise,” they
say, and this is quite true, provided the artist be a
quick Observer, possessing talent sufficient to handle
his subject harmoniously. Vice carries its own
Stigma, and pure beauty surrounds itself with light.
The author should be able readily to distinguish the
one as well as the other, and his precepts should
come as the harmonious result of his experience.
But such a work, at the mercy of an ill-balanced
brain and unhealthful temperament, must yield bad
fruit. Talent without broad and true knowledge of
zeality, or that which is, instead of being invented,
is incomplete in its workings and results. Its crea-
tions resemble the light of the foot-lamp, of fire-
works, of the prodigies of our modern pyrotechnists
— pleasing for a time, dazzling, captivating, intoxi-
cating ! But lost in the life-giving beauty of a sum-
mer's night or a glorious sunset, we are tempted to
cry out with the poet, —
“Nothing is beautiful but the True.”


## p. 253 (#289) ############################################

APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE ARTS. 253
What can be said of the other simplisme which,
in its search for the True, ignores the Beautiful while
it disregards the Good? Again, its partisans seek
artistic truth in its very worst conditions. Why
paint in full sunshine, if the intense light obliterates
details and confuses the shadows P Does it seem
a difficulty conquered P. It is far oftener a dis-
guised insufficiency. If my reference to painting
seem premature, it is because I wished to borrow an
image to show how equally grievous was the faulty
touch of many of our writers of renown. Many
among them seem striving to propagate the culture
of the Mediocre and Unseemly, as a thousandfold
easier practice than the religion of the Beautiful.
My present aim is to show clearly the influence
of even incomplete simplisme, in certain pernicious
effects upon literature. Edgar A. Poe entered the
realm of the fanciful after Hoffman, and how is it
that the initiator is less dangerous than his disciple?
It is because of these two simplistes, who have put
reason out of consideration, the first addressed him-
self only to the imagination, while the American
poet sounded the emotions to depths where terror is
awakened and madness begins to sting. Hoffman
has perhaps upon his conscience Some readers con-
fined in asylums for the deranged, but the far more
perilous hallucinations of Poe must account for
greater harm. The distance is great between imag-
ination and sentiment, and should be so regarded.
This extravagance should surely not be allowed to

§
usurp the place of morality, but this is what is done,
and greatness is not for them.
Another illustration lies in the transition interme-
diate between the romances of Balzac, Frederic
Soulié, Emile Souvestre, and Eugène Sue, and the
poetry of Victor Hugo, Lamartine, Béranger, Bar-
bier and the impressionalist school whose decline is
already at hand.
Of many names, which have acquired notoriety,
I select the two which afford the best contrast, —
Charles Baudelaire and Jules de la Madelène. The
first, among other eccentric works, has left us “The
Blossoms of Evil.” In the ideas which it embraces
it is the successful production of an imagination
misled and in distress; a pathological experience
probably prompted the conception. In it one reads
beautiful verse of Scholarly construction, and readily
perceives an individuality and originality of thought
and expression; but no one would predict or desire
that this production should pass to posterity.
“Le Marquis des Saffras,” by Jules de la Made-
lène, on the contrary, gratifies both judgment and
feeling. It is a spirited painting, acute and pro-
found, as well as true, of human life, especially of
provincial life. The human being is revealed in all
his aspects. Though the author disguises neither
errors nor weaknesses, he presents clearly the redeem-
ing side — the simple manners and the humble devo-
tion of sincere hearts. This, then, is the reason why,
sustained by a style rich in grace and strength, full

of the breath of poetry which is felt rather than
described, “Le Marquis des Saffras” holds its
place as an incontestable masterpiece in the
choice libraries that preserve the renown of great
writers.
A more careful examination of the doctrine of
Delsarte—“The necessity of the concurrence of the
mother modalities of the human organism to fulfil
the conditions of aesthetics”—but forces the con-
viction that disregard of this requirement renders all
sterile and incomplete, if not monstrous. Is this
equivalent to saying that the deductions from the law
of Delsarte tend to condemn in French literature its
simple gaiety, its graceful lightness, and to efface
this stamp of the race that our ancestors have surely
imprinted P
In works of the imagination the omission of moral
meaning is often more seeming than real, and every
good reader should be able to recognize this. How-
ever, this negligent seeming is far less hurtful than
brilliant wit concealing crudities and modifying bold-
nesses. Writers of this class do not lose sight of the
fact that, while the French character has its audac-
ities (contrary to the modifications of aesthetics), our
language possesses a proverbial chastity, which,
even in its farthest wanderings, genius comprehends
and respects. Tact and taste suffice to him who
consults them to escape grossness of language. The
delicacy of the allusions leaves their images in a
transparent mist; the very elasticity of the equivo-

cation furnishes a refuge for the thought which it
disquiets.
By art some most delicate subjects, very nearly
approaching license, have been pardoned. We would
surely exhibit a tyrannical and morose humor to
condemn to be burned en place de Grève, by the
hand of the executioner, the romances of Mazzone
Lescaut, and Daphnis and Chloe by Longus, as they
have been transmitted to us by Paul Louis Courier.
But when literature, realistic or materialistic (or
whatever they please to call it), freeing itself from
moral accompaniment, shows itself negative or weak
in its creations; if it be simpliste to the point of
appealing exclusively to the senses, limiting its
means of action to the development of the egotistic
and instinctive side of the human passions,—its
works have no longer right of consideration in
aesthetics. The consideration of the physical being
should surely figure in all representations of life,
but it is not necessary that from a subordinate con-
sideration it should ever be made all-governing. The
body, the essential part of our personality, is the
companion of our higher faculties. We should be
mindful of it, making it as beautiful as possible, but
giving it the reins would be even worse than giving
power absolute to the imagination.
Once more, impressionalism, without the control
of Science and of reason, has nothing to claim in
the spheres of the True, the Good, the Beautiful.

Application of the Law to Architecture.
The productions of architecture, like those of
literature, have their origin in the realm of thought.
Architecture is not, like the dramatic art, in subjec-
tion to the person of the artist. It is one of the
plastic arts, and of them the most synthetic by rea-
son of the number of agents concurring in its har-
mony. Its dependence upon form is akin to that
of sculpture, while the value of color in its effects is
only less than in the art of the painter.
This art, essentially comprehensive, demands of its
masters varied knowledge and that power of coör-
dination which, according to the learned philosopher
Antoine Cros, is the highest function of the human
intellect. The relation of aesthetics to the totality
of the faculties is here more evident than ever.
After the manifestation of mind in the composition
of the plan, the architect's next duty is to please the
eye. To this end he employs marble, stone, wood,
bronze or gold, and the result is that element of the
symphony which responds to sensation. The third
and only remaining element of the trinity is sentiment.
In order that, rising above its utilitarian purpose,
appropriateness and mathematical rules of stability,
the architect may fulfil the requisition of aesthetics
and arrive at the “Grand Art,” the remaining ele-
ment as well as the other two must be perfected in
result. The perfection of this element of sentiment
is shown in the work by the impression of grandeur
or elegance, of grace, severity or delicacy. The
17

triple necessity thus filled, the result is truly a work
of art.
Application of the Lazy to Sculpture.
The relation of Delsarte's system to sculpture has
already been alluded to. Its application here lies
principally in the realm of form. The sculptor aims
to reproduce finest proportions of face and figure.
He delights in a beautiful contour and, as Mengs
has said, “in lines undulating and serpentine,”
while he studiously avoids all simple straight lines.
The more limited range of outlook demands more
studied beauties and more significant expressions.
The statue — unlike the monument, which at once
arouses spontaneous emotions in the spectator —
should express the human being, his sensations, his
affections, his passions and struggles, and should
arouse an enthusiasm of admiration while it awakens
sympathetic echoes in the heart of the observer.
Here more strikingly than ever must we recognize
“Man the object of art.” In the light of this truth
we should demand of sculpture the manifestation of
the human life with its constituent faculties, not in a
perfectly equal accord which is never met in nature,
but with such predominance as the subject presents.
In Greek art the predominance is of the physical
aspect. They had before them exquisite models of
plastic beauty; not the sensual beauty which is
fleshly, but a plastic beauty consisting of harmony
of line and form. Let us further consider this dif-

ference as shown in comparison of the Apollo and
the Bacchus.
The Apollo satisfies alike the intellect and the eye
by its beautiful outlines. [We are not yet ready
to discuss beauty of expression.] The Bacchus less
ideal and more humanly natural cannot so satisfy a
highly aesthetic temperament. In neither work is
there much of sentiment expressed. The distinc-
tively moral side plays a secondary part, unless we
consider beauty itself a moral factor, a theory that
may be sustained. In neither beautiful marble is
there revealed any sensual dominance, though the
Bacchus, notwithstanding its plastic superiority,
rather inclines that way. The Apollo has been
loudly extolled for the pride of its attitude and its
divine calm in the encounter with the serpent Py-
thon; and still it is said that “a god could not have
cause for so great pride in the conquest of a reptile.”
But the art-critics have exaggerated the import of
the figure, which is wonderfully beautiful without
being accurately expressive. The civilization of the
new era has developed in man moral and physical
qualities, which furnish new expressions by which
the artist may set forth that part of human life which
Delsarte called “the transluminous obscurities of our
inmost organism.” Dating from this epoch we find
in Sculpture less of plastic beauty and more spiritual
and touching expression. Who would compare the
pathos of the Laocoon to that of Canova's Magdalen?
The sculptor Marcello (Mme. de Castiglione), too

early removed from an artistic career, exhibited
certain creations which illustrate this difference.
Among them is a bust, in marble, of an Arab chief,
which is after the style of the antique, beautiful lines,
without expression (a predominance of the physical
element). In her “Weary Bacchante” she shows
beauty tarnished by vice, and here the predominant
expression is sensual. But in her “Marie Antoi-
nette in the Temple Prison,” as in Mercié’s “David”
and the “Dying Napoleon,” it is not the marvelous
beauty which entrances us, but first and above this
reigns the power of expression.
Sentiment is become predominant. In the “Marie
Antoinette,” what bitter disappointment In the
“Napoleon,” what disillusion with the toys of the
world in which he had reigned In the “David "-
Biblical subject treated by a modern chisel—what
strange impressions and reflections are suggested by
that tranquil head and the wonderful frailty of the
body how original the conception of the figure, and
the whole a tribute to the high personality of the
artist | Mercié shows not only the work accom-
plished, but in this are glimpses of promise of
greatness to come which serve as more valuable
proof of greatness than the masterpiece completed.
This leads me to a reflection already often alluded
to, but which I would keep ever before you as the
foundation of my argument: “Man is the object of
art.” He is also the art-producer, and considering
relatively the two terms of the proposition, the mani-

festations of the faculties are not necessarily adequate
between the producer and the production. I will
explain. -
The best conditions under which an excellent
work of art should be produced are undoubtedly
the following: The conceiver possesses in the high-
est possible degree of development the modalities
of being essential to the kind of creation under-
taken, and these in their most perfect harmony; but
this perfection of intensity and of the relations of
the elements of the concept by no means necessi-
tates the artist's formation of types at once morally,
intellectually and physically artistic. This depends
upon the truth of his subject. That he embellish
it, whatever it may be, by his artistic interpretation
and execution, is all that we should expect.
In the new manifestation which we now consider,
where expression of sentiment is given predomi-
nance, the artist, interpreter of the passions, senti-
ments, weaknesses and vices as well as of the virtues
and sympathies of humanity, must, in order to interest
or chasten, show to it its own image, which reflection
will be most frequently not an ideal of perfection
but a type of suffering and vice, of weakness and
depravity. A work will be successful in proportion
as the chisel shall be most indefatigable in putting
in relief the virtue or the vice which characterizes
the subject. The greatest artist shall be he who
renders most striking the characteristic predomi-
nance, whatever it may be, of the type created or

interpreted. To sum up : Art is proportional to the
faculties of the artist, and the work is the result of
an application of these faculties to some special
manifestation of the human ego.
Impressionalism, as in the other arts, should be
considered in two aspects: the impression of the
artist and that of the public or observer. The
question then arises, what kind of a public should
be impressed that the artist may merit a place in the
higher ranks of aesthetics? While we have recog-
nized that judgments in questions of art are the re-
sult of a certain sympathy existing between artist
and observer, we have decided also that in consider-
ing such a question, all observers cannot be con-
sidered equal. In sculpture as in literature, where
appreciators are possibly more numerous, we must
admit that knowledge and capability or even sincer-
ity are rarely of any weight in the balance of the
grand juries of history or in the verdicts of con-
temporaries. The ignorant multitude sanction the
grossest works because these only come within their
understanding. Encouraged by the applause of
numbers and by the lack of restraint which wins
applause, artists descend the rounds of the ladder of
progress which step by Step has marked the ascent
of the great schools and the great masters, and the
result inevitably must be the return to mere sketches
in sculpture, and painting will diminish to imagery.
This end is quickly and readily reached, so easy and .
so fatal is the descent in these paths of decadence.

APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE ARTS. 263
“All styles are good except the tedious,” a well-
known critic has said. Pursuing the import of this
thought, we are led to the speedy conclusion that
the mezz// should never enter into competition. Noth-
ing better than that the condition of priority should
exist between diverse styles and opposite Schools;
but why strive to institute comparison between a
synthetic idea and the absence of synthesis and idea,
between certain proportions and harmony and the
absence of proportion and harmony, between a style
and the absence of style? Whatever the subject
and whatever the mode of treating it, the intelligence
of the artist should always be visible in his work.
I am more and more thoroughly convinced that
the theory of Delsarte, fatal to simplisme, is the true
theory of art. What can be more simpliste than
impressionalism when viewed as a school? It con-
siders no law or science, disregards entirely analysis
and logic, the Good and the Beautiful; it is given
Over to sensation; vague impressions which are,
whatever may be said to the contrary, only the in-
ferior part of man's faculties, indispensable surely,
but that which we have in common with the animals
and little children; very interesting to observe
among animals, a charming grace in children, but a
most unimportant factor in adult existence, particu-
larly in the artist's life, unless it be governed by the
intellect and subject to the sanction of feeling.

Application of the Law to Painting.
If any art should be given over to impressionalism
it seems as if it should be painting. To see and to
transmit what is seen, is not this the true office of the
painter, his undoubted mission ? Yes, on condition
that the artist has the requisites for seeing correctly
And if he rises to composition, he must also be
endowed with a creative intellect, with a portion of
that mental power which will permit him to embrace
a conception synthetically, and to coördinate its
parts.
Among the impressionalists of our time, there are
assuredly painters of talent; but what talent they
possess is, as it were, against their will: the influence
of tradition, the weight of the medium in which they
live unconsciously restrain them. Then, it must be
confessed, this impressionability of the artist has its
intrinsic merits, if it is kept to its place and degree;
but it must be regarded as certain, that if the simpliste
artist makes himself distinct in his work, it is be-
cause he contains within himself more of the requi-
sites for what he undertakes, and because, without his
having summoned them, the faculties of the under-
standing and the aesthetic sense have come to his aid.
If Delsarte admitted the precept that “everything
is perceived in the manner of the perceiver,” he, of
course, did not admit that every perceiver should
make his own law: his conception of the aesthetic
trilogy would never have permitted him to open this
Babel for the vanity of ignorance.


## p. 265 (#301) ############################################

APPLICATION OF THE LAW TO THE ARTS. 265
To finish with simplisme or naturalism, let us say
that, carricq to its utinost extreme, it becomes a fixed
idea, a monomania; has not impressionalism attained
to this even in the choice of colors P. It has been
said of certain painters that they had only to upset
their palette on the canvas to compose their pictures
Yet this varicolored chaos is not the characteristic
of the school. On the contrary, certain favorite
colors prevail; do not green and violet rule almost
exclusively in some of the most striking pictures
from impressionalist brushes?
There are moments when we ask whether the
impressionalists and their adherents are not obeying
an impulse to contradict rather than a serious con-
viction. In either case, it is time for many of them
to furnish proofs—that is to say, works,—in lack of
the reasons which they have not even offered.
After this digression, forced upon me by recent
scholastic quarrels, let us return to Delsarte.
I have given the reasons for his doctrine in other
chapters; this doctrine will gain strength when I
show what I have gathered from his science, since
science and law mutually testify for each other;
since all art, acquiring fresh vigor from its source,
/aw, and enlightened by the aid of these same for-
mulae, must bear the impress of truth, beauty and
goodness.
Even where color occupies in painting the place
attributed to outline in sculpture, there are in these
two manifestations of mental images — and in spite

of the synthetism peculiar to painting, — striking
similitudes.
As regards physical manifestations, both these
arts should seek truth — which does not mean
literal exactness, – and all that has been said of
simplisme, in regard to sculpture, is perfectly appli-
cable to that part of painting which treats of the
human figure. Science and law lay down the same
rules for both, – save for the differing modes of
execution.
It is another matter when it is a question of
representing nature as a whole, and under less
limited forms: seas, mountains, the atmosphere
and broad plains — landscapes of vast extent, —
subjects forbidden to sculpture even more exclu-
sively than simple compositions of several figures,
which are seldom successful in sculpture. For if
Sculpture sometimes makes a group, if it is used to
decorate monuments and tombs, it offers nothing.
analogous to those magnificent phases of nature
which we find on the canvases of the great masters.
Delsarte, who from the laws of mimetics deduced
for painters means of expressing correctly every
impression and emotion which man can feel, taught
nothing in regard to this special field of the land-
scape artist, who is not subject to the conditions of
the actor, Sculptor or orator. But, if this aspect
of art — save in cases where figures are introduced
— does not come under the head of certain state-
ments of our science, not having to imitate attitude,

gesture or voice — in a word, anything proceeding
from the human organism, - it is, perhaps more
closely than elsewhere, allied to the innovator's law:
to that law which prompts the artist to respond to
the psychical aspirations of his fellowmen, and
demands that in satisfying the senses, he should also
arouse or inspire the thought and feeling of beauty.
Thus the painter of nature, as much of a reality
as man, but a reality in its own way, if he desires to
make nature understood and loved, must give it the
stamp of his own ideas, his own feelings, his own
impressions.
Why should I care to be shown trees and waters,
valleys and mountains, if the tree does not tell me
of the coolness of its shade, if the water does not
reveal the peace of the deep lake, if I cannot
divine the rippling of the brook, if the valley does
not make me long to plunge into its depths Why
recall to me the mountain, if its curves do not rouse
in my mind any ideas of grace, elegance and
majesty,+ if its peaks do not make me dream of
the Infinite
However skilful the artist may be in the repro-
duction of form and the handling of color, he will
always be far inferior to nature if his soul has never
heard the inner murmur of all those mysteries of
the sensitive, and I will venture to say, spiritual life,
Contained in forests, waterfalls and ravines. Lack-
ing this initiation, he will play the cold and flavor-
less part of one who tells a twice-told tale; for it

is in landscape especially, that talent consists in
revealing the painter's own feeling.
The charm of things felt is not produced merely
by a grand way of looking at things: the mind, the
Soul, occupy but little space; but where they figure,
the canvas is well filled, and the brush betrays their
presence.
I remember, in Support of my thesis, that at one
of the annual expositions at the Salon — which then
represented the aristocracy of painting, — there was
a tiny picture: a hut half hidden in moss and
flowers. It was almost lost among the portraits of
distinguished personages, the historic incidents, the
scenes taken from fashionable life, and almost
drowned in the bloody reflections from the vast
display of battle pictures, which, as was then the
custom, monopolized half the space. -
Well ! this canvas, a yard wide and not so long,
held you captive, took your thought prisoner, and
inevitably impressed itself on your memory. You
longed to ramble over its thick turf; to enter that
cottage whose open windows gave you the feeling
that it was a peaceful shelter; you loved that poor
simplicity, which seemed to hide happiness.
Certainly the author of this graceful, touching
picture practiced Delsarte's law, at least from in-
tuition.
Profound emotions are not always due to ob-
jective beauty; the beauty of the work is a thing
apart from what it represents. Who does not recall,

in another order of talent, this effect, due to the
brush of Bonnat: an ugly, Old Spanish woman is
praying in a dark chapel; she prays with eyes, lips
and soul. There was never seen more complete
absorption, more complete forgetfulness of self in
humble fervor. It was far more touching than all
the types of sensual beauty, with pink and white
and perfumed skins — with delicate limbs, in dis-
agreeable attitudes |
This is, yet once again, due to the fact that senti-
ment is stronger than sensualism; and because the
artist's skill, taking the place of beauty in his sub-
ject, becomes genuine aesthetic beauty: so much so
that, looking at Old age and ugliness — as repre-
sented by Bonnat, the spectator is enchanted and
applauds — the success of the work /
If, however, to perfect execution is allied beauty—
not sensual, but aesthetic,+ if it is made manifest
from the point of view of form, feeling and thought,
the enthusiasm will be still greater, because all the
aims of art are realized at one and the same time.

CHAPTER IX.
DELSARTE'S BEGINNINGS.
“The artist, a traveller on this earth, leaves behind imperishable
traces of his being.”—François Delsarte.
We would fain prolong the faintest rays of all
that glitters and fades too soon, and if intense light
is generated in a human brain, we strive to retain its
every reflection. Nothing is indifferent which con-
cerns the nature of the chosen few ; great men belong
to the annals of their nation, and history should be
informed regarding them.
François Delsarte left this life at the moment
when misfortune had crushed France beneath her
iron heel for some ten years. The date of his death
—July 20, 1871—partially explains the silence of
the press on the occasion of so vast a social loss.
The circumstance of an artistic education, which
was carried on in my presence, gave me opportunity
to collect a mass of incidents and observations in
regard to the great artist who is the object of this
sketch.
I collected ideas in regard to his instruction, his
method and his discovery of the laws of aesthetics,
which are the more precious that nothing, or almost
nothing, was published by him touching upon subjects
of such supreme importance. It is my duty to tell
what I know.


## p. 271 (#307) ############################################

DELSARTE'S BEGINNINGS. 271
I have already established the bases of the work
which I now undertake, in a pamphlet containing
several articles published in various newspapers.
These articles were written under the inspiration of
the moment; they won the master's approval. I
shall have frequent recourse to them to correct the
errors of memory and give more vivid life to that
now distant past.
Delsarte was born at Solesmes (Department of
the North), November 9, 181 I. His father was a
practicing physician; but tormented by a genius for
invention, he spent his time and money in studies
and experiments. Then, when he succeeded in
producing some mechanical novelty, some capitalist
more used to trade and rich enough to start the
affair, usually reaped all the profits. This condition
of things, of course, produced great poverty in the
family of the inventor, and the children's education
Suffered in consequence, and yet young François
even then showed signs of superior endowments.
A missionary, passing through Solesmes, said to
him : “As for you, I don’t know what you will turn
out, but you will never be an ordinary man ” In
spite of this, his parents intended him for trade,
being unable to direct his talents toward science and
the liberal arts.
Before proceeding farther, I must consider a
question often asked in regard to the great artist,
and concerning which his family have kindly informed
Iſle.


## p. 272 (#308) ############################################

272 ARN AUD ON DELSARTE.
For a long time Delsarte signed his name in a
single word, as I write it now ; why, then, should we
ever see it written with the separate particle, which
seems to aim at nobility and which gives us the
form, del Sarte? I will give you the tradition as it
is told in Solesmes, and as the artist heard it during
a visit to his native place. If it be fiction, it is not
without interest, and I take pleasure in telling it.
The natives of Solesmes say that at a very re-
mote period a great painter, coming from a dis-
tance, spent some time in their town. The good
inhabitants of the place know nothing of the pic-
tures which this master must have produced; per-
haps they are quite as wide from his name ! But
Delsarte, struck by the probability of this poetic
origin, filled with brotherly sympathy for the pure
and graceful talent of Vannuchi del Sarto, doubted
not that the latter was the artist whose memory is
held sacred in Solesmes. Out of respect and vene-
ration for the Italian master, he divided the sylla-
bles, but still retained the French termination of his
113 Iſle.
We can readily see that an imaginative spirit,
such as we now have to deal with, would be carried
away by the legendary side of this story, and that
he would put full faith in his own commentaries:—
he believed so many things
To return to prose and to reality, I must add that
Delsarte based his sentiment upon partial proof.
Before the Revolution, the family did indeed sign

themselves del Sarte; but an ancestor — imbued
with the principles of 1789, and anxious to efface
all suspicion of noble origin — effected a fusion of
the two parts of the word, and left us the name as
we have known it and as, perhaps, we regret it.
Those who regard this change of family name as
mere vanity seem to me wide of the truth. A
strange nobility, moreover, that of Vannuchi, Sur-
named del Sarto / Sarto may be translated as
tailor, therefore Vannuchi del Sarto would mean:
Vannuchi of the tailor, short for Vannuchi, son of
the Zazlor.
What need had he of empty honors, he who
was on equal terms with the great men of letters,
science and the arts, who was surrounded by the
incense of the most legitimate enthusiasm, and who
received the homage of kings as of less value than
the praises of Spontini and Réber 1
I return to my sketch which will, I hope, justify
these last remarks. \
At the time of which we speak, the poor child
was not treated as the predestined favorite of art.
He had been entrusted to people who ill fulfilled
their mission. He was scolded and abused; he
was left destitute of the most necessary things.
He felt this injustice, and, gifted with a precocious
sensibility, he suffered greatly from it.
François had as a companion in misfortune, one
of his brothers, who could not bear the hard life;
born feeble, he soon succumbed. This was a severe

trial to the future artist When he saw his only
friend buried in the common grave, he could not
contain his grief.
“I rebelled,” he tells us, “at the idea of losing
all trace of this tomb. I shrieked aloud. I would
not leave the mournful place l’’
The grave-diggers took pity on his despair; they
promised to mark the spot. The child resigned
himself to fate and departed. I will let him speak
for himself :
“I crossed the plain of St. Denis (it was in De-
cember); I had eaten little or nothing, and I had
wept much. Great weakness combined with the
dazzling light of the snow, made me dizzy. The
fatigue of walking being added to this, I fell upon
the damp earth and fainted dead away.”
What followed may be explained by the ecstatic
state often experienced on coming out of a fainting-fit.
“Everything seemed to smile into my half-open
eyes; the vault of heaven and the iridescent snow
made magical visions about me; the slight roaring
in my ears lulled me like a confused melody; the
wind, as it blew over the deserted plain, brought me
distant, vague harmonies.”
Delsarte interpreted what he saw in the light of
Christian ideas: it seemed to him that the angels
made this delightful concert to console him in his
misery and to strengthen him to bear his hard lot.
Rising up, the child felt himself a musician. He
soon evinced an utter contempt for the china paint-

ing to which he had been bound apprentice. That
too was an art; but of that art, the angels had said
nothing. -
How was he to learn music?
He knew that by a knowledge of a very small
number of signs, one could sing and play on instru-
ments. He talked of this to all who would listen;
he questioned and inquired:—
“Do you know music, you fellows?” he asked
Some School boys of his own age.
“A little,” said some. -
“Well! what do they teach you?”
“They teach us to know our notes.”
“What notes P ‘’
“Do, re, mi, fa, Sol, la, si.”
“What sºlse P '’
“That is all.”
“Are there no more notes?”
“Not one !”
“How happy I am I know music ” cried the
delighted Delsarte.
“Cries of joy have their sorrows,” said a poet.
The child had uttered his cry of joy, and his tor-
ments were about to begin. Seven notes It was
a whole world; but what was he to do with them?
He scarcely knew, although he was enchanted to
possess the treasure. Could he foresee the revela-
tions which art had in store for him P Still less
could he predict those conquests in the realm of the
ideal which cost him so many sleepless nights.

It must be confessed, superior talents bring suffer-
ing to their fortunate possessor. They console him
on his journey, along the rough road down which
they drag him; they sometimes reward one of the
elect, but it is their nature to cause suffering.
And so François Delsarte was tempest-tossed
while yet a child. He soon saw that his scientific
baggage was but small; he felt that something
unknown, something infinite, barred his passage, so
soon as he strove to approach the goal which, in
an outburst of joy, he fancied within his grasp.
What hand would guide him to enter on the dazzling
career which he had dimly foreseen P Where should
he get books? Who would advise him P
Well ! these impossible things were all found — in
Scanty measure, no doubt, and somewºat Capri-
ciously ; but still the means for learning were
provided for his greed of knowledge.
At first, his stubborn will had only the seven notes
of the scale to contend with. He combined them
in every possible way. He derived musical phrases
from them ; at the same time, he listened with all
his ears to church music, to street musicians, to
church organs and hand-organs.
In these first struggles with knowledge — we can-
not call it science yet, — instead of bowing to the
method of some master, Delsarte made a method
for himself. Had it any resemblance to that which
—with the progress of time, his genius revealed to
him P I cannot say, and probably the thought never

DELSARTE'S BEGINNINGS. 277
occurred to him. However it may be, Delsarte said
that he learned a great deal by this autonomic pro-
cess: in fact, one who is restrained by nothing, who
satisfies a passion instead of accomplishing a mere
act of obedience, may enlarge his horizon and dig
to whatever depth he sees fit. In this case, study
is called research ; if, by this method, one loses the
benefit of the experience of others, he becomes
more quick at discovery. Is not the puzzle which
we work out for ourselves more readily remembered
than the ideas which are merely learned by heart?
A wise man, a disciple of Socrates — who has
been greatly ridiculed, but by whose lessons the
science of pedagogy has greatly profited,—Jacotot,
gave similar advice to teachers: “Put your ques-
tions, but let the scholar think and work out his
answers instead of putting them into his mouth.”
The talent of young François once established,
he left the inhospitable house where he had been so
misunderstood, and was taken into the family of an
old musician, “Father Bambini,” as Delsarte loved
to call him.
Here, finding it in the order of facts, I must
repeat almost literally a page from the little work.
quoted before.
Father Bambini was one of those old-fashioned
masters, who treat their art with love and venera-
tion. He gave concerts at which he was at once
performer and audience, judge and client. Delsarte
was sometimes present. He saw the good man take

•
up a Gluck score as one handles a sacred book; he
surprised him pressing it to his heart, or to his head,
as if to win a blessing from the great soul which
poured itself forth in these immortal compositions.
Here we most assuredly have the foundation of
the unlimited admiration which our great artist felt
for the author of “Alcestis " and of “Iphigenia.”
Everyone knows that it was Delsarte who drew
Gluck from the oblivion in which he had languished
since the beginning of the century. Delsarte alone
could have revived him, his assured and majestic
talent being amply capable of correctly interpreting
those colossal works. Delsarte is the equivalent of
Gluck, and, if we may say so, the incarnation of his
thought. When the artist sang a part in those lyric
tragedies of which Grétry says: “They are the very
expression of truth,” it seemed as if the illustrious
chevalier lived again in him to win better compre-
hension than ever before and to be avenged at last
for all the injustice and bad taste from which he had
suffered.
Delsarte received no very regular musical educa-
tion from Father Bambini. The lesson was often
given while the teacher was shaving, which did not
distract the attention of either party. The master,
having no hand at liberty to hold a book, made his
pupil explain all the exercises aloud, sing every
composition, and read at sight the authors with
whom he wished him to be familiar. Great progress
can be made where there is such mutual good will.


## p. 279 (#315) ############################################

DELSARTE'S BEGINNINGS. 279
They had faith in each other: the child, because he
saw that his master really loved his art; the old
musician, because he realized that his scholar had
a genuine vocation and would be a great artist.
One evening they were walking together in the
Champs Elysées. Carriages rolled by filled with
fashionable people. The humble pedestrians were
surrounded by luxury. Suddenly Father Bambini
turned toward his scholar:
“You see,” said he, “all these people who have
their carriages, their liveried lackeys and their fine
clothes; well, the day will come when they will be
only too glad to hear you, and they will envy you
because you are so great a singer.”
The child was deeply moved; not by this promise
of future glory; not by the thought, that by fame
he should gain wealth; but he seemed to see his
dream realized in a remote future. That dream was
the complete mastery of his art; it was his ideal
attained, or closely approached. This mode of
feeling already justified the prediction.
Delsarte retained a grateful memory of another
teacher. M. Deshayes, he said, spurred him on to
scientific discovery, as Bambini directed his attention
and his taste to the works of the great masters.
One day, as the young man was studying a certain
rôle, M. Deshayes, busily talking with some one
else and not even glancing toward his pupil, ex-
claimed :
“Your gesture is incorrect ”


## p. 280 (#316) ############################################

28O ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
When they were alone Delsarte expressed his
astonishment.
“You said my gesture was incorrect,” he ex-
claimed, “and you could not see me.”
“I knew it by your mode of singing.”
This explanation set the young disciple's brain in
a whirl. Were there, then, affinities, a necessary
concordance between the gesture and the inflections
of the voice? And, from this slight landmark, he
set to work, searching, comparing, verifying the
principle by the effects, and vice versa.
He gave himself with such vigor to the task that,
from this hint, he succeeded little by little in estab-
lishing the basis of his system of aesthetics and its
complete development.
After these beginnings, which Delsarte considered
as a favorable initiation, Father Bambini—his faithful
patron—thought that he required a more thorough
musical education, and chose the Conservatory
school. There, that broad and impulsive spirit in its
independence ran counter to classic paths, to rigid
processes; there, that exceptional nature, that
potent personality, which was already a marked one,
that vivid intuition—which already went beyond the
limits of the traditional holy of holies—had little
chance of appreciation. Moreover, Delsarte was
timid; his genius had not yet acquired the audacity
which dares. Competition followed competition;
would he win a prize? In answer to this question
which he had asked himself throughout the year, he

saw mediocrity crowned ; his soul of light and fire
was forced to bow before will-o'-the-wisps, most of
whom were soon extinguished in merited oblivion.
The artist's regret was the more acute because he
did not yet know the course of human life. He had
not proved the strange fatality — which seeks to
make itself a law — that, in general, success falls
to the lot of those who servilely follow in the ruts
of routine. Happy are the worshippers of art and
poetry, those who have devoted their lives to this
sacred cult, if ambition and intrigue — with their
attendant train of flattery, party rings, and illegal
speculation — do not invade the stage whence the
palms and the crowns are awarded !
Delsarte must also have learned in the course of
his life, that genius, a rare exception, is more rarely
still judged by its peers; and yet, the genius of this
student was already revealed by various tokens; and
for his consolation, these premonitory symptoms
were noted by other than the official judges.
After one of these scholastic contests, Delsarte
withdrew confused and heavy-hearted: he had re-
ceived but one vote in the competition; and even
that exception roused a sort of cheer, as if it were
given to some contemptible competitor.
The defeated youth walked slowly away, drag-
ging at his heels all the sorrow of his discom-
fiture, when two persons approached him ; one was
the famous Marie Malibran, the other the brilliant
tenor, Adolph Nourrit.

“Courage ' " said the prima donna, pressing his
hand. “I enjoyed hearing you very much. You
will be a great artist l” *
“My friend,” added Nourrit, “it was I who cast
my vote for you : to my mind, you are an incom-
parable singer. When I have my children taught
music, you shall certainly be their teacher.”
Delsarte blessed the defeat which had brought
him such precious compensations. These voices
which sounded so sweetly in his ear, were soon ex-
tinguished by death; but they vibrated long in the
heart which they had comforted. The artist associ-
ated their dear memory with every success which
recalled to him their sympathetic accents and their
clear-sighted prediction.

CHAPTER X.
DELSARTE'S THEATRE AND SCHOOL.
When Delsarte had finished his studies, he en-
tered the world unaided and alone; disarmed by
the hostilities which could not fail to await him,
by his very superiority, and by that honesty which
refuses to lend itself to certain transactions.
At the Opera Comique, where he was engaged,
he did not succeed. Exceptional talents require
an exceptional public who can understand them and
make them popular by applauding and explaining
them.
And yet certain people, gifted with penetration,
discovered under the artistic innovations peculiar to
the beginner, that indescribable fascination which
hovers round the heads of the predestined favorites
of art.
Delsarte could not long confine himself to the
stage, when everything connected with it was so far
from sympathetic to him, and seemed so contrary
to the true object of dramatic art. The theatre, to
his mind, should be a school of morality; and what
did he see? Authors — what would he say now-a-
days? — absorbed in winning the applause of the
masses, rather than in feeding them upon whole-
some food or in preparing an antidote for vice and
evil inclinations.


## p. 284 (#320) ############################################

284 ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
Whatever good intentions happened to be mingled
with the play were lost in the details of the action
— or in the often mischievous interpretation of the
actors. With his wonderful perspicacity, Delsarte
seemed to foresee all the excesses of naturalism in
certain forerunners of Adolphe Belot and Emile
Zola.
On the other hand, his comrades, who should
have attracted him, showed themselves to be envious
and malicious. To sum it all up, it was very hard
for him to live with them. Some of them might
please him by their simple gaiety, their childlike
ease, their lack of affectation, and their amiability,
but they were far from satisfying his lofty aspira-
tions !
An occupation of a higher order, he thought, the
elaboration of his method, demanded his thoughts.
He seemed haunted by a desire to produce what his
spirit had conceived. He longed fully to enjoy that
happiness of creation that arises from useful dis-
covery. He aspired to say: “In accomplishing the
task which I set myself, I have also done much for
art and artists.” -
Swayed by such thoughts, François Delsarte soon
left the profession of actor to follow that of teacher
of singing and elocution. Then he found himself
in his element and, as it were, at the centre of all that
attracted him. His teaching enabled him to verify
the value of his axioms hourly, in the order of facts
and to confirm the truth of his observations.

And yet he had not attained to the supreme beati-
tude. If the elect of plastic and practical art have to
contend with appraisers of every degree, inventors
have to deal with enemies who make up in stubborn
resistance what they lack in numbers, and Oppose
the iron will of a rival who will not see the limit of
the me plus ultra which he believes himself to have
reached and even exceeded.
In every station of life, the bearers of “good
news’ are a prey to the tyranny of interests and
established prejudices. In our time, this persecution
becomes mockery or indifference. Delsarte did not
escape this debt of revelatory genius. Humble in
regard to art and science, as he was conscious of his
strength when face to face with rivals and com-
petitors, he sometimes felt the doubt of himself, the
sudden weakness, which Overtakes great minds and
great hearts in the accomplishment of their mission.
A special form of torture attacked our young in-
novator. He had proved, connected and classed a
number of psychological facts relating to the theory
of art, and he did not know the special terms which
would make them intelligible. Like those phenome-
nal children, who see countless relations before they
possess the words to express them, he had discovered
a law, created a science, and he was still ignorant of
the language of scientists. If he tried to demon-
strate the bases of his system and its rational evolu-
tion in ordinary words, the ignorant would not under-
stand him and the learned would not deign to listen.

Sometimes he did find some one who would hear
him, question him, even criticize him, and who would
go away bearing a fragment of conversation or some
few notes which he had copied to turn to his own
profit. ...”
At this time, there came one day to Delsarte, a
pupil who—by a rare exception—had been through
a course of classical studies.
“Tell me, you who have studied (asked the
teacher with the affability of a great man), what is
metaphysics?”
“Why . . . just what you teach us !” said the
astonished youth.
Delsarte was enchanted to learn that he was only
divided by words from a science which had seemed
to him to dwell on inaccessible heights. The study
of technical words, when intuition had provided him
with important ideas and new perceptions, was
child's play to him ; in a short time he could teach
his philosophy of art in the consecrated expressions.
His lectures grew rapidly in the Rue Montholon.
A choice public soon assembled to hear them,
drawn thither by the admiring cry of the first
enthusiasts. At this period, the talent of the artist
was enhanced by the lustre of youth. Nature had
endowed him generously. His figure, which later
assumed rather large proportions, was tall and
elegant; his gestures were marked by grace and
nobleness; his hair, of a very light chestnut, gave
his face a fair softness; his brown eyes relieved this

expression and allowed him to give his face—when
the interpretation of the part required it—the signs
of power and vigorous passion. A full length por-
trait painted at this time and in the possession of
Madame Delsarte, gives us some idea of his grand
face and form, allowing for the disadvantages of
every translation. Although, in singing, the organ
was often impaired, his speaking-voice was most
agreeable in tone, correct and persuasive in accent.
In acting various parts, Delsarte transformed him-
self to suit the character that he represented. He
was congratulated on bringing to life for our age
Achilles and Agamemnon, as Homer painted their
types. Yet, I think he was sometimes told: “You
paint that wretch of a Don Juan a little too faith-
fully.” Certainly, art would never make that com-
plaint'
If Delsarte was understood in that part of his
method addressed especially to the ear and the eye,
it was not so with the theory which prepared these
striking demonstrations.
He was surrounded, it is true, by an assembly of
men of letters, men of the world, and amateur
artists, rather than by scientists and philosophers.
Many in the audience and among the pupils did not
pay an undivided attention to the scientific part of
the instruction. Thus the first notes of the piano,
announcing that the time for action had come,
always caused a repressed murmur of satisfaction
and pleasure.

Sometimes, after the lecture, a discussion followed,
for Delsarte often left room for a controversy which
was essentially incorrect and caused many misunder-
Standings. This was because the innovator some-
times blended with the clear hues of his art-princi-
ples certain tints of religious mysticism which had
no necessary relation with the synthesis of his
aesthetics.
It was one of the peculiarities of his character,
amiable and benevolent as it was, to take delight in
the conflict of ideas. If he saw, in the course of
his lecture, a man whom he took for a philosopher
br anything like it, he never failed to direct some
piquant phrase, some aggressive sentence or some
irritating thought that way — it was the gauntlet
which he flung for the final combat.
Nor were women exempt from these humorous
Sallies.
Although the master loved all grandeur — the
artistic sense with which he was so largely endowed
inclining him that way—he had democratic, I might
almost say plebeian, instincts. The poetry of simple,
humble, small existences sometimes Swayed him.
Thus, if among his hearers, a bright violet or an
audacious scarlet gown annoyed his taste; if the
reflection of a ruby or a diamond vexed his eye, he
would choose that instant to improvise a rustic idyl
or to intone a hymn to poverty.
But everything ended well; neither the philoso-
pher whom he had provoked, nor the fine lady whom

lie had reproved, left him as an enemy. His nature
with its varied riches had quite enough feminine
coquetry to regain betimes the sympathy which he
was on the eve of losing. A gracious word, an
affectionate clasp of the hand, and all was par-
doned.
The opposition manifested outside the lecture-
room to his ideas and mode of instruction, was less
courteous. There rival Schools and jealousies, ill-
disguised under an affectation of disdain, contended
against him. He was accused of the maddest eccen-
tricities; barbarous processes were imputed to him,
such as Squeezing the chest of singers, his pupils,
between two boards—the reason was hard to under-
stand. Others claimed that before Delsarte accepted
a scholar, he required a profession of the Catholic
faith and an examination in the catechism.
Those were the days when the author of “Les
Orientales,” in his legend of the “Two Archers,”
spoke of
“That holy hermit who moved stones
By the sign of the cross.”
But if, as an artist, Delsarte loved legends and was
inspired by faith, as a professor he could cut short
this poetic part of his art, at the point where science
and the practical side of his teaching began.
The reproach, therefore, carried no weight.
Delsarte was amused by these exaggerated accu-
sations; in another order of criticisms, it was agree-
able to him to hear “ that he sang without a voice,

as Ingres painted without colors.” The comparison
pleased him, although inexact.
Yes, I say ineract, Delsarte was not without a
voice; he had One, on the contrary, of great
strength and range; of moving tone; eminently
sympathetic; but it was an invalid organ and sub-
ject to caprice. He was not always master of it, and
this caused him real suffering.
Let me give you the history of his voice as
Madame Delsarte herself lately told it to me. I
must go back to his early days of study and débuts.
Delsarte entered the Conservatory at the age of
fourteen. Too young to endure the fatigue of the
regular school-exercises, his voice must have received
an injury. When the singer offered his services at
the Opera Comique — then Salle Vantadour — he
was told that his voice was hollow, that it had
no carrying power. This was perhaps partly the
fault of the building, whose acoustic properties were
afterward improved. However, thanks to the flexi-
bility which his voice retained and his perfect vocal-
ization, the pretended insufficiency was overlooked,
and the young tenor was admitted.
His mode of singing pleased the skilled public,
and the special abilities of this strong artistic organ-
ism — as I have already observed — did not pass
unnoted. -
A dilettante, to whom I mentioned Delsarte long
after this time, said: “What you tell me does not
surprise me. I heard him at his first appearance,

DELSARTE'S THEATRE AND SCHOOL. 29 I
and he has lingered in my memory as an artist of
the greatest promise. He was more than a singer;
he had that nameless quality, which is not taught in
any School and which marks a personality; a tone
of which nothing, before or since, has given me the
least idea.”
The tenor, from the Comic Opera, went to the
Ambigu Theatre, and thence to the Variétés, where
an attempt was being made to introduce lyric works.
François Delsarte's dramatic career did not, how-
ever, last more than two years. During these vari-
ous changes — I cannot give the exact dates — this
artist, on his way to glory, was forced to gain a liv-
ing by the least aristocratic of occupations. If he
did not go so far as Shakespeare in humility of pro-
fession (the English poet was a butcher's boy), he
strangely stooped from that native nobility — great
capacity, which must yet have claimed, in his
secret soul, its imprescriptible rights.
If this was one more suffering, added to all the
rest, it had its good side. It was, perhaps, the source
of the artist's never failing kindness, of that gracious
reception which he never hesitated to bestow on any-
one — from the Princess de Chimay and many other
titled lords and ladies, down to Mother Chorré, the
neighboring milk-woman, whom he held, he said,
“in great esteem and friendship.”
I return to his teaching. His lectures were given
in Rue Lamartine and Rue de la Pépinière. There
was always — aside from the School — an audience

made up of certain never failing followers and of a
floating population. The birds of passage sometimes
came with a very distinct intention to criticise; but
if they did not readily understand the learned deduc-
tions, they went away fascinated by what the pro-
fessor had shown them of his brilliant changes into
every type of the repertory which he held up as a
model. Enthusiasm soon triumphed over prejudice.
Envy, alone, persisted in hostility.
These meetings were genuine artistic feasts. They
were held at night, at the same hour as the theatres,
and no play was preferable to them in the eyes of
the truly initiated. They were a transcendent mani-
festation of all that is most elevated, which art can
produce. -
Here is an extract from a newspaper, which I find
among the notes sent me:
“I heard him repeat, one evening, ‘Iphigenia s
Dream,’ at the request of his audience. All were
held trembling, breathless by that worn and yet sov-
ereign voice. We were amazed to find ourselves
yielding to such a spell; there was no splendor and
no theatric illusion. /p/ligenia was a teacher in a
black frock coat; the Orchestra was a piano strik-
ing, here and there, an unexpected modulation; this
was all the illusion — and the hall was silent, every
heart throbbed, tears flowed from every eye. And
then, when the tale was told, cries of enthusiasm
arose, as if Iphigemia, in person, had told us her
terrors.”

These lines are signed “Laurentius.” I am very
glad to come across them just as I am giving vent
to my own feelings. I also find that Adolphe
Guéroult, in his paper, the “Press,” calls Delsarte
the matchless artist, and recognizes a law in his
aesthetic discoveries. I shall have occasion to set
down, as opportunity offers, a string of testimonies
no less flattering and no less sincere; but I hasten
to produce these specimens, lest the suspicion of
infatuation follow me.
How was it that amidst such warm plaudits, Del-
sarte failed to win that popularity which, after all, is
the supreme sanction ? It must be acknowledged
that he took no great pains to gain the place which
was his due. If he loved glory like the true artist
that he was, “he never tired himself in its pursuit.”
Perhaps he had an instinctive feeling that it would
come to him some day unsought.
He might, in this regard, be reproached for the
tardiness of his successes; he himself made diffi-
culties and obstacles which might be considered as
the effects of extreme pride.
Halévy once suggested his singing at the Tuil-
leries before King Louis Philippe and his family.
“I only sing to my friends,” replied the artist.
“That is strange,” said the author of “The Jewess,”
“Lablache and Duprez go whenever they are asked.”
“T)elsarte does not.”
“But consider This is to be a party given by
the Crown Prince to his father.”

294 ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
This last consideration touched the obstinate
heart.
“Well! I will go,” he said, “but it is only on
three conditions: I must be the only singer; I am
to have the chorus from the Opera to accompany
me; and I am not to be paid.”
“You will establish a dangerous precedent.”
“Those are my irrevocable terms.”
All were granted. ſº
From his youth up Delsarte manifested this, per-
haps excessive, contempt for money. On one oc-
casion it was quite justifiable. Father Bambini had
taken him to a party where he was to sing on very
advantageous terms. The scholar was treated with
deference; but the teacher who had neither a fine
face nor the claims of youth to shield him against
aristocratic prejudice, was received much as a
servant would have been who had made a mistake
in the door.
The young singer felt the blood mantle his brow,
and his heart rebelled.
“Take your hat and let us go !” he said to his
old master.
“But why?” replied the good man. He had
heeded nothing but his pupil's success.
Delsarte dragged him away in spite of his pro-
tests, and lost by his abrupt departure the profits
of the evening.

CHAPTER XI.
DELSARTE'S FAMILY. tº
Delsarte married, in 1833, Miss Rosina Andrien.
The young husband felt a high esteem for his
father-in-law (primo basso cantante at the Opera);
but we must not suppose that this consideration
influenced his choice. He made a love marriage
such as one makes at the age of twenty-two, with
such a nature as his. Moreover, reason was never
in closer accord with love.
Miss Andrien was remarkably beautiful. She
was fifteen; her talent as a pianist had already won
her a first prize at the Conservatory. She was just
the companion, wise and devoted, to counterbalance
the flights of imagination and the momentary trans-
ports inherent in the temperament of many artists.
I pause, fearing to wound a modesty which I
know to be very sensitive: the living cannot bear
praise with the indifference of the dead; but I
must be allowed to insist upon the valuable assist-
ance which the young wife lent her husband in his
professional duties; this is a special part of my
subject. - t
Mme. Delsarte started with a genuine talent. The
situation in which she was placed, soon made her a
perfect accompanist. Never was there more per-
fect harmony between singer and player. Amid the

296 ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
incessant interruptions necessary to a lesson, the
piano never lagged a second either in stopping or
in going on again. The note fell promptly, identi-
cal with the first note of the piece under study. To
'attain to this obedient precision, one must possess
indomitable patience, must be willing to be utterly
effaced. Delsarte appreciated this self-denial in
proportion to the merit of her who practiced it.
In everything that concerned him, he relied
especially upon the Opinion of his accompanist; he
felt her to be an abler and more serious judge than
the most of those around him. But — with the shy
reserve of merit unacknowledged even to itself, -
the young woman shrank from expressing her im-
pressions. If I may judge by the anecdote which
follows, the artist was at times distressed by this.
One day Delsarte, granting one of those favors
of which he was never lavish, consented to sing a
composition of which he was particularly fond, to a
few friends. It was the air from Méhul's “Joseph : ”
“Vainly doth Pharaoh . . .”
Mme. Delsarte, always ready at the first call, took
her seat at the piano.
The master was in the mood — that is, in full pos-
session of all his powers. His pathos was heart-
rending.
“You won a great triumph,” I said to him ; “I
saw tears in Mme. Delsarte's eyes.”
“My wife's eyes,” he cried as if struck by sur-
prise, “are you quite sure ?”

DELSARTE'S FAMILY. 297
“Perfectly,” I replied.
He seemed greatly pleased. Putting aside all
other feeling, it was no slight triumph to move to
such a point one who assisted at and sat through his
daily lessons for hours at a time.
A few years sufficed to form a family around this
very young couple. It was soon a charming acces-
sory to see children fluttering about the house;
slipping in among the scholars; showing a furtive
head—dark or light—at one of the doors of the lec-
ture-room. Let me recall their names: The eldest
were Henri, Gustave, Adrien, Xavier, Marie; then
came after a long interval, André and Madeleine.
Delsarte loved them madly; for their future he
dreamed all the dreams of the Arabian Nights.
Meantime, he played with them so happily that he
seemed to take a personal delight in it.
He gave them all the joys of this life that were
within his reach, and it was well that he did so !
Alas! of the dreams of glory cherished for these
beloved beings, some few were realized, but many
faded promptly with the existence of those who
called them forth.
But we must not anticipate. At the time of
which I speak the children were growing and devel-
oping, each according to its nature, in full freedom.
Those who felt a vocation seized on the wing—
rather than they received from irregular lessons—
Some fragments of that great art which was taught
in the school.

Marie learned while very young to reproduce with
marvelous skill what were called the attitudes and
the physiognomic changes. Madeleine delighted in
making caricatures which showed great talent. The
features of certain pupils and frequenters of the
lectures were plainly recognizable in these sketches
made by a childish hand,
Gustave was a child of an open face and broad
shoulders. One incident will show his originality.
A strange lady came to the master's house one
day either to ask a hearing or offer a pupil. She met
this charming boy.
“M. Delsarte P’’ she asked.
“I am he, madam ' ' replied Gustave without
flinching.
“Very good,” said his questioner, laughing, “but
I wish to speak to your father.”
This same Gustave who, to a certain degree,
followed in his father's footsteps, was struck down
a few years after him, at the age of forty-two.
What a striking application of Victor Hugo's
lines:
“And both are dead.... Oh Lord, all powerful is thy right hand!”
Gustave's career seemed to open readily and
smoothly. Not that he could approach his father
from a dramatic point of view; he had not his abso-
lute synthesis of talents, and his figure was not suited
to the theatre; as asinger, his voice was weak, but what
a charm and what a style he had Although his voice

DELSARTE'S FAMILY. 299
was not adapted to every part, although he had not
that range of the vocal scale which permits one to at-
tack any and every composition, still, its sympathetic,
tender and penetrating quality did ample justice to
all that is most exquisite in romance. When you
had once heard that voice, guided by the force of
his father's grand method, you never forgot its sin-
cerity and melancholy; it haunted you and left you
impatient to hear it again.
As a concert-singer and teacher, Gustave Delsarte
might have won high rank. An ill-assorted marriage
and his misanthropic character prevented. As a
composer, he left some few songs, masses and relig-
ious fragments which are not without merit. When
he was to produce any of his sacred works, the com-
poser-singer never took a part; but he would lead
the orchestra. If he came to a rehearsal and the per-
formers appeared weak, a holy wrath would seize
upon Gustave. Then he flung a firm, incisive, accent-
uated"note into the midst of the choir, vivid as a spark
bursting from a fire covered with ashes. He would
accompany it with a glance which seemed to flash
from his father's eye; at such moments, he resembled
him ; but this transformation never lasted more than
a second ; the fictitious power disappeared as all
which was Gustave Delsarte was doomed to dis-
appear.
At least, his father did not live to mourn his loss.
And yet he knew that worst of heart-suffering: the
loss of a beloved child. Alas! In that radiant

family, whose mirth, fresh faces and luxuriant health
seemed to defy death, the implacable foe had already
twice swept his scythe.
The first to go was André, one of the latest born.
He was at the age when the child leaves no lasting
memories behind ; but we know the grace of inno-
cence, the privilege of impeccability by which
infancy atones for the lack of acquirements. Then
these little creatures have the mysterious entrancing
Smiles, which mothers understand and adore — and
Delsarte loved his children with a mother's heart.
Time lessens such pangs; but when a fresh sor-
row re-opened the era of calamity, it seems as if the
sad events trod upon each other's heels and the
interval between seems to have been but one unmiti-
gated agony.
The loss undergone in 1863 was even greater.
Xavier Delsarte was a tall, handsome young man.
The master was content with the profit which his
son had derived from his tuition. He was success-
ful as a singer and elocutionist. He was attacked by
cholera during an epidemic. The night before he
had taken several glasses of iced Orgeat in the
open air.
Xavier lived in the Rue des Batailles with his
family, but not in the same apartment. This fact
was fatal. Instead of calling help in the first stages
— unwilling to disturb his relatives — the invalid
wandered down stairs during the night, and into the
court-yard. There he drank water from the pump.


## p. 301 (#337) ############################################

DELSARTE's FAMILY. 3OI
I can still recall the unhappy father's story of that
cruel moment.
“It was scarcely day. I was waked by that un-
expected, fatal ringing of the bell, which, at such an
hour, always bodes misfortune. The maid heard it
also, and opened the door. She uttered a cry of
alarm. Almost instantly, my poor boy stood at my
chamber door. He leaned against the frame of the
door, his strength not allowing him to advance.
From the change in his features, I understood all—
he was hopelessly lost!”
Delsarte was sensitive and of a very loving nature;
but he was endowed with great strength. Much
absorbed, moreover, in his profession, his studies, his
innovations, he often found in them, a counterpoise
to these rude blows of fate. So when the thoughts
of his friends recur to these disasters, they feel that
their greatest sympathy and commiseration are due
to the mother who three times underwent this su-
preme martyrdom.
Two names remain to be mentioned in this family
where artistic callings seemed a matter of course. The
concerts of Madame Thérèsa Wartel — sister of
Madame Delsarte — brought together the élite of
Parisian virtuosi, and the brilliant pianist took her
part in the quatuors in which Sauzay, Allard, Franc.
homme and other celebrities of the period figured.
George Bizet–author of the opera of “Carmen"
— prematurely snatched from the arts, was the
nephew of François Delsarte. This young man

taught himself Sanscrit unaided; he inspired the
greatest hopes.
Wartel, who gave Christine Nilsson her musical
education, was not of the same blood, but we find
certain points in his method which recall the pro-
cesses of Delsarte's school.

CHAPTER XII.
DELSARTE'S RELIGION.
I now confront an important and very interesting
subject; but one which is more difficult to handle
than the most prickly briers. There has been
a confusion, in regard to Delsarte, of two very dis-
tinct things: his practical devotion and his philoso-
phy of art, which does indeed assume a religious
character. He himself helped on this confusion.
I am desirous of doing my best to put an end to it.
I hope that, truth and sincerity aiding, I shall not
find the task too great for me.
I must first grapple with those ill-informed per-
sons who have denied the master his high intellectual
faculties, and even his scientific discoveries, for the
sole reason of the mystical side of his beliefs. I
must also expose the error of those who supposed
that to this mysticism were attributable the miracles
accomplished by Delsarte in his career as artist and
scholar.
I was the better able to understand these two
opposing elements—religiousness and strength of
understanding—because, if I gave in my entire adhe-
sion to the innovator in the arts, he did not find me
equally docile in what concerned the theosophic
part of his doctrine. Hence, discussions which
illustrated the subject. I speak in presence of his
memory as I did before him, with perfect frankness

and simplicity of heart; taking care not to offend
the objects of his veneration, but examining without
regard to his memory, as without prejudice, the
influence which his convictions exerted upon his
intellectual conceptions, his ideas, his character, his
talent — in a word, his life, in so far as it may con-
cern a sketch which lays no claim to be a complete
biography.
Now, it is from the point of view of art itself that
I ask the following questions: Was Delsarte a devout
Catholic? Was he orthodox P
Devout? He gloried in it, he insisted on it; I
will not say that he affected minute daily acts of
devotion, for that word would not accord with the
spontaneity of his nature; but he accented his
demonstrations, he spoke constantly of his religion.
Without any intention to wrong the serious side of
his religious feelings, it seemed to be a bravado put
on for the incredulous, a toy which he converted into
a weapon.
Orthodox P He made it his boast, and he cer-
tainly intended to be so; he loved, in many circum-
stances, to show his humility of heart. His faith, he
used to say, “was the charcoal-burner's faith.”
And yet, the charcoal-burner would have been
strangely puzzled if he had had to sustain the cease-
less contests which the artist accepted or provoked
from philosophers and free-thinkers; and, perhaps,
no less frequently, from his fellow-religionists, and
the priests themselves.


## p. 305 (#341) ############################################

DELSARTE'S RELIGION. 305
With the former, it was a mere question of dog-
matic forms or of the necessity for some form of
religion; with the latter, he entered upon a more
peculiarly theological Order of ideas, such as the
attributes proper to each of the three divine persons,
and other mystical Subjects.
Here, as elsewhere, Delsarte brought to bear his
personality, his stamp, his breadth of comprehension.
I once asked him what some called Dominations
might represent, in the celestial classification ? He
replied: “If any one or anything forces itself upon
our mind, takes active possession of Our Soul, do
we not feel that we are under a certain domina-
tion P’’
He gave me several other explanations touching
the angelic hierarchy. I considered them very
poetic, very ingenious—but were they also orthodox P
I am not competent to judge.
It was impossible to say at the first glance, how
the influence of this theosophy made itself felt in
this sensitive character, full as it was of surprises.
Delsarte was born good, generous, above the petty
tendencies which deform and degrade the human
type. On these diverse points, religious faith could
scarcely show its effect; but he also declared himself
to be irritable and violent—he confessed to a danger-
Ous fickleness—still, he would readily have slandered
himself, in the interests of his faith.
Whatever the cause of this acquired serenity,
Delsarte did not always refuse to satisfy his native

()
impulses. I have already alluded to cases in which
these returns to impetuous vivacity occurred, and how
he rose above these relapses. Whether his peaceful
spirit arose from religious feeling, or whether it was
the result of moral strength, it breathed the spirit
of the gospel; but it must also be confessed that our
artist mingled with it much worldly grace. What
matters it? Uncertainty has no inconveniences in
such a matter.
It was particularly on the occasion of those
sudden fits of passion to which the human con-
science does not always attach due weight, that Del-
sarte laid great stress upon Supernatural intervention.
Oh what would he have done without that
powerful aid, with his lively sensibilities — with his
too loving heart?
I have no opinion to offer in regard to the shield
which efficacious grace and the palladium of the
faith may form for dangerous tendencies; for
Catholics, that is a matter for the casuist or the
confessor to decide; but, as far as Delsarte is con-
cerned, had he beaten down Satan in a way to
rouse the jealousy of St. Michael, had he made the
heathen Socrates give precedence to him in patience,
wisdom and firmness, I should regard that victory
as the triumph of the sacred principles of the
eternal morality, of that which sums up, in a single
group, all the supreme precepts of all religions and
all philosophies, rather than as a result of external
practices.

It is by placing myself at this culminating point,
that I have succeeded in explaining to my own Sat-
isfaction the true stimulus of the artist-thinker, in
spite of all appearances and all contradictions; and
everything leads me to believe that the elevation
of his mind and the inspiration of the art which he
taught and practiced, would have sufficed, in equal
proportion with his faith, “to deliver him from
evil.”
How could a man glide into the lower walks of
life, whose mission it was to set forth the types
of moral beauty by opposing them, to use his
phrase, “to the hideousnesses of vice?”
Now, talent and faith meet face to face. We are
to consider to what extent the one was dependent
upon the other; and whether, in reality, the artist
whom so many voices proclaimed “incomparable ’’
owed his vast superiority to acts of religious devo-
tion, to his adhesion to the dogmas of the church.
It is not arbitrarily that a transcendent intellect
pointed out a difference between religion and reli-
gions : every mind devoted to philosophy must
needs reach this distinction.
I shall keep strictly within the limits of that
which concerns art, in a question so vast and of
such great importance.
Religion is that need which all generations of men
have felt for establishing a relationship between
man and the Supreme power or powers whence man
supposes he proceeded. To some it is an outburst

3O8 ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
of gratitude and homage; to others, an instinct
of terror which makes them fall prostrate before an
unknown being upon whom they feel themselves
dependent, although they cannot know him, still
less define him.
Religions are all which men have established in
answer to those aspirations of the conscience, to
satisfy that intuition which forces itself upon our
mind so long as sophistry has not warped it. It
follows from this, that religions vary, are changed,
and may be falsified until the primitive meaning is
lost. But whatever may be the faith and the rites
of religions — whether fanaticism disfigure them or
fetichism make a caricature of them, whether politi-
cians use them as an ally, or the traces of the apos-
tolate fade beneath the materialism of speculation,--
there will always remain at the bottom, religion :
that is, the thought which keeps such or such a so-
ciety alive for a variable time, and which, in periods
of transition, seeks refuge in human consciences
awaiting a fresh social upward flight.
Well it was not the external part of his belief
which inspired Delsarte, when—to use the expres-
sion of the poet Reboul—“he showed himself like
unto a god l’” It was not the long rosary with its large
beads which often dangled at his side, that gave him
the secret of heart-tortures and soul-aspirations !
The charcoal-burner's faith would never have taught
him that captivating grace, that supreme elegance of
gesture and attitude, which made him matchless.


## p. 309 (#345) ############################################

DELSARTE's RELIGION. 3O9
Nor did theology and dogma teach him the moving
effects which made people declare that he performed
miracles, and led several writers (Henry de Riancey,
Hervet) to say: “That man is not an artist, he
is art itself!” And Fiorentino, a critic usually
severe and exacting, wrote: “This master's senti-
ment is so true, his style so lofty, his passion so pro-
found, that there is nothing in art so beautiful or so
perfect l”
Profound passion, lofty style, art itself, these are not
learned from any catechism. That chosen organism
bore within its own breast the fountains of beauty.
An artist, he derived thence an inward illumination,
and, as it were, a clear vision of the Ideal. If religion
was blended with it, it was that which speaks directly
to the heart of all beings endowed with poetry, to
those who are capable of vowing their love to the
worship of sublime things.
What I have just said will become more compre-
hensible if I apply to Delsarte those more especially
Christian words: The spirit and the letter.
Yes, in him there was the spiritual man and the
literal man; and if either compromised the other, it
was not in the eyes of persons who attended, regularly
enough to understand them, the lectures and lessons
of the brilliant professor.
This I have already said, and I shall dwell upon
this point, hoping to establish some harmony be-
tween those who taxed Delsarte with madness on
account of his positivism in the matter of faith, and

those who strove to connect with his devotional
habits everything exceptional which that great figure
realized in his passage through this world.
In fact, it is only by separating the Delsarte of
the Spirit from him of the letter, that we can form
any true idea of him. -
And the letter, once again —was it not art and
poetry that made worship so dear to him P The
shadowy light of the churches, the stern majesty of
the vaulted roof, contrasting with the radiant circle
of light within which reposed the sacred wafer-all
this pomp, of heathen origin, warmed for him the
Severe simplicity and cold austerity of Christian sen-
timent; the chants and prayers uttered in common
also stimulated the fervid impulses of his heart.
The spirit of proselytism took possession of him
later in life. It was controversy under a new form,
more attractive and more distracting. There was
always some soul within reach to be won to the
faith; some rebellious spirit to bend to the yoke of
the official church,-proceeding, under due observ-
ance of ostensible forms, from the letter | Neophytes
were very ready to listen. After all, it pledged
them to nothing, and they talked of other things
often enough to prevent the conversation from
becoming too much of a sermon. Then, certain
favors — all of a spiritual nature — were attached
to this situation: a place nearer the master during
lectures, a more affectionate greeting, a sweeter
smile.

DELSARTE'S RELIGION. 3 II
These attempts more than once resulted in disap-
pointment to Delsarte. I will not eliumcrate them
all. Often he was heard with increasing interest, it
seemed as if resistance must yield, and that he might
speedily plant his flag “in the salutary waters of
grace,” but at that very moment his opponent
would become more refractory and more stubborn
than ever.
Once, he had great hopes. Several young people
seemed decided to enter into the paths of virtue.
The master was radiant. “Take heed,” said skeptic
prudence, “perhaps it is only a means of stimulating
your zeal, of profiting better by your disinterested-
ness.”
He soon acknowledged the truth of these predic-
tions; he confessed it in his moments of candor.
One of these feigned converts, especially, scan-
dalized him. The story deserves repetition:
The church of the Petits-Pères had ordered the
wax figure of a freshly canonized saint, from Rome.
Delsarte mentioned it to the school, and several
pupils went to see it.
“Ah, sir!” cried young D. on his return, “now,
indeed, I am a Catholic How lovely she is, how
fresh and fair after lying underground so long !”
“ Unhappy fellow !” said the disappointed artist,
“he takes the image for the reality, and the beauty
of a waxen St. Philomena has converted him.”
The young man had heard that the preservation
of the flesh, after a hundred years’ burial, counted

for much in canonization, if it did not suffice to jus-
tify it; and as the place where they had deposited
the sacred image was dark, D. had taken for life
itself the pink and white complexion common to
such figures before time has yellowed them.
Delsarte ended by being amused at his credulity;
he laughed readily and was not fond of Sulking.
Nor must we forget that this prečminent tragedian
was a perfect comedian, and that this fact entitled
him to true enjoyment of the humorous side of life.
Have I not somewhere read: “Beware of those who
never laugh !”
Delsarte's piety — I speak of that of the letter —
was seldom morose. It did not forbid juvenile ca-
prices; it overlooked venial sins.
One Sunday he took his scholars to Nanterre,
some to perform, others to hear, a mass of his own
composition. A few friends joined the party. The
mass over, they wandered into the country in groups.
Some walked ; some sat upon the grassy turf. The
air was pleasant, the conversation animated; time
passed quickly.
Suddenly the vesper bell was heard. Some one
drew Delsarte's attention to it—not without a tiny
grain of malice.
“Master, what a pity—you must leave us.”
He made no answer.
When the second summons sounded, the same
voice continued :
“There's no help for it; for us poor sinners, it's

no matter | But you, master, you cannot miss the
mass 1 ''
He put his hand to his head and considered.
“Bah l’ he cried boldly, “I’ll send my children.”
Let me give another trait in illustration of the
nature which from time to time pierced through and
rent the flimsy fabric of his opinions. This anecdote
is a political One.
Despite the precedent of an ultra democratic
grandfather, and all his plebeian tendencies as a phi-
lanthropist and a Christian, his Catholic friends had
inclined him toward monarchical ideas—although he
never actually sided with the militant portion of the
party.
On one occasion, it happened that the two wings
of this politico-religious fusion disagreed. As at
Nanterre, Delsarte acted independently, and on this
occasion politics were the victim. It fell out as
follows: -
A claimant of the throne of France, still young,
finding himself in the Eternal City, had not, to all
appearance, fulfilled his duties to the Vatican
promptly. -
The first time that Delsarte encountered certain
of those zealous legitimists, who are said to be
“more royalist than the king,” he launched this
apostrophe at their heads: -
“I hear that your young man was in no haste to
pay his respects to His Holiness.”
Thus, always free—even when he seemed to have

forged chains for himself—he obeyed his impulse
without counting the cost. Never mind | This
childish outburst must have gladdened the manes of
the ancestor who connected the syllables in the
patronymic name of Delsartel
I hope I shall not forget, as my pen moves along,
any of these memories, insignificant to many minds,
no doubt, but serving to distinguish this figure from
the vast mass of creation. If, among my readers,
some may say “pass on,” others will enjoy these
trifles, and will thank me for writing them.
Thus, Delsarte was always pleased to think he
bore the name of François in memory of Francis
of Assisi—not the Spaniard whom we know, but the
great saint of the twelfth century; he who “ap-
peased quarrels, settled differences, taught slaves and
common men, the poor man who was good to the
poor.”
“The fish, the rabbits and the hares,” the legend
says, “placed themselves in this fortunate man's
lmands.” ” * * * The birds were silent or
sang at his command “Be silent,” said the saint
to the swallows, “’tis my turn to talk now.” And
again: “My brothers, the birds, you have great
cause to praise your Creator, who covered you with
such fine feathers and gave you wings to fly through
the clear, broad fields of air.” -
One need not be very devout to be attracted by
such graceful simplicity.
Delsarte went farther. Whether he accepted this

DELSARTE'S RELIGION. 3 I 5
magnetic attraction as true or whether he regarded
it as purely symbolic — for this kind of miracle is
not dependent on faith, – he considered the monk
of Assisi as a lover of nature, whose heart was big
enough to love everything that lives, to suffer with
all that suffers. He strove to comprehend him by
placing him upon a pinnacle, well aware that the
sublime often lurks between the trifling.
It was on such occasions that the man of intellect
revived to ennoble and illumine everything. If,
despite his magnificent rendering of them, Delsarte
never called legendary fictions in question, let us
not refuse him that privilege. In such cases the
poetry became his accomplice, and – “Every poet
is the toy of the gods,” as Béranger says, a simple
Song-writer, as Delsarte was a simple singer.
There was in him whom Kreutzer called “the
apostle of the grand dramatic style,” a desire, I will
not say for realism, but for realization, for action.
Thus he once had a fancy to join the semi-clerical
society of the third order; it was a way of keeping
himself in practice, since there were various pre-
scriptions, observances and interdictions attached to
the office. One must repeat certain prayers every
day, and submit to a certain severity of costume.
No precious metal, not even a thread of gold or sil-
ver must be seen about one. In the first moments
of fervor, a beautiful green velvet cap, beautifully
embroidered in gold — the loving gift of some
pupil or admirer, — was interdicted, that is to say,

was shut up in a closet or reduced to the con-
dition of a mere piece of bric-à-brac. Luckily, the
association did not require eternal vows, and I think
I saw the pretty article restored to its proper use
later on.
Another attempt—and this was his own crea-
tion — tempted this inquiring mind; he wished to
pay especial homage, under some novel form,
to the Holy Trinity. The adepts were to be called
£he Trinitarians. In the founder's mind, this start-
ing-point was to be the seed for a sort of confrater-
nity with the mark of true friendship and unity of
faith.
This dream was never realized, apparently, for it
seems that the association could never number more
than three members at a time: so that it was in
number only that it justified its title. Delsarte was
very fond of these few adherents. “The Trini-
tarians— where are the Trinitarians?” was some-
times the cry at a lecture. It was the voice of the
master who had reserved a seat of honor for each
of them. This is all I ever knew about this society,
and I have reason to think that it never got beyond
a few talks among the members upon the subject
which united them.
It is not without reluctance that I expose his
weaknesses; but timid as the steps must ever be
which are taken upon historic ground, we must
walk in daylight. No one, moreover, could regard
this effervescence of a sentiment noble in its source,


## p. 317 (#353) ############################################

DELSARTE'S RELIGION. 3I 7
as a want of intellectual liberty. It was the af-
fectionate side of his nature which at moments
dimmed his reason, but never went So far as to put
out its light. I need not attempt to defend on this
point one, of whom Auguste Luchet wrote:
“It is by his soul and his science that he lifts you,
transports you, strikes you, shatters you with terror,
anguish and love ”
And Pierre Zaccone says:
“He is an artist, apart, exceptional, perhaps
unique !. with what finished art, what talent, what
GENIUS, he uses the resources of his voice ”
That which best atoned in Delsarte for the grain
of fanaticism with which he was reproached, was
the tolerance which prevailed in every controversy,
in every dissension. If he sometimes blamed free
thought, he never showed ill will to free-thinkers.
In the spirit of the gospel — so different from the
spirit of the devout party — he was “all things to
all men.” He was on a very friendly footing with
a priest whom, by his logic and his sincerity, he had
prevailed upon to forsake the ecclesiastical calling.
In our discussions, which dealt with secondary
subjects of various forms of belief – for I never
denied God, or the soul and its immortality, or the
freedom of the will which is the honor of the hu-
man race, or the power of charity, provided it be-
come social and fraternal, instead of merely alms-
giving as it has been,_ in these debates, sometimes
rather lively, I would end by saying to him: “You

know that I love and seek truth; very well ! if God
wished me to join the ranks in which you serve, he
would certainly give me a sign; but so long as I
do not receive His summons, what have I to do
with it?”
I spoke his own language, and he yielded to my
reasoning. “Come,” he would say, “I prefer your
frankness to the pretenses of feigned piety; ” and
he would add sorrowfully: “Alas! I often encounter
them ” So we always ended by agreeing, and this
truce lasted — until our next meeting.
The words which I have just quoted prove that
if Delsarte clung to the Catholic dogmas, he was
particularly touched by the sincere piety and active
charity of simple, evangelic hearts. I may give yet
another proof of this.
To satisfy his sympathies as much as to rescue
his clan, when attacked, he would always quote a
father confessor, one Father Pricette — this name
should be remembered in the present age — who,
during the icy nights of December, slept in an arm-
chair, because he had given his last mattress to
some one poorer than himself.

CHAPTER XIII.
DELSARTE'S FRIENDS.
Friendly relations—although disputes often arose
— were established toward I 84O between Delsarte
and Raymond Brucker (known to literature as
Michel Raymond). Fortunately in spite of the in-
fluence of the author of “Mensonge,” Delsarte's
superior rank always prevailed in this intimacy.
Michel Raymond published several novels in the
first half of this century. Later on, he took his
place in the ranks of that militia of Neo-Catholics,
the fruit of the Restoration. (I do not know
whether I am justified in giving the name of Neo-
Catholic to Brucker; perhaps, on the contrary, his
dreams were all of the primitive church. But, in
spite of his Jewish crudities, I suppose he would
never have joined the followers of Father Loyson.)
His keen, sharp and caustic spirit did not forsake
him when he changed his principles; and never did
the Christ — whose symbol is a lamb without a
stain — have a sterner or more warlike zealot.
In appearance, Brucker had somewhat the look
of a Mephistopheles — a demon then very much in
vogue, especially when he laughed, his laughter
being full of sardonic reserves. If Delsarte's mode
of proselyting was almost always gentle, affection-
ate, adapted to the spirit he aspired to conquer,


## p. 320 (#356) ############################################

32O ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
that of Raymond Brucker had an aggressive fashion;
he became brutal and cynical when discussion
waxed warm.
Once, in reply to one of his vehement attacks
against the age, in which he used very unparlia-
mentary expressions, he drew upon himself the fol-
lowing answer from a woman : “But, sir, I should
think that in the ardor of your recent convictions,
your first act of faith should have been to make
an auto-da-fé of all the books signed Michel Ray-
mond.”
I repeat, this writer, although of undoubted in-
tellectual merit, could not annul Delsarte's native
tendencies; he could never have led Delsarte into
any camp which the latter had not already decided
to join ; but when they met on common ground, he
influenced, excited and sometimes threw a shadow
over him. -
When they had fought together against the near-
est rebel, long and lively discussions would often
arise between them, but they always agreed in the
end : the artist's good-nature so willed it.
If dissension continued, if the fiery friend had
given cause for reproach, Delsarte merely said:
“Poor Brucker | " But how much that brief phrase
could be made to mean in the mouth of a man who
taught an actor to say, “I hate you !” by uttering
the words, “I love you,” and who could ring as
many changes on one sentence as the thought, the
feeling, the occasion, could possibly require.


## p. 321 (#357) ############################################

DELSARTE'S FRIENDS. 32 I
Do not suppose, however, that Delsarte abused
his power. Contrary to many actors who carry
their theatrical habits into their private life, he
aimed at the most perfect simplicity outside of the
rôles which he interpreted. “I make myself as
simple as possible,” he would say, “to avoid all
suspicion of posing.” But still he could not entirely
rid himself, in conversation, of those inflections
which illuminate words and are the genuine mani-
festation of the inner meaning.
Be this as it may, the relation between our two
converts assumed the proportions of friendship,
doubtless in virtue of the mysterious law which
makes contrast attractive.
Hegel says: “The identical and the non-identical
are identical; ” and this proposition passes for non-
sense. Perhaps if he had said: “May become
identical,” it would be understood that he meant to
speak, in general, of that reconciliation of contra-
ries which united the calm genius of Delsarte
and the bristling, prickly spirit of Raymond
Brucker.
One motive particularly contributed to the union;
Brucker was unfortunate in a worldly sense. Del-
sarte, improvident for the future and scorning money,
still had, during the best years of his professorship,
a relatively comfortable home. He loved to have
his friend take advantage of it. Large rooms, well
warmed in winter, a simple table, but one which
lacked no essential article, were of no small impor-
2 I

tance to one whose scanty household had naught
but sorrow and privation to offer.
How many evenings they spent together in dis-
sertations which often ended in nothing — and how
often the dawn surprised them before they were
weary !
For Brucker it was a refuge, but for Delsarte,
what a waste of time and strength taken from his
real work | That wasted time might have sufficed to
fix and produce certain special points in his method.
Then, too, his health demanded greater care.
Take it for all in all, this intimacy was perhaps
more harmful than helpful to Delsarte. Yet I have
been told that Raymond Brucker urged the innova-
tor to elaborate his discovery, and often reproached
him with his negligence in pecuniary matters. It
was he who said: “François Delsarte's system is an
orthopedic machine to straighten crippled intel-
lects.”
I have also heard in favor of Raymond Brucker,
that that mind so full of bitterness, that inquisitor
in partibus, was most tender toward a child in his
family, and that he bore his poverty bravely. I
desire to note these eulogies side by side with the
less favorable reflections which I considered it my
duty to write down here. I recall a short anecdote
which will serve to close the Brucker story.
As we have said, they were seldom parted. One
day Delsarte had agreed to dine with the family of a
pupil. As he was on his way thither, he met his

DELSARTE'S FRIENDS. 323
inseparable friend. From that moment his only
thought was to excuse himself from the dinncr;
but his hosts were reluctant to give up such a
guest; they insisted — they were offended.
“Pardon me,” said Delsarte; “I really cannot
stay ! I had forgotten that Brucker was to dine
with me.”
“But that can be arranged M. Brucker can
join us. Suppose we send and ask him P”
“You need not,” replied the master; “if you
are willing, I will call him; he is waiting for me be-
low at the corner.”
They had acted as children do, when one says to
the other on leaving school:
“Wait a minute for me, I'll ask mamma if you
can come and dine with us.”
Brucker, who after all knew how to be agreeable
when he chose, took his place at the table, and all
went well. w
This proves yet once again the extent to which
Delsarte possessed that charming simplicity so well
suited to all distinction.
In the dissertations upon religious subjects inces-
santly renewed about Delsarte, it was sometimes
declared that “great sinners were surer of salvation
than the most perfect unbelievers in the world.”
A young man; who doubtless felt himself to be
in the first category, once said to the master:
“My friend, the good God has been too kind to
me! I disobey him, I offend against his laws. . . .

324 ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
I repent, and he accepts my prayer | I relapse into
sin — and he forgives me! Decidedly, the good
God is a very poltroon "
This seems to exceed the unrestrained ease and
confidence usual toward an earthly father; but we
must not forget that the inflection modifies the
meaning of a phrase, and that poltroon may mean
adorable.
This penitent, now famous, carried his provoca-
tion of the inexhaustible goodness very far. At
one time in his life he tried to blow out his brains !
By a mere chance — he probably said, by a mira-
cle, the wound was not mortal; but he always
retained the accusing scar. I never knew whether
this unpleasant adventure preceded or followed Mr.
L.'s conversion, or whether it was coincident with
one of the relapses of which that repentant sinner
accused himself.
Another very religious friend was no less fragile
in the observance of his firm vow. Becoming a
widower, he swore eternal fidelity to the “departed
angel.” Soon after, he was seen with another wife
on his arm
“And your angel ?” whispered a sceptic in his
€3.1".
“Oh, my friend l’’ was the reply, “this one is
an archangel.”
Another figure haunted Delsarte and afforded
yet another proof of his tolerance. The Italian,
C , shared neither his political ideas nor his re-

ligious heliefs; he was one of those refugees whom
the defeats of the Carbonari have cast upon our
soil, and whose necessities France—does our neigh-
bor remember this? — for years supplied, as if they
were her own children. However, she could offer
them but a precarious living.
Signor C., to give Some charm to his wretched
existence, desired to add to his scanty budget a
strong dose of hope and intellectual enjoyment:
hope in—what came later — the independence and
unity of Italy. By way of diversion, this stranger
gratified himself by indulging in a whim; he had
dreams of a panacea, a plant whose complex virtues
should combat all the evils which fall to the lot of
poor humanity; but this marvel must be sought in
America. And how was he to get there, when he
could barely scrape together the necessary five
cents to ride in an omnibus ! The Isabellas of our
day do not build ships for every new Columbus who
desires to endow the world with some wonderful
treasure trove | And yet this man was not mad;
he was one of those who prove how many insane
ideas a brain may cherish, without being entitled to
a cell in Bedlam or Charenton.
While awaiting the realization of his golden
dreams, poor C. spent his time in perpetual adora-
tion of the Talma of Music — for so Théophile
Gautier styled Delsarte; he never missed a lec-
ture; he took part in the talks which lengthened

out the evening when the parlor was at last cleared
of superfluous guests.
Among his many manias—how many people have
this one in common with him l—the Italian cherished
the idea that he was of exceptional ability, and that
in more than one direction. He proclaimed that
Delsarte went far beyond everything that he knew—
equal to all that could be imagined or desired
in regard to art—but as for himself, C., was he not
from a land where art is hereditary, where it is
breathed in at every pore, from birth P And more
than the mass of his countrymen, did he not feel
the volcanic heat of the sacred fire burning within
him P -
One evening, he made a bold venture. He had
prepared a tirade written by Some Italian poet. All
that I remember of it is that it began with the words:
“Trema — Trema / " [Tremble — Tremble !]
The impromptu tragedian recited several lines in
a declamatory tone accompanied by gestures to
match. Delsarte listened without a sign of praise
or blame. Then he rose, struck an attitude appro-
priate to the text, but perfectly natural, and, in his
quiet way, said:
“Might not you as well give it in this key?” Then,
in a voice of repressed harshness, his gestures sub-
dued but expressive of hatred, he repeated the two
words: “ Trema — Tremza A ’’ 4.
The listeners shuddered. Delsarte had produced
one of those effects which can never be forgotten.

The smouldering ashes did not burn long; four syl-
lables were enough to extinguish the flame.
Following, not the chronological order, but that
of circumstances and incidents calculated to throw
light on my subject, I must once more retrace the
course of years.
C.'s persistency went on before and after 1848.
During the second period, all minds were greatly
agitated by the state of politics. C., in spite of his
undoubted liberalism — he spent a great part of his
leisure in making democratic Constitutions—thought,
like every, other claimant, that he had duties to per-
form , and that he might as well, to facilitate his
task, make an ally of the Emperor, without scruple;
but access to royalty was no less impossible than
landing on the American shore where his panacea
grew. He hit upon the following plan:
A number of ladies were to go in a body and im-
plore Napoleon III to pardon certain exiles: for the
same calamities always follow civil war, and there
are always women ready to beg for justice or mercy.
C., who knew their purpose, said to one of the
petitioners: “How are you going to make the Em-
peror understand that I am the only man capable
of saving the situation?”
The petition was not presented; and the world
remains to be saved
Our Italian had another specialty: he was perpet-
ually in search of some notorious somnambulist. It
is a well-known fact that the mental agitation caused

by governmental crises is very favorable to these
pythonesses of modern times. Each wishes to outrun
the future and to afford himself at least an illusion
of the triumph of his party. The Oracles varied ac-
cording to the opinion of the person who magnet-
ized these ladies, and, often, according to the pre-
sumed desire of the audience.
Delsarte allowed himself to be drawn into these
mysteries. He had time for everything. It afforded
him relaxation, and a means of observation. On
One occasion, he followed the refugee to a garden
where a person of “perfect lucidity" prophesied.
The Sibyl was a believer as well as a seer and pre-
tended to communicate with God in person. I do
not know exactly what supernal secrets the woman
revealed, while she slept, but the result was ridicu-
lous. -
They had forgotten to fix the hour for the next
sitting: so, to repair the Omission — by means of a
few passes — the Somnambulist was restored to sleep
and lucidity. Then in a corner of the garden, in a
familiar tone and—to use the popular expression—
“as if talking to her equal,” she began this colloquy
in which, as may well be imagined, the voice of
Jehovah was not heard :
“My God, what day shall we return ?”
“He says Wednesday,” announced the lady.
“Thank you, God l’’
If the Italian went into ecstasies over this irrever-
ent trifling, Delsarte did not disdain to caricature

it, and gave us a most comical little performance.
Here again we see how he could transform every-
thing, and make something out of nothing !
Among the frequenters of his lectures was an
artist whom I would gladly mention for his talent
if I did not fear to annoy him by connecting his
name with an incident concerning him. I relate it
in the hope of somewhat diverting my readers, to
whom I must so often discourse of serious things.
Mr. P. painted a portrait of Delsarte as a young
man. The features are exact, the pose firm and
dignified, the eye proud. The painter and the
model were on very good terms and sympathized
in religious matters. It must have been the master
who brought him over. He still burned with the
zeal peculiar to recent converts; to such a point
that even on a short excursion into the country, he
could not await his return to Paris to approach the
stool of repentance. This desire seemed easily sat-
isfied; what village is without a father confessor
So, one fine day, the artist rang at the first par-
Sonage he could find. The priest's sister opened
the door — offered him a seat—and told him that
her brother was away. But, after these prelimina-
ries, the lady seemed uneasy. She inquired what
the stranger wanted.
“To speak with the priest.”
What could this stranger have to say to him?
Such was the question which floated in her eyes,
amidst the confused phrases in which she strove to

gain an explanation. Mr. P. finally told her that
he had come to confess.
“My brother will not return till very late,” said
the poor girl, unable to disguise her distress.
“I will wait !” replied the traveler.
“Oh, sir, I hope you will not l”
He thought he heard her mutter: “We read such
things in the papers ”
The visitor at last perceived that she took him for
a thief, and he could not depart quickly enough.
One more anecdote :
François Delsarte called himself a bad citizen,
because he disliked to undertake the duties entailed
by reason of the national guard—a dignity long de-
manded by the advanced party of the day, but of
which they soon wearied.
I think that the artist's infractions were often
overlooked, and his reasons for exemption were
never too closely scanned. And yet, the soldier-
citizen was one day arraigned before a council of
discipline, which, without regard for this representa-
tive of the highest personages of fiction, condemned
him to three days' imprisonment.
It was as if they had imprisoned saltpetre in com-
pany with a bunch of matches — but he restrained
his rebellious feelings; he would not give his judges
the satisfaction of knowing his torment. He soon
thought only of procuring consolation: he sum-
moned his friends, who visited him in throngs.
Then he made the acquaintance of his companions

in misfortune. There was one especially, who,
alone, would have made up to him for all the incon-
veniences of his forced arrest.
The first time that this prisoner entered the room
where the other prisoners were assembled, he looked
at them with the most solemn air, put his hand to
his forehead, made a military salute, and in grave
tones, as if beginning a harangue, he uttered these
words:
“Captives — I salute you !”
It was strangely pertinent. Delsarte was not
behindhand in comic gravity. This little scene
enlivened him. -
Another compensation fell to the lot of our cap-
tive. One of the prisoners sang him a song, one
stanza of which lingered in his memory. I tran-
scribe it:
“I was born in Finisterre,
At Quimperlay I saw the light.
The sweetest air is my native air,
My parish church is painted white
Oh! so I sang, I sighed, I said,
How I love my native air,
And parish church so bright!”
These lines, written by some Breton minstrel, in-
spired one of those sweet, plaintive airs which the
drawling voice of the drovers sing as they return at
nightfall; one of those airs. which seem to follow
the brook down the valleys, and which repeat the
echoes of the mountains, in the far distance.
Oh! how Delsarte used to murmur it; it made
one homesick for Brittany

CHAPTER XIV.
DELSARTE'S SCHOLARS.
To get one's bearings in that floating population
(where persistency and fidelity are rare qualities)
which haunts a singing-School, it is well to make
classifications. In Delsarte's case, the novelty of
his processes, his extraordinary reputation among
the art-loving public, the length of time which he
insisted was necessary for complete education, all
combined to produce an incessant ebb and flow
of pupils.
Therefore, I must distinguish.
First, there were those, brought by Delsarte's
generosity, whose only resource was a vocation more
or less favored by natural gifts. He would say:
“Come one, come all.” But, of course, many were
called, and few were chosen, the majority only mak-
ing a passing visit.
Then there were the finished artists. They took
private lessons, coming to beg the master to put
the finishing touch to their work, hoping to gain
from him something of that spiritual flame which
consecrates talent. I shall not undertake to speak
of all, but I must quote a few names.
One winter day, says Za Patrie for June 18, 1857,
a woman, beautiful and still young, visited Delsarte,

DELSARTE'S SCHOLARS. 333
begging him to initiate her into the mysteries of
Gluck's style:
“You are the greatest known singer,” she said;
“no one can enter into the work of the great mas-
ters and seize their most secret thought as you do ;
teach me !”
“Who are you ?” asked François Delsarte.
“Henrietta Sontag,” replied the stranger.
Madame Barbot had a moment of great triumph,
and was summoned to Russia at the period of her
success in Paris. She was perhaps the master's best
imitator; she had somewhat of his tragic emotion,
his style, his gesture; then what did she lack to
equal him P. She lacked that absolute sine gua mon
of art and poetry—personality. She added little of
her own.
Even among those who could neither hear his
lectures nor follow his lessons, Delsarte had disci-
ples. A great singing-teacher, whom I knew at
Florence, was eager to learn everything concerning
the method. I often heard him ask a certain young
girl, as he read a score: “You were Delsarte's
pupil; tell me if he would have read this as I have
done P ''
Even the famous Jenny Lind made the journey
from London to Paris, expressly to hear the great
singer.
At his lectures were seen from time to time: M.
and Mme. Amand Chevé, Mlle. Chaudesaigues, M.
Mario Uchard — who, after his marriage, asked for

elocution lessons for his wife (Madeleine Brohan),
— Mlle. Rosalie Jacob, whose brilliant vocalization
never won the renown which it deserved, Mme.
Carvalho, who was not one of the regular attendants,
but who trained her rare talent as a light singer,
there, before the very eyes of her fellow pupils,
Géraldon, who was very successful in Italy, under
the name of Géraldoni.
Then, there was Mme. de B , who appeared
at the opera under the name of Betty; a beauty
with a fine voice. This artist did not perfect her
talents, being in haste to join the theatre in Rue
Lepelletier, under the shield of another master. Al-
though well received by the public, she soon gave
up the profession.
A memory haunts me, and I cannot deny it a
few lines. -
Mme. M. may have been eighteen when she
began to study singing with Delsarte, together with
her husband, who was destined for a similar career.
She had an agreeable voice, but a particularly
charming face, the freshness of a child in its cradle,
a sweet expression of innocence. In figure she was
tall and slender. The lovely creature always looked
like a Bengal rose tossing upon its graceful stalk.
These young students considered themselves finished
and made an engagement with the manager of a
theatre in Brazil.
“Don’t do it,” said Delsarte to the husband,
knowing his suspicious nature, “that is a dangerous
region; you will never bring your wife back alive.”

He prophesied but too truthfully.
Soon after, we heard that the fair songstress had
been shot dead by the hand of the husband who
adored her. I like to think that she was innocent
of more than imprudence. The story which reached
us from that distant land was, that M. M. threat-
ened to kill his wife if she continued to associate
with a certain young man.
“You would never do it !” she said.
She did not reckon on the aberrations of jealousy.
It was said, in excuse for the murderer, that she
had defied him, saying:
“I love him, and I do not love you !”
After the catastrophe, the unfortunate husband
gave himself up to justice. No case was found
against him, but how he must have suffered when
he had forever cut himself off from the sight of that
enchanting creature
Three figures stand preeminent in the crowd:
Darcier, Giraudet, Madame Pasca.
I will proceed in order of seniority.
The first named did not attend the lectures when
I did, but I often heard him mentioned in society
where he attracted attention by his rendering of
Delsarte's “Stanzas to Eternity,” Pierre Dupont's
“Hundred Louis d'or,” and many other impressive
or dramatic pieces. I know the master considered
him possessed of much aptitude and feeling for art.
They met one evening at a large party given by
a high official of the day. Darcier sang well, in

Delsarte's opinion; but it was perhaps too well
for a public made up of fashionables, not con-
noisseurs.
“It takes something more than talent to move
them,” thought the real judge, annoyed; and with
that accent familiar to well-bred people, which trans-
figures a triviality, he said to the singer: -
“Let them have the bread / ‘’
He referred to a political song ending with these
lines:
“Ye cannot hush the moan
Of the people when they cry: “We hunger . . .”
For it is the cry of nature,
They want bread, bread, bread ' "
The guests were forced to give the attention which
it demanded to this cry which aroused the idea of
recent seditions, and the performer came in for his
share.
This artist may still be heard, but his talents are
displayed in so narrow a circle that his reputation
is a limited one. Yet it is said that his compositions
and his mode of singing them attest to great vigor.
Darcier, it seems, always retained a strong feeling
of devotion for his master. He has been heard
to say: “I fear but two things — Delsarte and
thunder.”
Alfred Giraudet joined the grand opera as primo
basso cantante. He was warmly received by the
press, and had already won a name at the Opéra
Comique and at concerts. In this singer may be

noted the firmness of accent and scholarly mode of
phrasing, always in harmony with the prosody of the
language, which are part of the tradition of the great
school. He always bears himself well on the stage,
and the sobriety of his gesture is a salutary
example which some of his present colleagues would
do well to imitate.
He, too, was a loyal Soul; he always regarded it
as an honor to bear the title of pupil of Delsarte,
the latter always writing to him as my dear and last
disciple. I owe many of the memories and docu-
ments used in this volume to his kindness.
Alfred Giraudet always took his audience captive
when he sang Malherbe's verses — music by Réber
— of which each strophe ends with the following
lines:
“Leave these vanities, put them far behind us,
'Tis God who gives us life,
'Tis God whom we should love.”
The broad, sustained style, so appropriate to the
words of the melody, finds a sympathetic interpre-
ter in the young artist.
Delsarte gave this with great maestria. The finale,
particularly, always transports the listeners.
If any one can revive the tradition of the master's
teachings, it is certainly Giraudet, who understands
the method and appreciates its high import.
Madame Pasca was one of the latest comers; her
advent was an event. There were pupils in the
school who were destined for the theatre, and there
22

were women of society; the future artist of the
Gymnase partook of both phases. She had the
advantages of a vocation and of a careful education;
her fortune allowed her to dress elegantly, with the
picturesqueness imparted by artistic taste.
Chance, or a presentiment of Speedy Success, led
her to take her place, on the first day, very near the
master, in a peculiar seat — a sort of Small, low
easy chair which inspired one with a sense of non-
chalance. She was in full sight. Her gaze, pro-
found and sombre at times. roamed over the room
with the natural air of a meditative queen. She in-
spired all beholders with curiosity and interest. The
feeling which she aroused in her fellow-pupils was
less distinct. Her rare advantages caused a vague
fear in those who hitherto had securely held the
foremost rank; her beauty created a sense of rivalry,
unconscious for the most part, and yet betrayed by
countless signs.
There was a flutter of excitement throughout the
school. This increased when the young woman con-
firmed, by her first efforts, all that her agreeable ap-
pearance and fascinating voice had promised. She
declaimed a fragment from Gluck's “Armida’’ which
other pupils sang; a word sufficed to change inter-,
est to Sympathy. 3.
That accent touched , all hearts. What visible
grief and what a sense of suppressed tears when in
her grave, slow tones she uttered the phrase:
“You leave me, Rinaldo Oh, mortal pain ”

DELSARTE'S SCHOLARS. 339
The master soon obtained from this marvellous
aptness, what is rarely acquired, even after long years
of study: dramatic effects free from all hint of
charlatanism. The distinguishing point between
Madame Pasca and Madame Barbot is, that the
latter, while observing all the rules of the method,
avoided servile imitation.
Delsarte was all the more delighted at his success,
because he had revealed to his scholar her true call-
ing. Madame Pasca came to him for singing-
lessons, but her large, strongly-marked voice had
little range. She was directed toward the art which
she afterward practiced, and began her studies
with tragedy. Some idea of what she did in this
field may be formed from the effect which she pro-
duced in pathetic scenes, where the comedy allowed
her serious voice to show its power and penetrating
tone.
I need not speak of Madame Pasca's success at
the Gymnase and abroad. It is known and un-
doubted. Still she lacks the consecration of the
stage where Mars and Rachel shone. When this
artist left the school to enter upon her career, Del-
Sarte said to her:
“My dear child, you will spend your life in aton-
ing for the crime of being my pupil.”
He was right, for Madame Pasca has no place at
the Français yet.
I can speak from hearsay merely, of the lessons
in elocution and declamation intended for preachers

— particularly for the fathers of the Oratory, -
never having been present at them. I only know
that Father Monsabre and other famous ecclesi-
astics took lessons from François Delsarte.

CHAPTER XV.
DELSARTE'S MUSICAL COMPOSITIONS.
Delsarte paid but little attention to musical com-
position; still his musical works prove that he would
have succeeded here as elsewhere, had he devoted
himself particularly to the task.
To say nothing of six fine vocal exercises and a
number of songs which had their day, his “Stanzas
to Eternity” were highly popular. A mass by him
was performed in several churches; but his “Last
Judgment,” especially, ranks him among serious
composers.
This setting of the Dies /ræ is touching and
severe; the melody is broad, Sombre, threatening;
the accompaniment reminds one of the dull rattling
of the skeletons reassuming their original shape.
One seems to hear the uneasy hum of voices roused
from long sleep.
One incident showed the importance of this work.
Various pieces of concerted music were being re-
hearsed one night at the church of St. Sulpice, for
performance during the solemnity of “the work of
St. Francis de Xavier.” A close circle formed
around the musicians; private conversation added
a discordant note to the harmony; the church
echoed back the footsteps of people walking to
and fro.


## p. 342 (#378) ############################################

342 ARN AUD ON DELSARTE.
The Dies /ræ came ! The music at first imitates
the angel trumpets which, according to Christian
belief, are to be heard when time sha// end. The
summons sounded four times.
This mournful chant of reawakening generations
instantly silenced every voice and every step; all
were motionless ; and the solemn melody alone
soared to the vaulted roof.
A touching story is told of this work. At a large
and miscellaneous gathering, M. Donoso-Cortes, a
well-known Spanish publicist, then ambassador to
Paris, begged Delsarte to sing his Dies /ræ. A
space was cleared in the music-room.
The score of the symphony for voice and piano,
made by Delsarte himself, retains all his intentions
and effects, to which his striking voice added greatly.
Delsarte began : -
“Dies irae, dies illa,
Solvet saeclum in favilla,
Teste David cum sybilla.”
The whole assembly were taken captive. M.
Donoso-Cortes was particularly moved. His eyes
filled with tears. He was not quite well that night.
A week later the newspapers invited the friends of
the illustrious stranger to meet at St. Philippe-du-
Roule, to witness his funeral rites. Delsarte was
present; the church was so hung with black that
the choristers were alarmed for the effect of their
motetS.
The artist recalled the request made him the

previous week by the Spanish ambassador. He felt
as if that same voice came from the bier and begged
him for one more hymn to the dead. In spite of
his emotion, he offered to sing the Dies /ræ.
To obviate the lack of resonance, Delsarte sang —
according to his theory in regard to the laws of
acoustics, without expenditure of sound, almost
%22%2 ZJOCé.
No one was prepared. The listeners were all the
more overcome by those tones in which the friend's
regrets pervaded, with their sweet unction, the mas-
terly diction of the singer.
When his oldest daughter grew up, Delsarte
seemed to take a fancy to a different style of com-
position. He would not give that young soul the
regular repertory of his pupils, all passion and pro-
fane love. He wrote for Marie words and music —
couplets which were neither romance nor song; nor
were they quite canticles, although religion always
lay at the base of them.
I know none but Madame Sand who can be com-
pared to Delsarte in variety of feeling and simplicity
even unto grandeur. I have often observed a like-
ness and, as it were, a kinship between these great
minds. And yet these two great Souls, these two
great spirits, never exchanged ideas, The artist
never received the plaudits of the distinguished
writer. Both regretted it.
Delsarte said: “I lack that sanction,” and Madame
Sand wrote, when he had ceased to live: “I knew

344 ARN AUD ON DELSARTE.
Delsarte's worth ; I often intended to go and hear
him, and some circumstance, beyond my control,
always prevented.”
The world owes a debt to Delsarte for collecting
under the title “Archives of Song,” the lyric gems
of the XVI, XVII, and XVIII centuries And also
the songs of the Middle Ages, the prose hymns and
anthems of the church, arranged conformably to the
harmonic type consecrated by the oldest traditions.
“All these works,” he wrote in his announcement
of the work, “faithfully copied, arranged for the
piano and transposed for concert performance, will
finally be arranged and classified in Separate vol-
umes, to suit various voices, ages, styles, Schools,
etc., thus affording subject matter for a complete
course of vocal studies.”
I do not think that death allowed Delsarte to
complete this vast plan, but it was partly finished.
In the collection, we find the scattered treasures of
an eminently French muse: old songs picked up in
the provinces, in which wit and naive sentimentality
dispute for precedence. All this still exists, but
who can sing as he did the song beginning: “I was
but fifteen,” or “Lisette, my love, shall I forever
languish P” and so many others'
To explain the inexpressible charm which dis-
tinguished Delsarte from all other singers, a song-
stress once said: “His singing contrives to give us
the soul of the note. The others are artists, but he
is the artist.”

CHAPTER XVI.
DELSARTE'S EVENING LECTURES.
In François Delsarte's school there were morning
classes and evening classes. The former were more
especially devoted to the theory, to lessons. Those
of which I shall speak might be compared to lec-
tures, to dramatic and musical meetings. A choice
public was always present. Among them were:
The composers Réber and Gounod;
Doctor Dailly, Madame de Meyendorf– a great
Russian lady, the friend of art;
The Princess de Chimay and the Princess Czarto-
riska, who glided modestly in and took the humblest
place;
Madame Blanchecotte, whose charming verses
were crowned by the Academy;
Countess d'Haussonville, a familiar name;
M. Joly de Bammeville, one of the exhibitors at
the Exhibition of Retrospective Arts, in 1878;
Doriot, the sculptor ; Madame de Lamartine,
Madame Laure de Léoménil, a well-known painter;
Madame de Blocqueville, daughter of Marshal Da-
vout, and author of his biography; a throng of
artists, men of letters and Scientists; certain original
figures of the pcriod.
On one occasion we were joined by a man of
some celebrity — the chiromancist Desbarolles,

Delsarte had the courtesy to base his theory lesson
upon the latter's system; he pointed out its points
of relation with the sum total of the constitution of
the human being. It was a lesson full of spirit and
piquant allusions; one of those charming impromp-
tus in which Delsarte never failed.
From time to time certain persons in clerical
robes appeared in the audience; the austerity of
their habit contrasting somewhat strangely with the
attire of the elegant women, men of fashion and
young actors in their apprenticeship around them ;
but matters always settled themselves. One even-
ing one of these priests was in a neighboring
room, the doors of which were open into the draw-
ing-room. If the songs seemed too profane, he kept
out of sight; but so soon as the word God was pro-
nounced or a religious thought was mingled with a
romance, or operatic aria, the servant of the altar
appeared boldly, rejoiced at these brief harvests
which allowed him to enjoy the whole picture.
To give a correct idea of one of these evenings,
I will copy an account which I have just written
under the heading of “Recent Memories.”
By half-past eight, almost all the guests have as-
Sembled. A stir is heard in the next room. “He
is coming . . . it is he ” is whispered on every
hand. The master enters, followed by his pupils.
Almost at the same instant a young woman glides
up to the piano. She is to accompany the singers;
she enters furtively, timidly, as if she were not the

mistress of the house. She is beautiful, but she
does not wish this to be noticed ; she has much
talent, but she disguises it by her calm and severe
style of playing, which does not prevent critical ears
from noting her exactitude and precision, combined
with that rare spirit of abnegation which is the ac-
companist's Supreme virtue.
Delsarte takes his place by the piano; his atten-
tive gaze traverses the assembly; he exchanges a
smile, a friendly gesture with certain of the audience
who are always much envied. At this moment he
is grave, serious, and, as it were, penetrated by his
responsibility to an audience who hang devoutly on
his lips.
The professor begins by developing some point in
his system; he gives the law of pose or of gesture;
the reasons for accent, rhythm or some other detail :
connected with the synthesis which he has evolved.
He questions his scholars.
The first notes of the piano serve to mark the
change to practical instruction. The pupils sing in
turn. The master listens with the concentrated at-
tention peculiar to him; the expression of his face
explains the nature of the remarks he is about to
make, even before he utters them. He points out
mistakes, he illustrates them. *
Little by little, however, his dramatic genius is
aroused. Achilles seems to seize his weapons or
Agamemnon his sceptre. The scholar is pushed
aside, Delsarte takes his place.
(#

Then the artist is seen to the utmost advantage.
There, dressed in the vast, shapeless coat which
drapes itself about him as he gesticulates, his neck
free from the cravat which puts modern Europeans
in the pillory, and allowing himself greater space
than at his concerts — there, and there alone, is
Delsarte wholly himself.
The piano strikes the opening notes of the pre-
lude, and before the artist has uttered a word, he is
transfigured. If he is singing serious opera, the
oval of his face lengthens, the lines become more
fixed, his cheeks shrink, his forehead is lighted up
and his eye flashes with inspiration; the pallor of
profound emotion pervades his features, the some-
what gross proportions of his figure are disguised
by the firmness of his pose and the juvenile pre-
cision of his gesture.
The part of Robert the Devil is one of those in
which Delsarte best developed the resources and
suppleness of his genius. Robert is the son of a
demon, but his mother was a saint. He loves with
sincere love; but even this love is subject to the in-
fluence of the evil spirit; hence, these outbursts
followed by such tender remorse, that heart which
melts into tears after a fit of rage. Robert is jealous,
less so than Othello possibly, but Robert's jealousy
is stimulated by infernal powers and must differ in
its manifestation. It was in these shades of distinc-
tion that Delsarte's greatness was apparent to every

Then came those indescribable inflections —
words whicli pierced your heart, cold as a sword-
blade: “Come, come !” says Robert, striving to
drag /sabel/a away, . . . and that simple word
was made frantic, breathless, by the accent accom-
panying it. No One who has not heard Delsarte
utter the word rival can conceive of all the mysteries
of hate and pain contained in the word.
In the trio from “William Tell,” after the words,
“has cut an old man's thread of life,” Arnold feels
that Gessler has had his father murdered. A first
and vague suspicion dawned on the artist's face.
Little by little, the impression became more marked,
a clearer idea of this misfortune was shown by pan-
tomime; his eye was troubled, it kindled, every
feature questioned both William and Walter; the
actor's hand, trembling and contracted, was stretched
toward them and implored them to speak more
clearly. He was horror-stricken at the news he was
to hear, but uncertainty was intolerable; and when,
after these touching preparations, Arnold himself
tore away the last shred of doubt, when he uttered
the cry: “My father l’ there was not a heart—
were it bathed in the waters of the Styx — which
did not melt from the counter shock of such violent
despair.
The effects of rage, hate, irony, the terrors of re-
morse, the bitterness of disappointment, were not
the only dramatic means in the possession of that
artist whom Madame Sontag proclaimed as “the

greatest known singer.” None could express as did
Delsarte, contemplation, serenity, tenderness — the
dreams of a sweet and simple soul, and even the
divine silliness of innocent beings. Wit and malice
were equally easy for him to render.
In the duet from “Count Ory: ”
‘‘ Once more I’ll see the beauty whom I love,”
he was quite as apt at interpreting the hypocritical
good-nature of the false hermit as the sentimental
playfulness of the love-lorn page.
In his school the comic style bore an impress of
propriety and distinction, because it resulted from
intellectual perceptions rather than it expressed the
vulgar sensations manifested by exaggerated carica-
ture and grimace.
Delsarte thus put his stamp upon every style
which he attempted; he renovated every part. He
restored Gluck to life; he revealed Spontini to him-
self. The latter — the illustrious author of “Fer-
nando Cortez’— was at a musical entertainment
where Delsarte, whom he had never known, sang.
He had drunk deep of the composer's inspiration:
he showed this in the very first phrase of the great
air:
“Whither do ye hasten ? Oh, traitorous race . "
He sang with such vigorous accent, such great
maestria, that—in the mouth of Montezuma — the
words must have sufficed to rally the Mexican army
from its rout. He gave the cantabile:
“Oh country, oh spot so full of charm ' '

with indescribable sadness; desolation and despair
Seemed to fill his soul, and when the conquered man
invoked the spirits of his ancestors:
“Shall I say to the shadows of my fathers,
Arise — and leave your gloomy tomb ”
it seemed — so powerful was the adjuration — as
if the audience must see the sepulchre open on the
spot which the singer and actor indicated by his
.gesture and his gaze.
Such profound knowledge, sublime talent, terrify-
ing effects and contrasts so skilfully managed, and
yet so natural in their transition, strongly moved the
composer. -
“Do you know that you made me tremble?” Del-
Sarte said to him after he had sang.
“Do you know that you made me weep?” replied
Spontini, charmed to see his work raised to such pro-
portions.
Delsarte was always master of himself, however
impassioned he appeared.
Often, in his lessons, when every soul hung upon
his accents, he would stop abruptly and restore the
part to his pupil. Then, as if a magic wand had
touched him, all the attributes of the personage who
had lived in him, vanished. His face, his form, his
bearing resumed their usual appearance. The artist
disappeared, and the professor quietly resumed his
place, without seeming to notice that the audience
— still shaken by the emotions they had felt—
blamed him for this too prompt metamorphosis.

Yet Delsarte was as agreeable a teacher as he was
a marvelous artist. His instruction was enlivened
by countless unexpected flashes; his sallies were as
quick as gunpowder.
“A die /’’ languidly sang a tenor.
“You sleep !” said the master.
“Come, lady fair /" exclaimed another singer.
“If you call her in that voice, you may believe
that she will never come !”
“Don’t make a public-crier of your Achilles,”
said the master to some one with a rich organ, given
over to its own uncultivated power.
All three smiled. The one tried to die more fitly;
the other to call his lady fair in more seductive ac-
cents. The petulant outburst of the master taught
them more than many a long dissertation.
Delsarte made great use of his power of imitating
a defect; he even exaggerated it so that the scholar,
Seeing it reflected as in a magnifying-glass, more
readily perceived his insufficiency or his exaggeration.
If this mode of procedure was somewhat trying
to sensitive vanity, it was easy to see its advantages.
The master's censure, moreover, was of that inoffen-
sive and kindly character which is its own justifica-
tion. It was a criticism governed by gaiety. Delsarte
laughed at himself quite as readily as at the ridicu-
lous performances which he caricatured, if oppor-
tunity offered. And if by chance any pupil less
hardened to these assaults was intimidated or dis-
tressed, consolation was quick to follow.

I remember that a young girl gave rise to one of
these striking imitations. Delsarte put such an
irresistible comedy into it, that the audience was
seized with an uncontrolable fit of mirth. The
master's mimicry had far more to do with this than
the poor girl's awkwardness. But she did not under-
stand this. Her heart sank at this harsh merriment
and tears rushed to her eyes.
“What is the matter,” asked Delsarte ; “why
are you so disturbed P Among the persons whose
laughter you hear, I do not think there is one
who sings as well as you do ! I exaggerated your
mistake to make you aware of it; but you did your
work in a way that was very satisfactory to all but
your teacher.”
Speaking of this irony tempered by mercy, I rec-
ollect that Delsarte, after a great success, was once
complimented by the singer P., whose popularity -
far exceeded that of the “ lyric Talma.”
“And yet you have given me lessons,” said Del-
sarte, emphasizing the word yet. Well ! in such cir-
cumstances Delsarte showed neither the pride nor the
malicious spirit which might be imputed to him ; his
mind seized a contrast which amused him, and his
face interpreted it, but his voice remained soft and
friendly; for, in spite of his biting wit and cutting
phrases, his feelings were easily touched and his
heart was truly rich in sympathy.
Delsarte sang a great deal during his lessons; and
perhaps he gained, from the point of view of the

voice, by confining himself to fragments; seizing
the opportune moment, and his voice not having
had time to be tired, he could give, for a relatively
long space, the clear, ringing tones necessary for
brilliant pieces. Then his vocalization — which has
only a mechanical value with most singers—became
sobs, satanic laughter, delirium, and terror.
Then, too, thanks to proximity, the most delicate
tones could be heard to the extreme limits of the
smorgando, still preserving that slightly veiled tim-
bre unique in its charm, the mysterious interpre-
ter of infinite sweetness and unspeakable tenderness.
One might perhaps have made a complete analysis
of Delsarte from hearing him sing some dramatic
song, but let him give Eleazar's air from “The
Jewess: ” &
“Rachel, when the Lord,”
or that of Joseph :
“Paternal fields, Hebron, sweet vale,_”
let the artist give this in a quiet style, as putting a
mute upon his voice, and the observer forgot his
part; he followed the entrancing melody as far as
it would lead him into the realms of the ineffable
whence he returned with the fascination of memory
and the sorrow of exile.
Let no one cry that this is hyperbole ! One of
the most remarkable accompanists in Paris, an at-
taché of the Opéra Comique, M. Bazile, was once
So overcome by emotion in accompanying Delsarte
that for some seconds the piano failed to do its duty.

I might recount numberless proofs of admiration
equal to mine. One evening, at a lecture, the lesson
turned upon a song from “William Tell:”
“Be motionless, and to the ground
Incline a suppliant knee.”
For stage effect, Delsarte called in one of his chil-
dren, about eight or nine years old.
The subject is well known: William has been con-
demned to strike from a distance, with the tip of his
arrow, an apple placed on the head of his child.
William bids the child pray to God, and implores
him not to stir. Reversing the action of all actors
whom we usually see, the artist recited the fragment
in a wholly concentric fashion; he did not declaim;
he made no gesture toward the audience; but what
emotion in his voice, and how his gaze hovered over
and around the dear creature who was perhaps to be
forever lost to him He called the child to him, he
pressed him to his heart; he laid his hands on that
young head. His caresses had the lingering slow-
ness of supreme and final things, the solemnity of a
last benediction.
“This point of steel may terrify thine eyes | *
says the text, and the tragedian, enlarging the mean-
ing of the words by inflection and accent, showed
that this precious life hung on a thread and de-
pended on the firmness of his hand.
At the last phrase:
“Jemmy, Jemmy, think of thy mother,
She who awaits us both at home !”
his voice became pathetic to such a degree that it

was difficult to endure it. The child, who had re-
strained himself during the tirade, began to sob.
All eyes were full of tears. One lady fainted.
At concerts his triumph was the same on a larger
Scale. I will give but one anecdote. A man of letters,
who was also a skilled physician, said to Delsarte:
“Do you know, sir, that I made your acquaint-
ance in a very strange way? I was at the Herz
Hall, at your concert. Your voice and singing so
agitated me that I was forced to leave the room,
feeling oppressed and almost faint.”
This impressionable listener referred to a day
memorable in the annals of the master. Delsarte
— he sang certain airs written for women in Gluck's
operas — had selected Clytemnestra's song:
“A priest, encircled by a cruel throng,
Shall on my daughter lay his guilty hand.”
Just as this maternal despair reached its paroxysm,
the artist raised both hands to his head and remained
in the most striking attitude possible to overwhelm-
ing grief. Loud applause burst from every part of
the hall; there was a frenzy, a delirium of enthu-
siasm. At the same time, a violent storm burst out-
side; the roaring thunder, the rain beating in floods
upon the windows, the flashing lightning which
turned the gas-lights pale, formed a tremendous
orchestra for Gluck's music, and a fantastic frame
for the sublime actor. Then, as if crushed by his
glory, he prolonged that marvelous effect, and stood
a moment as if annihilated by the frantic and tumult-
uous shouts of the audience.

CHAPTER XVII.
DELSARTE'S INVENTIONS.
Delsarte always had his father's propensity to
devote himself to mechanics that he might apply
his knowledge of them to new things. When he
felt his artistic abilities, not growing less, but their
plastic expression becoming more difficult, owing
to the cruel warnings of his departing youth, this
tendency toward occupations more especially intel-
lectual, became more marked.
It may be helpful here to note that a machine—
that positive and most material of all things—is the
thing whose creation requires force of understand-
ing in the highest degree
The brain, that living machine, lends its aid to the
intellect; it represents the physical side; it is the
spot where the work is carried on. Feeling has no
part in the intellectual acts which work together in
mechanical production,- mathematics playing the
principal part, it has no other share, I say, but
to inspire certain persons with a passionate taste for
abstract studies, which leads them toward useful and
glorious discoveries.
Thus, this thought of Delsarte and Pierre Leroux
seems to be justified : that, in no case, can man
break his essential triplicity.


## p. 358 (#394) ############################################

358 ARN AUD ON DELSARTE.
Delsarte, moreover, by changing the direction of
his faculties, or rather by displacing the dominant,
affirmed his freedom of will. If he did not always
class himself with the strong, he still loved to reign
over himself in the omnipotence of his will.
The artist became an inventor; he took out let-
ters-patent for various discoveries, among others for
an instrument of precision applicable to astronomi-
cal observations. Competent persons have recog-
nized the great value of this invention, conceived
without previous study, and which remains hidden
among the papers of some official.
Only one of his mechanical conceptions was ever
really put to practical use, that of the Guide-accord,
it gained him a gold medal at the Exhibition of
1855; Dublin awarded it the same praise.
Berlioz wrote of this invention, in his book en-
titled, “A Travers Chants : ”
“M. Delsarte has made piano tuning easier by
means of an instrument which he calls the phomopti-
com. Any one who will take the trouble to use it
will find that it produces such absolute correctness,
that the most practiced ear could not attain to sim-
ilar perfection. This Guide-accord cannot fail, to
gain speedy popularity.”
On reading these lines, one is tempted to say:
Here is an open-hearted writer; one likes this out-
burst in regard to a man who was in some sense his
brother-artist. But what are we to think of this
critic, when we reflect that in this same book, where
he exalts the inventor, he never seems to remember

Delsarte the revealer of a law, the creator of a science,
the distinguished teacher, the famous artist. “He
has rendered all pianists a great service by inventing
this instrument,” says the author of “A Travers
Chants,” and that is all. And he calls him Monsieur
Delsarte, as if he were some unknown musical in-
strument maker or dealer | Had the author of
“William Tell” or “Alda” vexed him, he would
have spoken of them as M. Rossini, M. Verdi !
And yet he knew all about the man whom he
seemed anxious to extinguish, for it was he who, in
a musical criticism, wrote, among other praises: “It
is impossible to imagine superior execution; ” and
elsewhere: “He renders the thoughts of the great
masters with such brilliancy and strength, that their
masterpieces are made accessible to the most stub-
born intellect and the most hardened sensibilities are
roused by his tones.”
What had happened to make the author of the
“Pilgrims' March " so oblivious of his own admira-
tion? I have heard that the two musicians quarreled
as to the interpretation of a passage by Gluck, and
that a correspondence much resembling a literary
warfare, followed. Could this justify defection?
Perhaps a desire to stifle this glory, thereby to
lend more lustre to some meteor or star, had some
share in this supposed motive. *
At any rate, the affair is not to the honor
of Berlioz. We should never deny, whatever may
happen, the just judgment which we have uttered.

Direct or indirect, the rivalries of artists are to be
regretted for the sake of art itself, which lives on
noble sentiments and high thoughts. Although we
may laugh at the inconsequence of a critic who ex-
tinguishes with one hand that which the other hand
brought to light, we cannot repress a deep feeling
of sadness when we see upon what reputation too
often depends, and when we ask ourselves how
much we are to believe of the opinions of certain
chroniclers. e
The fact which I have just quoted is the more sur-
prising, inasmuch as Berlioz often drew his inspira-
tion from the method of, and from certain modes
of expression peculiar to Delsarte.

CHAPTER XVIII.
DELSARTE BEFORE THE PHILOTECHNIC
ASSOCIATION.”
It was in 1865 that Delsarte was heard in public
for the last time. The meeting took place at the
Sorbonne where the lectures of the Philotechnic
Society were then given.
I see him before me now with his strong person-
ality, his captivating and persuasive speech, his
mind with its incisive flashes; but a visible melan-
choly swayed him and was to follow him through
the variety and contrasts of the subjects on his
program.
And first, he takes pleasure in proclaiming to all
the tale of his mistakes. Still young in heart and
in mind, it seems as if in giving up hope on earth,
he tolled the knell of all the enchantments that were
passed and gone; that creative head fermenting with
the ardor of discovery seems to doubt the future and
bow beneath the burden of a sombre submission.
And yet he is surrounded by picked men who
admire him, by women, young, beautiful, brilliant,
eager to hear him, as of old; but he is not deceived
by all this. A magic spell has vanished ; sympathy
is not denied him, but perhaps he feels it to be less

tender, less affectionate than in the radiant days of
his youth.
This explains how, in the course of that evening,
a recrudescence of Christian feeling more than once
tore him away from the undeniable assertions of
science, not to drag him down to the puerilities
of the letter, but to draw him up into the clouds
of theology, whence hope of a future life, the con-
solation of farewell hours, smiled upon him.
But if Delsarte appeared depressed, he was not
to be conquered. His restless spirit betrayed him
to those whom his mystic fervor might have misled.
“Many persons,” he said, “feel confident that
they are to hear me recite or sing.
“Nothing of the sort, gentlemen; I shall not
recite, and I shall not sing, because I desire less to
show you what I can do, than to tell you what I know.”
Soon a wonderful change passed over him. It
seemed as if he had been covered with ashes for an
instant, only to come forth in a more dazzling light.
Hardly had his audience felt a slight sense of revolt
at the words: “I shall not sing,” than they found
themselves in the presence of an orator not inferior
to the greatest in the force of his images, and who,
with all his serious and pathetic eloquence, never
forgot the studied touches of the poet, or the dainty
style of the artist.
But I will not delay my reader to listen to me !
It is Delsarte himself who should be heard. I will
give a few extracts:

“I count,” he said, “on the novelty, the absolute
novelty, of the things which I shall teach you : Art
is the subject of this conversation.
“Art is divine in its principle, divine in its es-
sence, divine in its action, divine in its aim.
“Ah ! gentlemen, there are no pleasures at Once
more lasting, more noble and more sacred than
those of Art. f -
“Let us glance around us: not a pleasure which
is not followed by disappointment or satiety; not
a joy which does not entail some trouble; not an
affection which does not conceal some bitterness,
some grief, and often some remorse !
“Everything is disappointing to man. Every-
thing about him changes and passes away. Every-
thing betrays him; even his senses, so closely allied
to his being and to which he sacrifices everything,
like faithless servants, betray him in their turn ; and,
to use an expression now but too familiar, they go
on a strike, and from that strike, gentlemen, they
Inever return.

“The constituent elements of the body sooner or
later break into open rebellion, and tend to fly from
each other as if filled with mutual horror.
“But under the ashes a youthful soul still lives,
and one whose perpetual youth is torture; for that
soul loves, in spite of the disappointments of its
hard cxpcricnce; it loves because it is young; it
loves just because it is a Soul and it is its natural
condition to love.


## p. 364 (#400) ############################################

364 ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
“Such is the soul, gentlemen. Well ! for this
poor, solitary and desolate soul, there are still un-
utterable joys; joys not to be measured by all
which this world can offer. These joys are the gift
of Art. No one grows old in the realms of Art.”
After a pungent criticism of the official teaching
of art as hitherto practiced, Delsarte explained the
chief elements of aesthetics. He said:
“AEsthetics, henceforth freed from all conjecture,
will be truly established under the strict forms of a
positive science.”
But, as in the course of his lecture he had more
than once touched the giddy regions of supernatu-
ralism, this formula seemed a contradiction to Cer-
tain minds, yet enthusiastic applause greeted the
orator from all parts of the hall.
One paper, Z'Onion, said in this connection:
“M. Delsarte is a spontaneous soul, his mind is
at once Christian and free, his only passion is the
proselytism of the Beautiful, and this is the charm
of his speech. . . . I do not assert that every-
thing in it should be of an absolute rigor of philoso-
phy,” etc.
The same paper says elsewhere:
“All these theories are new, original, ingenious,
in a word, felicitous. Are they undeniably true?
What I can affirm is that none doubt it who hear
the master make various applications of them by
examples. Delsarte is an irresistible enchanter.”
The opposition of principles with which he is re-
proached, these doubts of the strength of his logic,
will be greatly diminished if this point of view be

BEFORE PHILOTECHNIC ASSOCIATION. 365
taken : that Delsarte traced back an assured science,
that he deduced from the faculties of man the hy-
pothesis that these faculties are contained in essence
and in the full power of their development, in an
archetype which, to his mind, is no other than the
Divine Trinity. Plato's ideal in aesthetics and in
philosophy was similar although less precise.
There is a saying that Italians “have two souls.”
In Delsarte there were two distinct types, the the-
istic philosopher and the scientist.
Now, the philosopher could give himself up to
the study of causes and their finality, that faculty
being allotted to the mental activity; he could even,
without giving the scientist cause for complaint,
make, or admit, speculative theories regarding the
end and aim of art, provided that the scientific part
of the system was neither denied nor diminished
thereby.
And is there not a certain kinship between sci-
ence and hypothesis which admits of their walking
abreast without conflicting?
Delsarte, as we have seen, rarely left his audience
without winning the sympathy of every member of
it. At the meeting of which I speak, he vastly .
amused his hearers by an anecdote. He doubtless
wished to clear away the clouds caused by that part
of his discourse which, by his own confession, had
a good deal of the sermon about it.
I will repeat the tale, a little exaggerated perhaps,
but still very piquant, which doubtless won his par-

don for those parts of his speech which might have
been for various reasons blamed, misunderstood or
but half understood |
The story was of four professors who, having ex-
amined him, had each, in turn, he said, administered
upon his [Delsarte's] cheeks smart slaps to the col-
leagues by whose advice he had profited in previ-
ous lessons. ->
The following lines were the subject of the lesson:
“Nor gold nor greatness make us blest;
Those two divinities to our prayers can grant
But goods uncertain and a pleasure insecure.”
“The first teacher to whom I turned declared

men, could be only his own.

most Sonorous, most magisterial tones. He raised
his eyes to heaven, rounded his gestures and struck
a heroic attitude.
“‘Show yourself,’ he resumed (after this demon-
stration), ‘by the elevation of your manners, worthy
of the lessons I have given you.’
“‘Ah !' I exclaimed, “at last I possess the noble
manner of rendering these fine lines.’
“Next day, having practiced the noble manner to
the utmost of my ability, I went to my second pro-
fessor, fully persuaded that I should hear nothing

ended the second line, when a shrug of the shoul-
ders accompanied by a terrible burst of laughter,
very mortifying to my noble manner, closed my
mouth abruptly.
“‘What do you mean by that emphatic tone?
What is all this bombastic sermon about? What
manners are these ? My friend, you are grotesque.
Those lines should be repeated simply, naturally
and with the utmost artlessness. Remember that
it is the good La Fontaine who speaks [accenting
each syllable] the-good-La-Fon-taine—do you hear?
There is but one way possible to render the lines
faithfully. Listen to me.’ - -
“Here the professor tapped his snuff-box,− com-
pressed his lips, dropped the corners of his mouth
in an ironical fashion, slightly contracting his eyes,
lifting his eyebrows, moving his head five or six
times from right to left, and began the lines in a
firm and somewhat nasal tone.
“Ah! ” I cried, amazed, ‘there is no other way
what wonderful artlessness, simplicity and
truth to nature l’
“So I set to work upon a new basis, saying to
myself: “Now, at last, I have got the natural style

then, as if crushed by the weight of some melancholy
memory, he cast slowly around him a look in which
the bitterness of a deep disappointment was painted.
He heaved a sigh, raised his eyes to heaven, still
keeping his head bent, and began in a grave, muffled
and sustained voice:

If this retreat was an orator's artifice—which may
well be, it was a complete success.
There was a shout: “ The fourt/, / the fourth /*
“Well, gentlemen, the fourth, like the other three,
claimed that his was the only correct style : I made
no distinction between verse and prose, thus follow-
ing the false method recently established by the
Théâtre-Français. To his mind the cadence of the
verse and the euphonic charm should outweigh
every other interest. The pauses which I made
destroyed its measure. I had no idea of caesura,
my gestures destroyed its harmony, etc., etc. His
pedagogic manner had nothing in common with that
of his brethren.”
This episode was not a mere witticism on Del-
Sarte's part; he intended it to prove his constant
assertion—and with persistent right, that previous
to his discovery, art, destitute of law and of science,
had had none but chance successes.
Delsarte closed this session by a summary of the
law and the science which I have set forth in this
book; but I must say it was at this moment espe-
cially that he seemed anxious that his religious con-
victions should profit by his artistic wealth ; all out-
side the sphere of rational demonstration is treated
from a lofty standpoint, it is true, and is freed from
the commonplaceness of the letter, but we can recog-
nize none but a poetic and literary merit in it.
It is to this latter period of his existence that
many will doubtless try to fasten the synthesis of this

great personality; but if any one wishes to gain an
idea of François Delsarte, of his ability, the extent
of his views, the power of his reason, the graces of
his mind, his artistic perfection, it is in his law, in
his science, in the memories which his lectures and
his concerts left in the press of the time, that such
an one must seek to understand him.

CHAPTER XIX.
DELSARTE'S LAST YEARS.
Before concluding these essays, my homage to the
innovating spirit, the matchless art, the sympathetic
and generous nature of François Delsarte, I make a
final appeal to my memory, and, first, I invoke afresh
the testimony of others.
Ala Patrie, June 18, 1857, says in an enthusiastic
and lengthy article:
“His deep knowledge, his incessant labors, his
long and fatiguing studies, have not allowed his life
to pass unnoted ; but although great renown, at-
tached in a short space to his name, has sufficed
for the legitimate demands of his pride, it has done
nothing, it must be owned, to provide for the wants
which the negligences of genius do not always
foresee.”
Then, apropos of Gluck and other unappreciated
composers of genius, the author of the article, Franck
Marie, goes on :
“With the confidence to which I recently referred,
Delsarte has undertaken the reform. Sure of the
success which shall crown his bold undertaking, he
began almost unaided, a movement which was no
less than a revolution. Between two snatches from
Romagnesi or Blangini, the majestic pages of Gluck
appeared to the surprise of the auditor. The heroes
of the great master took the place of Thyrcis and
Colin, the songs of Pergolese and Handel, coming

DELSARTE'S LAST YEARS. 373
from the inspired mouth of the virtuoso, at once
aroused unknown sensations. Lully and Rameau,
rejuvenated in their turn, surprised by beauties
hitherto unsuspected.”
Earlier still (in the Presse for December 6, 1840)
in an article signed Viscount Charles Delaunay are
these lines:
“We are, to-night, to hear an admirable singer
(Delsarte). He is said to be the Talma of music;
he makes the most of Gluck's songs, as Talma made
the most of Racine's verses. We must hasten, for
his enthusiastic admirers would never pardon us if
we arrived in the middle of the air from ‘Alcestis; ”
and if all we hear be true, we could never be con-
Soled ourselves, for having missed half of it.”
March 14, 1860, we read in the L’Indépendance
Belge :
“Among the many concerts announced there is
one which is privileged to attract the notice of the
dileſtanti. We refer to that announced, almost
naively, by the two lines: Concert by François Del-
sarte, Tuesday, April 4.—Nothing more | These
two lines tell everything ! Why give a program P
Who is there in the enlightened world who would
not be anxious to be present at a concert given by
Delsarte P For, at his concert, he will sing—he
who never sings anywhere, at any price. Observe
what I say: never anywhere, at any price, and I do
not exaggerate.”
This assertion, which shows the indifference of
Delsarte to the speculative side of art, is not with-
out a certain analogy to the fact which follows. At
one of his concerts he was to be aided by one of

the great celebrities of the time; Rachel was to re-
cite a scene from Some play. -
The actress failed to appear. Some few outcries
were heard. Delsarte considered this a protest:
“I beg those who are only here to hear Mademoi-
selle Rachel,” said he, “to step to the box-office.
The price of their tickets will be returned.” Ap-
plause followed these words, and the artist Sang in
a way to leave no room for regret.
I quote the following lines from an article pub-
lished by the “journal des Villes et des Campagnes”
in reference to a lecture given in the great amphi-
theatre of the Medical School, March I I, 1867:
“Should I say lecture? It was rather a chat—
a charming chat, without preparation, clear and
simple, and wholly free from academic forms. In
somewhat odd, perhaps, but picturesque and origi-
nal form, M. Delsarte told us healthy and strength-
ening truths: — ‘The misery of luxury devours
us, but the truth makes no display; it is modestly
bare.' . . “Art may convince by deceit;
then it blinds. When it carries conviction by con-
templating truth, it enlightens. Art may persuade
by evil; then it hardens. When it persuades by
goodness, it perfects.” These are noble words.
Orator, poet, metaphysician, artist, M. Delsarte
offers new horizons to the soul.” -
The sources whence I draw are not exhausted,
but I must pause.
Thus all have hailed him with applause ! Save
for some few interested critics, without distinction
Of opinions, political, religious or philosophical, all

differences were silenced by this admirable harmony
of the highest aesthetic faculties: the spirit of jus-
tice conquered party Spirit.
But whatever may have been said—and whatever
may still be said,—those who never heard Delsarte
can never be made to comprehend him: in him,
feeling, intellect, physical beauty and beauty of ex-
pression formed a magnificent assemblage of natural
gifts and of acquired faculties. In this distinguished
personality nature became art, to prove to us that
Outside her limits, as outside the limits of science,
arbitrary agreement and the caprices of imagination
can create nothing noble and great, persuasive and
touching.
With this artist there was never anything to be-
tray the artificiality of a situation; interpreted by
him, the creation, the invention, became real. From
his lips a cry never seemed a studied effect. It was
the rending of a bosom. A tear seemed to come
Straight from the heart; his gesture was conscious
of what it had to teach us; in all these applications
“of the sign to the thing,” there was never an error,
never a mistake. It was truž/ adorned by beauty.
In his singing, roulades became true bursts of laugh-
ter or true sobs.
Yes, all these things surpass description.
But what any and every mind may appreciate, is
the lovable, loving and generous nature which in-
vested these transcendant qualities with simplicity,
with charm and with life. Delsarte had a wealth of

376 ARNAUD ON DELSARTE.
Sentiment which overflowed upon the humble and
the outcast, as well as upon those favored by nature
and by fortune. Without the riches which he knew
not how to gain, disdainful as he was of petty and
sinuous ways, he was benevolent in spite of his
moderate means.
He gave, perhaps, oftener than he accepted pay-
ment for them, his time, his knowledge and his ad-
vice to all who needed them. He admitted to his
classes pupils whose beautiful voices were their only
wealth, and who could pay him only in hope.
We may say of François Delsarte, that so sympa-
thetic a nature is rarely seen in this world of ours,
where still prevail — tyrants to be destroyed — so
much antagonism, jealousy and rivalry. If some
few of the weaknesses natural to poor humanity
may be laid to his charge, no one had a greater
right to redemption than he.
He once distressed a fashionable woman by speak-
ing severely to her of one of her friends. She was
much troubled, but out of respect, dared not com-
plain. Delsarte saw tears in her eyes. He instantly
confessed his fault, and acknowledged, with the
utmost frankness, that he spoke from hearsay, and
very lightly. He added that this mistake should be
a lesson to him, and that he would think twice before
becoming the echo of evil report.
If, touching his science and his art, this master
often made assertions which might seem conceited,
aside from those convictions which, to his mind,

DELSARTE'S LAST YEARS. 377
had the character of orthodoxy, he used forms of
speech of which judges without authority would
never have dreamed. I have heard him say:
“I cannot be much of a connoisseur in regard to
pianists, for I only like to hear Chopin.”
He was always ready to praise the amateurs who
came to him for a hearing, even if they were the
pupils of other masters, finding out among all their
faults, the little acquirements or talent which he could
from their performance; sure, it is true, to correct
them if he afterward became their instructor.
Honors and fortune seemed within his grasp when
he neared his end. America offered him immense
advantages, with a yearly salary of $2O,OOO, to
found a conservatory in one of her cities. A street
in Solesmes was named for him. The King of Han-
over sent him, as an artist, the Guelph Cross, and,
as a friend, a photograph of himself and family; it
was to this prince, the patron of art, that Delsarte
wrote regarding his “Episodes of a Revelator:”
“I am at this moment meditating a book singular
for more than one reason, which will be no less novel
in form than in idea. . . . I know not what fate
is in store for this work, or if I shall succeed in see-
ing it in print during my lifetime.”
He did not realize this dream.
It was at about this same time that Jenny Lind
took a long journey to hear him and to consult him
about her art. ,”
At the period of the war of 1870–1871, Delsarte

took refuge at Solesmes, his native place. He left
Paris, with his family, Sept. IO, I870. Already ill,
he lived there sad, and crushed by the misfortunes
of his country. Nevertheless, during this stay, he
developed various points in his method, and there
his two daughters wrote at his dictation the manu-
script, “Episodes of a Revelator; ” his intellect had
lost none of its vigor, but his nature was shadowed.
François Delsarte returned to Paris March Io,
1871, after his voluntary exile. He soon yielded to
a painful disease, doubtless regretting that he had
not finished his work, but courageous and submissive.
As far as it lay in my power, my task is done. I
have furnished documents for the history of the
arts; I have aroused and tried to fix attention upon
that luminous point which was threatened with
oblivion.
Now I call for the aid of all, that the work of
memory may be accomplished.
There are still among us many admirers of Fran-
çois Delsarte, many hearts that loved him ; a sort
of silent freemasonry has been established between
them; when they meet in society, at the theatre, at
concerts, they recognize each other by mutual signs.

PART FIFTH.
THE LITERARY REMAINS OF

TRANSLATED BY ABBY L. ALGER.


## p. 382 (#418) ############################################

PUBLISHER'S NOTE.
Part Fifth contains François Delsarte's own zwords.
The manuscripts were purchased of Mme. Delsarte
zwith the understanding that they were all she had of
the literary remains of her illustrious husband. They
are published by her authorization.
The reader will probably notice that at times
Delsarte talks as ºf addressing an audience. This he
really did, and some of the manuscripts are headings
or draughts of his lectures before learned societies or
of talks at his own private sessions.
These writings are given to the public in the same
fragmentary condition that Delsarte left them in.
They were written upon sheets of paper, scraps of
£aper, doors, chairs, window casements and other
objects. A literal translation has been made, zwithout
a word of comment, and without any attempt at edit-
ing them. The aim has been to let Delsarte speak
for himself, believing that the reader would rather
/have Delsarte's own words even in this disjointed,
Žncomplete form—mere rough notes—than to have
them supplemented, annotated, interpreted and very
/ikely perverted by another person.

Extraſt ſimil: List IÉllºr iſ fit King Of Hälſºr,
I am at this moment meditating a book, singular
for more than one reason, whose form will be no
less novel than its contents. Your majesty will
read it, I hope, with interest.
The title of this book is to be: “My Revelatory
Episodes, or the History of an Idea Pursued for
Forty Years.”
It will be my task to connect and condense into
a single narrative all the circumstances of my life
which had as logical consequences the numerous
discoveries which it has been granted me to follow
up, discoveries which my daily occupations left me
neither time nor ability to set forth as a whole.
I know not what fate is reserved for this book.
I know not whether I shall succeed in Seeing it in
print during my lifetime. The minds of men are,
in these evil days, so little disposed to serious ideas,
that it seems to me difficult to find a publisher dis-
posed to publish things so far removed from the
productions of the century.
But, however it may be, if I succeed in getting
at least some part of my work printed, I crave, sire,
your majesty's permission to offer the dedication to
you This favor I entreat not only as an honor,
but also as an opportunity to pay public homage to
all the kindnesses which your majesty has never
ceased to lavish upon me.

EPISODE. I.
The subject in question was a scene in the play
of the Maris-Garcomes. The young officer, whose
part I was studying, met his former landlord after
an absence of several years, and as he owed him
some money, he desired to show himself cordial.
“Ah ! how are you, papa Dugrand P” he says,
on encountering him. This apostrophe is, there-
fore, a mixture of surprise, soldierly bluntness and
joviality.
At the first words I was stopped short by an
almost insurmountable difficulty. This difficulty
was all in my gesture. Do what I would, my man-
ner of accosting papa Dugrand was grotesque; and
all the lessons that were given me on that scene, all
the pains I took to profit by those lessons, effected
no change. I paced to and fro, saying and resay-
ing the words: “How are you, papa Dugrand?”
Another scholar in my place would have gone on ;
but the greater the difficulty seemed to me, the
higher my ardor rose. However, I had my labor
for my pains.
“That's not it,” said my instructors. Good heav-
ens ! I knew that as well as they did ; but what I
did not know was zwhy that was not it. It seems that
my professors were equally ignorant, since they

could not tell me exactly in what my way differed
from theirs.
The specification of that difference would have
enlightened me, but all remained, with them as with
me, subject to the uncertain views of a vague in-
stinct.
“Do as I do,” they said to me, one after the
other. t
Zounds ! the thing was easier said than done.
“Put more enthusiasm into your greeting to papa
Dugrand l’’
The greater my enthusiasm, the more laughable
was my awkwardness.
“See here; watch my movements carefully "
“I do watch, but I don't know how to go to work
to imitate you ; I don’t seize the details of your
gesture.” (It varied with every repetition.) “I
don't understand why your examples, with which I
am satisfied, lead to nothing in me.”
“You don’t understand You don’t understand
It's very simple ! Really, your wits must have gone
wool-gathering, my poor boy, if you are unable to
do what I have shown you so many times. Watch
closely now !”
“I am watching, sir, with all my eyes.” -
“You certainly see that the first thing is to stretch
out your arms to your papa Dugrand, since you are
so pleased to see him again ”
I stretched out my arms to their utmost extent;
but my body, not following the movement, still

wanted poise, and recoiled into a grotesque attitude.
My teacher, for lack of basic principles to guide
him, was unable to Correct my awkwardness; and,
vexed at his inability which he wished to conceal,
fell back on blaming my unlucky intellect.
“Fool,” said he finally, “you are hopelessly
stupid Why are you so embarrassed ? Are my
examples, then, worthless?”
“Indeed, sir, your examples are perfect.”
“Well, then, imitate them, imbecile !”
“I will try, sir.”
In this, as in all preceding lessons, I could give
only a blind imitation, which had not the small
mérit of being twice alike, even in my own eyes, for
every time I reproduced them I observed marked
variations which the master did not perceive.
I went to my room, as I had done many times
before, with tears in my eyes and despair in my
heart, to renew my useless efforts, vainly turning and
returning in all lights my unfortunate papa Dugrand.
This cruel ordeal lasted five months without the
least progress to lessen its bitterness.
Heaven knows with what ardor I cultivated my
papa Dugrand ' . I thought of him by day, and I
dreamed of him by night. I clung to him with all
the frenzy of despair, for I was determined not to
be beaten. I was bound to triumph at any cost, for
it was life or death to me. I resolved not to give
up papa Dugrand, even though he should resist me
ten years

My unceasing repetitions of (to them abomina-
ble) papa Dugrand caused my comrades to call me a
bore. In short, I became disagreeable to all around
me. Alas! all this study, all these efforts, could
not overcome the stubborn resistance of papa Du-
grand. My teachers were at their wits' end, and
finally refused to give me another lesson on the sub-
ject. But nothing could daunt the ardor of my zeal.
One day I was measuring the court-yard of the Con-
servatory, as usual, in company with papa Dugrand,
and repeating my “how are you ?” in every variety of
tone, when, all at once, having got as far as: “How
are you, pa–,” I stopped short without finishing
my phrase. It was interrupted by the sight of a
cousin of mine, whose visit was most unexpected.
“Ah! how are you?” I said; “how are you,
dear cou—”
Here my words were again interrupted by a sur-
prise; but this surprise was far greater than that
caused by the appearance of my cousin. Struck
by the analogy between this greeting and the un-
studied attitude which I had assumed under the ac-
tion of a genuine emotion, I cried in a transport of
joy which bewildered my innocent cousin: “Leave
me—don't disturb me—I’ve got it—wait for me—
stay where you are—I’ve got it.”
“But what is it that you've got P’’
“The dickens, papa Dugrand ' "
Thereupon I vanished like a flash, to run to my
mirror and reproduce to my sight papa Dugrand,

Judge of my astonishment: not only my gesture,
until now so persistently awkward, seemed suddenly
metamorphosed and became harmonious and nat-
ural; but, stranger yet, it did not correspond in the
least to what had been prescribed. However, it was
nature herself that had revealed this to me. Then,
the movements of my body, but a moment before so
discordant in my eyes, had acquired, under the in-
fluence of this gesture inspired from above, an ease
and a grace that filled me with surprise. Without
doubt, I now possessed the truth. An emotion,
spontaneously produced and so deeply felt, could
not result in an error.
This is what had happened under the action of a
natural surprise:
My hands were not extended toward the object
of my surprise — not the least in the world. By an
anterior extension of the arms, they were raised
high above my head, which, far from being uplifted
with the exultation which I had hitherto simulated,
was lowered to my breast; and my body, stranger
yet, instead of bending toward the attractive object,
bent suddenly backward.
What a blow nature had given to my masters
What an overthrowal of all conjectures My rea-
son, before this sovereign decision, was humbled
and dumbfounded. What arguments could my in-
structors invoke in the face of truth itself P
“What,” thought I, “are my masters absolutely
ignorant of the laws of nature?”

“What, does their reason, as well as mine, know
nothing of all this? How is it that this much-
praised reason has inspired me with effects precisely
opposite to those that were prescribed What is
reason? Is it, then, a blind faculty?”
Let us first see what these strange phenomena,
whose importance I cannot deny without denying
nature herself, signify.
I was in the midst of these reflections when the
recollection of my cousin came into my mind.
“Good heavens,” thought I; “I had forgotten
all about my poor cousin; what will he think P I
will hurry down, and, lest my precious ideas take
flight, send him away, and return to my reflec-
tions.
“Wretch that I am ; I think only how to get rid
of him, when he has so enriched me ! This is a
lesson to me. Poor boy! What opinion will he
have of me? Ah, that is he whom I see stretched
out on that stone bench. He has been patient, in-
deed. I believe that he is asleep !”
“No, I am not asleep,” said he, rising; “I am
furious ! Explain, if you are not too insane to be
rational, the extraordinary manner in which you
received me. Do you know that I have been wait-
ing here for you more than an hour P”
“Ah, my dear cousin,” said I, embracing him
warmly, “you do not know what a service you have
rendered me. I embrace you now, my good friend,
for the wonderful lesson you have given me. With-

out you I should never have found it out, and, rest
assured, I shall never forget it.”
“What P Who P What is it P '’
“Zounds, papa Dugrand I freely acknowledge
that I have learned more from you in one second
than from all my masters during four years.”
“Are you in your right senses?”
The matter was finally explained. My cousin
then told me about my home and my family; but I
must confess that I paid little attention to the good
news that he brought me, so excited and prečccu-
pied was my mind. Even then I could not help
thinking of the fragility of the heart in its affec-
tions. We soon separated, and I hurried to my
room, which seemed to me on this day paradise
itself.
I gave myself up to my interrupted course of
reflections.
I had proved the impotence of my own reason,
and also that of my masters. Now, as it was not
probable that all my teachers and myself were more
stupid than the rest of mankind — the common
herd – I concluded that reason is blind in the mat-
ter of principles, and that all her instructions would
be powerless to guide me in my researches. But,
from another side, it was evident to me that without
this reason I could not utilize a principle. What is
human reason, that faculty at once of so little avail
and yet so precious? What rôle does it play in art?
I feel that this is most important for me to know.

The answer to this question must spring from the
study of the phenomena of instinct. Let us ex-
amine, then, what nature offers us freely.
If these phenomena are directed by a physiologi-
cal or a spiritual necessity, a necessity on which in-
stinct is based, I am forced to admit, here, a reason
that is not my reason; a superior, infallible reason
in the disposition of things; a reason that laughs
at my reason, which, in spite of itself, must submit
under pain of falling into absurdity. I feel that it
is only by this absolute submission of my reason
that it can rise to the reason of things, since, of
itself, it would know nothing. [See definition of
reason.] -
Let us seek, then, without prejudice, the reason
of the things that interested me, in order that my
own reason may be raised to a higher plane. And
when it shall be illumined with the light that must
break upon it from the superior reason, I feel that
my reason can generalize instruction, and will be all-
powerful in arranging the conclusions that it may
deduce. I am aware, from the utter impotence of
my reason, that all principles must be accepted
humbly, in order to understand the deductions. My
reason does not know how to lead me to principles.
of which it is ignorant; but it knows how to guide
me back. In other words, it is a blind person
a priori, it is a luminary a posteriori. Though it
may not know at first, once shown, it readily recog-
nizes; though it may not divine, it learns by study;

though it may not seize, it retains, masters and
generalizes.
Reason, then, is a reflex power, and as such, if,
in a matter of principle, it recognizes itself as im-
potent and even absurd a priori, it knows that once
in possession of the principle, it borrows from its
light and becomes identified with it—an incom-
parable power of generalization.
Let the reason of the attitudes that I had ob-
served be once shown me, and my individual reason
would possess the Archimedean lever with which
I might open unknown worlds.
My reason | Ah ! I will identify it with the rea-
son of things | Henceforward this shall be my
method, this shall be my law.
But the reason of things—who will give it to
me? Is it not my reason itself P Oh, mystery !
I will follow thee to the depths of thy abyss. Thou
shalt have no more secrets from me, for God has
said that He hides only from the wise and prudent
man, but reveals Himself to the simple and to chil-
dren. Yes, these things shall be given to me through
my reason, if it will bow itself and be attentive and
humble; if it will patiently await the teachings of a
mute and persevering observation; if it will subor-
dinate itself to the intuitive lights that constitute
genius; and, finally, if it knows how to estimate
things other than itself.
Thus my reason, established, inflamed, consumed
by the charm of its contemplation, will be transfig-

ured in order to be more closely united to the sov-
ereign reason toward which it ever reaches out.
The first fruit of my observation consists in mak-
ing me recognize, in the facts examined, the proof
of a superior and infallible reason, and then to arm
against my individual reason and all its errors. An-
other thing yet more strange, but easily compre-
hended on reflection, is that to this defiance, this
contempt of self, I owe the boldness and the power
of my investigations.
Let us see, now, from which observations the pre-
ceding thoughts are the direct result.
In the phrase, “How are you, etc.,” my reason
dictated this triple, parallel movement: Advancing
the head, and the arms, with the torso on the fore-
leg. Now, the similar phrase, “ How are you, dear
cousin,” although uttered in a situation identical
with that of papa Dugrand, produced phenomena
diametrically opposed to those that my reason had
said were the only ones admissible. Is it not rea-
sonable to suppose that the sight of an agreeable
or loved object will excite in us a genuine feeling
that before we had vainly striven to simulate? Does
it not seem natural to extend the hand to a friend
when, with affectionate surprise, we exclaim : “How
are you, dear friend P” And should we ever think
of drawing the body away from the object that at-
tracts us? Finally, does it not seem that the head
should be raised, the better to see that which
charms us?

Ah, no l All these things, apparently so true and
so perfectly clear, are radically false. Facts prove
this beyond a doubt, and with facts there can be on
discussion, no argument. We must admit them
a priori or renounce the truth. Here, as in all ques-
tions of principle, the greatest act of reason consists
Žn an act of faith. This is absolutely undeniable.
In the phrase, “How are you, papa Dugrand,”
the arms should be raised, the head lowered and
the torso thrown back, supporting itself on the back
leg. This was indeed a blow to the presumption
of my poor reason, but should it complain P No,
for it has gained even from its confusion most fruit-
ful instruction.
Let us see. In questioning the effects and the
analogy, we shall doubtless explain their reason of
being. Why should the head become lowered P I
do not see all at first sight; but let us generalize
the question and probably it will specify itself.
When does a man bow his head before the object
which strikes his eye?
When he considers or examines it.
Does he never consider things with head raised ?
Yes, when he considers them with a feeling of
pride. It is thus that he rules them or exalts them;.
and also when he questions them with his glance;
in fine, when what he sees astonishes or surprises
him.
This last statement contradicts the example in
question, and seems to condemn it. Not the least

in the world. How is this? Thus: when the aston-
ishment or the surprise is not intense enough to
shake the frame, the head wherein all the surprise is
concentrated, is lifted and exalted. But so soon as
that surprise is great enough to raise the shoulders
and the arms, as by a galvanic shock, the head takes
an inverse direction, it sinks and seems anxious to
become solid to offer more resistance to that which
might attack it, for the first instinctive movement in
such a case is to guard against any unpleasant
event; then if the head is lifted to look at that which
surprises it, it is because it has no great interest in
the recognition of that which it considers; but as
soon as that interest commands it to examine, to
recognize, it is instantly lowered and placed in the
state of expectation.
O, now it becomes clear.
Now, how does surprise cause us to lift our arms?
The shoulder, in every man who is agitated or
moved, rises in exact proportion to the intensity of
his emotion.
It thus becomes the thermometer of the emotions.
Now, the commotion that imprints a strong impres-
sion, communicates to the arms an ascending mo-
tion which may lift them high above the head.
But why do not the arms, in an agreeable surprise,
tend toward the object of that surprise?
The arm should move gently toward the object that
it wishes to caress. Under the rapid action of surprise,
therefore, it could only injure or repel that object.


## p. 397 (#433) ############################################

EPISODE I. 397
This it does in affright.
But Instinct—that marvelous agent of divine rea-
son—in that case turns the arms away from the
object which they might injure by the rapidity of
their sudden extension, and directs them toward
heaven, leads them to rise as if expressing thanks
for an unexpected joy, so true it is that everything
is turned to use and is modified under the empire
of our instinct. Certainly, there is no similarity be-
tween this and the superfluous action, the inconse-
quent movements determined by the working of a
rule without a reason. And this is so because in all
that instinct suggests, it is the Supreme Artist him-
Self who disposes of us and acts in us, while what-
ever is suggested by a reason insufficiently inspired
by the contemplation of the divine handiwork is
fatally incoherent, for we thus pretend to substitute
ourselves for God, and God thenceforth leaving us
to ourselves, surrenders us to all the discordant
effects of an inconsequential and vain conception.
It remains to find the justificatory reason for this
retroactive movement of the body, which seems
illogical at first sight.
Let us inquire in what case and under the action
of what emotions a man may shrink from the object
which he is considering.
In the first place, he shrinks back whenever it in-
spires him with a feeling of repulsion. He shrinks
from it particularly when it inspires him with fright.
This is a matter of course and self-evident.

In what case does the body take an inverse direc-
tion to the object which attracts it? This we must
know before we can explain the phenomenon in
question.
We move away from the thing which we con-
template to prove to it, doubtless, the respect and
veneration that it inspires. In fact, it seems a lack
of respect to that which we love to approach it too
closely; we move away that we may not profane it
by a contact which it seems might injure its purity.
Thus the retrograde movement may be the sign
of reverence and salutation, and moreover a token
that the object before which it is produced is more
eminent and more worthy of veneration.
A salutation without moving shows but little rev-
erence, and should only occur in the case of an
equal or an inferior.
In justification of the actual fact, let me give an-
other observation of quite another importance.
When a painter examines his work, he moves
away from it perceptibly. He moves away in pro-
portion to the degree of his admiration of it, so that
the retroactive movement of his body is in equal
ratio to the interest that he feels in contemplating
his work, whence it follows that the painter who ex-
amines his work in any other way, reveals his indif-
ference to it.
The picture-dealer usually proceeds in quite an-
other manner. He examines it closely and with a
magnifying-glass in hand. Why is this? Because


## p. 399 (#435) ############################################

EPISODE I. 399
it is less the picture which he examines than the
handiwork of the painter, the actual work which is
the chief object of his survey.
But why does the artist move away from the work
which he contemplates? The better to seize the
total impression. For instance: if it be a full length
portrait and the artist studies it too closely he secs,
I will suppose, the nose of his portrait and nothing
more. If he moves a little farther off he sees a little
more, he sees the head ; still farther and he sees both
the head and the torso which supports it. Finally,
moving still farther away, he gets a view of the whole
and thus seizes its harmonious relations. This in-
spection may be called synthetic vision, and in
opposition to this, direct vision, which I assumed
before instinct taught me better, is but short and
limited.
To sum up: If instinct did not lead us to retro-
act, to examine an object unexpectedly offered to our
gaze, each surprise would expose us to error.
Now we must retroact to see an object as a whole
and not expose ourselves to error, and then, too,
does not the love which a creature inspires within
us naturally extend to the medium which surrounds
him, and in this way does it not seem as if all that
touched him partook of his life and thus acquired
some title to our contemplation? -
Thus my mind, tortured by one prečccupying
thought, had, thanks to the fixed idea which swayed
it, found wondrous lessons in the simple incident of

my cousin's return, otherwise so devoid of interest;
and I may truly say that the lesson learned from
meeting my cousin taught me more than all those
I had received in the space of three years. In short,
I had learned how vain is advice dictated by the
caprice of a master without a system | I had
learned the inanity of individual reason in a matter
of experience. I knew that certain laws existed,
that those laws proceeded from a Supreme Reason,
an immense centre of light, of which each man's
reason is but a single ray. I knew without a doubt
how ignorant my masters were of those laws to the
study of which I meant to devote my life. I pos-
sessed facts which I saw could be applied in count-
less ways, luminous doctrines radiating from the
application.
Thenceforth I had the nucleus of the science I
had so vainly asked of my masters, and I did not
despair of formulating it.
Judge of my joy! The facts I then found myself
the possessor of, seemed to me more valuable than
all the treasures of the world.

EPISODE II.
Some time later, I again saw my worthy cousin,
the innocent cause of all my joys. He was a medi-
cal student, and came to propose a visit to the dis-
secting-room. I did not hesitate to accept; the
proposal harmonized with my desire.
I did not go, as so many go to the morgue,
merely to see dead bodies. No ; the curiosity that
impelled me, and the avidity with which I pursued
the object of my study, was not to be so easily sat-
isfied.
Dead bodies only attracted me when they were—
if not dissected—at least flayed. Children break
their dolls to see what there is inside; so I, too,
wanted to see what there was in a corpse. It seemed
to me that under the mutilations which the scalpel
had inflicted on the body, I should find the answer
to more than one enigma—might solve some of the
secrets of life.
The prospect of this visit had the charm of a
pleasure party to me. I made it a holiday and
awaited the hour with impatience.
But, on arriving, when I found myself in that place
chill and gloomy as the tomb; when I felt choked
by the mephitic gases that arose from this seat of
infection; when I found myself in the presence of a
heap of corpses mutilated by the scalpel, disfigured

by putrefaction and partially devoured by rats and
worms; when, beneath tables laden with these hor-
rible remains, I saw mean tubs filled with human
entrails mingled with limbs and heads severed from
their trunks; when I felt fragments of flesh reduced
to the state of filthy mud, clinging to my feet, my
heart throbbed violently, and I was overcome by an
indescribable sense of repulsion.
“What,” I said to myself, “those shapeless and
putrifying masses have lived They have thought,
they have loved And, who would believe it from
the horror and disgust that they inspire, they have
been loved, cherished, perhaps adored ! Ah l if, as
some think, the Soul is not immortal, if so many as-
pirations, so many schemes, so many hopes are to
end here—-what is man P”
But yet more lamentable food for thought was
reserved for me: the spectacle of a ruin yet more
profound than those which my eyes could scarce en-
dure, was to appear before me in all its hideousness.
In fact, there reigns in these gloomy halls where
no tear has ever fallen, no prayer has ever been
heard and no ray of hope has ever pierced—there
reigns something yet colder than death, something
more unwholesome, more nauseous, more delete-
rious than the putrid miasmas that infect the air,
something more sad to see than the nameless frag-
ments of extinct life, something more loathsome
than those filthy and disgusting remnants, something
more repulsive than those noses eaten by worms

and those empty eyeballs devoured by rats. I mean
the cynicism of the dwellers in that place; I mean
their insensibility, their indifference and calm heed-
lessness in the presence of such grave subjects for
thought. I mean that lack of perception, that spirit
of negation and revolt of which those wretched men
make a boast and which they obstinately oppose to
all religious sentiment, all principle of tradition or
revealed authority. I mean the atheism and cease-
less mockery with which they invariably meet any
generous impulse aroused in an honest Soul by a
healthy faith. p
This struck me even more sensibly than the spec-
tacle of death and dissolution which I have striven
to describe. Thus the apparently living men who
haunt this spot are more truly dead than the corpses
upon which they exercise their pretended science.
They seemed to me ruins far more terrible than
those of the body, ruins which repelled all hope,
being born of doubt and leading to negation.
If the mutilated and half-devoured bodies that lay
before me, filled me with horror and disgust, they,
at least, left within me a faint lingering hope sur-
viving death; but the state of blindness of those
souls who have lost consciousness of their being and
even the feeling of thir existence, the shadowy
abyss into which they allow themselves complais-
antly to glide, the nullity which they adorn with the
title of science,—all this filled me with fright, for I
felt the doubt and despair into which contact with it

would inevitably have plunged me, if, by a special
favor, the tone and mimetics, alike self-sufficient and
mocking, of these free-thinkers, as they are now
styled, had not, from the first, inspired me with aver-
sion for them and a salutary hatred of their doc-
trine.
And yet, amidst so many repulsive objects, the
faculty of observation to which I already owed such
fruitful remarks was not dormant in me: I had
already asked myself by what evident sign one could
recognize a recent corpse.
From this point of view I made a rapid explora-
tion, and I questioned the various corpses left almost
intact; I sought in some portion of the body, com-
mon to all, a form or a sign invariably found in all.
The hand furnished me that sign and responded
fully to my question.
I noticed, in fact, that in all these corpses the
thumb exhibited a singular attitude—that of adduc-
tion or attraction inward, which I had never noted
either in persons waking or sleeping.
This was a flash of light to me. To be yet more
sure of my discovery, I examined a number of arms
severed from the trunk; they showed the same ten-
dency. I even saw hands severed from the forearm;
and, in spite of this severing of the flexor muscles,
the thumb still revealed this same sign. Such per-
sistence in the same fact could not allow of the
shadow of a doubt: I possessed the sign-language
of death, the semeiotics of the dead.


## p. 405 (#441) ############################################

EPISODE II. 4O5
I rejoiced, foreseeing the service which this dis-
covery would render upon a battle-field, for instance,
where more than one man risks being buried alive. I
divined, moreover, something of its artisticimportance.
I then questioned my cousin and the other students
present in regard to the symptomatics of death, and
I saw with surprise that, not only had the expression
of this phenomenon escaped them hitherto, but that
they had no exact and precise knowledge concern-
ing this grave and important question.
There remained, in order to complete my discov-
ery and to deduce useful results from it, to verify
the symptom on the dying man. It was important
for me to know in what degree it might become
manifest on the approach of death.
My wishes were gratified as if by magic, for I was
led from the school of anatomy to that of clinical
medicine. There a house-student, a friend of my
cousin, placed me beside a dying patient, and I ex-
amined with the utmost attention the hands of the
unhappy man struggling against the clutches of in-
evitable death.
At first I observed something strange in regard to
myself, namely that the emotion which such a sight
would have caused me under any other circum-
stances, was absolutely null at this moment; close
attention dulled all feeling in me. I then understood
the courage which may inspire the surgeon in the
discharge of his duty; and I drew from this obser-
vation deductions of great artistic interest.

Now I proved that the thumbs of the dying man
contracted at first in almost imperceptible degree;
but as the last struggle drew near, and in the su-
preme efforts made by the patient to hold fast to the
life which was slipping from him, I saw all his fin-
gers convulsively directed toward the palm of the
hand, thus hiding the thumbs which had previously
approached that centre of convergence. Death
speedily followed this crisis and soon restored to the
fingers a more normal position; but the contraction
of the thumb persistently conformed to my previous
observations. The presence and progress of this
phenomenon in the dying was invariably confirmed
by numerous tests which I afterward tried.
Thus, I had acquired the proof that, not only
does the total adduction of the thumb characterize
death, but that this phenomenon indicates the ap-
proach of death in proportion to its intensity. I,
therefore, possessed the fundamental principle of a
system of Semeiotics hitherto unknown to physiolo-
gists; but this principle, already so full of interest,
must be made profitable to art.
A multitude of pictures, which in former times I
had admired at the museum, passed before my
mind's eye. I recalled battle-scenes where the dying
and the dead are represented; descents from the
cross where Christ is necessarily represented as dead.
The idea struck me that I would go and verify the
action of the thumb in these various representations
which the painter's fancy has given us of death.

EPISODE II. - 4O7
It was on a Sunday. The Louvre was on my way
to the Conservatory, where, as is well known, I lived
as pensioner.
I had often traversed the galleries of the Louvre;
but now I was armed with a criterion that would
give my criticisms indisputable authority.
The ignorance of the fact I sought, even among
artists of renown, was not long in being made appar-
ent: all those hands, where they thought they had
depicted death, afforded me nothing but the charac-
teristics of a more or less peaceful sleep. The cor-
rectness of my criticism may be verified anywhere.
Thus, the mere discovery of a law sufficed to
elevate a poor boy of fifteen years, destitute of all
science and deploring the deep ignorance in which
he had hitherto been left, to the height of an infallible
critic in whom the greatest artists found no mercy.
I then understood all the power, all the fertility given
by an acquaintance with the laws that regulate the
nature of man, and in how much even genius itself
may be rendered sterile by ignorance of those laws
which simple observation would make them ac-
quainted with. But, I thought, my discovery is not
complete, for if, thanks to it, I have succeeded in
proving that all these pictures of death are false, true
only as representing sleep, it is, on the other hand,
impossible for me to prove in how far those figures
live, in which the painter aims to represent life. I
must, therefore, seek the sign of life to complete my
standard of criticism.

Suddenly, struck with amazement by the dazzling
rays of unexpected light, I asked myself whether
the criterion of death would not reveal to me, by the
law of contraries, the thermometer of life. It should
a priori—it does |
Still I felt that it was not here that I might be per-
mitted to contemplate the vital phenomena attached
to the thumb : since death was so badly rendered
here, I had strong reasons for thinking that life was
no better treated.
I left the museum, then, where I had nothing
more to learn; and, to observe living mimetics of
the thumb, I went out on the promenade of the
Tuileries thronged by aristocratic people. I care-
fully examined the hands of this crowd, but I was
not long in discovering that these elegant idlers
had nothing good to offer. “This class,” I said to
myself, “is false from head to foot. They live an
artificial, unnatural life. I see in them only artifice,
or an art dishonored by using it to mask their insin-
cerity and artificiality.”
The happy idea came to me to mingle with
mothers, children and nurses.
“Ah,” said I, “in the midst of this throng, laugh-
ing and crying at the same time—singing, shouting,
gesticulating, jumping, dancing—here is life If
the contemplation of this turbulent and affectionate
little world does not instruct me, where shall I find
the solution I seek?”
I did not have to wait long for this solution.


## p. 409 (#445) ############################################

EPISODE II. 4O9
I noticed nurses who were distracted and indif-
ferent to the children under their charge ; in these
the thumb was invariably drawn toward the fingers,
thus offering some resemblance to the adduction
which it manifests in death. With other nurses,
more affectionate, the fingers of the hand that held
the child were visibly parted, displaying a thumb
bent outward; but this eccentration rose to still
more startling proportion in those mothers whom
I saw each carrying her own child; there the thumb
was bent violently outward, as if to embrace and
clasp a beloved being.
Thus I was not slow to recognize that the con-
traction of the thumb is inversely proportionate, its
extension directly proportionate to the affectional ex-
altation of the life. “No doubt,” I said to myself,
“the thumb is the thermometer of life in its extend-
ing progression as it is of death in its contracting
progression.”
Countless examples have confirmed this. I could
even, on the spot, form an idea of the degree of af-
fection felt for the children entrusted to their care,
by the women who passed before my eyes.
Sometimes I would say: “There is a servile crea-
ture whose heart is dead to that poor child whom
she carries like an inert mass; the position of the
thumb drawn toward the fingers renders that indif-
ference evident.” Again it was a woman in whom
the sources of life swelled high at the contact with
the dear treasure which she clasped; that woman

was surely the mother of the child she carried, the ex-
cessive opening of her thumb left no room for doubt.
Thus my diagnostics were invariably confirmed
by exact information, and I could see to what extent
the remarks which I had recorded, were justified. I
drew from them most interesting applications for
my special course of study.
Thus, Suppose I had asked the same service from
three men, and that each had answered me with the
single word yes, accompanied by a gesture of the
hand. If one of them had let his thumb approach
the forefinger, it is plain to me that he would de-
ceive me, for his thumb thus placed tells me that he
is dead to my proposition.
If I observe in the second a slight abduction of
the thumb, I must believe that he, although indis-
posed to oblige me, will still do so from submission.
But if the third abducts his thumb forcibly from
the other fingers, oh! I can count on him, he will
not deceive me ! The abduction of his thumb tells
me more in regard to his loyalty than all the assur-
ances which he might give me.
Behold, then, an intuition whose correctness the
experience of forty years has not contradicted.
It is hard to imagine the joy I felt at my discov-
ery produced and verified in a single day by so
many examples, differing so greatly one from an-
other and of such diverse interest. -
All the emotions of this extraordinary and fertile
day had so over-excited my imagination that I had

great difficulty in calming my poor brain, and far
from being able to enjoy the rest which I so much
needed, I was a prey to wakefulness in which the
turmoil of my ideas at one time made me fear that
I was going mad. I then felt for the first time the
frailty of the instrument of thought in regard to
the faculty which rules and governs it.
In brief, I was — thanks to my double discovery
— in possession of a law whose deductions ought to
touch the loftiest questions of science and art, and
I was enabled thenceforth to affirm upon strong and
irrefragable proof that the thumb, in its double
sphere of action, is the thermometer of life as well
as of death.

EPISODE III.
The day after that which had been so fruitful both
in emotions and discoveries, a thousand recollections
tumultuously besieged my mind and still disturbed
me. I saw that if I could not contrive to classify
them in strict order of succession, I should never be
able to derive any practical value from them. I
therefore took up link by link the chain of events
of the previous day, but in inverse order. That is,
I began my course where I left off the day before,
and thus proceeded toward the Tuileries to end at
the Medical School.
At the retrospective sight of all that merry, noisy
little world, of all those fat, cheerful nurses, careless
and laughing as they were, of those mothers each so
tenderly expansive in contemplation of her child, so
happy in its health and strength, so joyous and so
proud of its small progress, the recollection of a
phenomenon which I had not at first observed struck
me with all the force of a vivid actuality.
I should say, by the way, that it is much more to
the strength of my memory than to the present ob-
Servation of facts, that I owe these remarks. Sta-
bility is the sine gua non of the things one proposes
to examine, and the memory must possess the sin-
gular power of communicating fixity to fugitive

things, permanence to instantaneousness, and actu-
ality to the past.
Now, the phenomena of life occurring with the
rapidity of lightning can only be studied retrospect-
ively; that is to say, in the domain of memory, ex-
cept to be verified if the attention, free from all
other prečccupation, allows us to seize them on the
wing once more. The remark suggested to me by
memory seemed all the more interesting because it
formed in a new order of facts a flagrant opposition
to the opinion formulated by my masters under the
title of theory. Thus nature once more proved to
me that the only point in which I had found them
to agree, rested upon a fundamental error. I have
since recognized that it is thus in the majority of
cases, so that one may almost certainly pronounce
erroneous any statement in regard to which all the
masters of art agree.
This proposition at first seems inexplicable, but
its reason is readily understood by those who know
the sway of falsehood over a society perverted in its
opinions as in its tastes; to those who know the de-
plorable facility with which error is spread and the
tenacity with which it clings to our poor mind.
Error, moreover, owes to our abasement which it
flatters and crushes, the privilege of freedom from
contradiction, and it is only in regard to truth that
the minds of men are divided and contend.
On retracing in my memory the walks I had taken
in the Tuileries, I was struck by an important fact

4 I4 DELSARTE'S OWN WORDS.
amidst the phenomena called up : the voice of the
nurse or mother, when she caressed her child, inva-
riably assumed the double character of tenuity and
acuteness. It was in a voice equally sweet and
high-pitched that she uttered such words as these:
“How lovely he is l’” . . . “Smile a little bit for
mamma / " Now this caressing intonation, impressed
by nature upon the upper notes of all these voices,
forms a strange contrast to the direction which all
singing-teachers agree in formulating; a direction
which consists in augmenting the intensity of the
sound in direct ratio to its acuteness. Thus, to
them, strange to say, the entire law of vocal shades
would consist in augmenting progressively the sound
of the ascending phrase or Scale, and diminishing in
the same proportion for a descending scale. Now,
nature, by a thousand irrefutable examples, directs
us to do the contrary, that is, she prescribes a de-
crease of intensity (in music, decrescendo) propor-
tionate to the ascensional force of the Sounds.
Another blow, I thought, for my masters, or
rather I receive it for them, for they, poor fellows,
do not feel it. But how can these phenomena of
nature have escaped them, and by what indescrib-
able aberration can they direct, under the name of .
law, a process absolutely contrary to that so plainly
followed by those same phenomena? However, I
added, every supreme error under penalty of being
self-evident, must, to endure, necessarily rest upon
some truth or other. Now, on what truth do so


## p. 415 (#451) ############################################

EPISODE III. 4I 5
many masters claim to base so manifest an error?
This is what we must discover.
I was now convinced that caressing, tender and
gentle emotions find their normal expression in high
notes. This is beyond all doubt. Thus, according
to the foregoing examples, if we propose to say to
a child in a caressing tone that he is a darling, it
would clearly be very bad taste to bellow the words
at him on the pretext that, according to singing-
teachers, the intensity of the sound is augmented in
direct ratio to its acuteness.
But my memory, as if to confirm this principle,
and to show its contrast with the custom admitted
by those gentlemen, suggests to me other instances
derived from the same source. Let a mother be
angry with her child and threaten him with pun-
ishment; she instantly assumes a grave tone which
she strives to render powerful and intense. Here,
then, on the one hand (and nature proclaims it), the
voice decreases in "intensity in proportion as it rises
higher; and, on the other hand, it increases in pro-
portion as it sinks. This double fact, undeniably
established, constitutes an unanswerable argument
against the system in question. But it is not, there-
fore, necessarily its radical and absolute refutation.
No, doubtless, whatever may be the significance and
the number of the facts opposed to the directions

able to those masters. Thus, I have seen many
nurses lose their temper and still use the higher
tones of their voice; and, on the other hand, I also
remark (and the remark is important) a certain form,
the appellative form, where all the characters agree
without exception in producing the greatest inten-
sity possible upon the high notes.
The professors of singing triumph, for they find
in this appellative form, always and necessarily
sharp and boisterous at the same time, a striking
confirmation of their system. Here I seem to stray
far ſron the solution which I thought I already
grasped Far from it; the light is breaking.
Hitherto the examples evoked had only increased
my obscurity by their multiplicity, and I saw noth-
ing in all these remarks but a series of contradic-
tions whence it seemed impossible to deduce any-
thing but confusion, into which I found myself
plunged.
But was this confusion really in the facts which I
examined, or was it not rather the creation of my
own mind? Now, in the matter of principle, the
weakness of individual reason has been too often
proved to me to allow of my attaching any other
cause to the contradictions which block my path
and force me to confess my ignorance. I will not,
then, here cry mea culpa for myself or for others to
justify that ignorance or excuse its confession. It
must be acknowledged that God knows what He
does, and His omnipotence is assuredly guiltless of

the divagations which an impotent mind finds it
convenient to attribute to it.
Now, let others in the blindness of proud reason,
forget this truth, which they contest even by oppos-
ing to it the quibbles for which free-thinkers are
never at a loss, and to escape the confusion which
they inevitably derive from the ill-studied work of
the Supreme Artist. Let them venture to attribute
to it their own darkness. For my part, I shall not
thereby lose my conviction that all which seems to me
disordered or contradictory in the expression of the
facts which I question, is only apparent and only
exist in my own brain.
The profound obscurity into which light plunges
us does not prevent the light from being; and the
chaos of ideas which, most generally, results from
our examination of things, proves nothing against
the harmonies of their constitution.
The pebble virtually contains the spark, but we
must know how to produce it. Thus the phenom-
ena of nature contain luminous lessons, but we must
know how to make them speak; and, what is more,
understand their language. Now, I would add, the
spirit of God is inherent in all things; and this
spirit should, at a given moment, flash its splendors
in the eyes of an intellect alike submissive, atten-
tive, patient and suppliant.
Moreover, does not the Gospel show us the way
to fertilize investigations such as those to which I
have given my life? Does it not say: “Knock and

it shall be opened, ask and it shall be given?”
Then what must I do to find my way out of the
maze in which my reason wanders? What must I
do in presence of the contradictions which neverthe-
less must needs contain a fecund principle? Finally,
what must I do in order to see light break from the
very heart of those obscurities wherein light is
lost?
I will seek anew, night and day, if needful; I will
knock incessantly at the door of the facts which I
desire to examine. I will descend into the secret
depths of their organism; there I will patiently
question every phenomenon, every organ, and I will
entreat their Author to divulge to me their purpose,
their relations and their very object.
Well ! It is thus that those men, proud of their
vain knowledge, were made dizzy by the splendor
of that same light which they thought that they
could subject to their investigations, and the blind-
ness which has fallen upon them is the punishment
which God is content to inflict upon them in this
world.
Having said this, where was I in my investiga-
tions? Ah it was here.
The memory of the high inflections invariably
affected by the women whom I had seen on the pre-
vious day, caressing their infants, struck me with the
more force that I had learned from my masters that
law which had hitherto ruled uncontested, and now
underwent a refutation which demonstrated the

falsity of its applications with a clearness and mi-
nuteness which left no room for doubt.
The examples in virtue of which I saw the errors
of my masters, unanimously proclaimed the tenuity
of the voice to be in proportion to its acuteness.
Now this formula is, in letter as in spirit, the re-
verse of the prescription upon which, by a caprice
whose cause I have just explained, all the masters
of art agree.
I then perceived that my first affirmations were
no better founded than those of the masters, whose
theories I had attacked. The truth of the matter is
that ascending progressions may arise from opposite
shades of meaning. “Therefore,” said I to myself, “it
is equally inadmissible to exclude either affirmation.”
The law is necessarily complex: let us bring to-
gether, that we may seize them as a whole, both the
contrary expressions and the circumstances which
produce them.
Vulgar and uncultured people, as well as children,
seem to act in regard to an ascensional vocal pro-
gression in an inverse sense to well-educated, or, at
any rate, affectionate persons, such as mothers, fond
nurses, etc.
No example has, to my knowledge, contradicted
this remark.
But why this difference? What are its motive

sensuality and tenderness, these shades of the voice
may be traced back to two distinct sources: sent-
ment and passion. It is sentiment which I have seen
revealed in mothers; it is passion which we find in
uncultured persons.”
Sentiment and passion, then, proceed in an in-
verse way. Passion strengthens the voice in pro-
portion as it rises, and sentiment, on the contrary,
softens it in due ratio to its intensity. It was the
confusion of these different sources which caused a
momentary obscurity in my understanding.
Let us now formulate boldly the law of vocal
proportions. -
Given a rising form, such as the ascending scale,
there will be intensitive progression when this form
should express passion (whether impulse, excite-
ment or vehemence).
There will be, on the other hand, a diminution of
intensity where this same form should express
sentiment.
This law even seems regulated by a quantitative
expression, the form of which appeared to me like
a flash of light. This is the formula:
Under the influence of sentiment the smallest and
most insignificant things that we may wish to repre-
sent proportion themselves to the degree of acute-
ness of the sounds, which become softened in pro-
portion as they rise.
Under the influence of passion, on the contrary,
the voice rises, with a corresponding brilliancy, in

EPISODE III. 42 I
proportion to the magnitude of the thing it would
express, and becomes lowered to express smallness
or meanness. . Thus an ascending scale being given,
it must be considered as a double scale of propor-
tion, agreeing alternately with an increasing or de-
creasing intensitive progression, increasing under the
influence of passion and decreasing under the influ-
ence of sentiment.
Thus we would not use the same tones for the
words: “Oh, what a pretty little girl | * “What a
lovely little flower l’’ and : “See that nice, fat peas-
ant woman l’” “What a comfortable great house ! ”
By such formulae as these I was able to sum up,
in clear and didactic form, the multifarious examples
suggested by my memory, startled at first by their
contradiction and then delighted at the light thrown
upon them by these very formulae, due, not to my
own merit, but to the favor of Him who holds in
His hand the source of all truth.
Thus, I feel and readily acknowledge, that the dis-
covery upon which I am at work is not my own
work; and, therefore, I pray for it as for a signal
favor. Nor can it be otherwise with any man. It
is, therefore, always an impertinence for any man to
attribute to his personal genius, vast as he may sup-
pose it to be, the discovery of any law. God alone
discloses His treasures, and, as I have experienced,
He only reveals them to the eye of reason raised by
humility to contemplation.
Man seeks that which he desires to know with at-

tention and patience proportioned to the ardor of
his desire. The attention of which his mind is ca-
pable and the constancy of will brought to bear in
pursuit of his research, constitute his only mark of
distinction. Herein lies all the merit to which he
can lay just claim. But at a moment absolutely
unforeseen, God reveals to him that which he seeks,
I should say that for which he does not seek, and
for his due edification it is generally the opposite
of what he seeks which is revealed to him. This is
not to be contested. Thus the things discovered to
him cause him such surprise that he never fails to
beat his brow when he sees them, as if to prove that
he is not the author of their discovery, and that he
was far from foreseeing anything like what has been
shown to him; and that there may be no possible
mistake in the interpretation of the gesture, he in-
variably accompanies it by the phrase: “What a
fool I am " All will admit that if a man really
believed himself the author of his discovery, he
takes a very inopportune time to declare his impo-
tence and his stupidity so distinctly. But taking
none too kindly his avowal which, moreover, is but
the proclamation of an indisputable truth, let us
rather say that this act of humility is forced from
him by the greatness of his surprise.
Happy, very happy is the man whose pride does
not instantly react against the humble and truthful
confession of his folly.

myself the cause of the sterility of the learned bodies,
and I do not hesitate to say to-day, that it is because
scientists refuse to declare themselves fools, and it
is to this lack of sincerity that they doubtless owe
the punishment that paralyzes their genius.
How can these men fail to take seriously the little
knowledge to which they cling and their fortune and
renown ; how can these wise men, to whom the
world pays incessant homage, consent meekly to
confess the infirmity of their reason P They feign,
on the contrary, even when crushed beneath the
Divine splendor, an air of great importance; and
when the Omnipotent in His mercy deigns to bend
to their low level, to lay open to them the treasures
of His sovereign thought, do you think that in token
of the sacred and respectful admiration which they
owe in return for such goodness, they will prostrate
themselves like the Seraphim whose knowledge
assuredly equals the few notions which they adorn
with that title P Ah far from it. You little know
these scientists, when you impute to them an act
which they would qualify as contemptible and would
declare unworthy of a free-thinker | They stand
erect, on the contrary, with head held high, inso-
lently laying claim, by virtue of I know not what
conquest of the human mind, to judge the eternal
and immovable light of the Divine Reason.

My retrospective journey from this point of de-
parture seemed destined to be even more full of
observations than that which preceded it. My day
had been so full of work, so fruitful in unexpected
discoveries, that it was absolutely necessary for me
to stop at this first station.
After a few days of rest I naturally resumed my
walk toward the garden of the Tuileries, whither I
was led by an instinct full of promise. There, in
fact, fresh re-appearances were not long in adding
light to that with which I was still dazzled !
I remember that I had been vaguely struck by
the contemplative attitude of a mother toward her
child. The reason why this attitude struck me even
in the midst of my absorption in search of notes
relative to the thumb, was, first, because this attitude
was a contrast to that assumed by most of the
nurses under the action of the same feeling; and,
in the next place, it seemed to deny the contempla-
tive forms which I had deduced from my first dis-
covery, and which rested upon such motives as the
following: That a painter admires his work by
throwing back his head. Hitherto it had seemed to
Iſle clearly proven that admiring contemplation en-
tailed this retroaction. I considered this, it will be

remembered, the characteristic feature of a law, and
that for the reasons which I had previously given.
Well! were all these reasons, plausible as they ap-
peared, to be contradicted by a single fact still pres-
ent to my memory, in spite of the observations in
the midst of which it arose, and which, moreover,
should have been more than enough to efface it?
Strange to say, this fact vaguely noted amidst pre-
occupations to which it seemed absolutely foreign,
had remained persistently in my mind | Now this
fact, becoming by a reflex act the object of serious
thought, resulted from this observation:
That a woman, as she contemplated her child,
bent her head toward it.
Searching in my memory, I found several similar
instances completely confirming this principle, op-
posed to my observations, that contemplation tends
to push the head toward the object contemplated.
And yet this example does not affect those to
which I had at first paid exclusive heed. Here, as
in the preceding remarks, the law is complex, and it
must first be recognized that contemplation or simple
admiration is produced alike by the retreat or ad-
vance of the head. This double action being ad-
mitted, it remained to decide how far they might be
mingled in a single situation; that is to say, to what
point these two inverse inclinations might be pro-
duced indifferently; and if, as I must a priori sup-
pose, these inclinations recognized two distinct
causes. If so, what were those reasons? The

question was not easy of solution, and yet it must
be decided definitely. I could enjoy no peace until
I had answered it. The doubt instilled into my
mind by this new contradiction was intolerable. I
set boldly to work, determined not to pause until I
had found a final solution. I called to mind all my
memories having any bearing on this double phe-
nomenon. These memories were far more numer-
ous and far more striking than I had dared to hope.
What a magnificent thing are those mysterious res-
ervoirs whence, at a given moment, flow thousands
of pictures which until then we knew not that we
possessed? A whole world of prostrate believers
adoringly turning their heads toward the object of
their worship, appeared before me to support the
example afforded me by the mother lovingly bend-
ing her head toward the child at which she gazed.
Among other instances, I saw a venerable master
affectionately bending his head toward the being to
whom he thus seemed with touching predilection to
give luminous instructions.
I saw lovers gazing at their loved one with this
attractive pose of the head, their tenderness seeming
thus to be eloquently affirmed. But, side by side
with these examples, I saw others totally opposite;
thus, other lovers presented themselves to my mind's
eye with very different aspect, and their number
seemed far greater than that of the other. These
lovers delighted to gaze at their sweetheart as paint-
ers study their work, with head thrown back. I saw

mothers and many nurses gazing at children with
this same retroactive movement which stamped their
gaze with a certain expression of satisfied pride,
generally to be noted in those who carried a nursling
distinguished for its beauty or the elegance of its
clothes.
Two words, as important as they are opposite in
the sense that they determine, are disengaged : senz-
sata/ity and tenderness.
Such are the sources to which we must refer the
attitudes assumed by the head on sight of the object
considered.
Between these inverse attitudes a third should
naturally be placed. It was easy for me to charac-
terize this latter: I called it colorless or indifferent.
It is entirely natural that the man who considers
an object from the point of view of the mere exam-
ination which his mind makes of it, should simply
look it in the face until that object had aroused the
innermost movements of the soul or of the life.
Whence it invariably follows that from the incite-
ment of these movements, the head is bent to the
side of the soul or to the side of the senses.
“Which is, then, for the head, the side of the
soul,” you will ask me, “and which the side of the
senses?” -
I will reply simply, to cut short the useless de-
scription of the many drawbacks that preceded the
clear demonstration that I finally established, that
the side of the heart is the objective side that occu-

pies the interlocutor, and that the side of the senses
is the subjective, personal side toward which the
head retroacts; that is to say, the side opposed to
the object under examination. Thus, when the head
moves in an inverse direction from the object that it
examines, it is from a selfish standpoint; and when
the examiner bends toward the object it is in Con-
tempt of self that the object is viewed.
These are the two related looks that I have named
Sensuality and Tenderness, for these reasons:
The former of these glances is addressed exclu-
sively to the form of its object; it caresses the pe-
riphery of it, and, the better to appreciate its totality,
moves away from it. This is what occurs in the
retroactive attitude of the head.
The other look, on the contrary, aims at the heart
of things without pausing on the surface, disdaining
all that is external. It strives to penetrate the ob-
ject to its very essence, as if to unite itself more
closely within it; it has the expression of confidence,
of faith—in a word, the giving up of self.
Thus, when a man presses a woman's hand, we
may affirm one of three things from the attitude
which his head assumes:
I. That he does not love her, if his head remains
straight or simply bent in facing her.
2. That he loves her tenderly, if he bows his head
obliquely toward her.
3. Finally, that he loves her sensually—that is to
say, Solely for her physical qualities—if, on looking

at her, he moves his head toward the shoulder which
is opposite her.
Such are, in brief, the three attitudes of the head
and the eyes, which I have named colorless, affec-
tional, sensual.
Henceforth I possessed completely the law of the
inclinations of the head, a law which derives from its
very complexity the fertility of its applications.

SEMEIOTICS OF THE SHOULDER.
When I found myself the possessor of this law
whose triple formula is of a nature to defy every
objection, I sought to appropriate to myself, before
the mirror, all its applications.
But there arose yet another difficulty that I had
not foreseen.
I, indeed, reproduced, and at the proper time, the
movements of the head already described, but they
remained awkward and lifeless.
What was the cause of this awkwardness and cold-
ness of which I was well aware, but which I could
not help? I strove unceasingly to reproduce the
examples that lived so vividly in my memory, but
all these laborious reproductions, these efforts from
memory, were futile. The stubbornness of an in-
domitable will, however, led only to a negative re-
sult. I was vexed at an awkwardness the reason of
which I could not find.
One day, almost discouraged by the lack of suc-
cess in my researches, I sorrowfully said to myself:
“What shall I do? Alas ! the more I labor, the
less clearly I see; am I incapable of reproducing
nature—is the difficulty that holds me back in-
vincible?”


## p. 431 (#467) ############################################

EPISODE v. 43 I
As I uttered the preceding words, I noticed that,
under the sway of the grief which dictated them, my
shoulders were strangely lifted up, and, as then I
found myself in the attitude which I had previously
tried to render natural, the unexpected movement
of my shoulders, joined to that attitude, suddenly
impressed it with an expression of life so just, so
true, so surprising, that I was overwhelmed.
Thus I gained possession of an aesthetic fact of
the first rank, and I was as amazed at my discovery
as I was surprised that I had not observed sooner a
self-evident movement, whose powerful and expres-
sive character seems fundamentally connected with
the actions of the head. “How stupid I am,” I
thought, “not to have remarked so evident an ac-
tion of an agent which leads the head itself. How
could I let this movement of the shoulder escape
me !” And I revelled in the pleasurable triumph
of reproducing and contemplating expressions which
I could not have rendered previously without dis-
honoring them. Thenceforth I understood without
a doubt all the importance of this latest discovery.
But this importance, clearly proven as it was, was
not yet fully explained to me.
Thus, I knew henceforth the necessity for move-
ments of the shoulder, but I was still ignorant of
their motive cause; and I was reluctant to be longer
ignorant. I foresaw a concomitance of relations
between this movement of the shoulder and the ex-
pression of the head.


## p. 432 (#468) ############################################

The shoulder, then, became, in its turn, the chief
object of my studies, and I gained therefrom clear
and indisputable principles.
In this way I managed to form the bases of my
discovery. The mothers whom I had seen bending
their heads over the children on whom they gazed,
thus revealed something unreserved and touching;
and in my ignorance the important part which the
shoulder played in the attitude had escaped me. It
was indeed from the action of the shoulder, even
more than from the inclination of the head, that this
expression of tenderness, so touching to behold,
proceeded.
The head, in such a case, accordingly receives its
greatest sum of expression from the shoulder. That
is a fact to be noted.
For instance, let a head—however loving we may
suppose it to be intrinsically—bend toward the ob-
ject of its contemplation, and let the shoulder not be
lifted, that head will plainly lack an air of vitality
and warm sincerity without which it cannot persuade
us. It will lack that irresistible character of inten-
sity which, in itself, supposes love; in brief, it will
be lacking in love.
“Then,” I said, “I have found in the shoulder the
agent, the centre of the manifestations of love.”
Yes, if in pressing a friend's hand I raise my
shoulders, I shall thereby eloquently demonstrate all
the affection with which he inspires me.
If in looking at a woman I clasp my hands and at

the same time raise my shoulders, there is no longer
any doubt as to the feeling that attaches me to her,
and instinctively every one will say: “He loves her
truly; ” but if, preserving the same attitude in the
same situation, the same facial expression, the same
movement of the head, I happen to withhold the ac-
tion of the shoulder, instantly all love will disappear
from my expression and nothing will be left to that
attitude but a sentiment vague and cold as false-
hood.
Once more, then, the inclinations of the head
whose law I have previously determined, seem to
owe to the shoulder alone the affectionate meaning
that they express; but the head—as I have said,
in its double inclination, characterizes two kinds of
love (or rather two sources of love) which are not
to be confounded: sensuality and tenderness.
What part, then, does the shoulder play in regard
to this distinction P. It will be curious to determine
this point. Let us see -
The part played by the shoulder is considerable
in tenderness; that is not to be doubted. But its
rôle seems to be less in sensuality. Thus the shoul-
der generally rises less when the head retroacts than
when it advances toward the object of its contem-
plation. Why is this? Is it because sensuality per-
tains less to love than tenderness? Has it not the
same title to rank as one of the aspects of love? In
a word, why is less demand made upon the shoulder
in one instance than in the other?
Ç 28


## p. 434 (#470) ############################################

434 DELSARTE'S OWN WORDS.
If I do not mistake, the reason is this: love gives
more than it lays claim to receive, while sensuality
asks continually and seeks merely the possession of
its object. Love understands and loves sacrifice;
it pervades the whole being; it inspires it to bestow
its entire self, and that gift admits of no reserve.
Sensuality, on the contrary, is essentially selfish;
far from giving itself, it pretends to appropriate and
absorb in itself the object of its desires. Sensu-
ality is, so to speak, but a distorted, narrow and
localized love; the body is the object of its con-
templation, and it [sensuality] sees nothing beyond
the possession of the object.
But love does not stop at the body—that would
be its tomb ; it crosses the limits of it, to rise to the
soul in which it is utterly absorbed. Thus love
transfigures the being by consuming its personality,
whence it comes that he who loves, no longer lives
his own life, but the life of the being whom he con-
templates.
Let the vulgar continually confound these two
things in their manifestations; let lovers themselves
fail to distinguish, accurately between tenderness
and sensuality; for me this confusion is henceforth
forbidden, and I can from the first glance boldly
separate them, thanks to the lessons taught me by
the inflections of the head.
But let us return to the shoulder. Am I not right
in Saying that in this agent I possess the organic
criterion of love? Yes, I maintain it. But let us

follow the action of this organ in its various mani-
festations. -
One thing at first amazed me, in view of the part
which I felt I must assign to the shoulder. Whence
comes, if the designation of that rôle be in confor-
mity with truth, whence comes the activity so ap-
parent, so vehement indeed, which the shoulder
displays in a movement of anger or of mere impa-
tience? Whence comes its perfect concomitance or
relations with moral or physical pain? Lastly,
whence comes that universal application which I
just now perceived clearly and which, until now, I
had confined to such narrow limits? But if the ele-
vation of the shoulder is not the criterion of love,
if, on the contrary, that movement is met with again
just as correctly associated with the most contradic-
tory impressions, what can it mean?
Here I was, once again, thrown far back from the
discovery that I was so sure I possessed.
It is very fortunate that I have been neither an
author nor a journalist, and I bless to-day that dis-
trust of self which has saved me from the mania of
writing. I highly congratulate myself on the spirit
of prudence that has invariably made me reply to
whoever pressed me to publish: “When I am old.”
Age has come, and it has found me even less dis-
posed to publicity than ever. This work owes its
existence solely to the earnest and continual solici-
tations, the sometimes severe demands of deep
friendship and devotion, which it was impossible for

me to refuse. This book is not, then, a spontaneous
enterprise on my part; it is the work of friendship.
And if this book has any measure of success, if it
accomplishes any good, it may be traced back to
and acknowledged as rising from the never-failing
encouragement of my old friend Brucker.
Let us return, now, to where I was in my re-
searches.
It remains, then, for me to specify the true mean-
ing of the shoulders in the expression of the pas-
sions. Their intervention in all forms of emotion
being proven to me, it would seem that the very
frequency of that intervention should exclude the
possibility of assigning any particular rôle to this
agent.
Fancy my perplexity, placed face to face with an
organ infinitely expressive, but whose physiognomy
is mingled promiscuously with every sentiment and
every passion
How, then, are we to characterize the shoulder?
What name shall we give to its dominant rôle? How
specify that Supreme power outside of which all ex-
pression ceases to exist? Is it allowable for me to
call it neutra/? And if the universal application of
that agent apparently authorizes that appellation up
to a certain point, whence comes its importance?
Whence the empire that it exerts over the aspect of
its congeners? Is it admissible for a neutral agent
to exert so much action upon the totality of the
forces to which it is allied P *

Assuredly not The word neutra/, moreover, ex-
cludes the idea of action, and even more strongly
that of predominant action which belongs surpass-
ingly to the shoulder. Truly, here was a treasure-
house for me. It was, as they say, “to give speech
to the dogs.”
This new difficulty only increased the determina-
tion with which I had pursued my researches; and
with the confidence arising from the fact that no
obstacle had yet conquered me, I said to myself
that the solution of this problem would be due to
my perSeverance. I could not, in view of the im–
portance of its expression, consider the shoulder as
a neutral agent. After spending a long time in vain
Study, I was on the point of giving up as insoluble
the problem that I had set myself. Let us see by
what simple means I obtained the solution. How
much trouble and pains one will sometimes give him-
self in looking for spectacles that are on his nose !
The shoulder, in every man' who is moved or agi-
tated, rises sensibly, his will playing no part in the
ascension; the successive developments of this in-
voluntary act are in absolute proportion to the pas-
Sional intensity whose numeric measure they form ;
the shoulder may, therefore, be fitly called the ther-

“Thermometer,” I cried, “there is an excellent
word, strikingly correct. But have I not, in pro-
nouncing it, simply and naturally characterized the
rôle that I am striving to define?

“Thermometer of the sensibility ! Is not that the
solution of the enigma P Thermometer; yes, that is
it! That is the very expression to give to my re-
searches, an expression without which nothing could
be explained. That, indeed, answers to everything,
and makes the difficulties against which my reason
struggled disappear.”
The shoulder is, in fact, precisely the thermome-
ter of passion as well as of sensibility; it is the
measure of their vehemence; it determines their
degree of heat and intensity. However, it does not
specify their nature, and it is certainly in an analo-
gous sense that the instrument known by the name
of thermometer marks the degrees of heat and cold
without specifying the nature of the weather — a
specification belonging to another instrument, the
complement of the thermometer — the barometer.
The parallel is absolute, perfect. t
Let us examine this point:
The shoulder, in rising, is not called upon to
teach us whether the source of the heat or vehemence
which mark it, arise from love or hate. This speci-
fication does not lie within its province; it belongs
entirely to the face, which is to the shoulder what
the barometer is to the thermometer. And it is
thus that the shoulder and the face enter into har-
monious relations to complete the passional sense
which they have to determine mutually and by dis-
tinct paths.
Now, the shoulder is limited, in its proper do-

main, to proving, first, that the emotion expressed
by the face is or is not true. Then, afterward, to
marking, with mathematical rigor, the degree of in-
tensity to which that emotion rises.
After having finished the formulation of this
principle I exultingly exclaimed:
“God be praised I now possess the semeiotics
of the shoulder, and thereby I hold the criterion of
the passional or sensitive powers — a criterion out-
side of which no truth can be demonstrated in the
sphere of sentiment or feeling.”
Thus, a word suggested by chance became my
Archimedean lever. The word, like a flash of light,
flooded my mind with radiance which suddenly re-
vealed to me the numerous and fertile applications
of a principle hitherto unknown. Yes, I henceforth
possessed an aesthetic principle of the utmost value,
the consequences of which, I could readily see,
were as novel as they were profound.


## p. 440 (#476) ############################################

EPISODE VI.
FIRST OBJECTION TO THE THERMOMETRIC SYSTEM
OF THE SHOULDER.
The innate aesthetic principle of the semeiotics of
the shoulder was at last clearly demonstrated to
me, and no more doubt or uncertainty upon that
point seemed to me possible. I might safely form-
ulate the following rule:
When a man says to you in interjective form : “I
love, I suffer, I am delighted,” etc., do not believe
him if his shoulder remains in a normal attitude.
Do not believe him, no matter what expression his
face may assume. Do not believe him — he lies;
his shoulder denies his words. That negative form
betrays his thoughts; and, if he expresses ardent
passion, you have merely to consult the thermome-
ter which, all unwittingly, he himself offers to your
inspection. See, it marks zero ! therefore he lies;
doubt it not, he lies but his shoulder does not lie.
He amiably puts it at your disposal — read, read at
your ease; it bears inscribed in living letters his
deceit and craft. It can never cheat you, and when
the gentleman accosts you with such words as:
“Dear friend how charmed I am to see you !”
say to yourself as you look at his thermometer:
“Traitor, your delight as well as your friendship is
below zero ! You try to deceive me, but in vain;

henceforth you have no secrets from me, clumsy
forger | You do not see, as with one hand you
proffer the false jewel which you would sell me,
that the other at the same instant gives me the
touch-stone which reveals your tricks; your right
hand thus incessantly exposing to me the Secrets
of your left hand l’’
What an admirable thing is this mechanism of the
body working in the service of the soul | With
what precision it reveals the least movements of its
master | What magnificent things it lays bare
Voluntarily or involuntarily, everything leads to
truth under the action of the translucid light which
breaks forth in the working of each of our organs !
And yet, well founded as the preceding theory
may be, solid as are the bases upon which it rests,
is it free from any and all objection? May not some
oppose to it, for instance, the impassibility of men
and women of the world, among whom it would be
difficult to find the movements of the shoulder,
which such people deem so ungraceful in others as
to deprive them of all desire to imitate them? Now
what conclusions are we to draw from the absence
of this movement in those who are known as aristo-
crats? Must we tax them all indiscriminately with
falsehood?
Here I might, and without hesitation, answer by
the affirmation, Yes, all aristocrats lie ' The me-
dium which they constitute and which is called the
world is nothing but a perpetual lie. Civility itself

rests upon a lie. Nay, more, it insists upon deceit
as a duty. Heavens, what would become of the
world if truth were a necessity | Quarter of an
hour of sincerity would be intolerable; . . . the
inhabitants would slay each other
In the world people display their feelings, even
the most avowable, with great reserve; this pru-
dence, which paralyzes the very springs of sensitive
life, seems as if it needs must neutralize the rôle
which I attribute to the shoulder; and yet, in spite
of contrary appearances, I deny that the thermo-
metric action of the shoulder undergoes the least .
alteration in the aristocratic world; I deny explicitly
that this agent proves less expressive and, above all,
less truthful there than in the street; and that for
the following reasons:
In the first place, we cannot reasonably suppose
very ardent passions in men who are enervated by
the perpetual influence of an artificial society. Now,
here the stationary condition of the thermometer is
explained: it proves absolutely nothing against the
truth of the reports; it remains at zero to mark a
colorless medium totally destitute of vitality. The
shoulder would violate its law if it were to rise un-
der such circumstances. It is, therefore, perfectly in
character here; it should be, a priori, impassive in
a negative society.
But is the shoulder really impassive in that me-
dium which we call society P
Yes, in the eyes of people who are not of it, and

EPISODE VI. 443
who, from that very fact, cannot understand the value
of certain expressions which are almost impercept-
ible; no, to those who constitute that special world
of relations called superior.
How many things, in fact, the shoulder reveals by
those slight changes unseen by ignorant persons, and
expressing particularly the delicate and exquisite
charm of spiritual relations ! It is the law of infini-
tesimal quantities, of those scarcely perceptible
movements or sensations that characterize the finer
relations of people of culture, of eloquence, of grace,
and of refined tastes.
It should be borne in mind, as I have already
shown, that the manifestations of the shoulder in the
street by no means accord with those of people ruled
by the fashions of society. There is very little har-
mony or relation between the exquisite joints of a
refined nature, the swift and flexible movements of
an elegant organism, and the evolutions clumsily ex-
ecuted by torpid limbs, ankylosed, as it were, by labor
at once hard and constant.
This observation logically led me to an important
conclusion, namely, that the value or importance of
a standard is deduced expressly from the nature of
the being, or the object to which it is applied. Of
what value, for instance, could a millimeter be when
added to the stature of a man? That same milli-
meter, however, would acquire a colossal value when
added to the proportions of a flea. It would form
a striking monstrosity.


## p. 444 (#480) ############################################

444 DELSARTE'S OWN WORDS.
An imperceptible fraction may, in certain cases,
constitute an enormity. Again, the value of a stand-
ard, not the specific or numerical value which is an
invariable basis, but the relative or moral value, must
be deduced from the importance of the medium to
which it applies. For instance: Five hundred men
constitute a very good army in the midst of a peace-
ful population; and this handful of Soldiers exerts,
indeed, more moral power than the multitudes re-
strained under their government. A smile coming
from the lips of a sovereign leaves in the soul that
it penetrates a far deeper trace than all the demon-
strations of a common or vulgar crowd. The trav-
eler, detained by the winter in the polar regions,
finds that he is warm and takes pleasure in the dis-
covery, though at the time the thermometer marks
Io degrees below zero.
The atmosphere of a cave that we find warm in
winter seems to us, without being modified in the
least, of an icy coldness in summer. -
The large quantity of alcohol that laboring people
consume would ruin the health of less strongly con-
stituted persons.
To conclude, then, these examples prove beyond
dispute that one can only appreciate the importance
of an act when he takes into account the nature of
its agents, and that without these considerations he
will be obliged to give up immediately all serious
estimation of these manifestations.
Here I touch, it seems to me, a law of harmony,

a curious law that I wish to examine incidentally. I
shall, then, occupy myself with the objections that
may, perhaps, be opposed even yet to the thermo-
metric system of the shoulder.


## p. 446 (#482) ############################################

EPISODE VII.
The foregoing study has, as it seems, established
an important fact, namely, that among the various
classes of men which make up society there is no
common standard of measure. It, therefore, appears
impossible, at first sight, to establish a harmonious
scale of relations between so many various circles.
However, if these circles, whatever their differ-
ences may be, were specified and sufficiently known;
if I could, for example, judge a priori of the style
and mode of activity adapted to each class of soci-
ety; in a word, if it were possible for me to char-
acterize each of its classes dynamically, should I not
succeed in ascertaining a proportionate gamut or
scale among them, and thereby should I not be en-
abled securely to apply the principles established
above P
Let us say, to begin with, that if each social sphere
affects a determinate character in the intensity of its
passional evolutions, it has, in consequence, its spe-
cial gamut; then, as many spheres as there are, so
many gamuts must there be. Now, all these gamuts
taken together must form a scale of proportion in
virtue of which they may be characterized. That is
obvious. But the difficulty is to prove the mode or
first tonality of these gamuts. How are we to set to
work?

WHAT I PROPOSE.
I propose a great, a worthy subject for your study.
At those oratorical sessions which are rapidly in-
creasing under the name of conferences, sessions at
which so many distinguished men take the floor, you
have been told in elegant terms, often in eloquent
terms, of the sciences, of their application and of
their progress. You have listened to discourses
upon art, its primitive purity, its supposed princi-
ples, its decadence, its renaissance, its multifarious
changes; its masterpieces have been pointed out to
you ; they have been described to you; you have,
in some degree, been made familiar with their origin.
You have heard the story of the lives of the great
artists. They have been shown to you in their
weakness and in their strength. The times and
manners amid which they lived have been painted
for you in more or less imaginary colors. I propose
something better than all this.
I offer you a work superior even to those sciences
which have been described to you ; superior to all
which the genius of a Michael Angelo or a Raphael
could conceive; a work in comparison with which
all the magnificences of science and of art must
pale. I propose that you should contemplate your-
selves |
Nothing is so unfamiliar to man as himself. I
will, therefore, as I have promised, show you the


## p. 449 (#485) ############################################

WHAT I PROPOSE. 449
marvels which God himself has placed within you,
in the transluminous obscurities of your being.
Now, if there be more Science, more genius in the
production of a violet or a worm than is revealed by
all the combined powers of Science and of art, how
much admiration should we not feel at the sight of
all the splendors which God has spread broadcast in
the privileged work wherein He was pleased to reveal
his own image ' But a light inaccessible to the vain
demonstrations of your sciences constantly removes
this mysterious image from your gaze. As light
eludes the eye which it illumines, if we would seize
and contemplate it, we must have two things: we
must have a special and a supernatural object.
There must be light within you, and it must pierce
the depths wherein that image dwells.
Here there is no question of the light which
shines to show us the things of the natural world by
which we are surrounded. Nor is it a question of
the intellectual light sometimes visible to scholars.
I speak of that light which is hidden from those
very scholars because their eyes could not bear its
lustre, a transluminous light which fills the soul
with beatific visions, and of which it is said that God
wraps it about Him as a mantle.
Now, three worlds, of the nature of which man
partakes, are offered for our contemplation. These
three worlds are: The natural, the intellectual, and
the supernatura/.
Three sorts of vision have been given man to in-

itiate him into these three worlds. These different
forms of vision are: Direct, inward and higher.
By means of direct vision man is made acquainted
with the world of nature; by inward vision he is
shown the world of science; and, lastly, by higher
vision he sees the world of grace. But as there can
be no vision where no light penetrates, it follows
that between the three kinds of vision described and
the corresponding worlds there must intervene three
sorts of light, in order to produce the triple vision
necessary for the knowledge of man:
Direct vision — sidereal light — natural world.
Inward vision—the light of tradition—the world of
Science.
Higher vision — revealed light—supernatural world.
Such are the conditions necessary for the under-
standing of my demonstrations.
Having prepared your eye for the vision of these
three worlds which serve as the bases of art, I shall,
then, reveal to you their splendors; happy if, thus,
I can help to make you bless the author of so many
marvels, and communicate to you those keen joys
which perpetuate in the soul a fountain of youth
which can never be quenched by the infirmities of
the body. -

THE BEAUTIFUL.
Beauty is that reason itself which presides at the
creation of things. It is the invincible power which
- attracts and subjugates us in it. The Beautiful
admits of three characters, which we distinguish
under the titles of ideal beauty, moral beauty, plastic
beauty. - -
Plato defined ideal beauty when he said: “Beauty
is the splendor of truth.” St. Augustine said of
moral beauty that it is the splendor of goodness.
I define plastic beauty as the plastic manifestation
of truth and goodness.
In So far as it responds to the particular type in
accordance with which it is formed, every creature
bears the crown of beauty; because in its corre-
spondence with its type it manifests, according to its
capacity, the Divine Being who created it.
The Beautiful is an absolute principle; it is the
essence of beings, the life of their functions.
Beauty is a consequence, an effect, a form of the
Beautiful. It results from the attractions of the
form. The attraction of the form comes from the
nobility of the function. This is why all functions
not being equally noble, all do not admit of beauty.
The characteristic of beauty is to be amiable; con-
sequently a thing is ugly only in view of the amiable
things which we seek in beauty.


## p. 452 (#488) ############################################

452 DELSARTE'S OWN WORDS.
Beauty is to the Beautiful what the individual
reason is to the Divine reason of things. Human
reason is but one ray of a vast orb called the reason
of things, LDivine reason. Let us say of beauty
what we have said of the individual reason, and we
shall understand how the Beautiful is to be distin-
tinguished from it. Beauty is one ray of the
Beautiful.
Beauty is the expression of the, object for which
the thing is.
It is the stamp of its functions. It is the trans-
parency of the aptitudes of the agent and the radi-
ance of the faculties which it governs. It is the
order which results from the dynamic disposition of
forms operated in view of the function.
Beauty is based on three conditions: Clearness,
integrity and due proportion.
Beauty exists in the practical knowledge of the
tendencies affected by the form in view of the object
for which it is ; in view, above all, of the action
which it exerts upon the beings with whom it is in
relation. Thus a thing is not only beautiful from
the transparency of its aptitudes, it is especially so
from the beauty of the acts which its use determines
abroad. This is the reason why beauty is to all
creatures an object of appetency, of desire and of
love.

TRINITY.
There is a mystery full of deep instruction, a myS-
tery whose divine obscurities surpass all the light
whose splendors dazzle us by their supernatural
clarity, and which, as a great Saint once said, radi-
ates splendid beams and floods with the glory of its
fires those spirits who are blind with the blindness
of holiness. This mystery, outside of which all is to
man dark and incomprehensible, illuminates every-
thing and explains it in the sense that it is the cause,
the principle and the end of all things.
This dazzling mystery is the universal criterion
of all truth; it is the science of sciences, which is
self-defining and whose name is Trinity.
Here we foresee an objection to which we must
first reply. Some will be surprised that a system
declared to be infallible should rest upon a mystery;
they will ask what a mystery can have to do with a
purely didactic question. Patience 1 You shall see
that it cannot be otherwise. Nothing is more evi-
dent than light, yet light is a mystery, the most ob-
scure of all mysteries. Thus light escapes the eye
and it does not see that by means of which it sees.
Now, if light is a mystery, why should not mystery
be a light? Let us see first what the church teaches
us in regard to this mystery.
God is a word which serves as a pretext for every
Utopia, for every illusion and for every human folly.

The Trinity is the express refutation of all these
stupidities; it is their remedy, corrective and preserv-
ative. Deprive me of the Trinity and I can no
longer understand aught of God. All becomes dark
and obscure to me, and I have no longer a rational
motive for hope.
The Trinity, the hypostatical basis of beings and
things, is the reflection of the Divine Majesty in its
work. It is, as it were, a reflection upon us of its
own light. The Trinity is our guide in the applied
Sciences of which it is at once the solution and the
enigma.
The Trinity is manifest in the smallest divisions
of the Divine work, and is to be regarded as the
most fertile means of scientific investigation; for if
it is at once the cause, the principle and the end of
all science, it is its infallible criterion and we must

PASSION OF SIGNS. SIGNS OF PASSION.
These two terms at first sight seem very similar.
It is not so. They express two wholly distinct
things. Therefore to know the meaning of words
by no means proves one capable of finding words
and fitting them to the meaning.
It is clearly easier to translate a language than to
write it, and just as we must learn to translate before
we can compose, so we must become thoroughly
familiar with semeiotics before trying to work at
aesthetics; and, as the science of semeiotics is still
wholly incomplete, it is, therefore, absolutely im-
possible that that which is called aesthetics should in
the least resemble the science which I have just
defined.
I have shown you aesthetics as a science. I have
given you its definition. I have fixed its special
part in the sum total of knowledge which goes to
make up art; moreover, I have pointed out what
this science is intended to teach you. I have, by So
doing, assumed serious obligations toward you. I
must needs produce under this title something more
than mere fantastic reflections upon works of art, or
more or less attractive stories about their authors and
the circumstances in which they lived. It will not be
so amusing, but assuredly it will be more profitable,

which aesthetics must-study inherent fitness.
AEsthetics is the science of the sensitive and pas-
sional manifestations which are the object of art,

If semeiotics does not tell us the passion which
the sign reveals, how can aesthetics indicate to us
the sign which it should apply to the passion that it
studies? In a word, how shall the artist translate
the passion which he is called upon to express?
AEsthetics determines the inherent forms of sen-
timent in view of the effects whose truth of relation
it estimates. -

It is thus that wisdom and reason proceed in
inverse sense from the principle to the knowledge
which is the object of both. Wisdom, in fact,
studies the principle in its consequences, while
reason studies the consequences in the principle,
hence it comes that wisdom and reason are often at
war with each other; hence also the obscurity which
generally prevails as to the distinction between them.
Let us say that wisdom and reason are to intelligence
what aesthetics and Semeiotics are to art. Let us
add to this parallel that zwisdom and reason are to
intelligence what aesthetics and semeiotics are to
ontology; that is:—
I, If, from a certain organic form, I infer a cer-
tain sentiment, that is Semeiotics.
2. If, from a certain sentiment, I deduce a certain

form whose inherent fitness I am supposed to know,
I take possession of that arrangement under the

by substituting my individual will for its’ inherent

DEFINITION OF FORM.
Form is the garb of substance. It is the expres-
sive symbol of a mysterious truth. It is the trade-
mark of a hidden virtue. It is the actuality of the
being. In a word, form is the plastic art of the Ideal.
We have to consider three sorts of form : The
form assumed by the being at birth and which we
will call constitutional form. Under the sway of
custom forms undergo modifications: We will call
these forms habitual forms. Then there are the
fugitive forms, modifications of the constitutional
form, which are produced under the sway of pas-
sion. These forms, which we will call accidental,
passional or transitory, are fugitive as the things
which give them birth.

ON DISTINCTION AND VULGARITY OF
MOTION.
Motion generally has its reaction; a projected
body rebounds and it is this rebound which we call
the reaction of the motion.
Rebounding bodies are agreeable to the eye.
Lack of elasticity in a body is disagreeable from the
fact that lacking suppleness, it seems as if it must,
in falling, be broken, flattened or injured; in a word,
must lose something of the integrality of its form.
It is, therefore, the reaction of a body which proves
its elasticity, and which, by this very quality, gives
us a sort of pleasure in witnessing a fall, which apart
from this reaction could not be other than disagree-
able. Therefore, elasticity of dynamic motions is a
prime necessity from the point of view of charm.
In the vulgar man there is no reaction. In the
man of distinction, on the contrary, motion is of
slight extent and reaction is enormous. Reāction is
both slow and rapid.

GESTURE.
The artist should have three objects: To move, to
2nterest, to persuade. He interests by language, he
moves by thought, he moves, interests and per-
suades by gesture.
Language is the weakest of the three agents. In
a matter of the feelings language proves nothing.
It has no real value, save that which is given to it
by the preparation of gesture.
Gesture corresponds to the soul, to the heart;
language to the life, to the thought, to the mind.
The life and the mind being subordinate to the heart,
to the soul, gesture is the chief organic agent. So
it has its appropriate character which is persuasion,
and it borrows from the other two agents interest
and emotion. It prepares the way, in fact, for lan-
guage and thought; it goes before them and fore-
tells their coming; it accentuates them.
By its silent eloquence it predisposes, it guides the
listener. It makes him a witness to the secret labor
performed by the immanences which are about to
burst forth. It flatters him by leading him to feel
that he partakes in this preparation by the initiation
to which it admits him. It condenses into a single
word the powers of the three agents. It represents
virtue effective and operative. It assimilates the
auxiliaries which surround it, and reflects the imma-

nence proper to its nature, the contemplation of its
subject deeply seen, deeply felt. It possesses them
synthetically, fully, absolutely.
Artistic gesture is the expression of the physiog-
nomy; it is transluminous action; it is the mirror
of lasting things.
Lacordaire, that spoiled child of the intellect,
spoke magnificently. He interested, he aroused
admiration, but he did not persuade. His organism
was rebellious to gesture. He was the artist of
language. Ravignan, inferior intellectually, pre-
pared his audience by his attitude, touched them by
the general expression of his face, fascinated them
by his gaze. He was the artist of gesture.
Thus, if we sing, let us not forget that the pre-
lude, the refrain, is the spiritual expression of the
song; that we must take advantage of this exordium
to guide ourselves, to predispose our hearers in our
favor; that we must point out to them, must make
them foresee by the expression of our face the
thought and the words which are to follow; that, in
fact, the ravished spectator may be dazzled by a
song which he has not yet heard, but which he
divines or thinks that he divines.
Definition of Gesture. (Compare Delaumosne,
page 43.)
Gesture is the direct agent of the heart. It is the
fit manifestation of feeling. It is the revealer of
thought and the commentator upon speech. It is


## p. 467 (#503) ############################################

GESTURE. 467
the elliptical expression of language; it is the justi-
fication of the additional meanings of speech. In
a word, it is the spirit of which speech is merely the
letter. Gesture is parallel to the impression re-
ceived ; it is, therefore, always anterior to speech,
which is but a reflected and subordinate expression.
Gesture is founded on three bases which give rise
to three orders of studies; that is, to three sciences,
namely: The static, the dynamic and the semeiotic.
What are these three sciences, and, first of all,
what are they in relation to gesture? The semei-
otic is its mind; the dynamic is its soul; the static
is founded on the mutual equilibrium or equipoise
of the agents.
The dynamic presents the multiple action of three
agents; that is to say, of the constituent forces of
the soul.
The semeiotic presents to our scrutiny a triple
object for study. It sets forth the cause of the acts
produced by the dynamic and the static harmonies.
Moreover, it reveals the meaning of the types which
form the object of the system. It offers us a knowl-
edge of the formal or constitutional types, of the
fugitive or accidental types, and, finally, of the
habitual types. \
The triple object of the dynamic are the rhythmic,
inflective and harmonic forms. Dynamic rhythm is
foundéd upon the important law of mobility, in-
versely proportionate to the masses moved. Dy-
namic inflections are produced by three movements:


## p. 468 (#504) ############################################

468 DELSARTE'S OWN WORDS.
Direct movements, rotary movements and move-
ments of flexion in the arc of a circle.
Dynamic harmony is founded on the concomi-
tance of the relations existing between all the agents
of gesture. This harmony is regulated by three
states, namely: The tonic or eccentric state, the
atonic or concentric state, and the normal state. It,
therefore, remains for us to fix the three vital con-
ditions of the static part of gesture. The vital con-
dition of the static is based upon the knowledge of
the nine stations. The spirit of the static entails the
study of scenic planes which embrace three condi-
tions: The condition of the personage in relation to
the scenic centre or to the interlocutor whom he
addresses; in the second place, his situation ; and,
finally, the direction assumed by his body in regard
to the conditions already indicated.
The soul of the static is in the harmonic opposi-
tion of the surfaces moved.
The most powerful of all gestures is that which
affects the spectator without his knowing it.
From this statement may be deduced the prin-
ciple that: Outward gesture, being only the echo
of the inward gesture which gave birth to it and
rules it, should be inferior to it in development and
should be in Some sort diaphanous.

ATTITUDES OF THE HEAD.
The head, considered in its three direct poses,
presents three conditions or states. When facing
the object contemplated, it presents the normal
state; bent forward and in the direction of the
object, it presents the concentric state; raised and
considering the object from above, it presents the
eccentric state. [Compare Delaumosne, page 65.]
If, now, we consider each of its attitudes in con-
nection with a double lateral inclination of which
they are capable, we have the following nine:
I. The first is normal. The head is neither high
nor low, the glance being direct.
2. The second is characteristic of tenderness.
This attitude consists in bending the head obliquely
toward the interlocutor. The body, in this attitude,
should not face the object; thus the head, in bending
toward it, bends sidewise in relation to the body.
3. The third attitude is characteristic of sensu-
ality. This attitude is marked by an inclination
quite the reverse of the second; that is to say,
away from the interlocutor. Naturally, in this atti-
tude, as in the preceding one, the glance is oblique;
the head being bent forward and backward, is here
placed obliquely.
4. The fourth is characteristic of scrutiny, reflec-
tion. The head in this attitude is bent forward as

we said in concentration, and the eye, from the
effort to lower the head, is thrown up to inspect the
object.
5. The fifth is characteristic of veneration. This
attitude offers the same inclination as the second ;
but here, as the head must be lowered, the eye is
directed both obliquely and upward.
6. The sixth is characteristic of suspicion. This
attitude offers the same inclination as the third, with
the concentric modifications indicated for the pre-
ceding One.
7. The seventh is characteristic of exaltation,
passion. This attitude is eccentric and direct, as
we have already said.
8. The eighth attitude is characteristic of aban-
donment, extreme confidence. This attitude pre-
sents the inclination of the second and the fifth, with
this difference, that here the head is thrown back
and the eye, instead of being bent directly upon
the object as in the second and upward as in the
fifth, here gazes downward.
9. The ninth attitude is characteristic of pride.
This last attitude takes the inclination of the sixth
and eighth attitudes, with the differences in gaze
indicated in the foregoing.
Thus, to sum up what we have already said, we
see that the first, fourth and seventh attitudes are
directly toward the object; that the second, fifth and
eighth bend obliquely toward the object; and, finally,


## p. 471 (#507) ############################################

ATTITUDES OF THE HEAD. 47 I
that the third, sixth and ninth are the result of an
oblique inclination away from the object.
NOTE.-It is to be understood that the various
attitudes of the head are asserted only in regard to
the direction taken by the eye. Thus it is not abso-
lutely true to say that the head is in the eccentric
state because it is raised; for it may be that, raised
as it is, the direction of the eye may be even higher
than it, and, in that case, the head might, although
raised, present the aspect of the concentric state.
Then it would be true to say that the head presents
the concentric state in a high direction.

ATTITUDES OF THE HANDS.
The hands, like the legs, have three kinds of atti-
tudes. They open without effort and present the
normal state; they close and present the concentric
state; then they open forcibly and present the ec-
centric state. These three kinds of attitudes produce
nine forms.
I. The first is characteristic of acceptance. In
this the hand is presented open without effort, the
fingers close together and the palm up.
2. The second is characteristic of caressing. In
this attitude the palm of the hand faces the object
considered and gently follows its forms.
3. The third is characteristic of negation. This
attitude is executed in the following fashion: The
arm and hand are placed as in caressing; but, in-
stead of following the form of the object, the hand
rids itself of it by a rotary movement, thus placing
the palm in a lateral direction.
4. This attitude is executed with the closed fist,
the arm hanging naturally, that is, without any ac-
tion determined by the will.
5. The fifth is characteristic of will. This attitude
consists in carrying the fist forward, the back up.
6. The sixth attitude is characteristic of menace.
This attitude is effected by an outward rotary move-
ment compressed in the fist, so that, contrary to the
will, the back of the hand is down.


## p. 473 (#509) ############################################

ATTITUDES OF THE HANDS. 473
7. The seventh is characteristic of desire. The
hand, in this attitude, moves forward as in the first,
but with the difference that here the fingers are
spread apart, this spreading signifying “I do not
possess,” expresses desire. There is, by the fact of
the advance of the hand, aspiration and not pos-
Session.
8. The eighth is characteristic of imprecation. It
consists in stretching the palm of the hand toward
the object as in a caress, but with this difference,
that the fingers are spread apart, thus offering a re-
pulsive aspect.
9. The ninth is characteristic of refusal, repulsion.
It consists in carrying the hand obliquely as in ne-
gation, observing the spreading of the fingers which
characterizes this species.
Affirmation—The Hand.
To make the demonstration of the different affir-
mations of the hand more clear, we employ the cube
which, as is well known, has six faces, eight angles,
and twelve edges.
When the hand is placed upon a flat surface the
affirmation is simple; when the hand is placed upon
an angle the affirmation is triple or common to three
faces or surfaces. There are three directions in the
cube: Horizontal, vertical and transverse. So, too,
there are three directions possible for the hand in
relation to the body:

These nine physiognomies of the hand modify
those of the face, often supply their place and some-
times even contradict them. When they are appro-
priate to the hand and face alike, there is homoge-
neity. The expression of the hands results from the
coöperation of three orders of phenomena. The
first order comprises the intrinsic physiognomies as-
sumed by the hand under the influence of the pas-
sions. The second order comprises the attitudes
assumed by the hand toward the object of the pas-
sion. The third order comprises the evolutions
impressed upon the hand by the body, fore-arm and
shoulder. These evolutions are so many inflections.
We know the nine attitudes appropriate to the
hand, and the nine attitudes designated by the nine
modes of presentation of the hand in regard to the
cubic surfaces. We must examine the nine inflec-
tions which arise in the first instance from the three
directions, antero-posterior, vertical and transverse.
These inflections again include three movements
of three kinds: Direct movements, circular move-

ments and oblique movements. These movements
are produced by three sorts of action: Sectional
action, rotary action and translative action.
To recapitulate: These physiognomies, attitudes
and inflections form by their combination the multi-
farious expressions of which the hand is capable, as
are all parts of the body. *
Having spoken of the affirmations of the hand, we
must speak of its degree of certainty of which the
arm is the thermometer. This affirmation varies
with the angle formed by the fore-arm with the arm.
All these modes of affirmation may be applied to
negation.

ATTITUDES OF THE LEGS.
I. The first attitude is normal; it consists of an
equal balance of the weight of the body on the two
legs. This attitude is that of the soldier carrying
arms, without the stiffness assumed by the wilful
regularity of rigid discipline. It is also that attitude
taken by a man in the act of salutation ; it is also
characteristic of the weakness of a child or of old
age; it is the sign of respect. [Compare Delau-
mosne, p. IOO.]
2. The second attitude is characteristic of repose
in strength. The weight of the body is thrown
upon one hip, the free leg being carried forward.
This change should be effected without tension or
stiffness. This attitude is also characteristic of cer-
tain concentric passions hidden under seeming calm.
3. This attitude is characteristic of vehemence,
of which it is the type. It is prečminently the ec-
centric attitude. It consists in carrying the whole
weight of the body forward, the backward leg ex-
tended in equal proportion to the forward poise of
the torso.
4. This attitude is characteristic of the weakness
which follows vehemence. It is the type of concen-
tration; it is also in character as in species the antip-
odes of the third attitude, since it is its resolute
expression. This attitude consists in throwing the

whole weight of the body backward, contrary to the
preceding attitude where the body was brought
forward, and in bending the leg which bears the
weight of the body, which is also the reverse of the
preceding attitude, where the leg is extended. This
attitude is nearly that of the fencing-master; it dif-
fers, however, in the position of the backward foot,
which, in fencing, is turned outward. The regularity
of this attitude may be verified by kneeling, which
is its paroxysm. If the attitude is well done it leads
to it naturally.
5. The fifth attitude serves as a preparation for
oblique steps; it is also colorless, transitive, suspen-
sive. It ends all the angles formed by walking.
We may define this attitude as a third transversal;
that is to say, the free leg, instead of being behind
as in the third, is impassive, so that the body, instead
of being advanced, should be slightly inclined to one
side.
6. The sixth attitude is an attitude of pomp and
ceremony. It is only assumed in the presence of
kings, princes, or persons for whom we have great
respect. We will define this attitude as a third
crossed proceeding from the fifth ; that is to say,
the free leg of the fifth becomes the strong leg
moving sidewise and slightly forward, thus crossing
the back leg.
7. The seventh attitude is an attitude character-
istic of absolute repose. It is the strongest attitude,
and, consequently, that assumed by intoxication to

ATTITUDES OF THE LEGS. 479
resist a lack of equilibrium. It is the attitude of
vertigo, or of extreme trust.
Do not be surprised by the bringing together of
these very different and opposite terms in one and
the same attitude. It is a sufficient explanation to
say that the strong attitude is sought out by weak-
ness as a weak attitude is sought by strength. This
attitude consists in the division of the weight of the
body between both legs, which are spread wide apart
in parallel directions. This attitude would be im-
proper in a parlor.
8. The eighth attitude is an attitude characteristic
of the alternation between the Offender and defender.
It is the exact medium between the third and
fourth ; it, therefore, expresses moral as well as
physical alternation. A man placed between the
offensive and the defensive always assumes this atti-
tude as if to sound the resources of his courage in
face of an enemy stronger than himself; in this atti-
tude he may advance or recede. This attitude is a
seventh, whose direction, instead of being lateral, is
parallel to the body and antero-posterior. In this
position the body faces the forward leg, both legs
being spread wide apart, as in the Seventh, both re-
ceive an equal portion of the weight of the body.
9. The ninth attitude is characteristic of defiance.
This attitude is a stiff second. It differs only in
that the free leg is rigid instead of being bent as in
the second. To execute this attitude thoroughly
well the free leg must be stretched to the very ut-

most, without allowing the strong leg to bend as in
the fourth, which is the only attitude where the
strong leg should be bent. To prevent this flexion,
the body must be carried well over on the hip of the
strong leg, so that the side of the free leg may be
elongated.

THE HOLY TRINITY RECOVERED IN
SOUND.
Sound is the reflection of the Divine image. In
sound there are three reflex images: The reflex of
life; of the intellect; and of love. They result
from the parallel and simultaneous action of three
agents: The projective (life), reflective (intellect),
and vibrative (love).
Sound contains three sounds: That of the tonic,
the dominant, and the mediant. The tonic (Father)
necessarily generates the dominant (Son), and the
mediant (Holy Ghost) proceeds necessarily from
the first two.
Pythagoras discovered this law. Passing before
a blacksmith's shop, he heard the sound of heavy
hammer strokes upon a forge. He recognized per-
fectly that each blow gave out beside the principal
tone (tonic) two other tones, which corresponded to
the twelfth and seventeenth of the tonic. Now, the
twelfth reversed is nothing but the fifth or dominant,
and the seventeenth becomes, by a double reversion,
the third or mediant of the tonic.
Let us say, then, that every tone necessarily con-
tains the tonic its generator, the dominant its engen-
dered, and the mediant which proceeds from the
Other two. The reiinion of these three tones which
makes them into one, forms the perfect chord.


## p. 485 (#521) ############################################

THE HOLY TRINITY RECOVERED IN SOUND. 485
Full and absolute consonance is the expression of
union, of love, of order, of harmony, of peace; it
is the return to the source of goodness, to God.
If a fourth form should be added to the perfect
chord, to consonance, there would necessarily be a
dissonance. This fourth can only enter by an effort,
almost by violence. It is outside of plenitude, of
the calm established by the Divine law; it produces
a painful sensation, a dissonance. As soon as there
is a discord, a dissonance, the animal cries out, the
dog howls, inert bodies suffer and vibrate; but all
is order and calm again when consonance returns.


## p. 486 (#522) ############################################

SPEECH.
Speech is an act posterior to will, itself posterior
to love; this again posterior to judgment, posterior
in its turn to memory, which, finally, is posterior to
the impression.
Every impression, to become a sensation, must
first be perceived by the intelligence, and thus we
may say of the sensation that it is a definite impres-
sion. But, to be definite, it must pass into the do-
main of memory and there solicit the reappearance
of its congeners with which it may, identify itself.
It is in this apparatus and surrounded by this throng
of homogeneous impressions which gather round it,
as if by magic, or rather which it draws about it as
the magnet draws the iron, it is, I say, in this com-
plex state that it appears before the intelligence to
receive from the latter a fitting name. For the in-
telligence could not give it a name if the homoge-
neous impressions in which it has, so to speak,
arrayed itself, did not serve to point it out.
Now, by this distinction, established by the double
operation of the memory and the intelligence, a
movement takes place in the soul, of attraction, if
the intelligence approve; or of repulsion, if it dis-
approve. This movement is called the will. The
will, therefore, becomes the active principle in virtue
of which speech is expressed; thus speech is the

express agent of the will. It is speech, in fact,
which, under the incubation of this mysterious
power, rules, groups and moves bodies with the aid
of memory.
• Inflection is the life of speech; the mind lies in
the articulative values, in the distribution of these
articulations and their progressions. The Soul of
speech is in gesture.

BREATHING.
Breathing, according to its form of production, is:
(1) Costal or combined; (2) diaphragmatic; (3)
costo-diaphragmatic. *
Breathing is a triple act based upon three phe-
11O II). CIla . Inspiration, suspension, expiration. From
the successive predominance of each of these three
phenomena, or from their equal balance, result
eighty-one respiratory acts, which may be reduced
to three terms: The breathing is normal, spasmodic,
or sibilant.
There are three questions to be considered in
regard to breathing:
I. How should it, the breath, be produced to gain
the greatest development for the voice?
2. What place should it occupy in speech?
3. What aspect does it assume under the influ-
ence of the passions?
In other words, three characters may be attributed
to respiration: Vocal, logical, pathetic or passional.
Vocal Respiration.
The lungs constantly contain a quantity of air,
which is the source of life and with which we can-
not dispense without inconvenience to health and to
the voice. The quantity of air requisite for the
renewing of the blood, and which is called the
breath of life, amounts to a third of what the

BREATHING. 489
*-
lungs are capable of receiving. In order to sing,
therefore, it must be increased by two-thirds, and it
is this borrowed breath only which should be given
out in singing. When the lungs are thus filled with
air, the sound is produced by escapement. From
this it receives greater force, and its production, far
from being a fatigue, becomes a relief.
Inspiration should always be followed by a sus-
pensive silence; otherwise the lungs, agitated by
the act of inspiration, perform the expiration badly.
Logical Respiration.
Logical respiration constitutes the respiration
itself. Suspension expresses reticence, disquietude.
Inspiration is an element of dissimulation, concen-
tration, pain. Hence, we have normal, oppressive,
spasmodic, superior, sibilant, rattling, intermittent,
crackling, and hiccoughing respiration.
Expiration is an element of trust, expansion, con-
fidence and tenderness. If the expression contains
both pain and love, the inspiration and expiration
will both be noisy; but the one or the other will
predominate according as pain predominates OVer
love, or vice versa.
Passional Respiration.
The source of passional respiration lies in the
agitation of the heart. The effect of respiration is
most powerful, for the slighter and more impercep-
tible the phenomena are, the more effect they have
upon the auditors.


## p. 490 (#526) ############################################

VOCAL ORGAN.
The organ assumes at birth a form; this form is
called the timbre or tone. This tone corresponds
to the constitutional form. Under the Sway of
habit, the form assumes an acquired tone which is
called emission. The emissive form corresponds to
the habitual tone. Under the sway of emotion the
voice is modulated and assumes forms which we will
call passional or transitory.
The mouth is normal, concentric and eccentric.
[See chart in Delaumosne, page 81.]
From these three types we have succeeded in fix-
ing and classifying forty-eight million phenomena.


## p. 491 (#527) ############################################

DEFINITION OF THE VOICE.
The voice is the essential element in singing. It
is based upon Sound. This is based upon three
agents: -
The projective agent, or the lungs.
The vibrative agent, or the laruya.
The reverberative agent, or the mouth.
Each of these agents acts in different ways, nine
acts resulting therefrom, which we will call products
of phonetic acts.
The projective agent in its special activities en-

The vibrative agent in its special activities en-

Prolations,

Emissions,
Articulations,

of view, these products become as many elements
and must be examined from the triple point of view
of preparatory, practical and transcendant studies.
We must, therefore, know first the general definition
of these elements, their cause and their theoretical
history, which constitutes phonology or the pre-
paratory study of the voice.
Secondly, we must know the physical order in
virtue of which these phenomena may be acquired
or developed. The various special exercises and
the vices to be avoided constitute phonation or the
practical study of the voice.
Thirdly, we must know and appreciate the physi-
ological, intellectual and moral meaning of these
elements, the different relations of resemblance, of
opposition and of identity which exist between these
different phenomena. 1
The modes of application or principles of style
form the transcendent study or aesthesiophony, that
is, the voice applied to feeling, etc.
What the Register is.
* The register is an intrinsic modification of the
sound; a modification which is produced in the
larynx itself and which does not belong to the
mouth. Now, we may say of registers that they are
to the larnyx what emissions are to the mouth.
Thus registers form a physiognomy which the sound
assumes in the larynx, and emissions form the phys-

iognomy which that same sound takes on in the
mouth.
On Shading.
Light and shade are not, as has been asserted,
subject to the arbitration or inspiration of the mo-
ment. They are ruled by laws; for in art there is
not a single phenomenon which is not subject to ab-
solute mathematical laws. A knowledge of these
laws is important, the art of shading forming the
basis of style.
The opinion which makes the ascending phrase
progressive is false six times out of seven. It is
only correct in the following cases:
I. If an ascending phrase encounters no repeated
and no dissonant note it is progressive, and the cul-
minating note is the most intense. It has one de-
gree of intensity. *
2. If we find a note repeated in the ascending
phrase, that note, even if it be the lowest of all,
must be made more important than the highest note
and will have two degrees of intensity. In this
case, the higher the voice rises the softer it must
become; for there cannot be more than one culmi-
nating point in a musical phrase any more than in a
logical or mimetic phrase. All sounds must, there-
fore, diminish in proportion to their distance from
this centre of expression, from this repeated note.
The reason of the intensity of a repeated note lies
in the fact that we repeat only that thing which we
desire, and this intensity gives it a greater value.

3. If the repeated note be at the same time the
culminating note, it will require a new degree of in-
tensity. It will have three degrees of intensity.
4. We may possibly find a dissonant note in the
ascending phrase, with a repeated culminating note.
(This note would, then, be more than an indication;
it would receive an adjective form from the accident,
assuming in the musical phrase the value that an
adjective would have in a logical phrase.) Its in-
tensity, therefore, would be greater than that of the
highest repeated note, and it would have four degrees
of intensity. &
5. If the dissonant note is also the highest note,
it acquires from that position a fifth degree of in-
tensity. -
6. It may happen that the dissonant note appear-
ing in a rising phrase is repeated ; by reason of this
repetition it would receive a sixth degree of in-
tensity.
7. Finally, if the dissonant note is at the same
time culminating and repeated, it has seven degrees
of intensity.
º Pathetic Effects.
Pathetic effects are nine in number, the principal
of which are as follows: The veiled tone; the flat
or compressed tone; the Smothered tone; the rag-
ged tone; the vibrant tone. The last is the most
powerful.
Vibration or tremolo, bad when produced invol-
untarily by the singer, becomes a brilliant quality

when it is voluntary and used at an opportune time.
Every break must be preceded by a vibration, which
prepares the way for it.
Prolations are laryngeal articulations. Great care
must be taken not to substitute pectoral articula-
tions for them. -
The chest is a passive agent; it should furnish
nothing but the breath. The mouth and the larynx
alone are entitled to act.
On the Tearing of the Voice.
Exuberance of the contained brings on destruc-
tion of that which contains it. Tearing of the voice,
therefore, should only be associated with an exces-
sive extension of the sound whose intensity, as we
have demonstrated, is in inverse ratio to the dra-
matic proportion.


## p. 496 (#532) ############################################

NUMBER.
The figure I is characteristic of unity and meas-
ure. The figure 2, which is the measure in the I,
should become subordinate in its greatness and be
equal with it. It is another one which gives birth
to the idea of number.
The idea of number can only arise from the pres-
ence of terms of the same nature. Thus the idea
of number cannot arise from the presence of a cart
and a toad. We shall thus have two very distinct
unities, having no kind of relation to each other.
There must, therefore, be equality before there can
be number. This is so true that we cannot say of
a man and a child that they are two men or two
children, because the one is not equal to the other.
It is, therefore, from the point of an attributive
equality that we are enabled to say: They are two.
But we can say: There are two beings, because
in regard to being they are equal one to the other.
We now understand how two equals one, that the
two figures have an equal importance, and that the
figure I contains exclusively the idea of measure;
the figure 2 contains the idea of number, which is
not in the I, this being the characteristic feature by
which the two terms differ.
Now, how are we to form a perfect unity between
these two equal but distinct terms?


## p. 497 (#533) ############################################

NUMBER. 497
A single operation will suffice to give us the idea
we wish, and this operation is revealed to us entire
in the word weight. In fact, the two terms can only
be united by this word. We feel that I and 2 give
us a common weight, the sum of which is repre-
sented by the figure 3. The figure 3 is, therefore,
equal in importance to I and to 2 ; it maintains
equality in the terms of which it is the representa-
tive, and its characteristic feature is equally impor-
tant with those already described.
Thus to the figure I belongs the idea of measure,
to the figure 2 belongs the idea of number, to the
figure 3 belongs exclusively the idea of reunion, of
community, of unity in fine, which no other figure
can reveal to us. We may say: I and I are equal
among themselves, in the unity of the figure 3 ; or,
in other words: Measure and number find their
unity in weight.

THE ATTRIBUTES OF REASON.
THE HUMAN REASON, that haughty faculty, deified
in our age by a myriad of perverse and commonplace
minds known under the derisive and doubly vain
title of freethinkers, is but blind, despite its high
opinion of its own insight. Yes, and we affirm by
certain intuition that man's reason is not and cannot
be otherwise than blind, aside from the revealing
principle which only enlightens it in proportion to
its subordination; for, abandoned to itself, reason
can only err and must fatally fall into an abyss of
illusions.
The melancholy age in which we live but too often
offers us an example of the lamentable mistakes into
which we are hurried by misguided reason, which,
yielding to a criminal presumption, deserts without
remorse the principle super-abounding in life, Zight
and glory. -

butes of man, is so far subject to error, it is essential
to have a thorough apprehension of the complexity
of its nature. What, then, is the real nature of the
reason so little studied and so illy known by those
very men who raise altars in its honor? Let us try
to produce a clear demonstration. And let us first
say that reason does not constitute a primary prin-
ciple in man; for a primary principle could never
mistake its object. Neither is it a primary faculty,
it is only the form or the manner of being of such
a faculty, and thus cannot be a light in itself. The
rays by which it shines are external to it in the
sense that it receives them from the principle which
governs and fertilizes it. Still, let us say that,
although neither a principle nor a faculty, reason is
none the less, with conscience, of which it forms the
base, the noblest power of man; for this power God
created free; free from subjection to the principle
that enlightens it; free, too, to escape from it. Yet
every power necessarily recognizes a guiding princi-
ple to whose service it needs must bow; but to rea-
son alone it is granted to avoid the law which impe-
riously rules the relations of the harmonious subordi-
nation of principiant faculties to their principles.
Hence the error or possible blindness of reason;
hence also its incomparable grandeur, which lies
solely in its free and spontaneous subordination.
These principles established, let us go still farther,
and penetrate deeper into the mysterious genius of
1"CaSOIl.


## p. 506 (#546) ############################################

506 DELSARTE'S OWN WORDS.
St. Thomas, in whom shone the most perfect rea-
son of which humanity can boast, was pre-eminently
authorized to define reason. He did it in terms at
once so simple, so precise, and of such exquisite
clarity, that we may venture to think that reason
itself could not have better rendered the terms of
its own entity.
This definition, let no one fail to see, contains in
its extreme brevity more substance than would fill
a voluminous treatise. This, then, is his definition:
Reason is the discursive form of the intellect.
Now by this St. Thomas plainly establishes that
reason, distinct from the intellect, with which we
must beware of confounding it, proceeds from it as
effect proceeds from cause. Therefore, intellect
surpasses reason as its principiant and guiding
faculty; and reason only figures in the intelligential
sphere, despite t portant part it plays in virtue
of its adjunctive or supplementing power.
But what is the purpose of this adjunction?
Here, in reply to this grave and important question,
let us refer to what the same scholar says elsewhere.
“Reason arises,” he says, “from the failure of
intellect.” Certainly this is a luminous, and doubt-
less a very unexpected proposition. From it we
learn, on the one hand, that the intellect is liable to
defects and consequently to weaknesses; on the
Other hand, it seems established that the adjunctive
power comes to aid the faculty which governs it,

since here the subjected is born of the failure of the
subjector.
Let us explain this fresh anomaly. We have in
the first place declared the preceding proposition
luminous in spite of the obscurity into which we are
plunged by the consequences which we have derived
from it; but, patience | We are already aware that
it is from the very obscurity of things that the
brightest light sometimes bursts upon contempla-
tive eyes; and since faith is the next principle to
knowledge, let us have faith at least in the trust-
worthiness of him who addresses us, especially as
he has given us repeated, unequivocal tokens of
Sound and upright reason. Let us, then, have no
doubt that the preceding proposition contains a
precious precept; and very certainly light will soon
dawn on our mind.
This settled, and for the better understanding of
the meaning attached to this proposition, let us call
to our aid the powers of analogy.
If reason arises from the failure of intellect it is
doubtless to rectify the valuations of the ego. Now
the compass, which is in itself very inferior to the
hand which fashions it and appropriates it to its
own use, nevertheless implies a defect in that hand
which directs it. So there is between the eye and
the telescope, which comes to its aid, all the distance
that divides the faculty from the instrument which
it governs. Still the telescope joined to the eye
communicates to it a great power of vision; but the

508 DELSARTE'S OWN WORDS.
instrument arises from the failure of the eye, which
is nevertheless infinitely superior to it; for it is the
eye which sees, and not the telescope.
It is thus that we must understand the relations
of reason and intellect. Let us say, then, that the
reason is to the intellect exactly what the telescope
is to the eye. This established, we can formulate
the following definition as well founded.
The intellect is the spiritual eye whose mysterious
telescope reason forms, or : reason is a necessary
appendage of mental optics, or again : reason is the
glass used by the eye of a defective intellect.
But this is not all. St. Thomas provides us still
elsewhere with the means of making our analogy
more striking. He says, indeed : reason is given us
to make clear that which is not evident. Is not
this, as it were, the seal of truth applied to our
demonstration? Thus the eye uses the telescope
absolutely as the intellect employs the reason, to
make clear that which is not evident.
Of course it is plain that if the sight and the
intellect answered perfectly to their object, they
could do without this adjunct which betrays their
imperfection. The intellect would thenceforth have
no more need of reason than the eye of glasses.
This explains the fact, so important to consider,
that the clearer the mental vision is the less one rea-
sons. The angels do not reason; they see clearly
what is troubled and confused by our mind. No
one reasons in heaven, there is no logician there, no

of time.
Divine reason alone will endure because it has
nothing accidental, and it is substantially united to
the eternal word. It is that reason toward which all
blest intelligences will finally gravitate. Hence, we
See that what already partakes of the celestial life
repels reasoning as a cause of imperfection or infirm-
ity. It is thus, by its exclusion of reasons, that the
Gospel Supremely proves its celestial origin. It is,
indeed, a thing well worth remark, especially worthy
of our admiration, that there is not to be found, in
the four Gospels, a single piece of reasoning, any
more than there is an interjection to be found.
Let us add that faith does not reason: which does
not mean, as so many misbelievers feign, that faith
is fulfilled by blindness or ignorance of the objects
of its veneration. Quite the contrary. Faith dis-
penses with reason because of the perfection of its
sight. It is, finally, because it is superior to reason
and sees things from a higher plane. This is what
so many short-sighted people cannot see; and, to
return to our analogy, it seems to them able to see
nothing save through the glasses of reason. It seems
to them, I say, that any man who does not wear

we, who, thank God, have sound sight, are only
troubled and clouded by them.
It is thus that reason, which is given us to make
clear what is not evident, frequently obscures even
the very evidence itself. We might confirm this
declaration by a thousand examples. To cite but
one, let us point out how plainly the spectacle of
the universe of thought and the idea of a Divine
Creator prove that no glasses are required to con-
template God in His works. Well! scientists have
felt obliged to direct theirs upon these simple
notions, and have thus, i. e., by force of reasoning,
succeeded in confusing out of all recognition a
question sparkling with evidence, so much so that
they will fall into such a state of blindness that they
can no longer see in this world any trace of the
Supreme Intelligence which is yet manifested with
glory in the least of His creatures. Consequently,
they will bluntly deny the existence of God; but as
they still must needs admit a creative cause, they
have to that end invented moving atoms and have
made from these strange corpuscles something so
perfectly invisible that they can spare themselves
the trouble of providing public curiosity with a living
proof of their theory. -
The scientist is born perverted, as was said
of the Frenchman who created the vaudeville; and
men, too strong-minded and above all too full of
reason to give any credence to the mysteries taught
by the church, have displayed a blind faith in respect

to moving atoms. They think thus to set them-
selves free from what they call the prejudices of
their fathers. They find no difficulty in attributing
to invisible corpuscles both the plan and the execu-
tion of the beings who people the universe.
This is the fine conception attributed to what is
called a higher reason—a conception before which
bow legions of strong minds. To such a degree of
degradation can reason drag man down.
It is, therefore, dangerous to consult the reason
in any case where evidence is likely to be called into
play. But, before proceeding farther in the course
of our demonstrations, a question presents itself.
It may be asked what we think of another kind of
reason—pure reason , for it appears that in the
opinion of certain philosophers pure reason does
exist. I do not know where they authenticated and
studied this species of reason. For myself I confess
in all humility that not only have I never seen a pure
reason, but it has never even been possible for me
to raise my mind to the point of comprehending the
signification of pure reason. I greatly fear that some
nonsense lurks within the phrase, such transcenden-
tal nonsense as belongs to ideological philosophers
alone. I know not why, but these gentlemen's pure
reason always gives me the sensation of a strong
blast of moving atoms. In fact, it is not clear; but
why require clarity of philosophers and ideologists?
But let us leave these senseless words and pursue
the course of our demonstrations.


## p. 512 (#552) ############################################

5 I2 DELSARTE'S OWN WORDS.
What we have said of reason is quite sufficient to
prevent its confusion with the faculty whose discur-
sive form it is. But this is not enough. We must,
by still more delicate distinctions, make any con-
fusion between these two terms impossible.
Reason, although essentially allied to intelligence,
is not, like it, primordial in man. Thus God created
man intelligent, and consequently susceptible of
reason; but we do not see the word reason brought
into play in Genesis, because it merely expresses a
derivation from the mind or intellect. Reason,
therefore, is secondary and posterior in the genetic
order. But here to the support of this assertion we
have a striking and undeniable proof; namely, that
the infant is born intelligent but not reasonable.
Intellect proceeds directly from that true /*g/it w/ic/.
shines in every man on / is entrance into the world,
while reason is merely the fruit of experience. A
proof of the superiority of intelligence to reason is
seen in the fact that it partakes of the immutable,
and is not like the latter, liable to progress.
Thus the child is seen to be as intelligent as an
adult man can be. Let us rather say that it is in the
child especially that intelligence displays its brightest
rays. Yet he is not furnished with reason. And
why not? Because he has no experience. Reason,
therefore, is an acquired power, whose light is bor-
rowed from experience or tradition.
Reason is proportional to the experience acquired.


## p. 513 (#553) ############################################

© THE ATTRIBUTES OF REASON. 5 I 3
Practical reason or rationality is the ration or portion
of experience allotted to each person.
Reason is to the mental vision exactly what the
eye is to optical vision, and just as the eye bor-
rows its visual action from external light, so reason.
borrows its power of clear and correct vision from
traditional experience. The similarity is absolute.
Suppress light, and vision ceases to be possible.
Suppress revelation from intellectual objects, and
reason is thenceforth blind.
Between reason and intelligence, although there
be inclusion and co-essentiality in these terms, there
is a great difference in the mode of cognizance; for,
as St. Augustine says, intelligence is shown by
simple perception, and reason by the discursive pro-
cess. Thus, while intelligence acts simply, as in
knowing an intelligible truth by the light of its own
intuition, reason goes toward its end progressively,
from one thing known to another not yet known.
The latter, as St. Thomas says, implies an imper-
fection. The former, on the contrary, beseems a
perfect being. It is, therefore, evident, adds the
same profound thinker, that reasoning bears the
same relation to knowledge that motion does to
repose, or as acquisition to possession. The one is
of an imperfect nature, and the other of a perfect
nature. Boëthius compares the intellect to eter-
nity; reason, to time.
Yet human reason, according to the principle
which illuminates it, offers three degrees of elevation

which we will distinguish, for readier comprehension,
by three special terms, namely: first, tradition or
the experience of another; Second, personal expe-
rience; third, the reason of things.
Trained by tradition, reason is called common
sense. Trained by personal experience to the knowl-
edge of principles, reason is called science. Trained
by the contemplation of principles to the perfection
of the intellect, reason is called wisdom2.
What we call practical reason is based upon the
authority of tradition and the lessons of other peo-
ple's experience in regard to the customary and
moral matters of life.
Speculative or discursive reason judges by the
criterion of its own experience; thereby inferring
consequences more or less in conformity with tradi-
tional teachings, and arriving by the logical Order
of its deductions and in virtue of the principles
which it accepts and which it applies to its discover-
ies, at what we call science.
Transcendental reason pursues, in the effects
which it examines, the investigation of their cause,
and rises thence to the very reason of things.
Wherefore it silences reasoning, enters into a silent
and persistent course of observation, consults the
facts, examines, studies and questions the principles
whence it sees them to be deduced ; and, without
yielding to the obscurity in which these principles
are enveloped, pierces that obscurity by the pene-
trative force of unremitting attention. Inspired by

the standard of faith, it knows that the spirit of God
exists at the root of these mysteries. It clings
thereto, unites itself thereto by contemplation, and
finally draws from this union its strength, its light
and its ſoy. •,
Such is the course of wisdom, and such are the
inestimable advantages of faith to reason. It is in
fact by faith that reason is aggrandized and elevated
to the height of the intellect whence it draws its
certitude.
Reason believes because it desires to understand,
and because it knows that faith is the next principle
to knowledge.
Thus the grandeur of reason is proportioned to
its humility; proportioned, I would say, to the
efforts which it multiplies to forget itself when the
truth addresses it. But such is not the method of
procedure of “strong minds.” They have a horror
of the mysteries toward which they are still urged
by correct instincts. The fact is, let us say it
boldly, they fear lest they find God there.
In these misguided spirits there is so much pre-
Sumption, self-conceit, self-love, that they are, in the
nullity of their lofty pride, a worship unto them-
selves, an idolatry of their own reason. They
have deified it, that poor, frail reason; and this,
while mutilating it, while proclaiming it independent
and free from all law, from all principle, from every-
thing definite.

pendent reason, who on principle boast that they have

afflicts these unbelievers for all who believe and hope
here below ; thence, their systematic ignorance of
fundamental questions; thence, the incurable blind-
ness in which they bask; thence, finally, the incon-

spectacle humiliating to the human mind.
But agnostic man labors in vain. He cannot
escape the mysteries which surround him on every
hand, like a gulf in which reason is inevitably lost
so soon as it ceases to seek the light.
Man stumbles at every turn against the efforts of
a stronger reason than his own, the Supreme Reason
before which, nilly nilly, his must bow and confess
the insanity of its judgments.
Logic is not, to reason, a sure guide; and even
where it feels its foothold most strong, it sometimes
trips, to the disgrace of the good opinion it had of
its own infallibility.
Let us show by a simple example to what rebuffs
our reason is exposed when counting on the Sup-
port of its logic, face to face with the reason of facts.
Undoubtedly it is logical and perfectly in conform-
ity with reason, to say that one and one make two.
No doubt seems possible on that point. Well, this
elementary truth, the most undeniable in the eyes
of all men which can be produced, does not, despite
the assurances which seem to uphold it, constitute

an impregnable axiom ; for there are cases when
one and one do not make two / Certainly such a
proposition seems scarcely reasonable, for its admis-
sion would entail the reversal of what are called the
sound notions of logic But what will the logician
say if I affirm that in a certain case, one and one

trouble to refute me? No, he would laugh in my
face; he would not listen to me; he would tax me
with absurdity and insanity, preferring thus to lose
a chance of instruction rather than confess the impo-
tence of his logic.
There is the evil, and it is generally in this way
that ignorance is perpetuated. But let us return to
the fact which we desire to prove, contrary to logic
and the pretensions of ordinary reason.
Now, it is logical and perfectly in conformity with
reason to say that two musical instruments make
more noise than one; and that thus two double
basses, for example, tuned in unison and placed side
by Side, produce one sound of a double intensity.
This seems an elementary matter. It is as clear, you
say, as that one and one make two. Well, no, it is not
So clear as you suppose. It is, on the contrary, a
mistake; for attentive experiment proves that
the result is diametrically opposite to the logical
conclusion.
This is a fact which no argument can destroy.
Two double basses, placed in the above-named con-
ditions—conditions of vicinity and tonal identity—

far from adding up their individual result, are thus
reduced each to a quarter of its own sonority, which
in the sum total, instead of producing a double Sound,
produces a sound reduced to half of that given indi-
vidually by each instrument taken alone. This is
how a power plus an analogous power equals together
with it but half a power; and thus we are forced
to admit that one and one do not necessarily make
tWO.
I have carried the experiment still farther; in the
instrument which gained me a first-class medal at
the exhibition of 1854, I was enabled to put thirty-
six strings of the same piano into unison at once.
Well ! All these strings, struck simultaneously, did
not attain to the intensity of sound produced by one
of them struck singly. All these sounds, far from
gaining strength by union, reciprocally neutralized
one another. This is not logical, I admit; but we
must submit to it.
Logic must be silent and reason bow before the
brutal force of a fact to which there is no objection
to be raised.
Since we are on the subject of the phenomena
of sonority, let us draw another illustration from it,
quite as overwhelming in its illogicalness as the
former.
When two similar phenomena differ from one
another on any side, the discord brought about by
this difference is more apparent and more striking
by reason of the closer conjunction of these phenom-


## p. 519 (#559) ############################################

THE ATTRIBUTES OF REASON. 5 I9
ena. By way of compensation the dissimilarity is
less appreciable in proportion as these phenomena
are farther apart from each other.
This is rigorously logical and perfectly conform-
able to reason; yet there are cases where we must
affirm the contrary. Thus the same sound produced,
I will suppose, by two flutes not in accord with one
another, forms those disagreeable pulsations in the
air which discordant sounds inevitably produce.
There seems to be no doubt that by gradually
bringing these discordant instruments together, the
falseness of their relation must be more and more
striking, more and more intolerable. Wrong ! For
then, and above all if the mouths of these instru-
ments be concentrically directed, a mutual translo-
cation is produced between the two discordant
sounds, which restores the accuracy of their agree-
ment. Thus the lower sound is raised, while the
higher one is lowered, in such a way that the two
sounds are mingled on meeting and form a perfect
unison. Now, here are contrasts, which, contrary to
all rational data, so far from being exaggerated
by contact, diminish gradually, until they are utterly
annihilated. Thus, then, given two instruments of
the same nature, if the harmony which they effect
be true, they enter by reason of their conjunction
into a negative state which neutralizes their sonority;
while the contrary occurs in the case of false unison.
Here the instruments become identical with one

another, the sonority is increased and the tonal
deviation is corrected to the most perfect harmony.
Obstinate rationalists, what is your logic worth
here? Has it armed you against the surprises held
in store for you by a multitude of facts inaccordant
with your reasonings? Oh, proud and haughty rea-
son, bow your head | Confess the inanity of your
ways. Bow yet, once again, and contemplate the
mystery whence luminous instruction shall beam for
you !
At bottom these mysteries may surprise and
baffle a reason deprived of principle; but they are
never contrary to it, because they proceed from
reason itself, from that Supreme Reason which cre-
ated us in its own image; and, by that very fact, is
always in accord with individual reason in so far as
this will consent to sacrifice its own prejudices to it,
or listen to its infallible lessons.
But man's reason most frequently heeds itself
alone. Thence, once again, arise its infirmities.
Thus, what will happen, if, because the truths
which I utter here are obscure and do not at the
first glance appear to conform to the requirements
of logic, you hastily reject them with all the lofti-
ness of your scornful reason, which would blush to
admit what it did not understand | Poor reason |
which in and of itself understands so little, and
admits so many follies as soon as a Scholar affirms
them. The consequence will be that you will be

bend before a mystery revealed, behold it, I say,
bowed beneath the weight of prejudices, which there
will be more than one scholar, more than one
logician, ready to endorse.
* Thus reason will refuse as unworthy itself, all
belief in the actions of God or of unseen spirits, the

ence of moving atoms, invisible corpuscles. This is
the mental poverty into which the enemies of religious
faith unwittingly fall. They pervert that instrument
of reason whose true use is to supplement and fortify
imperfect intelligence, and misuse it to discredit and
overthrow the original intuitions of intelligence.

TRUENESS IN SINGING.
NOTES OF A LECTURE BY DELSARTE, TAKEN BY HIS
PUPIL A. GIRAUDET, OF THE NATIONAL
ACADEMY OF MUSIC, PARIS.
By a most reasonable deduction derived from his
admirable principles, Delsarte reckoned three modes
or degrees of correct singing:
I. Absolute trueness;
2. Temperate trueness;
3. Passional trueness.
Absolute trueness is that adopted by theorists, who
divide the gamut into five notes and two semi-notes;
the note into nine commas, or shades of tone; the
chromatic semi-tone into five, and the diatonic semi-
tone into four.
Thus from C to C# they count five shades of tone;
whereas from C to D b they count but four. Like-
wise, from D to D b they count five shades of tone,
and from D to C ; but four.

nevertheless, most important in singing, as we shall
See later on. But performers, to simplify our musical
system, have divided this comma into two, making
synonymous notes of D flat and C sharp ; that is to
Say, notes having the same sound. The note is,
therefore, practically divided into two semitones of
four commas and a half. This is what is known as
moderation or temperate trueness.

Temperate trueness is defective from many points
of view. This is the universal opinion, but we are
forced to accept this method by the absolute im-
possibility of any improvement, especially with the
key-board instruments now in vogue; and it must
be accepted until some new invention shall revolu-
tionize the piano by modulating its tones, a trans-
formation which would give that instrument not only
the musical design, but also the color and warmth
which it now lacks.
Let us pass to passional trueness, leaving Science
to enter the domain of art. “Passional trueness,”
said Delsarte, “consists in giving each semitone
three, four, five, six, or even seven commas, accord-
ing to its tendency.” As we see, the precept is
daring, and an inattentive scholar would only have
to forget the last words of the definition to make

TRUENESS IN SINGING. 535
people say that the great master of lyric art taught
his pupils to sing false.
Every rule has its reason and its consequences.
St. Augustine, who knew the Beautiful, of which art
is only the expression, and who could explain it
well, has given us a brief but admirable definition of
music: “Music is a succession of sounds each calling
forth the other.” Simple yet profound words ! The
Sounds call each other forth, desire and mutually
attract each other, and in every age this attraction
has been so clearly evident, that the seventh note in
the Scale, when it meets the others each of which
has its particular name relating to its particular func-
tion, tonic, dominant, etc., is simply called the sensi-
tive note, from its tendency to pass into the atonic.
Passional trueness is based upon this tendency of
the notes to pass into those which succeed them, and
upon this reciprocal attraction of sounds. Thus,
notes, which have a tendency toward the acute or
shrill, may be raised two commas or more above
temperate trueness. Notes which have a tendency
toward the grave may be lowered in the same pro-
portion. (Example, taken from “The Prophet,” by
Meyerbeer.)

may also be but two commas removed from the G,
and this change far from producing a disagreeable
effect upon the ear, will make a most striking im-
pression and the accent will be far more dramatic
than before. Try the reverse, that is, divide the
interval B sharp–C into seven commas on the semi-
tones A flat-G ; it will be unendurable. Whence
we may deduce the fact that to sing false is to sing
above or below a note in the inverse direction to its
attraction.
Delsarte, in his definition, speaks only of the semi-
tone, and we ourselves give examples of that sort
of attraction only ; but it does not follow that the
other intervals are not equally subject to the same
law. Their attraction may not be shown by the
same effects.
The master added, in speaking of trueness in sing-
ing: “The triad is the breathing-place of the tonal-
ity; the notes composing it should be absolutely
true. They are the singer's invariable and necessary
law. They characterize repose. Their office is
that of attraction, and they can only be attracted
mutually, with the exception of the tonic, which is
the centre of attraction not only for various notes,
but for the phrase and the entire composition.”
Delsårte was very severe in regard to those who
sang false; but to sing true was not, to his thinking,
a good quality. He said, on this point, that no one
would compliment an architect because he had built a
house in accordance with geometrical rules. Whence


## p. 537 (#577) ############################################

TRUENESS IN SINGING. 537
he concluded that trueness is the least of good quali-
ties, and the lack of it the greatest of vices, and he
added in regard to style: “The most important
quality is expression, and a lack of expression is the
least of vices.”
Let us add that the application of passional true-
ness depends upon a thousand conditions of rhythm
and harmony, to analyze which would lead us much
too far. The artist must make use of it according
to his aptitudes and his tendencies, for he must pre-
serve his individuality. He must learn by observa-
tion and the study of his own faculties to apply
theoretical rules' founded upon natural laws.
Practical trueness, while it allows us to depart
from legitimate trueness, has strong analogies with
the tempo rubato. The tempo rubato, which Delsarte
employed in a remarkable and striking way in
dramatic passages, actually permits the musician, in
certain cases and in the desired proportion, to change
the value of the notes while respecting the principle
of time, which is invariable. But the application of
these rules is subject to the emotional intensity; it
is, therefore, impossible to determine theoretically
and absolutely its various bearings.

SYSTEM OF
DELSARTHºHYPRESSION
By GENEVIEWE STEBBHNs.
PRESENTED FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A WAY
PLAIN, PRACTICAL, IIELPFUL.
*. Designed Especially for a Text-Book and for Self-Instruction. ."
A B00K OF HESTHETIG PHYSIGAL TRAINING FOR ALL PER-
S0NS OF GULTURE. -
AND PARTICULARLY FOR THE
E10Outionist, Orator, ACtor, Public Reader, Law-
yer, Preacher, Painter, Sculptor, and a11
Others Who Wish to give Expres-
SiOn to their BOdies Or to
their Work.
Author and Publisher haze spared neither Zabor nor expense in their endeavor to Aroduce
a work that s/a/Z satis/3, the wides/read desire /or something tangible azed servicead/e ozz
the Delsarée System. Æzery erercise has been subjected to repeated Žersonal test, and greaz
care gizen to the description of attitude and mozement.
The writings and teachings of Delaumosne, Arnaud and Mackaye (pupils of Delsarte) the
author has supplemented with years of study under other masters—in different capitals, at the
Paris Conservatoire, etc., and has drawn from various additional sources, ancient and mod-
ern. She has taken all they had to give, pruning, analyzing, comparing, adapting, formula-
ting, constructing, and testing theories, principles, rules and methods by years of personal,
practical experience as teacher, elocutionist, public reader, and actress. So far as the Delsarte
System is known, so far as it can be reduced to definitions and exercises, both author and pub-
lisher do now place this book before the public as the best that can be written ; trusting that,
besides being a guide and help to the oratorical and dramatic student, it will contribute toward
rescuing the life-work of François Delsarte from the threatening oblivion and from the misun-
derstanding, mysticism and contempt into which it has fallen.
***
Delsarte's gymnastics differ
from others in that they are not
mechanical. Each has a men-
tal, emotional, aesthetic value
and intent. No exercise is prac-
ticed simply for the physical
result, but for the purpose of
developing body, mind , and
soul, and harmonizing their re-
ciprocal relations, influences
and effects.
***
By a happy, 1udicious ming-
ling of philosophy and drill ex-
ercises, the author has avoided
making the book either too
metaphysical or too mechani-
cal. Both the reasoning stu-
dent and the practical student
will be satisfied. Every gym-
nastic has its philosophical ex-
planation, every principle its
physical application.
***
The book is arranged in divi-
sions and lessons; with head-
ings, sub-headings, numbered
paragraphs, the gymnastics
grouped and classified, type of
various sizes and differently dis-
played, an order of exercises for
systematic practice and blank
pages for explanations and re-
marks an exhaustive index; it
is well suited for class-work.
SIXTEEN CHARTS (drawn expressly for this book from living models); NINETEEN
SETS OF AFSTHETIC GYMNASTICS, INCLUDING DECOMPOSING EX-
ERCISES, RECOMPOSING EXERCISES, HARMONIC POISE OF
BEARING, A GAMUT OF EXPRESSION IN PANTOMIME,

PUELISHER'S ANNOUNCEMENT,
Many persons àegin their professional career by publishing “treatises,” “ methods,” “sys-
tems”— mere theories which the azeźhors Žhemzse/zes have not tested, and which are either
Žagiarisans, or, if original, possess little or no merit; sometimes these publications are even
injurious because they are the result of ignorance and false principles.
OSKAR GUTTMANN, in contradistinction to the many writers who flood and afflict the public, did
not take up the pen until he had something of value to communicate, something which had
been subjected to the crucial test of PRACTICAL ExPERIENCE. But he had no prototype, no
author from whom he could draw. He was alone. He was the discoverer, the inventor, the
pioneer, the formulater. It is well that he was forced to go to nature, to drink at the fountain
head, for in so doing he produced a work founded upon the natural, Scientific principles
governing vocal anatomy, physiology and hygiene ; the production, management and cultiva-
tion of the singing and speaking voice.
Twenty-five years ago was issued the first German edition of Gymnastics of THE VoICE,
which at once became a standard authority,+ a position it holds until this day, notwithstand-
ing the many volumes that have appeared and which are — forgotten It has been the source
from which many subsequent writers have taken ideas and exercises, generally without credit
and also without properly and intelligently reproducing them.
The repeated editions in Europe, and the necessity of another American edition so soon
after the issue of the first, are proof positive of its merit and durability. It is a book £hat has
comte to stay /
The text for the new edition has been thoroughly revised from beginning to end. Many
pages of new matter have been added, including mezzzzzerous exercises for £7-actice zwhich haze
NEVER BEFoRE BEEN IN PRINT, and which are the results of the author’s life-long study and
experience ; and the whole work has been put into a form adapted to use as a text-book in
colleges and schools, and as a self-instructor by any person.

PANTOIVIIIVIEs,
W O R D L E S S P O E M S
FOR ELOCUTIONARY AND CALISTHENIC"CLASSES.
BY MARY TUCKER MAGILL.
Teachers of elocution know how difficult it is to make the pupil comprehend
the exquisite delicacy and all-conquering power which the human frame pos-
sesses for giving expression to speech. The object of this book is to meet and
overcome this difficulty,+ to give ease, grace and freedom of movement, while
the face speaks unconsciously in unison with the language. For the accomplish-
ment of this end music has been summoned to aid, and, for the time being, to
take the place of the human voice. There are 20 illustrations from a living
model ; but these are only the leading positions and expressions; the descrip-
tions and directions give many others. The music is adapted to the exercises,
changing with every sentiment.

Based upon Natural and Artistic Principles. Including a thorough course of
training in the Art of Breathing and Voice-Building, together with a carefully
prepared set of
VOCAL EXERCISES.
The whole forming a Plain, Comprehensive and Progres-
sive Course for the Cultivation of the Voice.
Aesigned both for 7 eachers' use and for Students' Self-/nstruction.
BY JOSEPHINE RAND.
This book merits special attention and recommendation. Most books of this kind are written
mainly to advertise their authors and to bring them pupils, hence they withhold oftentimes the
very thing that the student needs and desires. Miss Rand is imbued sufficiently with the
missionary spirit to give her complete method, and to do her best to make her meaning plain
and useful. She boldly and frankly puts into print what she considers to be the best method
of learning to sing, her treatise being the outcome of her experience as singer and teacher.
A commendable spirit pervades the whole book, and whatever criticisms other teachers may
have to make, they certainly must acknowledge that the author has aimed to conscientiously
and thoroughly perform her task, which is to present a thorough course of training in the
art of breathing and voice-building, together with a carefully prepared set of vocal exercises, the
whole forming a plain, comprehensive and progressive course for the cultivation of the voice,
designed both for teachers' use and students' self-instruction. While it must be acknowledged
that a good teacher is a prime necessity, this book will be found of unusual helpfulness to pupils
in private study, for the instructions have been made as plain and comprehensive as possible.
Many of the exercises are original ; some are the outgrowth of knowledge gained by experience
with the necessities of different voices, and others are gleanings obtained from different teachers
such as Garcia, Lamperti, Shakespeare, Vannucinni, Guilmette, Mme. Rudersdorff and others.
This book pays special attention to English singing, and teaches the application of the old
Italan method to the pure English vowels and consonants, enabling the singer to render an
nglish composition with perfection of pronunciation, while, at the same time, not allowing it
tosuffer from an improper placing of tone or from imperfection of quality. The principal Sec-
tions of the book are :
Theory and Practice, Preparatory Study, Art of Breathing, Training of the Tongue, Study
of ithe English Language, Registers, Hygiene of the Voice, Design of the Exercises, Exercises
in Respiratory Technique, Exercises for the Flexibility of the Jaw, the Lips and the Soft-
Palate, Position of the Mouth in Singing, Exercises in Vocal Technique, Color, Scale Practice,
The Trill, Staccato Singing, Faults to be Avoided, Sight Reading, Exercises with Accompani-
ment, Expression.
The following points are given special attention :
Breath-control, the foundation of all good singing — a thorough knowledge of diaphragmatic
breathing, and by it the entire control of the voice.
Entire relaxation and freedom of all the muscles of the throat, jaw and face making possible a
relaxed and open throat, through which the tones may pass unobstructed and unfettered.
Distinct glottal articulation, securing proper vocal attack, or that precision of striking a tone
that is gained by a perfect command of the coup-de-glotte.
Voice-placing under the direct supervision of the mind, affording a definite idea of how and
zwhere to place the voice properly, and without the usual throat-contraction.
Development of pure tone, and its application to vocalization.
Distinct enunciation, applied especially to English singing.
Acquisition of resonance and power by the knowledge of the use of the entire reverberating
surface as a sounding-board.
Regulation of the voice, or, in other words, its equal development through its entire range.
Printed on extra heavy paper, sheet music size, bound in limp cloth, price $2.
postpaid.

TESTIMONIALS FROM EMIMENT ENGLISH AUTHORITIES:
“Admirable and of great utility.” — Fred-
erick A. G. Ousley.
“I like them very much : they are scientific,
systematic, and ingenious.”—John Stainer.
“My voice never settled, and at the age of
twenty-five, after I had attained to the degree
of Bachelor in Music of Cambridge, I was
still the unhappy possessor of a miserable
kind of child's squeak. Luckily for me, how-
ever, I at this time came across Mr. Behnke,
and in less than twelve lessons he enabled me
to speak in a full, round meazz's voice, which
soon developed into a decent bass. The re-
sults of Mr. Behnke's teaching were so very
obvious, that many of my friends, who had
not seen me for a month or two, positively
started with surprise and astonishment when
they heard me speak.”— C. W. Pearce, Mus.
Doc. Cazztalá.
“Mr. Behnke's view of the registers and
and the methods to be employed for the Ö/ezza!—
Žng and strengthening is correct scientifi-
cally and physiologically, and is of the utmost
Żut/?ortazzce from a 7/zzeszca/ stand-point. I
insist fromz the ſizsä on a proper use of the
#/.272 register, and am thus able, with the min-
imum of fatigue, both to teacher and pupil,
to secure high notes, clear, pure, and pleasant,
and without the constant flattening which is
the bane of all conductors and teachers who
have to deal with male voices. Nor does this

weaken the notes of the lower register; on
the contrary, it improves the voice through-
out.”—R. Dunston, Mies. Batc., Canzza &., L.
Mees. T. C. L. Teacher of Vocal Music at the
West mainster and Southland's Training Col-
Aeges.
* The second thing of which the audience
becomes aware upon an actor's entrance, is the
sound of his voice. Here, indeed, the actor
of the present day has an enormous advantage
over those of a past generation. Thanks to
the genius of Mr. Emil Behnke, the actor may
learn to produce his voice so perfectly that he
will be able to achieve effects without effort,
which were before beyond his reach, even at
the cost of utter exhaustion. Mr. Behnke has
made the teaching of voice-production a scº-
ence which deals with facts instead of fancies,
enabling the student to understand what is
wanted and to do intelligently and with a di-
rect purpose, what he could otherwise only
accomplish by the uncertain method of imita-
tion and by guess-work. I am not speaking
at hap-hazard, or with a superficial knowledge
of the subject. My opinion is based upon
careful personal investigation and upon obser-
vation of the practical results in many indi-
vidual cases. I am quite sure that Mr.
Behnke's method of teaching voice-produc-
tion will soon be adopted in all schools of
singing and elocution.”— A ſerizzazzzz Pezzzz.

Essays AND POSTSCRIPTS ON ELOCUTION.
BY PROF. A. MELVII, LE BELL.
Every elocutionist and every other person interested in language and speech will welcome
whatever comes from the pen of this eminent author, who is the greatest living elocutionist.
For many years the name of Bell has been familiar to students of elocution ; at least three
generations of the Bells have occupied prominent positions as teachers and writers, “Bell’s
Standard Elocutionist’” having reached, in 1885, the enormous sale of 136,ooo copies—the
largest sale of any elocutionary work. It is, therefore, no mere figure of speech to say that
the name of Bell has become a household word in Great Britain and in America, both through
the writings of A. Melville Bell and through the scientific researches of his son, A. Graham
Bell, the inventor of the telephone. The present book is a supplement to, a resumé and a
reinforcement of the theories and principles laid down in his former works, and is a finishing
touch to a long and distinguished professional career. The contents are :
The Science of Elocution, Faults in Reading and Speaking, English Pronunciation,
English Phonetic Elements, Alphabetics, Relation of Tones to Language, The Tones of
Speech, The Instrument of Speech, Respiration in Speech, Phonetic Syllabication, Accent,
Emphasis, Rhythm as Affecting Reading, Rhyme as Affecting Pronunciation, Expressive
Speech, Action, Class Characteristics of Delivery, Defects and Impediments of Speech,
Orthography, Visibility of Speech, Imitation, Reading and Readers, Oratory and Orators, An
Alphabet of Orators, A Shadow Class of Students.
Price, $1.25.
