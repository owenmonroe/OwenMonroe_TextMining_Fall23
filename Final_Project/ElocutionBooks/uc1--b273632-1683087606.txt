PREFACE.
This book is not an elaborate treatise, designed for special teach-
ers of clocution, but a drill-book of essentials for use by teachers
that do not make elocution a specialty. In most High and Normal
schools, and in the advanced Grammar grades, the curriculum is so
crowded that there is no time for the special training given by
professional teachers of elocution to select classes of private pupils.
The time generally allotted to reading and elocution seldom ex-
ceeds that allowed for vocal music-perhaps one or two hours a
week. Hence the successful training of largo classes involves a
great deal of concert drill; and this requires the use of a suitable
manual of principles, directions, and drill exercises.
This treatise owes its existence to the difficulties met with in
the management of a very large High school, including a post-
graduate Normal department, in which an honest effort has been
made to secure a fair degree of attention to school reading and
elocution.
Fully realizing the limitations of teachers in similar schools, I
have endeavored to keep within the bounds of what it is possible
to accomplish without making elocution a hobby. The salient
points of this hand-book are as follows
1. It includes only what it is possible to take up without material
interference with the ordinary school curriculum.
2. It embraces only what pupils of average ability are capable of
comprehending and mastering.
3. It includes a fair outfit of principles and practice for those
who intend to become teacherv.
4. It can be effectively usvd by teachers who are not specialists
in elocution.

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
5. It contains clear and concise statements of principles and
rules.
6. It is characterized by the copiousness and freshness of the
illustrative drill-examples.
It was my good fortune, more than thirty years ago, to be a
student under that most critical and scholarly elocutionist and Nor-
mal-school instructor, Professor William Russell; and it is natural
that I should follow in the steps of my revered instructor. I am also
indebted to many excellent manuals on elocution for principles and
examples that constitute the common stock of matter on this sub-
ject.
I am under obligations to the publishers of the works of Ameri-
can authors for permission to make short extracts from their pub-
lications, and in particular, to Houghton, Mifflin & Co., for extracts
from Longfellow, Whittier, Holmes, Lowell, and Emerson.

PART 1.
ORTHOPHONY AND ORTHOEPY.
SECTION 1.
INTRODUCTORY HINTS AND DIRECTIONS.
1. As correct pronunciation is an essential of good
reading, it is important that pupils should acquire at
the outset a thorough knowledge of the elementary
sounds of the English language, and that they should
be trained to a ready command of the organs of speech.
2. The melody of our mother-tongue depends in a
great measure on the fullness and purity with which
the vowel sounds are given. The most marked provin-
cialisms in our country consist chiefly in the peculiar
shades of sound given to certain vowels.
3. In high schools and normal schools, if anywhere,
critical attention ought to be given to pronunciation.
It is desirable that pupils should become familiar with
the diacritical marks of the dictionary in order that
they may be able to find, by themselves, the correct
pronunciation of any word.
4. It is the object of the following lessons to train
(1) the ear to the correct sound; (2) the voice to distinct
enunciation; and (3) the eye to the use of diacritical
marks.
(11)


## p. 12 (#18) ##############################################

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
I. HINTS TO TEACHERS.
1. In all short concert drill exercises, require pupils
to stand, and to stand erect. Let the concert drill be
preceded by a breathing exercise.
2. Insist upon it that pupils hold the book properly
in the left hand, high enough to bring the head erect.
3. In the more difficult drill exercises, the teacher
should first read the examples, requiring pupils to repeat
in concert. To some extent, elocution must be taught
by imitation.
4. The true economy of time in vocal culture, as in
vocal music, consists in training large numbers together.
The concert drill lessons may be given to two or three
hundred pupils in the assembly hall as effectively as to
a single class in the recitation room.
5. The concert drill in phonic spelling is designed to
give pupils the full command of their vocal organs, and
also to secure accurate articulation, enunciation, and
pronunciation. At first, it may be desirable for the
teacher to lead the class, giving every sound clearly,
forcibly, and distinctly.
6. The grouped lists of words illustrating the vowel
sounds should be pronounced distinctly and forcibly by
the teacher, then by the class in concert, and finally,
by individual pupils. The monosyllables in these lists
should be spelled by sound, first by the teacher, next
by the class in concert, and, finally, by individual pupils.
7. Insist upon it that pupils practice every lesson, after
it has been read in school, at home, by themselves.
8. Impress upon pupils the fact that good reading,
like vocal music, requires long-continued practice.
9. Insist upon it that pupils, when reading, shall raise
their eyes from the book when approaching the end of
a sentence, and repeat the last five or ten words look-
ing directly at the teacher or the class.
ds should be pro the class in mables in these

II. HINTS TO PUPILS.
1. Stand erect when you read, and hold the book in
your left hand, high enough to bring the head erect.
2. By frequent inhalations, keep your lungs well filled
with air.
3. Read loud enough to be easily heard by every mem-
ber of your class. If possible, look over the advance
lesson before the hour of class drill.
4. After the class drill at school, read each lesson by
yourself at home. You can become a good reader only
by patient and persevering practice.
5. If you have any marked faults in reading, you
must endeavor to correct them by self-culture out of
school.
6. Enter into the spirit of whatever you read, and
read it so as to convey that spirit to those who listen.
7. Think about the meaning of what you read. Refer
to the dictionary for the definition of any word you do
not fully comprehend, or for the pronunciation of any
word with which you are not familiar.
8. Listen attentively to the reading of your teacher,
or of the best readers in the class, and try to imitate
their style of reading.
9. Train yourself to the habit of raising your eyes
from the book to look at the teacher or the class. It
is a matter of politeness to look at those to whom you
speak, or to whom you read. As you approach the end
of a sentence, glance your eye along the words in ad-
vance of the tongue, and then complete the sentence
without looking on the book. It is a good plan to
practice this by yourself before a mirror.
10. Endeavor to become so familiar with the diacrit-
ical marks that you can find out, for yourself, from the
dictionary, the pronunciation of any word without re-
ferring to the key, the table of sounds, or the teacher.

III. PRELIMINARY BREATHING EXERCISES.
Concert drill exercises in articulation and pronunciation
should be preceded by short breathing exercises. These
may be conducted in a great variety of ways, of which
only a few are here indicated. The length of time in
inhaling or exhaling may be regulated by the rise or fall
of the teacher's hand.
1. Stand erect; feet firm; body braced ; shoulders well
back; arms akimbo.
2. Inhale slowly through the nostrils for five seconds;
exhale slowly through the nostrils for five seconds.
Repeat five times. Regulate the inhaling and exhaling
by the rise and fall of the hand. In inhaling, fill the
lower part of the lungs and do not elevate the shoulders.
3. Take a similar exercise, prolonging the time, first
to ten seconds, next to fifteen seconds, and finally to
twenty seconds.
4. Inhale; exhale slowly, giving, in a soft whisper,
the sound of “Ah!” prolonged for five seconds; ten
seconds; as long as possible.
5. Inhale; exhale slowly, giving the sound of long o,
in pure tone, prolonged for five seconds; next for ten
seconds; then for fifteen seconds; and finally, as long
as possible.
6. Inhale; exhale slowly, giving for ten seconds the
sound of long e; of Italian a; of long oo.
7. Inhale ; repeat, in monotone, the long vowels, a, e, i,
0, u, until the breath is exhausted.
8. Inhale; count, with one breath, to 10; next, to 20;
then, to 30.
9. Repeat, in one breath, the letters of the alphabet.
10. Inhale slowly; exhale slowly, giving the sound of
liquid l prolonged for five seconds; ten seconds; fifteen
seconds; twenty seconds; next, the sound of m; of n;
of r.

XVIII. The short sound of o.
Marked with a breve, thus—. The sound of short
0, as in not, is slightly modified by the different con-
sonants with which it is combined. In words like cough,
gone, loss, etc., the sound of short o is modified so that
it tends towards a sound intermediate between short o
and broad a. Avoid the common error of saying dawg
or dorg for dog; gawd or gord for god; also, that of
gūt for got, etc.

is identical with that of oo in moon, and of u after r,
as in rule. Avoid the provincialism of reducing the
sound of o, oo, and ụ to that of long u or ew, thus-
dew for do, trew for true, tew for to, yew for you,
skewl for school, etc. The sound of o, oo, or u is one
of the extremes of the vowel scale, made correctly by
projecting the lips free from the teeth.

XXI. Sound of o as in fôr.
Marked with a circumflex, thus—Ô. This sound of o
is identical with broad a as in all. It occurs before r
in words of one syllable; in accented syllables when
not followed by another r; and also in the derivatives
of such words as nôrth, nôrthern, etc. Be careful to
give r its full sound.

XXIII. The long sound of u.
Marked with a macron, thus-ū. This is a compound
sound, formed of a slight sound of y joined with 00
long. After d, t, l, n, and s, it is somewhat difficult to
introduce the y sound. Avoid the two extremes: (1)
That of overdoing the y sound, so as to make dū’ty
sound like jū'ty. (2) That of sounding u like oo long,
as doo'ty for dū'ty.

IV. VOWEL SOUNDS IN UNACCENTED SYLLABLES.
There are many delicate shades of sound in unac-
cented vowels which must be learned from the lips of
the living teacher, or by noticing carefully the pro-
nunciation of educated and critical people.
I. Final unaccented ar, er, ir, or, yr.
The vowels a, e, i, o, u, y, preceding r in final unac-
cented syllables, have the sound of e as in hēr.
bēg'gar al'der ärmor sůl'phur
eðl'lar
băn ner ärdor

III. Words having a or o unaccented.
In words like the following, a or o in unaccented final
syllables has a slightly obscured sound of short U.

IV. Final unaccented a.
Unaccented a, at the end of a word, has the sound
of intermediate a, verging towards short u, as com må
or com'mŭ.
com'må ăl'ġe brå
pï ăz'ză
va nil'la
ē'rå
ā're å
co ro'na guer il'la

mĩ ca op'e rå sin til là mem o rằnda
sö fä
i dē'a
um brěl'la a năth'e må
V. Sound of a in unaccented final syllables.
In words like the following, a has the sound of short
e; as, -age=ěj, and -ate =ět.
coŭrſage măr’riage săv'age păl'ate
dămage căr’riage ūş'age pī'rate
drāin'age mīle'age ăgʻate friğ’ate
frónt'age põst'age climate ad van'tage
lēak'age tillſage prī'vate per çent'age
VI. Unaccented a as an initial syllable.
In the first syllable of words like the following, the
vowel a, when unaccented, has nearly the sound of short
a a little obscured, or of a as in ask, verging towards
short u; as à bout', ă bove'; or å bout', å bove'. Avoid
the common error of giving a the long sound; as ā bove',
mā chïne'; also that of short u, as ŭ bout', ŭ bove'. In
the dictionary this sound is unmarked.

X. Sound of short i and y in unaccented syllables.
In words like the following, there is a tendency to
give short e the sound of obscure e or a, and to pro-
long final -ty into -te.
ac tỉv'i ty gul li bil'i ty r e spon si bil'i ty
a gil'i ty
in těl'li ġi ble tran quil'li ty

el i ġi bil'i ty il lēg'i ble u na nỸmi ty
fu şi bằl'i ty in fin'i ty in com pat i bil'i ty
XI. Sound of u in unaccented final syllables.
In the pronunciation of words of two syllables ending
in -ture, -dure, or -sure, there is a slight difference in

XV. Miscellaneous Hints.
1. The article a is sounded in connection with the
word that follows it; as, “a book” is sounded as one
word of two syllables, thus—a-book'. Here the article
has the sound of long a, obscured and cut off suddenly.
It is not good usage to give it the sound of short u,
thus—ŭ-book’, or of ûr-book'.
2. Before a word beginning with a consonant the
article the, except when emphatic, is sounded as a syllable
of the word which it precedes, as the-book', pronounced
as a word of two syllables, accented on the last. In
such cases the obscured e sound in the is really repre-
sented by short i, rather than by short u; as, thị-book',
thì-horse', thy-school'. It is sometimes indicated thus-
th’-book', th’-horse'.
3. Before words beginning with a vowel, as the-air',
the-ice', e in the has the long sound, less obscured and
shortened than when the precedes a word beginning with
a consonant. The error in sounding the articles a and
the frequently arises from attempts to give their phonic
spelling independent of their connection with the words
that follow them. In order to sound the articles cor-
rectly, notice how they are pronounced, by persons of
good taste, in ordinary conversation.

SECTION III.
CONSONANT SOUNDS.
I. ARTICULATION.
1. Distinct articulation is essential to good reading
and speaking. “The first step towards becoming a good
elocutionist,” says Comstock, “is a correct articulation.
A public speaker, possessed of only a moderate voice,
if he articulates correctly, will be better understood, and
heard with greater pleasure, than one who vociferates
without judgment. The voice of the latter may indeed
extend to a considerable distance, but the sound is dis-
sipated in confusion. Of the former voice not the
smallest vibration is wasted; every stroke is perceived
at the utmost distance to which it reaches; and hence
it has often the appearance of penetrating even farther
than one which is loud, but badly articulated.”
2. “In just articulation,” says Austin, “the words are
not hurried over, nor precipitated syllable over syllable;
nor, as it were, melted together into a mass of confusion;
they are neither abridged, nor prolonged; nor swallowed,
nor forced, and, if I may so express myself, shot from
the mouth; they are not trailed nor drawled, nor let
slip out carelessly, so as to drop unfinished. They are
delivered out from the lips, as beautiful coins newly
issued from the mint, deeply and accurately impressed,
perfectly finished, neatly struck by the proper organs,
distinct, sharp, in due succession, and of due weight.”
3. The best way of training the organs of speech to
good articulation is by means of forcible phonic spelling
and by drill-exercises on the elementary sounds, partic-
ularly on subvocals and aspirates.
4. “Articulate utterance,” says Prof. Russell, “requires
a constant exercise of discrimination of the mind, and
of precision or accuracy in the movements of the organs

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
of speech. A correct articulation, however, is not be-
labored or artificial in its character. It results from the
intuitive and habitual action of a disciplined attention.
It is easy, fluent, and natural; but, like the skillful
execution of an accomplished musician, it gives forth
every sound, even in the most rapid passages, with truth
and correctness.
5. “A good enunciation gives to every vowel and
consonant its just proportion and character; none being
omitted, no one blending with another in such a manner
as to produce confusion, and none so carelessly executed
as to cause mistake in the hearer, by its resemblance
to another.
6. “A correct enunciation is the fundamental quality
of a distinct and impressive elocution. It is an attain-
ment of great value, for the ordinary purposes of
communication; but it becomes doubly important, in the
act of reading or speaking in public, whether we advert
to the larger space which must be traversed by the
voice, or the greater moment of the topics of discourse
which are usual on such occasions.
7. “The appropriate style of modern eloquence is that
of intellectual, more than of impassioned, expression;
and enunciation being, of all the functions of the voice,
that which is most important to the conveyance of
thought and meaning, it justly requires, in the course
of education, more attention and practice than any other
branch of elocution.”
II. CLASSIFICATION OF ELEMENTARY SOUNDS.
The elementary sounds are classified as follows:
1. Vocals, or tonics.
2. Subvocals, or subtonics.
3. Aspirates, or atonics.
Vocals, represented by vowels, are sounds consisting
of pure tone only.


## p. 37 (#43) ##############################################

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
31
Subvocals, represented by consonants, are sounds that
have tone, but are inferior to vocals in fullness. A
consonant can not be named without the aid of a vowel,
as b is named in the alphabet, be. Hence the term
consonant, sounded with.
Aspirates, represented by consonants, are sounds with-
out tone.
Letters are characters to represent articulate sounds.
III. DIACRITICAL MARKS OF CONSONANTS.
[As given in Webster's Dictionary.]
ç soft-çede, çent.
th sharp—thing, bath.
e hard—eall, lae.
th flat-Ehine, smooth.
ch unmarked—church. ng unmarked— sing, ring.
çh soft-chaise, chute. n-ink, link.
eh hard—chyle, ehyme. X = ks—box, fox.
ſ hard—ğum, log.
X=g2–exist, exalt.
ġ soft-gem, ĝin.
ph=—phlox, sylph.
ş soft =2–haş, hiş.
qu = kw—queen, queer.
s sharp=ç—sin, gas. wh=hw—when, why.
IV. DRILL LESSONS ON CONSONANT SOUNDS.
1. SUBVOCALS.
In concert drill-exercises on the following table, observe
the following directions :
1. Pronounce each word distinctly, and then give,
forcibly, the phonic spelling.
2. Repeat, forcibly, each subvocal and aspirate three
times, thus—b, b, b; d, d, d, etc.
3. After concert drill, require each pupil, in turn, to
give the sounds.
b.—bìb, bābe, bee, ebb, mob, rõb, sõb, eõb.
d.—dyd, dog, dčad, odd, dread, died, said, běd.

ORTHO E PY.
GOOD USAGE. The standard of correct pronunciation
is good usage. Good usage implies the pronunciation of
the educated and intellectual classes of society. The
standard of good usage is found in the dictionaries of
a language. In the United States, the standard dic-
tionaries are Webster's and Worcester's.
The standard of pronunciation is never absolutely un-
deviating. Custom, from time to time, changes the pro-
nunciation of words ; but the number of these changes
is not large. Whenever general good usage changes the
pronunciation or the spelling of a word, this change
soon finds its way into a new edition of the dictionary.
The dictionary, then, remains the standard of good usage.
There are a few hundred words in our language that
have two authorized pronunciations, either of which is
allowable.
AFFECTATIONS. All affectations in pronunciation should
be carefully avoided. The affectation of ei'ther and
nei'ther, for ēither and nēither, is a case in point.
Avoid in'quiry for in quiry. There is no better test
of culture, scholarship, and refinement, than a correct
pronunciation.
On this point, Prof. William Russell says: “Individual
opinion, when it is at variance with this important and
useful principle of accommodation, gives rise to eccen-
tricities, which neither the authority of profound learn-
ing, nor that of strict accuracy and system, can redeem
from the charge of pedantry.
"It is a matter of great importance to recognize the
rule of authorized custom, and neither yield to the in-
fluence of those errors which, through inadvertency, will
creep into occasional or local use; nor, on the other

hand, be induced to follow innovations or changes adopted
without sufficient sanction. A cultivated taste is always
perceptible in pronunciation, as in every other expression
of mind; and errors in pronouncing are unavoidably
associated with a deficiency in the rudiments of a good
education.”
PROVINCIALISMS. Provincialisms, or the peculiar pro-
nunciation prevailing in certain localities or sections of
our country, must be studiously corrected and avoided.
It is to this class of errors that teachers must carefully
direct their attention. The force of habit is so strong
that pupils continue to mispronounce words long after
they know the pronunciation to be incorrect.
Provincialisms most commonly consist of some varia-
tion or perversion of vowel sounds: as hălf for hälf,
călf for calf, lăugh for läugh, etc.; of tew for to, trew
for true, dew for do, yew for you; of grăss for grass,
ăsk for åsk, lăst for låst, etc.; of dawg or dorg for dog ;
of gỉt for gět, gŭt for gòt, etc.; of toon for tūne, noo
for new, dooty for dūty, etc. ; of op for úp, onder for
ŭnder; of skewl for school, rewl for rule.
Another class of these errors consists in misplacing
the accent of words; as, i'de a for i dē'a, ăd’ult for
a dult, reºcess for re cèss, eon vẽx for eõn vex,
ex tănt for èx'tant, in ter ěst'ing for în'ter est ing,
Yllus trate for il lisºtrate, roºbust for ro bằst, tirade
for tỉ rāde', ve hē'ment for vē’he ment.
In this connection, the following lines from Oliver
Wendell Holmes convey a valuable lesson :
1. A few brief stanzas may be well employed
To speak of errors we can all avoid.
Learning condemns beyond the reach of hope
The careless churl that speaks of soap for sõap:
Her edict exiles from her fair abode
The clownish voice that utters road for road,

Less stern to him who calls his coat a coat,
And steers his boat believing it a boat,
She pardoned one, our classic city's boast,
Who said, at Cambridge, most instead of most;
But knit her brows, and stamped her angry foot,
To hear a teacher call a root a root.
2. Once more: speak clearly, if you speak at all;
Carve every word before you let it fall;
Do n't, like a lecturer or dramatic star,
Try over hard to roll the British r;
Do put your accents in the proper spot;
Do n't-let me beg you—do n't say “How?” for “What?"
And, when you stick on conversation's burrs,
Do n't strew the pathway with those dreadful urs.
1. WORDS OFTEN MISPRONOUNCED.
[By misplacing the accent.]
The only variations from “Webster's Dictionary,” in
the following lists, include a few words in relation to
which it may be said that good usage is in advance of
the dictionary.
First, require pupils to pronounce the following words
in concert; then require each pupil, singly, in turn, to
pronounce five or more words.

PRINCIPLES IN ELOCUTION.
CHAPTER I.
EMPHASIS, PAUSES, AND INFLECTIONS.
SECTION 1.
EMPHASIS.
I. INTRODUCTORY.
1. Emphasis, as the term is used in its restricted sig-
nification, is the special force or energy of voice applied
to words in order to give prominence to leading ideas.
2. In its widest signification, however, emphasis is
used to include any means of distinguishing words,
phrases, or clauses, whether by means of force, or inflec-
tion, or stress, or quantity, or pauses.
3. A word may be made emphatic by an intense
whisper ; by a strong rising, falling, or circumflex slide ;
by prolonging vowel or liquid sounds; or by rhetorical
pauses.
4. As commonly used, however, emphasis relates to
the degree or intensity of force. But the stronger the
emphatic force, the longer are the slides, and the more
(57)

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
prolonged the vowel and the liquid sounds. It may here
be remarked that the liquid sounds capable of being
prolonged in emphasis are l, m, n, and r. The short
vowel sounds and the consonant sounds, with the ex-
ception of l, m, n, r, cannot be prolonged in emphasis.
5. “Every sentence,” says Prof. William Russell, “ con-
tains one or more words which are prominent, and
peculiarly important, in the expression of meaning.
These words are marked with a distinctive inflection;
those, in particular, which illustrate the reading of strong
emotion, or of antithesis.
6. “ The words which are pronounced with peculiar
inflection, are uttered with more force than the other
words in the same sentences. This special force is what
is called emphasis. Its use is to impress more strik-
ingly on the mind of the hearer the thought, or portion
of thought, embodied in the particular word or phrase
on which it is laid.
7. “It gives additional energy to important points
in expression, by causing sounds which are peculiarly
significant, to strike the ear with an appropriate and
distinguishing force. It possesses, in regard to the sense
of hearing, a similar advantage to that of relief,' or
prominence to the eye, in a well-executed picture, in
which the figures seem to stand out from the canvas.
8. “Emphasis, then, being the manner of pronouncing
the most significant words, its office is of the utmost
importance to an intelligible and impressive utterance.
It is the manner of uttering emphatic words which
decides the meaning of every sentence that is read or
spoken.
9. “A true emphasis conveys a sentiment clearly and
forcibly to the mind, and keeps the attention of an
audience in active sympathy with the thoughts of the
speaker; it gives full value and effect to all that he
utters, and secures a lasting impression on the memory."

II. FAULTS IN EMPHASIS.
In animated conversation, most persons emphasize
correctly because they know clearly what they wish to
express; but, in reading the long and involved sentences
of literary composition, the faults of untrained readers
are numerous.
1. Sometimes the emphasis is misplaced because the
reader does not clearly comprehend the sense of what
is read.
2. Sometimes the emphasis is applied at random, with-
out reference to prominent ideas.
3. Sometimes the untrained reader reads in a dull,
monotonous tone, without any emphasis whatever.
4. Not unfrequently the pupil overdoes the emphasis,
and reads in a jerky, dogmatic manner.
5. There is often a tendency to a regular recurrence
of emphasis, combined with the falling inflection, on
random words, particularly at the end of every line of
poetry, or of every alternate line, or at the end of every
phrase or clause.
III. GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EMPHASIS.
1. Words or groups of words that express leading
ideas are emphatic; those that express what is compar-
atively unimportant, or that merely repeat what has
been previously stated, are unemphatic.
2. Words expressing contrast of ideas are emphatic.
3. The subject and predicate of a sentence are, in
general, emphatic.
4. Articles, pronouns, and connectives are, in general,
unemphatic, though any part of speech may sometimes
become emphatic.
5. The emphatic words of a sentence are generally
the words most strongly marked by the rising, falling,
or circumflex inflection.

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
IV. DISTINCTION OF EMPHASIS.
Emphasis may be divided into two kinds, antithetic
or relative emphasis, and absolute emphasis.
Antithetic emphasis is applied to words that indicate
contrast of ideas : Absolute emphasis is used to show
the importance of a single word or to express feeling,
emotion, or passion.
The degree of emphasis to be applied to words may
be considered as slight, moderate, or strong.
V. EXAMPLES OF ANTITHETIC EMPHASIS.
1. He is not a friend but an ènemy.
2. Hě raised a mórtal to the skies.
She drew an àngel dòwn.
3. To bé or not to be—that is the question.
4. I come to bůry Cæsar, not to prăise him.
5. As for mé, give me liberty or give me dèath.
6. You cannot dó wrong without suffering wrong.
7. He that cannot béar a jest should not mdke one.
8. I said my fàther, not my mother.
9. Tálent is power ; táct is skill.
10. After the snów, the emerald leaves,
After the hárvest, golden sheaves.
11. He spoke for education, not agáinst it.
12. The clerk, in letting Scrooge's nephew but, had
let two other people an.
13. Put not your trust in money, but put your money
in trúst.
14. The noblest mind the best contentment has.
15. Be thou familiar, but by no means vàlgar.
16. Give every man thine éar, but few thy vdice.
17. Take each man's cénsure, but reserve thy jùdgment.

18. COMPENSATION.
Polárity, or action and réaction, we meet in every
part of nàture-in dárkness and light ; in héat and cold ;
in the ebb and flow of waters; in male and fèmale; in
the inspiration and expiration of plants and animals;
in the equation of quantity and quality in the fluids of
the animal body ; in the systole and diàstole of the heart ;
in the undulations of flúids and of sound ; in the cen-
trifugal and centrèpetal gravity; in electricity, gálvanism,
and chemical affinity. Superinduce magnetism at one end
of a needle, the opposite magnetism takes place at the
other end. If the south attrácts, the north repèls. To
empty hére, you must condense thère. An inevitable
dùalism bisects nature, so that each thing is a hálf and
suggests another thing to make it whole ; as, spírit, mdt-
ter; mán, wòman ; ódd, even ; súbjective, objective; in,
but ; upper, den ; mótion, rest ; 2/óa, utay.
All things are double, óne against another—tít for tat;
an eye for an eje; a tooth for a tooth ; blood for blood;
méasure for measure ; lóve for love. Give and it shall
be gàven you. He that wátereth shall be watered him-
self. What will you háve? quoth Gód; páy for it and
tàke it. Nothing venture, nothing hàve. Thou shalt be
paid exactly for what thou hast dòne, no more, no lèss.
Who doth not work shall not èat.
EMERSON.
VI. EXAMPLES OF ABSOLUTE EMPHASIS.
Absolute emphasis is applied to words according to
their importance in the sentence, or according to the
degree of emotion or passion to be expressed. When words
are repeated for the purpose of intensifying emotion,
each successive repetition is more forcibly emphasized.
1. It was a turkey! He never could have stood upon
his légs, thăt bírd. He would have snapped 'em short
òff in a minute, like sticks of sèaling-wax.

2. What is it that gentlemen wash? What would they

3. “Revènge ! rcvènge !” the Saxons cried.
4. Then rose the terrible cry of fire! fíre! fère !
5. We must fàght; I repeat it, sir, we must fight!
6. “To àrms! to drms ! to àrms !” they cry.
7. Happy, happy, háppy páir !
None but the bráve,
None but the bráve,
None but the bráve deserves the fàir!
8. CHRISTMAS CAROL.
“Why, bless my soul!” cried Fred, “who's thàt?”
“It's I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner,
Will you let me in, Fred ?”
Let him in! It is a mercy he did n't shake his drm
off. He was at home in five minutes. Nothing could
be heàrtier. His niece looked just the same. So did
Topper, when he came. So did the plump sister, when
shể cáme. So did every one when they cáme. Wonder-
ful párty, wặnderful games, wonderful unanimity, won-
derful hàppiness!
DICKENS.
9. GRANDMOTHER'S STORY OF BUNKER-HILL BATTLE.
Then we cried, “The troops are routed ! they are beat-
it can't be doubted !
God be thanked, the fight is over !"--Ah! the grim old
soldier's smile!
Tell us, TELL us why you look so ? (we could hardly
speak we shoòk so.)
“Are they béaten ? áre they béaten ? àre they beaten ?”
-“Wait awhile.”
And we shout, “At last they're dòne for; it's the barges
they have rùn for:
They are beaten! beaten! BEATEN'! and the battle 's
over now."

10. INDEPENDENCE.
But whatever may be oŭr fate, be assúred—be assured
that this declaration will stånd. It may cost treasure,
and it may cost blood ; but it will stànd, and it will
richly compensate for bòth. Through the thick gloom
of the présent, I see the brightness of the future, as the
sùn in hèaven. We shall make this a glòrious, an im-
mòrtal day. When we are in our gràves, our children
will honor it. They will celebrate it with thanksgiving,
with festivity, with bònfires, and illuminàtions. On its
annual retúrn, they will shed tears, còpious, gùshing tears ;
not of subjection and slávery, not of ágony and distréss,
but of exultàtion, of gràtitude, and of joy.
My judgment approves this measure, and my whole
heàrt is in it. All that I hdve, and all that I am, and
all that I hòpe in this life, I am now ready here to
stàke upon it; and I leave off as I began, that, live or
die, survive or pèrish, I am for the declaration.
WEBSTER.
11. UNCLE TOBY.
“In a fortnight or three weeks,” said my uncle Toby,
smiling, “he might màrch.” “He will never march, an'
please your honor, in this world,” said the corporal.
“He will march,” said my uncle Tóby, rising up with
one shoe off. “An' please your honor,” said the corporal,
"he will never march but to his grăve.” “He shall
march,” cried my uncle Toby; "he shall march to his
régiment.” “He can not stand it,” said the corporal.
“He shall be suppôrted," said my uncle Toby. “Ah,
well-a-day, do what we can for him," said Trim, main-
taining his point, “the poor soul will die.” “He shall
nôt,” shouted my uncle Toby, with an oath. The Accus-
ing Spirit which flew up to heaven's chancery, blushed
as he gave it in, and the Recording Angel, as he wrote
it down, dropped a tear upon the word and blotted it
out forever.

coy emphasic equired by thy punctua
PAUSES.
1. The pauses made in reading or speaking may be
classed as grammatical, rhetorical, and emphatic or emo-
tional.
2. Grammatical pauses are those indicated by punctua-
tion; rhetorical pauses are those required by the structure
of the sentence, or by emphasis; and emphatic pauses,
those expressive of deep feeling or passion.
3. These pauses may be relatively long, moderate, or
short, according to the general style of expression ap-
propriate to what is read; but without due attention
to them, it is impossible properly to emphasize prose,
or to express the melody of verse.
4. Concerning pauses, Prof. Russell says: “The ces-
sation of the voice at proper intervals has the same
effect, nearly, on clauses and sentences with that of
articulation on syllables, or of pronunciation on words :
it serves to gather up the sounds of the voice into rela-
tive portions, and aids in preserving clearness and dis-
tinction among them. But what those elementary and
organic efforts do for syllables and words—the minor
portions of speech-pausing does for clauses, sentences,
and entire discourses.
5. “The great use of pauses is to divide thought into
its constituent portions, and to leave the mind oppor-
tunity of contemplating each distinctly, so as fully to
comprehend and appreciate it, and, at the same time, to
perceive its relation to the whole. Appropriate pauses
are of vast importance, therefore, to a correct and im-
pressive style of delivery; and without them, indeed,
speech cannot be intelligible.
6. “Pausing has, further, a distinct office to perform
in regard to the effect of feeling as conveyed by utter-
ance. Awe and solemnity are expressed by long cessa-

tions of the voice; and grief, when it is deep, and at
the same time suppressed, requires frequent and long
pauses.
7. “The general effect, however, of correct and well-
timed pauses, is what most requires attention. The
manner of a good reader or speaker is distinguished, in
this particular, by clearness, impressiveness, and dignity
arising from the full conception of meaning, and the
deliberate and distinct expression of it; while nothing
is so indicative of want of attention and of self-com-
mand, and nothing is so unhappy in its effect, as haste
and confusion.”
I. GRAMMATICAL PAUSES.
Grammatical pauses, or the pauses indicated by punc-
tuation, have no fixed length. They depend, to some
extent, on the character of the piece to be read. When
the general movement or rate is slow, the pauses are
relatively long ; when the movement is fast, the pauses
are relatively short. The general principles that govern
grammatical pauses may be stated as follows:
1. In general, a slight pause at a comma ; a longer
pause at a semicolon ; and a still longer pause at a period.
2. A full pause, longer than at a period, is required
at the end of a paragraph of prose, or of a stanza of
poetry.
This pause is made to enable the hearer to note the
subdivisions of a piece, and to afford the reader time
for a slight rest.
II. RHETORICAL PAUSES.
1. Rhetorical pauses are pauses not indicated by punc-
tuation, but which are made in reading, generally for
the purpose of emphasis or expression. Attention to
these pauses is absolutely essential to good reading.
2. The general tendency of pupils to read too fast is

owing, in no small degree, to a neglect of the pauses
necessary to effective utterance. Both the hearer and
the reader must have time to think. These pauses, too,
afford the reader time to renew the breath, and thus
keep the lungs well supplied with air.
3. A continuous stream of rapid utterance soon wea-
ries the hearer, because the speaker neither takes time
to think, nor allows his hearers time to do so. The
trained extemporaneous speaker talks with deliberation,
and the trained reader reads in the same manner.
4. We read words by groups, not by disconnected
units. The beginner laboriously calls out each word of
a sentence independently, with a pause after each word,
thus:
“The | black | cat | caught | a | big | rat | in the 1
barn."
A good reader will read this sentence in groups, as
indicated by the hyphenized words, thus:
“The-black-cat | caught-a-big-rat | in-the-barn.”
5. Pupils, whose attention is directed to the manner
in which they run words together in speaking and read-
ing, with pauses between the groups, will notice that
adjectives are grouped with the nouns which they mod-
ify; adverbs, with verbs or adjectives or other adverbs;
prepositions, with their objects; pronouns, with the words
they modify; and auxiliaries, with their principal verbs
-in other words, that we speak in phrases and clauses.
6. They will notice, further, that when the subject of
a verb is a noun, or when it is modified by a phrase
or a clause, there is a rhetorical pause between the sub-
ject and the predicate.
A COMMON FAULT.
7. “The common fault in regard to pauses,” says
Prof. Russell, “is that they are made too short for
clear and distinct expression.

8. “Feeble utterance and defective emphasis, along
with rapid articulation, usually combine to produce this
fault in young readers and speakers. For, whatever
force of utterance or energy of emphasis, or whatever
rate of articulation we accustom ourselves to use, our
pauses are always in proportion to it.
9. “Undue brevity in pausing has a like bad effect
with too rapid articulation : it produces obscurity and
confusion in speech, or imparts sentiment in a manner
which is deficient and unimpressive, and prevents the
proper effect both of thought and language.
10. “To be fully convinced how much of the clear-
ness, force, and dignity of style depends on due pauses,
we have only to revert for a moment to the effect of
rapid reading on a passage of Milton, and observe what
an utter subversion of the characteristic sublimity of the
author seems to take place. This instance is, no doubt,
a strong and peculiar one. But a similar result, though
less striking, may be traced in the hurried reading of any
piece of composition characterized by force of thought
or dignity of expression.
11. “When habitual rapidity of voice, and omission
of pauses, are difficult to correct, the learner may be
required to accompany the teacher's voice in the practice
of sentences. This simultaneous reading, if sufficiently
long continued, will probably prove effectual for the
cure of habitual faults. A second stage of progress
may be entered on, when the learner's improvement will
warrant it; and he may be permitted to read after the
teacher.
12. “Pupils who possess an ear for music, may be
taught to observe that there is in reading and speaking
a 'time,' as distinct and perceptible, and as important,
as in singing, or in performing on any instrument; and
that pauses are uniformly measured with reference to
this time.”

DRILL EXERCISES.
13. The careful study of a few selections for the pur-
pose of marking pauses, emphasis, and inflection, is also
an excellent exercise in parsing and analysis. This
method is a slow one, but it will lead to thoughtful,
careful, and expressive reading.
14. For the purpose of aiding pupils to gain a clear
comprehension of this subject, general principles are
applied under a number of definite rules, which are
illustrated by copious examples. The value of thorough
drill on these examples cannot be overestimated.
15. If any teachers object to formal rules, the follow-
ing remarks of Prof. Russell are commended to their
attention:
16. “Persons, even, who admit the use of rules on other
subjects, contend, that, in reading and speaking, no rules
are necessary; that a correct ear is a sufficient guide,
and the only safe one. If, by a 'correct ear,' be meant
a vague exercise of feeling or of taste, unfounded on a
principle, the guidance will prove to be that of conjec-
ture, fancy, or whim. But if, by a 'correct ear,' be
meant an intuitive exercise of judgment or of taste,
consciously or unconsciously recognizing a principle,
then is there virtually implied a latent rule; and the
instructor's express office, is, to aid his pupil in detect-
ing, applying, and retaining that rule.
17. “Systematic rules are not arbitrary; they are
founded on observation and experience. No one who is
not ignorant of their meaning and application, will ob-
ject to them, merely because they are systematic, well
defined, and easily understood : every reflective student
of any art, prefers systematic knowledge to conjectural
judgment, and seizes with avidity on a principle, be-
cause he knows that it involves those rules which are
the guides of practice.”

posts; whose morning drum-beat, following the sun in
his course, and keeping pace with the hours, daily circles
the earth | with one continuous and unbroken strain |
of the martial airs of England.

With golden architrave.

V.
RECAPITULATION OF PAUSES.
1. In general, a rhetorical pause should be made between
the subject and the predicate, when the subject is emphatic,
or when it consists of a phrase, a clause, or a noun mod-
ified by a phrase or a clause.
2. A rhetorical pause should be made whenever the
regular order of a sentence is broken by the inversion of
words, phrases, or clauses.
3. An emphatic pause occurs before any word that is
very strongly emphatic, or to which the reader or speaker
desires to call marked attention.

SECTION III.
INFLECTION.
I. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.
1. In all good speaking or reading, there must be
ever-varying upward and downward slides of the voice.
Inflection is a means, not only of expressing emotion,
passion, and emphasis, but, also, of conveying the finer
distinctions and contrasts of ideas, and the more delicate
shades of feeling and sentiment.
2. Inflection forms an important element of emphasis :
for emphasis consists, not only in force, but also in the
slides and in quantity.
3. Reading, when it lacks the melody of varied em-
phasis and inflection, becomes like the monotonous
droning of children who laboriously pronounce the suc-
cessive words of their reading lesson in the conven-
tional school tone.
4. In animated conversation, and in the reading of
simple stories, the inflections take care of themselves
without thought by the speaker or reader; but in the
long and often inverted sentences of finished prose or
poetry, involving a higher and more complicated order
of thought, the proper application of emphasis and
inflection requires some knowledge of the principles of
elocution.
5. While it is true that a clear conception of the
spirit and meaning by the reader is essential to good
reading, it is equally true that, having the right con-
ception, the reader may fail to convey it to the hearer,
from ignorance of the principles that govern the correct
expression of thought and feeling.
6. Good reading, like fine singing, is the result of
systematic training—is the product of culture and art.
There are good natural voices both for singing and


## p. 76 (#82) ##############################################

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
reading, but a fine singer, without training in the science
and art of music, is as rare as is a good reader of gen-
eral English literature, who is ignorant of the principles
of elocution, and untrained in the management of the
voice.
7. The real object of school elocution is, not to enable
pupils to read by imitation a few selected pieces in the
style of an actor, but to make thoughtful and intelli-
gent readers independent of the assistance of teachers.
8. One reason for the full treatment of inflection in
this book is the great importance of the subject as a
means of expressive and impressive reading.
9. Another reason is the cursory manner in which
the few introductory rules and illustrations are taken
up in the grammar School Teachers of high schools
and normal schools are aware of the fact that many of
their pupils come into school not only ignorant of the
principles of inflection, but also so untrained in the
management of the voice that they cannot give the
correct inflections even when indicated, and sometimes
cannot even innitate them when given by the teacher.
10. It is not unreasonable to expect that, in high and
normal schools, there should be training enough to
enable students themselves to apply the general prin-
ciples of elocution; and that there should be practice
enough to secure some flexibility in the management of
the voice.
11. Expression in reading depends largely on the vari-
ety produced by the proper and effective application of
the slides. There is no excuse for the neglect that leads
to the monotonous and lifeless style of reading charac-
teristic of many high schools and colleges.
“This school-tone,” says Prof. Russell, “can be tol-
erated only in a law paper, a state document, a bill of
lading, or an invoice, in the reading of which the mere
distinct enunciation of the words is deemed sufficient.


## p. 77 (#83) ##############################################

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
77
In other circumstances, it kills, with inevitable certainty,
everything like feeling or expression.”
12. The careful study of an extract from some stand-
ard author, for the purpose of marking it for inflection,
emphasis, and pauses, is an intellectual discipline of no
mean order. It combines, in one lesson, rhetoric, gram-
mar, and elocution.
13. It matters little whether aspiring elocutionists can
or can not render effectively such pieces as “The Raven,"
“The Bells,” or “ Catiline's Defiance”; but it is a mat-
ter of solid importance for them to be able to read
intelligently and effectively such extracts as Macaulay's
“Puritans,” Bryant's “Winds,” Byron's “ Apostrophe
to the Ocean," one of Webster's “Speeches,” or an ex-
tract from Milton or Shakespeare. The trained reader
is able not only to read well, but also to give good
reasons for reading with good taste, discrimination, and
judgment.
14. As an aid both to teachers and pupils in apply-
ing principles and rules, a considerable number of
extracts and examples are marked for inflection, em-
phasis, and pauses. When these have been carefully
studied and read, pupils ought to be able to apply, to
some extent at least, principles and rules to unmarked
extracts, thus becoming independent of imitation and
of teachers.
II. DISTINCTIONS OF INFLECTION.
1. Inflection may be defined as an upward or down-
ward slide of the voice, generally on the emphatic word
or words of a sentence. In words of more than one
syllable, the inflection falls chiefly on the vowel of the
accented syllable; hence the mark of inflection is placed
over the vowel in the accented syllable.
2. The rising inflection, indicated by the acute accent


## p. 78 (#84) ##############################################

78
SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
( ), is used in direct questions, and, in general, when-
ever the sense is incomplete.
3. The falling inflection, indicated by the grave accent
( ), is used in complete declarative, exclamatory, or very
emphatic statements, and, in general, wherever the sense
is complete, or does not depend on something to follow.
4. The circumflex, a combination of the rising and
falling inflections on the same sound or word, indicated
thus ( or ^), is used in surprise, sarcasm, irony, wit,
humor, and in expressing a pun, or a double meaning.
The rising circumflex is used in place of the direct ris-
ing inflection to add force to the emphasis, and the
falling circumflex in place of the direct falling inflec-
tion.
5. The monotone (- -), that is, one uniform tone, is
merely the absence of any marked rising or falling slide
above or below the general level of the sentence.
III. LENGTH OF SLIDES.
1. The length of the rising or the falling inflection,
in ascending or descending the scale, depends on the
force of emphasis applied to words marked by inflection.
2. The degrees of inflection may be roughly distin-
guished as corresponding to the second, third, fifth, and
eighth notes in the musical scale, including the semi-
tones, or chromatic notes, of the minor second, third,
fifth, and eighth notes.
3. The “second” and “third” are classed as the un-
emotional slides, as contrasted with the “fifth” and
“eighth,” which are the emotional inflections.
IV. THE SLIDE OF THE SECOND.
1. The inflection of the second 'is a very slight up.
ward or downward slide of the voice, expressing what


## p. 79 (#85) ##############################################

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
may be termed the current melody of the sentence, in
quiet conversation and in unemotional reading. It is
the distance in tone between C and D, or Do and Re
on the scale in music.
2. “ The simple rise and fall of the second, and per-
haps its wave,” says Dr. Rush, “when used for plain
narration, or for the mere statement of an unexcited
idea, is the only intonated voice of man that does not
spring from a passionate, or, in some degree, an earnest
condition of his mind. If we listen to his ignorance,
doubt, selfishness, arrogance, and injustice, we hear the
vivid forms of vocal expression, proceeding from these
and related passions.
3. “Thus we have the rising intervals of the fifth and
octave, for interrogatives, not of wisdom but of envious
curiosity; the downward third, fifth, and octave, for dog-
matic or tyrannical command; waves for the surprise
of ignorance, the snarling of ill-humor, and the curling
voice, along with the curling lip of contempt; the pierc-
ing height of pitch for the scream of terror; the semi-
tone, for the peevish whine of discontent, and for the
puling cant of the hypocrite and the knave, who cover
beneath the voice of kindness, the designs of their craft.
4. “Then listen to him on those rare occasions, when
he forgets himself and his passions, and has to utter a
simple idea, or plainly to narrate; and you will hear
the second, the least obtrusive interval of the scale,
in the admirable harmony of Nature, made the simple
sign of the unexcited sentiment of her wisdom and
truth.”
V. INFLECTION DRILL ON THE SECOND.
1. Count, in a gentle tone, from one to twenty, with
the slight rising inflection, thus~óne, two, three, four, etc.
2. Count from one to twenty with the slight falling
inflection, thus—òne, twò, etc.


## p. 80 (#86) ##############################################

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
3. Count with alternate rising and falling, thus-one,
two, thrée, four, etc., to thirty.
4. Sound the long vocals, ā, ē, ī, ā, ū: (1) With the
rising second. (2) With the falling second. (3) Alter-
nate rising and falling.
VI. THE SLIDE OF THE THIRD.
1. The slide of the third corresponds to the interval,
on the scale, between C and E, or Do and Mi.
2. When the voice rises on a word through an inter-
val of two tones, or a major third, it expresses moderate
emphasis, interrogation, contrast, or slight surprise; when
the voice falls through the same interval, it expresses
moderate emphasis, assertion, command, contrast, or the
conclusion of a proposition.
3. The inflection of the third is the prevailing slide
of animated and earnest conversation, and of the slightly
emphatic words of narrative, didactic, or descriptive com-
position. It is the slide of antithesis in contrasted words.
VII. UNEMOTIONAL SLIDES.
The slides of the second and third are the senten-
tial or unemotional inflections as contrasted with the
fifth and the eighth, which are the slides of emotion and
passion.
VIII. INFLECTION DRILL ON THE THIRD.
1. Count, with moderate force and emphasis, from one
to twenty with the rising third, thus: one, two, thrée, etc.
2. Count from one to twenty with the falling third,
thus : òne, two, three, etc.
3. Count with alternate rising and falling third, thus :
óne, two, three, four, etc.
4. Will you go or stdy ?

IX. THE SLIDES OF THE FIFTH AND THE EIGHTH.
1. The slide of the fifth corresponds to the interval
between C and G, or Do and Sol, and the slide of the
eighth, or the octave, to the interval between C and
C, or Do and Do.
2. When the voice rises through the interval of the fifth,
it expresses impassioned interrogation, extreme surprise,
or strong negation; when it falls through the same in-
terval, it expresses deep conviction, strong determination,
emphatic declaration, stern command, or strong emotion.
3. Under the influence of intense excitement or pas-
sion, the voice sometimes rises or falls through the
whole octave. The rising octave expresses amazement,
astonishment, excited interrogation, intense irony, and
the falling octave expresses fierce determination, impas-
sioned scorn, imprecation, and defiance.
4. Thus, when Douglas cries out under the influence
of intense anger-
“And darst thou then
To beard the lion in his dén,
The Douglas in his háll ?”
The voice on “hall” rises through the whole octave. And
when Coriolanus cries out: “Measureless liar," the voice
on "measureless” falls through the octave.
5. The words “ áh! indeed !” uttered so as to express
the greatest possible degree of astonishment, illustrate
the rising octave.
X. INFLECTION DRILL.
1. Sound the long vocals, ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, with the rising
fifth; the falling fifth.
2.: Sound the long vocals, ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, with the rising
eighth ; with the falling octave.
3. Count from one to twenty with the rising fifth ;
the falling fifth.

I. THE RISING INFLECTION.
1. The rising inflection calls attention to what is to
follow. It is the inflection of incomplete statement, of
appeal, of inquiry, and of negative antithesis.
2. It is the prevailing inflection of sentiment, of tender-
ness, and of pathos.
3. It is the characteristic inflection used in stating
what is comparatively unimportant, trite, questionable,
doubtful, or parenthetical.
PAAN
RULES FOR THE RISING INFLECTION.
Rule 1. Questions requiring YES or No for an answer
have the rising inflection, except when very emphatic.
EXAMPLES
[Rising Third.—Light Emphasis.]
1. Have you recited your léssons ?
2. Is it, 0 mán, with such discordant nóises,
With such accurséd instruments as thése,
Thou drownest Nature's sweet and kindly voices,
And jarrest the celestial harmonies ?
3. Breathes there the man with soul so dead,
Who never to himself hath said,
This is my own, my native land?
Whose heart hath ne'er within him búrned,
As home his footsteps he hath túrned,
From wandering on a foreign stránd ?
[Fifth and Eighth.–Strong Emphasis.]
4. Hates ăny man the thing he would not kill ?
5. Whăt! wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee
twice?
6. And dar’st thou then
To beard the líon in his den,
The Douglas in his håll ?

Thou dar’st not call thyself his footprint
8. Is it come to this ? Shall an inferior mágistrate,
a governor, who holds his whole power of the Roman
people, in a Roman province, within sight of Italy,
bind, scoúrge, torture, and put to an infamous déath, a
Roman citizen ? Shall neither the cries of innocence
expiring in ágony, the tears of pitying spectátors, the
majesty of the Roman Commonwealth, nor fear of the
justice of his country, restrain the merciless monster,
who, in the confidence of his riches, strikes at the very
root of líberty, and sets mankind at defiance? And
shall this man escápe ? Fathers, it must not bè! It
must not bè, unless you would undermine the very
foundations of social safety, strangle jùstice, and call
down à narchy, mássacre, and rùin on the Common-
wealth !
CICERO.
9. Canst thou bind the únicorn with his band in the
fúrrow ? or will he harrow the válleys after thee? Wilt
thou trúst him because his strength is great ? or wilt
thou leave thy lábor to him ?
Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks ? or
wings and feathers unto the óstrich ? Canst thou draw
out leviathan with a hook ? or his tongue with a córd
which thou lettest dówn ? Canst thou put a hóok into
his nose ? or bore his jów through with a thórn? Wilt
thou pláy with him as with a bird ? or wilt thou bind
him for thy máidens ? Canst thou fill his skin with
barbed irons ? or his héad with fish spears ? Book of Job.
Rule II. Words repeated in surprise take the rising

SHAKESPEARE.
For heaven's sake, Hubert, let me not be boúnd ;
Náy, hear me, Hubert; drive but these màu cao,
And I will sit as quiet as a lùmb;
I will not stír, nor wince, nor speak a word,
Nor look upon the iron ángerly:
Thrust but these men awúy, and I'll forgive you,
Whatever torment you do pùt me to.
2. MRS. CAUDLE'S CURTAIN LECTURES.
1.
Now, Caudle, déar, do let us talk comfortably. After
all, love, there's a good many folks who, I dare say,
don't get on half so well as we've done. We've both
our little témpers, perhaps; but you are aggravating ;
you must own thăt, Caúdle. Well, never mind; we won't
talk of it; I won't scold you now.
11.
I'm sure I do n't object to your being a Măson ; not
at ăll, Cáudle. I dare say it's a very good thing; I dare
say it is : it's only your making a secret of it that věxes
mé. But you 'll těll me—you 'll tell your own Mărgaret ?
You won't? You're a wretch, Mr. Candle. HARROLD.
Rule V. Negative expressions, whether of words, phrases,
clauses, or sentences, take the rising inflection when they
carry the attention forward to a contrasted affirmation,
np backward to an affirmative statement.
EXAMPLES
1. I come not here to tálk.
Ye know too well the story of our thràlldom.
2. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone.
It is to the vigilant, the active, the bràve.
3. Tell me not, in mournful númbers,

For the soul is deàd that slúmbers,
And things are not what they seem.

Cleon dwelleth in a pàlace—in a cottage, l’;

But the poorer of the twain is Clèon, and not I'.
6. FREEDOM.
O Freedom ! thou art not, as poets dream,
A fair young girl, with light and delicate limbs,
And wavy tresses gushing from the cap
With which the Roman master crowned his slúve,
When he took off the gýves. A bearded màn,
Armed to the tèeth, art thòu.
BRYANT.
7. THE OCEAN.
The armaments which thunderstrike the walls
Of rock-built cities, bidding nations quake,
And monarchs | tremble in their cápitals,
The oak leviathans, whose huge ribs make
Their clay creator | the vain title | take |
Of lord of thee, and arbiter of war;
Thése, are thy toys, and as the snowy flàke
They melt into thy yeast of waves, which mar |
Alike | the Armada's príde | or spoils of Trafalgàr.

8. LIBERTY.
Tell me not of the honor of belonging to a free
country. I ask, does our liberty bear generous fruits !
Does it exalt us in manly spirit, in public vàrtue, above
countries trodden under foot by dèspotism ?—Tell me
pot of the extent of our country. I care not how lárge
it is, if it multiply degenerate mén. Speak not of
our prospérity. Better be one of a poor people, plain
in mánners, reverencing Gód, and respecting themselves,

CHANNING.
9. WHAT CONSTITUTES A STATE !
What constitutes a Státe ?
Not high-raised báttlement or labored mound,
Thick wall or moated gáte ;
Not cities proud with spíres and turrets crowned.
Not báys and broad-armed pórts,
Where, laughing at the storm, rich návies ride :
Not starred and spangled courts
Where low-bred baseness wafts perfume to príde :
Nò; mèn, high-minded mén; men, who their duties know;
But know their rìghts; and knowing, dare maintain ;
Prevent the long-aimed blow,
And crush the týrant while they rend the chàin.
Thèse constitute a State.
JONES.
Call on pupils to find additional examples.
Rule VI. Incomplete expressions, whether of phrases or
clauses, when they carry the mind forward to something to
be stated, require the rising inflection.
EXAMPLES.
1. Born to inherit the most illustrious monarchy in
the world, and early united to the object of her chóice,
the amiable princess, happy in herself, and joyful in
her future prospects, little anticipated the fate that was
so soon to overtàke her.
2. THE PILGRIM FATHERS.
And yet, do you not think, that who so could, by
adequate description, bring before you that winter of the
Pílgrims, its brief súnshine, the nights of stórm, slow
wáning; the damp and icy bréath, felt to the pillow of
the dying; its destitutions, its contrasts with all their
former expérience in life; its utter insulátion and loneli-
ness; its deáth-beds and búrials; its mémories; its ap-

prehénsions; its hópes; the consultations of the prúdent ;
the prayers of the pious; the occasional cheerful hymn,
in which the strong heart threw off its búrthen, and,
asserting its unvanquished náture, went úp, like a bird
of dáwn, to the skies ;—do ye not think that whoso
could describe them calmly waiting in that defile, lonelier
and darker than Thermopylae, for a morning that might
never dáwn, or might show them, when it did, a mightier
arm than the Persian, raised as in act to strike, would
he not sketch a scene of more difficult and rarer héro-
ism? A scéne, as Wordsworth has said, “mélancholy,
yea, dismal, yet consolatory and full of joy ;” a scéne,
even better fitted, to súccor, to exált, to léad, the for-
lorn hopes of all great causes, till tíme shall be no more.
СноАТЕ.
3. THE STRIFE.
Notice that the last four stanzas constitute one sentence.
The wish that of the living whole
No life may fáil beyond the gráve
Derives it not from what we have
The likest Gód within the soul ?
Are God and náture then at strife,
That náture lends such evil dréams ?
So careful of the type she seems,
So cáreless of the single life,
That I, considering everywhere
Her secret meaning in her deeds,
And finding that of fifty seeds
She often brings but one to béar-
I fálter where I firmly tród;
And, falling with my weight of cares
Upon the great world's últar-stairs,
That slope through darkness up to God,

I stretch lame hands of fàith, and grope,
And gather dust and chúff, and call
To what I feel is Lord of all,
And faintly trust the larger hope.
TENNYSON's In Memoriam.
4. THE LADDER OF ST. AUGUSTINE.
The low desire, the base design,
That makes another's virtues léss;
The revel of the treacherous wine,
And all occasions of excess;
The longing for ignoble things,
The strife for triumph more than truth ;
The hardening of the heart that brings
Irreverence for the dreams of yoúth ;
All thoughts of ill; all evil deeds
That have their root in thoughts of ill;
Whatever hinders or impedes
The action of the noble will,
All these must first be trampled down
Beneath our feet, if we would gáin
In the bright fields of fair renówn,
The right of eminent domain.
LONGFELLOW.
Rule VII. Conditional phrases and clauses, when in-
troductory, take the rising inflection, because the sense is
carried forward to the principal statements on which they
depend.
EXAMPLES.
1. FROM "THE ARMORY.”
Were half the power that fills the world with térror;
Were half the wealth, bestowed on camps and courts,
Given to redeem the human mind from érror,
There were no need of arsenals or fòrts. LONGFELLOW.

2. FROM “JULIUS CÆSAR."
As Cæsar lóved me, I wèep for him; as he was fórtu.
nate, I rejoice at it; as he was váliant, I hònor him ; but,
as he was ambitious, I slèw him. There is tears for his
lóve; joy for his fórtune; honor for his válor; and
death for his ambition.
3. WATER.
Of all inorganic súbstances, acting in their own proper
náture, and without assistance or combination, wáter is
the most wonderful. If we think of it as the source of
all the changefulness and beauty which we have seen
in clouds; then as the instrument by which the earth
we have contemplated was modeled into symmetry, and
its crags chiseled into gráce; then, as in the form of
snów, it robes the mountains it has máde with that
transcendent light which we could not have conceived if
we had not seen; then as it exists in the foam of the
tórrent–in the íris which spáns it, in the morning mist
which ríses from it, in the deep crystalline pools which
mirror its hanging shóre, in the broad lake and glancing
river ; finally, in that which is to all human minds the
best emblem of unwéaried, unconquerable power, the wild,
várious, fantástic, támeless unity of the séa ; what shall
we compàre to this màghty, this universal element, for
glóry and for beaùty ? or how shall we follow its eternal
chángefulness of fèeling? It is like trying to paint a
soul.
4. FROM WEBSTER'S SPEECHES.

and blind ambition shall hówk at and tear it; if folly
and mádness, if uneasiness under salutary restrúint, shall
succeed to separate it from that Union, by which alone
its existence is made súre, it will stand, in the end, by
the side of that cradle in which its infancy was rocked ;
it will stretch forth its árm with whatever of vigor it
may still retáin, over the friends who gather round it;
and it will fäll, if fall it mást, amid the proudest mòn-
uments of its glóry and on the very spòt of its òrigin.
Require cach pupil, at the next lesson, to read one additional illus-
tration, selected from some extract in this book.
Rule VIII. In poetic description, whether of prose or
verse, the prevailing inflection is the slight rising inflection
of the “ third.”
EXAMPLES
1. FROM WHittier’s “RANGER.”
Nowhere fáirer, sweeter, rárer,
Does the golden-locked frúit-bearer,
Through his painted woodlands stráy,
Than where hillside oaks and beeches
Overlook the long, blue réaches,
Silver cóves and pebbled beaches,
And green isles of Casco Bày:
Nowhere dáy, for delay,
With a tenderer look beseeches,
“Let me with my charmed earth stay."
. 2. WATER.
Gleaming in the déw-drop, singing in the summer ráin,
shining in the ice-gem till the trees seem turned to
living jewels, spreading a golden véil over the setting
· sún, or a white gauze around the midnight moon; sport-
ing in the cataract, sleeping in the glacier, dancing in
the háil-shower, folding bright snów-curtains softly above
the wintry world, and weaving the many-colored íris,

that seraph's zone of the sky, whose warp is the rain
of earth, whose woof is the sunbeam of heaven, all
checkered over with celestial flowers by the mystic hand
of rarefáction—still always it is beaùtiful, that blessed
cold water! No poison bubbles on its brink—its foam
brings not mádness and murder—no blood stains its liquid
gláss—pale widows and starving orphans weep not burn-
ing tears in its clear dépths—no drunkard's shrieking
ghost from the gráve curses it in words of despàir !
Speak out, my friends; would you exchange it for the
demon's drink-álcohol ?
A shout like the roar of the tempest answered “NÒ!
No'!”
3. THE VOICE OF SPRING.
The fisher is out on the sunny séa;
And the reindeer bounds o’er the pasture frée ;
And the pine has a fringe of softer green,
And the moss looks bright, where my fòot hath been.
From the streams and founts I have loosed the cháin.
They are sweeping on to the silvery máin,
They are flashing down from the mountain brows,
They are flinging spray o'er the forest boughs,
They are bursting fresh from their sparry cáves;
And the earth resounds with the joy of waves.
DENTON.
HEMANS.
Rule IX. Pathos and tender feeling incline the voice
to the slight rising inflection.
EXAMPLES.
1. BABIE BELL.
And what did dainty Babie Bell ?
She only crossed her little hánds !
She only looked more meek and fáir !
We parted back her silken háir;
We laid some buds upon her brów-
Death's bride arrayed in flowers ! Aldrich.

THE RANGER.
When the shadows vail the meadows,
And the sunset's golden ladders
Sink from twilight's walls of gray-
From the window of my dreaming,
I can see his sickle gléaming,
Cheery-voiced can hear him téaming
Down the locust-shaded wáy ;
But away, swift away,
Fades the fond, delusive seéming,
And I kneel again to prày.
WHITTIER.
Rule X. In a series of words or phrases, if the par-
ticulars enumerated are unimportant, or if they are to be
taken as constituting a whole, each particular, except the
last in a closing series, takes the rising inflection.
EXAMPLES.
1. The sún, the planets, their sátellites, the comets,
and the méteors, compose the solar system.
2. The solar system consists of the sún, the planets,
their sátellites, the comets, and the meteors.
3. The minerals of California are gold, silver, copper,

4. Whéat, flóur, pórk, beef, cotton, tobacco, and petró-

8. FROM DICKENS's “CHRISTMAS CAROL.”
It was a game called Yes and No, where Scrooge's
nephew had to think of something, and the rest must
find out what; he only answering to their questions yes
or no, as the case was. The fire of questioning to
which he was exposed elicited from him that he was
thinking of an ánimal, a líve animal, rather a disagrée-
able animal, a sávage animal, an animal that growled and
grúnted sometimes, and tálked sometimes, and lived in
London, and walked about the streets, and was n't made
a show of, and was n’t léd by anybody, and did n't live
in a menágerie, and was never killed in a márket, and
was not a hórse, or an áss, or a ców, or a búll, or a
tíger, or a dóg, or a píg, or a cát, or a bedr.

head) upon the hob. Nobody under the bed ; nobody

hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall.

II. THE FALLING INFLECTION.
1. The falling inflection is the slide of the complete
statement.
2. It is the characteristic inflection of assertion, of
confidence, of command, of emotion, and of passion.
3. It denotes what is important, interesting, or decisive.
It is the prevailing inflection of impressive oratory.
RULES FOR THE FALLING INFLECTION.
Rule 1. The close of a declarative, imperative, or ex-
clamatory sentence is generally marked by the falling
inflection.
EXAMPLES.
1. The liberty of the press is the highest safeguard
to all free government. It is like a great, exúlting, and
abóunding river.
2. Maud Muller, on a summer's dáy,
Raked the meadow sweet with hày.
3. Ye crágs and peaks, I'm with you once agdin !
I hold to you the hands you first beheld,
To show they still are free. Methinks I hear
A spirit in your echoes answer me,
And bid your tenant welcome to his hòme
Again! O sacred fórmıs, how proùd ye look!
How hàgh you lift your heads into the skỳ!
How hùge you are! how mighty and how frèe !
generally
Rule II. The answer to a direct question
takes the falling inflection.
EXAMPLES.
1. Are you going to school ? Yes, I dm.
2. Shall traitors lay that greatness lów?
No! land of hope and blessing, nò.


## p. 96 (#102) #############################################

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
EXCEPTIONS.
Answers given in a careless or an indifferent manner
sometimes take the rising inflection, as,
1. What do you want ? Nothing.
2. Which will you hàve? I do n't care.
3. What did you say? Not múch.
4. May I stáy here? Yes, you may if you líke.
5. Out spoke the ancient fisherman: “O what was that,
my dàughter ?”
“'T was nothing but a pebble, sir, I threw upon the
water."
“And what is that, pray tell me, love, that paddles
off so fåst ?”
“It's nothing but a pórpoise, sir, that's been a swim-
ming pást.”
Rule III. Impassioned exclamation or very emphatic
assertion is characterized by the falling inflection—usually
the fifth or eighth.
EXAMPLES.
[Falling Fifth.]
1. Rèse, fellow-mèn, our country yet remains.
2. Clearness, fòrce, and earnestness are the qualities
which produce conviction.
3. Eloquence is action, nòble, sublime, gòdlike action.
4. Stràke—till the last armed foe expères ;
Stràke—for your àltars and your fères ;
Stràke—for the green gráves of your sères,
Gốd—and your native lànd!
[Falling Eighth.--Emotional.]
5. O hòrrible! O horrible ! most hòrrible !

8. I have done my dùty :-I stand acquitted to my
conscience and my country :-I have opposed this measure
throughout ; and I now protèst against it as hårsh, op-
prèssive, uncalled for, unjùst,—as establishing an infamous
precedent by retaliating críme against crème,-as tyran-
nous—crùelly and vindàctively tyrannous. O'Connell.
9. The mustering place is Lanrick mead,
Speed forth the signal, Norman, speed ;
Her summons dread brooks no deldy,
Stretch to the ràce—awdy, awdy!
10. Thy threats, thy mercy, I defù,
Let recreant yield who fears to die.
11. “Can naught but blood our feud atone ?
Are there no means ?" No, stranger, nòne.
WTY,
Rule IV. Indirect questions and very emphatic direct
questions generally take the falling inflection.
Interrogative sentences beginning with who, which,
when, where, why, and how, generally take the falling
inflection. A direct question if repeated a second or
third time, frequently takes the falling inflection for
emphasis.
EXAMPLES.
1. What constitutes a State ?
2. What is it that gentlemen wish ?
3. When was he graduated ?
4. Why do you not study your lèsson ?
5. “Speak louder; I did not hear your question.”

Do you hear it, I say ? Ôi ! you do hear it !”
Rule V. Completeness of thought or expression, whether
in the clauses of a complex sentence, or in the propositions
of a compound sentence, generally requires the falling in-
flection.
EXAMPLES.
1. DEAD HEROES.
They fell | devoted, but undying ;
The very gàle | their names seemed sìghing ;
The waters | murmured of their náme;
The woods were peopled with their fàme;
The silent pillar, lone and gray,
Claimed kàndred | with their sacred clày:
Their spírits wrapped the dusky mountain,
Their mémory | sparkled o'er the fountain ;
The meanest róll, the mightiest river,
Rolled mingling | with their fáme forèver.
BYRON.
2. FROM GOLDSMITH'S “DESERTED VILLAGE.”
Imagination fondly stoops to trace
The parlor splèndor of that festive plàce:
The whitewashed wall, the nicely sanded floor,
The varnished clock that clicked behind the door;
The chèst, contrived a double debt to pay,
A bed by night, a chest of drawers by dày;
The păctures placed for ornament and use,
The twelve good rùles, the royal game of goose ;
The hedrth, except when winter chilled the day,
With aspen bòughs and flowers and fènnel gay ;
While broken tèacups, wisely kept for show,
Ranged o'er the chimney, glistened in a row.

It has lengthened life ; it has mitigated pdin ; it has
extinguished diseases; it has increased the fertility of
the soil ; it has given new securities to the mariner ; it
has furnished new arms to the wùrrior ; it has spanned
great rivers and estuaries with bràlges of form unknown
to our fathers; it has guided the thùnderbolt innocuously
from héaven to eàrth; it has lighted up the night with
the splendor of the dày; it has extended the range of
the human vision ; it has multiplied the power of the
human muscles; it has accelerated mòtion ; it has anni-
hilated distance; it has facilitated intercourse, correspònd-
ence, all friendly offices, all despatch of bùsiness ; it has
enabled men to descend to the depths of the sea, to
soar into the dir; to penetrate securely into the noxious
recesses of the eàrth, to traverse the land in cárs which
whirl along without hòrses, and the ocean in ships which
run ten knots an hour against the wind.

That coiled around the stately stems, and ran
Even to the limit of the lànd, the glows
And glories of the broad belt of the world,

All thèse he sàw; but what he fain had seen
He could not see, the kindly human fàce,
Nor ever hear a kindly vòice, but heard
The myriad shriek of wheeling ocean-fowl,
The league-long ròller thundering on the rèef,
The moving whisper of huge très that branched
And blossomed in the zènith, or the sweep
Of some precipitous rivulet to the wave,
As down the shore he ranged, or all day long
Sat often in the seaward-gazing gorge,
A shipwrecked súilor, waiting for a sàil ;
No sàil from dúy to dày, but every dúy
The sunrise broken into scarlet shafts
Among the palms and ferns and precipices;
The blaze upon the waters to the èast ;
The blaze upon his island overhead ;
The blaze upon the wàters to the west;
Then the great stàrs that globed themselves in heaven,
The hollower-bellowing ocean, and again
The scarlet shafts of sùnrise,—but no sàil.
TENNYSON'S Enoch Arden.
ILLUSTRATION.
The contrast in the rendering of a series with the
rising inflection and the unemphatic tone of indiffer-
ence, or with the falling inflection and the emphasis of
feeling, is illustrated by the following:
The one with yawning made reply:
“What have we seen? Not múch have I !
Trées, méadows, inóuntains, gróves, and streams,
Blue ský, and cloúds, and sunny gléams."
The other, smiling, said the same;
But, with face transfigured and eye of flame :
“ Trèes, mèadows, moùntains, grèves, and streams,
Blue sky and cloùds and sunny glèams ! ”

Rule VII. The cadence, or falling inflection at the
end of a sentence, must not be made too abruptly.
The closing descent in tone at the end of a sentence
falls lower than the falling inflection at the end of the
propositions that make up a compound sentence, and
lower than the slide on emphatic words or clauses.
The longer the sentence, the more marked is the cadence.
The common errors in cadence are: (1) Dropping the
tone suddenly on the last word of the sentence. (2)
Falling too soon in the sentence. (3) A gradual dimin-
ishing in force towards the end of a sentence, so that
the last few words are feebly uttered. (4) A monoto-
nous sameness of inflection.
The difference between the partial falling inflection in
the body of a sentence and the cadence at the close,
must be illustrated by the living voice of the teacher.
Take the following sentence from Addison for illus-
tration :
“Our sight is the most perfect and most delightful
of all our senses. It fills the mind with the largest
variety of idèas, converses with its objects at the great-
est distance, and continues the longest in action without
being tired or satiated with its proper enjoyments.”
Here the slide on “ideas” and “ distance” is the partial
falling, say the falling third, while the cadence on “enjoy-
ment” runs to the falling fifth. It will be noticed, also,
that the voice slides upward on “ action,” to prepare for
the cadence at the close of the sentence.
EXAMPLES.
1. I have done my dùty ; I stand acquitted to my
conscience and my country; I have opposed this meas-
ure throughout; and I now protest against it, as hàrsh,
opprèssive, uncalled for, unjùst; as establishing an infa-
mous precedent, by retaliating crime against crème; as
tùrannous—crùclly and vindàctively tyrannous.

2. Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,
Where wealth accumulates and men decày:
Princes and lords may flourish, or may fàde
A breath can make them, as a breath hàs made;
But a bold peasantry, their country's príde,
When once destroyed, can never be supplied.
3. God of the earth's extended plàins !
The dark green fields contented lie:
The mountains rise like holy towers,
Where man might commune with the sky;
The tall cliff challenges the storm
That lowers upon the vale belów,
Where shaded fountains send their streams,
With joyous music in their flow.
RULES FOR CONTRASTED INFLECTIONS.
Rule 1. When negation is opposed to affirmation, nega-
tion has the rising, and affirmation the falling inflection.
Contrasted words are emphatic.
EXAMPLES.
1. He did not call you, but mè.
2. He called you, not mé.
3. He called neither you nor mè.
4. Man never is, but always to bè blest.
5. JOHN HOWARD.
He visited all Eŭrope—not to survey the sumptuous-
ness of pálaces, or the stateliness of témples; not to
make accurate measurements of the remains of ancient
grandeur, nor to form a scale of the curiosities of modern
árt, nor to collect médals, or collate mánuscripts ; but
to dive into the depths of dùngeons, to plunge into the
infection of hospitals, to survey the mansions of sorrow
and pain; to take the gauge and dimensions of misery,
depression, and contempt; to remember the forgotten, to

pare and collate the distresses of all men in all countries.
His plan is orèginal ; it is as full of génius as of humanity.
It was a voyage of discovery—a circumnavigation of

BURKE.
Rule II. When the conjunction or connects contrasted
words or phrases, it is preceded by the rising, and fol-
lowed by the falling inflection. Contrasted words are
emphatic.
EXAMPLES
1. Did he call Jáne or Màry?
2. Is this book yours or mine ?
3. Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give
my hand and my heàrt to this vote.
4. Do we mean to carry on or to give úp the war?
Require an additional example from each pupil.
Rule III. Contrast or antithesis is denoted by opposite
inflections on the contrasted words of a sentence, and the
contrasted words are emphatic.
Pupils should be cautioned against the common fault
of substituting, in examples of contrast, the circumflex
inflections for the direct rising and falling inflections.
The following example is often incorrectly read thus :
1. In the one we most admire the măn; in the other,
the wôrk.
It should be read as follows:
2. In the one we most admire the mán; in the other,
the work.
3. Incorrect : As is the beginning, so is the end.
4. Correct : As is the beginning, so is the ènd.
5. Incorrect : What we gain in power is lost in tîme.
6. Correct : What we gain in power is lost in time.

The circumflex inflections are properly applied in
cases of very emphatic contrast, or in the expression of
irony, sarcasm, wit, and humor.
Selection 3, at the end of this chapter, affords good
illustrations of contrasted circumflex, while selections 1,
2, and 5 are examples of the use of the direct rising
and falling inflections.
“A fault of local usage, prevailing throughout New
England,” says Prof. Russell, “is that of giving all em-
phasis with the tone of the circumflex. It is a tone
incompatible with simplicity and dignity of expression,
and belongs properly to irony or ridicule, to the peculiar
significance of words and phrases embodying logical or
grammatical niceties of distinction, or to the studied and
peculiar emphasis which belongs to the utterance of a
word intended to convey a pun. This fault would be
avoided by giving emphasis with the direct inflection,
instead of the circumflex.”
EXAMPLES OF CONTRAST,
1. I said good, not búil ; virtuous, not vícious ; éducated,
not illiterate.
2. He spoke for education, not agáinst it.
3. After the shower, the tranquil sùn ;
Silver stárs when the dày is done.
After the snów, the emerald leaves ;
After the hárvest, golden shèaves ;
After the cloúds, the violet skỳ ;
Quiet woods when the winds go by.
After the tempest, the lull of wàves ;
After the báttle, peaceful gràves.
After the knéll, the wedding-bells;
Joyful gréetings from sad farewells.
After the búd, the radiant rose;
After our wéeping, sweet repose.

and Càrthage! Róme with her ármy, Cárthage with her
flèet ; Cárthage, old, rích, and crafty-Róme, young, poor,
and robùst ; the pást, and the fùture; the spirit of dis-
cóvery, and the spirit of conquest; the genius of commerce,
the demon of wàr; the East and the South on one side,
the West and the North on the dther; in short, twó

6. I have always preferred cheerfulness to mèrth. The
látter I consider as an áct, the former as a hàbit of the
mind. Mirth is short and tránsient, cheerfulness fixed
and permanent. Mirth is like a flash of lightning, that
breaks through a gloom of clouds, and glitters for a
móment; cheerfulness keeps up a kind of dàylight in the
mind, and fills it with a stèady and perpétual serènity.

And rooks committee-men and trûstees.

honor from the profession. Take them to court. Talent
feels its weight, tact finds its way; talent commănds,
tact is obéyed ; talent is honored with approbătion, and
tact is blessed by preferment.

inflection, and their answers, the falling inflection.

Hor. Nay, very pàle.
Hamlet. And fixed his eyes upon you ?
Hor. Most constantly.
Hamlet. I would ) had been thére.
Hor. It would have much amàzed you. SHAKESPEARE.
III. INFLECTIONS OF THE PARENTHESIS.
Rule 1. The words included in a parenthesis, or be-
tween two dashes used as a parenthesis, and any phrase
corresponding in effect to a parenthesis, are read with the
same inflection as the clause immediately preceding them.
“A lower and less forcible tone, and a more rapid
utterance, than in the other parts of a sentence, together
with a degree of monotony, are required in the reading
of a parenthesis. The form of parenthesis implies some-
thing thrown in as an interruption of the main thought
in a sentence. Hence its suppressed and hurried tone;
the voice seeming to hasten over it slightly, as if impa-
tient to resume the principal object. The same remark
applies, with more or less force, to all intervening
phrases, whether in the exact form of parenthesis or
not.”
RUSSELL.

EXAMPLES.
1. Uprightness is a habit, and, like all other habits,
gains strength by time and exercise. If then we éxer-
cise upright prínciples (and we cannot have them, unless
we exercise thém), they must be perpetually on the

2. “And this,” said hé—putting the remains of a
crust into his wallet—"and this should have been thị
portion,” said hè, “ hadst thou been alive to have shared

3. To my mind-though I am native here,
And to the manner bórn—it is a custom
More honored in the breach than the observance.
SHAKESPEARE.
SUMMARY OF INFLECTION.
1. The stronger the emphasis, the longer the slides.
2. In unimpassioned reading, the emphasis is slight
and the slides are short : in bold and dignified composi-
tion, the emphasis is stronger and the slides are longer :
and in highly impassioned or dramatic reading, the em-
phasis is strongest and the slides are longest.
3. The general principle that underlies all the rules of
inflection is as follows: The rising inflection in general
denotes incompleteness of statement, comparatively unim-
portant statement, interrogation, or negation; the falling
inflection denotes completed or emphatic statement.
GENERAL INFLECTION DRILL.
1. Sing the scale, upward and downward.
2. Substitute in place of the note names the long
vocals, thus : ā, ē, ī, ā, ū, ā, ē, ā.
3. Sound the third, fifth, and eighth notes of the

scale; then substitute for the note names the following:
ē, ä, oo.
4. Give the long vowel sounds, ā, ē, ī, ā, ū, (1) with
the rising “second ;” (2) with the rising “third ;” (3)
with the rising “fifth ;” (4) with the rising “eighth.”
5. Give the long vowel sounds, ā, ē, ī, ā, ū, with the
falling “second,” “third,” “ fifth,” and “ eighth.”
6. Give the long vowel sounds, ā, ē, ī, ā, ū, with the
rising wave of the “third;” of the “fifth ;” of the
"octave;” the falling wave with the same degrees.'
IV. THE CIRCUMFLEX INFLECTION.
The circumflex, or wave, is a combination of the rising
and falling inflections on the same word or sound.
The rising circumflex ends with the rising inflection,
and is denoted thus ~); the falling circumflex ends
with the downward slide, and is marked thus ).
The circumflex is more emphatic than the direct rising
and falling inflections. The circumflex may be divided
into the distinctive and the emotional.
I. THE DISTINCTIVE CIRCUMFLEX OF THE THIRD.
The distinctive, or unimpassioned, circumflex occurs
when the voice rises or falls through the interval of the
third. It is the characteristic inflection of good-natured
raillery, of humor, and of wit. It is used in express-
ing a pun, or a play upon words. It expresses a double
meaning, or a double relation. It carries the mind back
to something that has been said, or forward to some-
thing to be said. This form of circumflex is a delicate
wave of the voice, and is very expressive; but great care
should be taken not to overdo it. Carried to excess,
it becomes ridiculous.


## p. 112 (#118) ############################################

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
II. INFLECTION DRILL.
1. Sound the long vocals, ā, ē, ī, ā, ū, with the slight
rising circumflex of the third; with the slight falling
circumflex.
2. Count from one to twenty, with the slight rising
circumflex; with the falling wave of the third.
3. It is n't the sěcret I care about, Mr. Caudle. It's
the slight.
4. Do you hear the răin, Mr. Caudle ?
5. When lawyers tõke what they would give,
And doctors give what they would tăke.
6. I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honorable měn.
7. Men, indeed! call themselves lõrds of creătion !
Pretty lords, when they can't even take care of an um-
brělla!
8. Let any man resolve to do right nốw, leaving then
to do as it can; and if he were to live to the age of
Methûselah, he would never do wrong. But the com-
mon error is to resolve to act right ăfter breakfast, or
ăfter dinner, or to-měrrow môrning, or něxt tîme. But
now, just now, this once, we must go on the sáme as
ever.
III. EMOTIONAL CIRCUMFLEX.
The emotional circumflex occurs when the voice rises
or falls through an interval of the fifth or the eighth.
It is the wave of irony, sarcasm, scorn, contempt,
hatred, revenge, astonishment, or amazement. It is the
inflection of very strong emphasis.
The rising circumflex occurs where, otherwise, the
direct rising inflection would be used; and the falling
wave where, otherwise, the falling slide would be applied.

IV. INFLECTION DRILL.
1. Sound the long vocals, ā, ē, ī, ā, ū, with the rising
circumflex of the fifth; with the falling circumflex.
2. Repeat, five times, with surprise, the words, “óh!
indeed !” with the rising circumflex of the fifth.
3. Gone to be mărried ! gone to swear a peace!
4. Hath not a Jew hånds, òrgans, diměnsions, sēnses,
affections, păssions ?
5. Repeat, with irony and the falling wave of the
fifth, the expression, “I told you sô.”
6. Sound the long vocals, ā, ē, ī, ā, ū, with the rising
wave of the eighth; the falling wave of the eighth.
7. Repeat, five times, with the greatest possible aston-
ishment, the following: õh ! indeed ! is it trŭe !
8. O nôble judge! O eccellent young man!
9. Nô! by St. Bride of Bothwell, nô!
10. Soars thy presumption then so high,
Because a wretched kérn ye slew,
Homage to name to Roderick Dhů ?
V. EXAMPLES OF THE DISTINCTIVE CIRCUMFLEX.
The distinctive circumflex is the delicate wave of the
voice, generally of the rising or falling third, indicative
of mirth, fun, wit, humor, and good-natured raillery.
In the following examples, be careful not to overdo the
inflection or the emphasis.
EXAMPLES.
1. THE DEBTOR.
A děbtor is a man of mark. Many eyes are fixed upon
him; many have interest in his well-being; his move-
ments are of concern; he can not disappear unheeded ;

his name is in many môuths; his name is upon many
bộoks; he is a man of nôte—of prômissory note; he fills
the speculâtion of many minds; men conjecture about
him, wônder about him-wonder and conjecture whether
he will pây. He is a man of cônsequence, for many are
running after him. His door is thronged with dứns.
He is inquired after every hour of the day. Judges hear
of him and know him. Every meal he swallows, every
coat he puts upon his bâck, every děllar he bôrrows,
appears before the country in some formal dôcument.
Compare hřs notoriety with the obscure lot of the créd-
itor—of the man who has nothing but claims on the
world; a lândlord, or fúnd-holder, or some sûch disa-
greeable, hard character.
2. FALSTAFF'S INSTINCT.
Why, I knew ye as well as he that made ye. Why,

appărent ? Should I turn upon the trŭe prănce? Why,
thou knowest I am as valiant as Hércules; but beware
înstinct; the lîon will not touch the true prince; instinct
is a great matter; I was a coward on instinct. I shall
think the better of myself and thee during my life; I
for a valiant lion, and thou for a trắe prince.

If to dě were as easy as to know what were good to

good to be done than be one of the twenty to follow
mine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the
blôod ; but a hot temper leaps over a cold decrèe; such
a hare is madness, the youth, to skip o'er the meshes
of good counsel, the cripple. But this reasoning is not
in the fashion to choose me a húsband. O me! the
word choose! I may neither choose whom I woŭld, nor
refuse whom I dislike ; so is the will of a living dăughter
curbed by the will of a dead father. Is it not hård,

The emotional circumflex runs into the fifth and
eighth, and requires strong emphasis. This form of the
circumflex is expressive of sarcasm, irony, astonishment,
revenge, and hatred.

V. THE MONOTONE.
The monotone is one uniform tone, which neither rises
nor falls in pitch above or below the general level of
the sentence. It is a continuous flow of sound, corre-
sponding, in some degree, to the chanting tone in vocal
music. It is generally associated with low pitch and slow
movement. When the voice is under the influence of
awe or horror, the monotone strikes upon the ear like
the recurring pulsations of a deep-toned bell.


## p. 120 (#126) ############################################

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
The monotone is the natural expression of voice when
the feelings are under the influence of awe, adoration,
reverence, sublimity, grandeur, or horror.
“Grandeur of thought and sublimity of feeling,” says
Tower, "are always expressed by this movement. The
effect produced by it is deep and impressive. When
its use is known, and the rule for its application is
clearly understood, the reading will be characterized by
a solemnity of manner, a grandeur of refinement, and
a beauty of execution, which all will acknowledge to be
in exact accordance with the dictates of Nature, and
strictly within the pale of her laws.”
The monotone, one of the most effective tones in
elocution, must not be confounded with monotony, one
of the worst faults in school reading.
There is one form of monotone, prevailing in the
poetry of sentiment, that is not combined with low pitch.
This may be called poetic monotone, as contrasted with
the monotone on a low pitch, which may be termed
grave monotone.
In poetic monotone, the key is not necessarily lower
than the middle pitch, though there is always something
of the suppressed force of pathos and sentiment. In
examples of the poetic monotone, the slight or suspen-
sive rising inflection takes the place of monotone.
I. INFLECTION DRILL ON THE MONOTONE.

II. EXAMPLES OF POETIC MONOTONE.
1. FROM POE'S “RAVEN.”
Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from
an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim, whose footfalls tinkled on the
tufted floor.
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl, whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's
core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease
reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light
gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-light
gloating o’er
She shall press, ah, nevermore !
2. FROM “THE CLOSING SCENE."
Long, but not loud, the droning wheel went on,
Like the low murmur of a hive at noon;
Long, but not loud, the memory of the gone
Breathed through her lips a sad and tremulous tune.
At last the thread was snapped: her head was bowed ;
Life dropped the distaff through his hands serene,-
And loving neighbors smoothed her careful shroud,
While Death and Winter closed the autumn scene.

3. PASSING AWAY.
While yet I looked, what a change there came!
Her eye was quenched, and her cheek was wan;
Stooping and staffed was her withered frame,
Yet just as busily swung she on.
The garland beneath her had fallen to dust:
The wheels above her were eaten with rust.

The hands, that over the dial swept,
Grew crooked and tarnished, but on they kept;
And still there came that silver tone
From the shriveled lips of the toothless crone-
Let me never forget, to my dying day,
The tone or the burden of that lay-
" Passing away! Passing away !”

III. LOW, OR GRAVE, MONOTONE.
The low, or grave, monotone is pitched on the lower
notes of the voice. It is indicated by the macrons
placed over the vowels :
1. ALEXANDER'S FEAST.
He chose a mournful mūse,
Soft pity to infūse:
He sung Darius grēat and good,
By too sēvēre a fāte,

Fällen from his hīgh estāte,
And wēltering in his blood.

For the wild, grim dīce of the iron game.

6. THE PRISONER OF CHILLON.
For all was blānk, and blēak, and grāy;
It was not nīght-it was not dāy;
It was not even the dūngeon līght,
So hāteful to my heavy sīght-
But vācancy absorbing spāce,
And fixedness—without a place;
There wēre no stārs—nō ēarth-no tīme-
Nō chēck-no chānge—no good-no crīme-
But sīlence, and a stīrless brēath
Which neither was of līfe nor dèath :
A sēa of stāgnant idleness-
Blīnd, boundless, mūte, and motionless.
BYRON,

Crēeps in this petty pāce from dāy to dāy,
To the lāst syllable of recorded tīme;
And all our yēsterdays have līghted fõols
The wāy to dūsty death. Oūt, oūt, briēf cāndle !
Līfe's but a wālking shādow; a põõr plāyer,
That strūts and frēts his hour upon the stāge,
And thēn is hēard no more : it is a tāle
Told by an idiot, fūll of sound and fūry,
Signifying nothing.

Doomed for a cērtain tērm to wālk the nīght;

Till the foul crīmes, done in my dāys of nāture,
Are būrnt and pūrged awāy. Būt that I am forbīd
To tēll the sēcrets of my prīson-house,
I could a tāle unföld, whose līghtest word
Woūld hārrow up thy soul; frēeze thy young blood;
Māke thy two eões, like stārs, stārt from their sphères ;
Thy knotted and combined locks to pārt,
And each particular hāir to stānd on ēnd,
Like qūills upon the frētful porcupine.

EXAMPLES OF EMPHASIS, PAUSES, AND INFLECTION.
1. JOHN BUNYAN.
Bunyan | is almost the only writer | that ever gave to
the abstract | the interest of the concrète. In the works
of many celebrated authors | men are mere personificà-
tions. We have not an Othello, but jèalousy; not an
lágo, but pèrfidy; not a Brútus, but pàtriotism. The
mind of Búnyan, on the contrary, was so imáginative |
that personifications, when he dealt with them, became
mèn. A dialogue between two quàlities, in his dream,
has more dramatic efféct | than a dialogue between two
human bèings | in most plâys.
The stùle of Búnyan | is delightful to every reader,
and invaluable | as a stúdy | to every person who wishes
to obtain a wide command over the English lùnguage.
The vocábulary | is the vocabulary of the common people.
There is not an exprèssion, if we except a few technical
terms of theólogy, which would puzzle the rúdest peasant.
We have observed several páges | which do not contain
a single word of more than two syllables. Yet nò writer
| has said more exáctly | what he meant to say. For
magníficence, for páthos, for vehement exhortation, for
subtile disquisítion, for every purpose of the poet, the
órator, and the divine, this homely dialect, the dialect of
plain workingmen, was perfectly sufficient. There is no
book in our làterature | on which we would so readily
stake the fáme of the old unpolluted English lànguage ;
no bóok | which shows so well | how rich that language
às, in its own proper wéalth, and how little it has been
improved by all that it has bòrrowed.
Cowper sáid, fifty or sixty years ago, that he dared
not name John Búnyan in his verse, for fear of moving
a snèer. Wě | live in bétter tèmes; and we are not afraid |

2. HYDER ALI.
[This extract must be read with strongly marked rising and falling
inflections.)
Whilst the authors of all these evils | were idly and
stupidly gazing on this menacing méteor, which black-
ened all the horizon, it suddenly bùrst, and poured down
the whole of its contents | upon the plains of the Car-
nàtic. Then ensued a scene of wóe, the like of which
no eýe | had sèen, no heárt | concèived, and which no
tongue | can adequately tèll. The miserable inhábitants,
flying from their flaming víllages, in part | were slàugh-
tered ; others, without regard to sér, to áge, to ránk, or
sacredness of fúnction--fáthers torn from children, hús-
bands from wives-enveloped in a whirlwind of cávalry,
and amidst the goading spears of drivers, and the tram-
pling of pursuing horses, were swept into càptivity, in
an unknown and hóstile lànd. Those who were able to
eváde this tempest, fled to the walled càties. But, escaping
from fire, sword, and éxile, they fell into the jaws of
fàmine.
For eighteen mònths, without intermèssion, this destruc--
tion | raged | from the gates of Madrás | to the gates of
Tanjòre ; and so completely did these masters in their
árt, Hyder Ali, and his more ferocious són, absolve
themselves of their impious vów, that when the British
ármies | traversed, as they did, the Carnátic | for hun-
dreds of miles in all directions, through the whole låne
of their march they did not see óne | màn, not óne | wòman,
not óne | chàld, not òne | four-footed bèast | of any descríp-
tion | whatèver. One dēad | ūniform sīlence | rēigned |
over the whole rēgion.

3. CONTRAST OF TACT AND TALENT.
[This extract affords a good illustration of distinctive or unimpassioned
circumflex.]
Tálent | is something, but táct | is every thing. Talent |
is sèrious, sõber, gráve, and respectable: tact | is all thăt,
and more too. It is not a sixth sénse, but it is the life
of all the five. It is the open eùe, the quick èar, the
judging tàste, the keen sméll, and the lively touch ; it is
the intérpreter of all riddles, the surmounter of all diffi-
culties, the remover of all obstacles. It is useful in all
pláces, and at all tàmes; it is useful in solitude, for it
shows a man into the world; it is useful in society, for
it shows him his way through the world.
Tálent | is power, táct | is skill; tálent | is wežght, táct |
is momentum ; tálent | knows what to do, táct | knows
how to do it; tálent | makes a man respectable, tăct | will
make him respected; tálent is wealth, táct | is ready
môney. For all the practical purposes, táct | carries it
against tálent | tén to one.
Take them to the theater, and put them against each
other on the stage, and tálent | shall produce you a
tragedy that shall scarcely live long enough to be con-
dèmned, while tăct | keeps the house in a roar, night
after night, with its successful fàrces. There is no want
of dramatic tálent, there is no want of dramatic tàct;
but they are seldom together: So we have successful
pieces which are not respectable, and respectable pieces |
which are not successful.
Take them to the bàr, and let them shake their learned
curls at each other in legal rivalry; tálent sees its way
clearly, but tăct | is first at its journey's ènd. Tálent |
has many a compliment from the bench, but tăct | touches
fées. Tálent makes the world wonder that it gets on
no fóster, tăct | arouses astonishment | that it gets on so
fást. And the secret is, that it has no wéight to carry;
it makes no fálse steps; it hits the right ndil on the

head; it loses no tàme; it takes all hants; and by keep-
ing its eye on the wéather-cock, is ready to take advantage
of every wind that blows.
Take them into the church : tálent | has always some-
thing worth hěaring, táct | is sure of abundance of hear-
ers; tálent | may obtă in a living, tăct will make one;
tálent | gets a good name, táct | a great one; talent | con-
vănces, táct | converts ; túlent | is an honor to the pro-
féssion, táct | gains honor from the profession.
Take them to court: tálent | feels its wřight, táct |
finds its way; tálent | commănds, táct | is obeyed; tál-
ent | is honored with approbătion, and táct | is blessed
by preferment. Place them in the sènate : tálent | has
the ear of the house, but táct | wins its heart, and has
its vôtes; tálent | is fit for employment, but táct | is
fitted for it. It has a knack of slipping into place
with a sweet silence and glibness of movement, as a ball-
iard-ball insănuates itself into the pocket.
It seems to know ěvery thing, without learning any
thing. It has served an extemporary apprenticeship; it
wants no drilling; it never ranks in the awkward squad;
it has no left hånd, no deaf ear, no blind side. It puts
on no look of wondrous wisdom, it has no air of profăn-
dity, but plays with the details of place | as dexterously
as a well-taught hànd | flourishes over the keys of the
pidno-forte. It has all the air of commonplace, and all
the force and power of gênius.

them; nor have there been wanting | attentive and
malicious observers | to point them out. For many years
after the Restoration, they were the theme of unmeas-
ured invective and derision. They were exposed to the
utmost licentiousness of the press | and of the stage, at
the time when the press and the stáge | were most licèn-
tious. They were not men of létters; they vére | as a
body | unpopular; they could not defènd themselves;
and the públic | would not take them under its protèc-
tion. They were therefore abandoned | without reserve |
to the tender mércies of the sátirists and dràmatists.
The ostentatious simplicity of their dréss, their sour
áspect, their nasal twáng, their stiff pósture, their long
gráces, their Hebrew námes, the scriptural phráses which
they introduced on every occásion, their contempt of
human learning, their detestation of polite amúsements,
were indeed fair gáme for the laughers. But it is not
froin the lèughers alóne that the philosophy of history I
is to be learned. And he who approaches this subject |
should carefully guard against the influence of that
potent ridicule | which has already misled so many ex-
cellent writers.
Those who roused the people to resistance, who
directed their measures through a long series of event-
ful yéars, who fórmed, out of the most unpromising
matérials, the finest ármy | that Europe had ever seen,
who trampled down king, Chúrch, and aristócracy, who,
in the short intervals of domestic sedítion and rebéllion,
made the name of England | terrible to every nation on
the face of the earth, were no vúlgar fanàtics. Most of
their absurdities were mere èxternal bàdges, like the
signs of freemasonry, or the dresses of friars. We re-
grèt that these badges | were not more attractive. We

kind has owed inestimable obligations | had not the lofty

Charles I., or the easy good bréeding for which the
court of Charles II. was celebrated. But, if we must
make our choice, we shall, like Bassanio in the play,
turn from the specious caskets, which contain only the
death's head and the fóol's head, and fix our choice on
the plain leaden chést | which conceals the treasure.
The Púritans | were men | whose minds | had derived
a peculiar chàracter | from the daily contemplation of
superior béings | and etérnal interests. Not contènt | with
acknowledging, in general terms, an overruling Próvi-
dence, they habitually ascribed évery event | to the will
of the Great Béing, for whose power | nothing was too
vást, for whose inspection | nothing was tóo minùte. To
know him, to serve him, to enjoy him, was with them,
the great end of existence. They rejected with con-
tèmpt | the ceremonious homage | which other sects |
substituted for the pure worship of the soul. Instead
of catching occasional glímpses of the Deity | through
an obscuring véil, they aspired to gaze full | on the
intolerable bràghtness, and to commune with him | fúce
to fàce. Hence originated their contèmpt | for terrés-
trial distànctions.
The difference between the greatest and the mèanest
of mankind seeined to vànish, when compared with the
boundless interval | which separated the whole rèce | from
him | on whom their ówn eyes | were constantly fixed.
They recognized no title to superiority | but his fùvor ;
and, confident of that favor, they despised all the accóm-
plishments | and all the dígnities of the world. If they
were unacquainted with the works of philosophers and
poets, they were deeply réad | in the oracles of God. If
their names were not found in the registers of héralds,
they felt assured that they were recorded in the Book
of Life. If their steps were not accompanied by a
splendid train of ménials, legions of ministering àngels |
had charge over them. Their púlaces | were houses |

not made with hànds, their díadems | crowns of glóry I
which should never fáde awày.
On the rich and the éloquent, on nóbles and priests,
they looked down with contèmpt; for they esteemed
themselves rich in a more precious treasure, and eloquent
in a more sublème language, nobles | by the right of an
éarlier credtion, and priests | by the imposition of a
mightier hànd. The very mèariest of thein | was a béing |
to whose fate I a mystérious and terrible importance be-
lònged-on whose slightest actions | the spirits of light
and dárkness | looked with ánxious interest—who had
been destined, before heaven and earth were created, to
enjoy a felicity | which should continue | when heaven
and earth | should have passed away. Evénts which
short-sighted politicians | ascribed to eărthly causes | had
been ordained on his account. For his sake empires
had risen, and flourished, and decàyed. For his sake
the Almighty | had proclaimed his will | by the pen of
the evangelist | and the harp of the prophet. He had
been rescued by no common deliverer | from the grasp |
of no common fòe. He had been ransomed | by the
sweat of no vŭlgar ágony, by the blood of no éarthly
sàcrifice. It was for hím | that the sùn | had been dark-
ened, that the rocks had been rent, and the dèad had
arisen, that áll nature had shuddered at the sufferings
of her expiring Gôd !
Thus the Pŭritan | was made up of two different
mèn, the one | all self-abásement, pénitence, grátitude,
pássion ; the other | pròud, càlm, inflexible, sagacious,
He prostrated himself in the dúst before his Măker ;
but he set his foot | on the neck of his king. In his
devotional retirement, he prayed with convulsions, and
gróans, and tears. He was half-maddened by glórious |
or tèrrible illusions. He heard the lyres of ángels | or
the tempting whispers of fiènds. He caught a gleam of
the Beatific Vision, or woke screaming from dreams of
derdtionalnd tears. He w heard the lyresont a gleam of

everlàsting fare. Like Váne, he thought himself intrusted
with the scepter l of the millénnial year. Like Fleet-
wood, he cried in the bitterness of his soul that God |
had hid bis fàce from him. But when he took his
seat in the council, or girt on his sword for wár, these
tempestuous workings of the soul | had left nò perceptible
tràce behind them. People who saw nothing of the
gódly | but their uncouth vísages, and héard nothing
from them | but their groans | and their whining hymns,
might lùugh at them. But those had little réason to
láugh | who encountered them in the hall of debate |
or in the field of battle.
These fanátics brought to civil and military affairs |
a coolness of judgment | and an immutability of púr-
pose, which some writers have thought | inconsistent
with their religious zèal, but which were, in fact, the
necessary èffects of it. The intensity of their feelings
on óne subject | made them trànquil | on every other.
One overpowering sentiment | bad subjected to itself | píty
and hatred, ámbition and fèar. Death | had lost its tèr-
rors, and pléasure | its chàrms.
They had their smiles | and their tèars, their ráptures |
and their sòrrows, but not | for the things of this
world. Enthusiasm had made them stdics, had cleared
their minds from every vúlgar passion and préjudice,
and raised them above the influence of danger and
of corruption. It sometimes night lead them to pur-
sue unwise ends, but never to choose unwise means.
They went through the world | like Sir Artegale's íror,
man Tàlus with his fàil, crushing and trampling down
oppréssors, mingling with human beings, but having
neither párt nor lòt | in húman infàrmities; insensible
to fatigue, to pléasure, and to pain ; not to be pierced
by any weapon, not to be withstood by any bàrrier.

5. THE RIGHT TO TAX AMERICA.
“But, Mr. Speaker, we have a right to tax Amèrica."
Oh, inestimable right! Oh, wônderful, transcendent right!
the assertion of which has cost this country thirteen
pròvinces, six àslands, one húndred thousand lives, and
séventy millions of mòney! Oh, invaluable right! for
the sake of which we have sacrificed our rank amung
nàtions, our importance abròad, and our happiness at
hòme.
Oh, right, more dear to us than our existence, which
has already cost us so much, and which seems likely to
cost us our all! Infatuated màn ! miserable and undone
country! not to know that the clăim of right, without
the power of enforcing it, is nugatory and idle. We have
a right to tax America, the noble lord télls us, therefore
we ôught to tax America. This is the profound logic
which comprises the whole chàin of his reasoning.
Not inferior to this was the wisdom of him who
resolved to shear the wólf. Whút-shéar a wólf! Have
you considered the resõstance, the dìfficulty, the dănger,
of the attempt ? :
No, says the madman, I have considered nothing but
the right. Man has a right of domínion over the beasts
of the forest; and, therefore, I will shear the wólf.
How wônderful that a nation could be thus delùded !
But the noble lord deals in cheats and delusions. They
are the daily traffic of his invention ; and he will con-
tànue to play off his cheats on this house, so long as
he thinks them necessary to his púrpose, and so long
as he has money enough at command to bribe gentle-
men to pretend that they believe him.
But a black and bitter day of rèckoning will surely
come; and whenever that day cómes, I trust I shall be
able, by a parliamentary impeachment, to bring upon the
heads of the authors of our calúmities the punishment
they deserve.

Spake full well, in language quaint and olden,
One who dwelleth by the castled Rhine,
When he called the flowers, so blue and golden,
Stàrs, that in earth’s firmament do shine.
Stars they are, wherein we read our history,
As astrologers and seers of eld;
Yet not so wrapped about with awful mystery,
Like the burning stars which they beheld.
Wondrous trùths, and mánifold as wondrous,
God hath written in those stars above ;
But not less in the bright flowerets únder us |
Stands the revelation of His love.
Bright and glorious | is that revelation
Writ all over this great wòrld of ours ;
Making evident our own creation |
In these stars of éarth—these golden flowers.
And the Póet, faithful and far-seeing,
Sees, alike in stárs and flowers, a part |
Of the self-same, universal being,
Which is throbbing | in his bráin and heart.
Gorgeous flowerets in the sùnlight shining ;
Blossoms | flaunting in the eye of dày;
Tremulous lèaves, with soft and silver lìning;
Bùds | that open / only to decày!
Brilliant hòpes, all woven in gorgeous tissues,
Flaunting gayly in the golden light;
Large desires, with most uncertain issues ;
Tender wishes | blossoming at night!
These in flowers and men are mòre than seeming;
Workings | are they | of the self-same powers,

Where the slaves of nature | stoop to drink ;
Not alone in her vast dome of glóry,
Not on graves of bird and béast alone,
But on old cathédrals | high and hòary,
On the tomb of hèroes, carved in stone ;
In the cottage of the rudest peasant,
In ancestral homes, whose crumbling towers,
Speaking of the Past | unto the Présent,
Tell us of the ancient Games of Flowers;
In all places, then, and in all seasons,
Flowers expand their light and soul-like wings,
Teaching us, by most persuasive reasons,
How akin they are | to hùman things.

Emblems of the bright | and better lànd.

7. THE SEVEN AGES OF MAN.
All the world's a stùge,
And all the men and women merely plàyers :
They have their éxits and their entrances ;
And one mún in his time plays many pàrts,
His ácts being seven àges. At first, the Infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
And then, the whining School-boy, with his sàtchel,
And shining morning fáce, creeping like snàil
Unwillingly to school. And then, the Lover,
Sighing like fùrnace, with a woful bállad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a Soldier,
Full of strange daths, and bearded like the pàrd,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in qudrrel,
Seeking the bubble reputátion
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then, the Justice,
With eyes sevère, and beard of forn al cùt,
Full of wise sàws and modern instances ;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slippered Pantaldon,
With spectacles on nóse, and pouch on sède ;
His youthful hóse, well sáved, a world too wide
For his shrúnk shànk; and his big manly vóice,
Turning again toward childish tréble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of áll,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans táste, sans èverything.

We buried him darkly, at dead of night,
The sods with our bàyonets turning;
By the struggling moonbeam's misty light,
And the làntern | dimly burning.
No useless cóffin | inclosed his breast,
Not in shéet | nor in shroùd | we wound him;
But he lay | like a warrior taking his rést
With his martial cloak | around him.
Féw and short | were the prèyers we sáid,
And we spoke not a word of sorrow,
But we steadfastly gazed on the face of the dead,
And we bitterly thought of the mòrrow.
We thought, as we hollowed his narrow béd,
And smoothed down his lonely pillow,
That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head,
And wé | far awúy on the billow!
Lightly they 'll talk of the spirit that's gone,
And o'er his cold ashes , upbráid him,-
But nothing he 'll reck, if they let him sleep on
In the grave | where a Briton | has laid him.
But half of our heavy task was done
When the clock / struck the hour for retiring;
And we heard the distant and random gún
That the fóe | was sullenly firing.
Slowly and sadly | we laid him down,
From the field of his fame | fresh and góry;
· We carved not a line, and we raised not a stone,
But left him alone with his giory.

CHAPTER II.
FORCE AND STRESS.
SECTION I.
FORCE OF VOICE.
1. Force of utterance relates to the degree of loudness
or intensity of voice.
2. The three main divisions of force are soft, moderate,
and loud. These, for convenience, may be subdivided
· as follows: (1) Very soft (corresponding to pianissimo
in music). (2) Soft (piano). (3) Moderate (mezzo-forte).
(4) Loud (forte). (5) Very loud (fortissimo).
3. The general rule of force is, to read with an
intensity appropriate to the thoughts or emotion to
be expressed, and with a power or strength of voice
sufficient to fill the room, so that every person in it
may hear distinctly every word that is uttered.
4. Force of voice must be stronger in the school-
room than in the parlor, and louder in the lecture-hall
than in the school-room. If read to an assemblage of
a thousand people, the most didactic and unimpassioned
document must be read with considerable force.
5. Pupils should be cautioned against attempting any
degree of force beyond the compass of their voices, and
also against the conventional school-tone of loudness,
which consists in raising the voice to so high a pitch
that it grates on the ear like the filing of a saw.
6. “The command of all degrees of force of voice,"
says Prof. Russell, “must evidently be essential to true

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
and natural expression, whether in reading or speaking.
Appropriate utterance ranges through all stages of vocal
sound, from the whisper of fear and the murmur of
repose, to the boldest swell of vehement declamation,
and the shout of triumphant courage. But to give forth
any one of these or the intermediate tones, with just
and impressive effect, the organs must be disciplined by
appropriate exercise and frequent practice. For every
day's observation proves to us, that mere natural instinct
and animal health, with all the aids of informing intel-
lect, and inspiring emotion, and exciting circumstances,
are not sufficient to produce the effects of eloquence, or
even of adequate utterance.
7. “ The overwhelming power of undisciplined feeling
may not only impede but actually prevent the right
action of the instruments of speech; and the novice who
has fondly dreamed, in his closet, that nothing more is
required for effective expression than a genuine feeling,
finds, to his discomfiture, that it is perhaps the very
intensity of his feeling that hinders his utterance; and it
is not till experience and practice have done their work,
that he learns the primary lesson, that force of emotion
needs a practiced force of will to balance and regulate
it, and a disciplined control over the organs to give it
appropriate utterance.
8. “The want of due training for the exercise of
public reading or speaking is evinced in the habitual
undue loudness of some speakers, and the inadequate
force of others—the former subjecting their hearers to
unnecessary pain, and the latter to disappointment and
uneasiness.
9. “Force of utterance, however, has other claims on
the attention of students of elocution, besides those which
are involved in correct expression. It is, in its various
gradations, the chief means of imparting strength to the
vocal organs, and power to the voice itself. The due

143
practice of exercises in force of utterance, does for the
voice what athletic exercise does for the muscles of the
body : it imparts the two great conditions of power-
vigor and pliancy."
CAUTION.
10. In drill upon the following exercises, bear in mind
the following direction from Prof. Monroe: “Seek to
make the sounds always smooth and musical ; and never
lose sight of the fact that what is wanted in every-day
use of the voice, in the school-room or elsewhere, is a
pleasant and natural intonation. The practice of loud
and sustained tones is an excellent means of improving
the voice; but is to be the exception, not the rule, in
ordinary reading. Still less should a shouting tone be
used in conducting a recitation, or in the ordinary dis-
cipline of a class. Yet the softest tone must be elastic
and full of life, not dull and leaden.”
CONCERT DRILL ON FORCE.
1. Repeat, three times, the long vocals, ā, ē, ī, ō, ū,
(1) with soft force; (2) with moderate force; (3) with
loud force.
2. Count from one to twenty with very soft force;
with soft force; with moderate force; with loud force ;
with very loud force.
3. Repeat, five times, the word “all,” beginning with
very soft force, and increasing the degree of force with
each successive repetition of the word.
4. Repeat the following with increased force on each
successive repetition : " loud, louder, LOUDEST.”
5. Repeat, three times, ē, ā, a, a, 7, 0, (1) with soft
force; (2) moderate force; (3) loud force.

But I struck one chord of music,
Like the sound of a great Amen!
It flooded the crimson twilight,
Like the close of an angel's psalm,
And it lay on my fevered spirit,
With a touch of infinite calm.
It quieted pain and sorrow,
Like love overcoming strife;
It seemed the harmonious echo
From our discordant life.
It linked all perplexed meanings
Into one perfect peace,
And trembled away into silence,
As if it were loath to cease.

III. MODERATE FORCE
Moderate force is the prevailing tone in the reading
of unimpassioned narrative, descriptive, or didactic com-
position, in a small room, or to a small number of
persons. It is the degree of force used in conversation.
The characteristic quality of moderate force is "pure
tone,” and the stress, “unimpassioned radical.”
EXAMPLES.
1. There was a sound of revelry by night.
2. What constitutes a state ?
3. Scrooge never painted out old Marley's name.
4. The history of England is emphatically the history
of progress.
5. The eyes of men converse as much as their tongues.
6. Spake full well in language quaint and olden,

When he called the flowers, so blue and golden,
Stars, that in earth's firmament do shine.

She was eight years old, she said ;
Her hair was thick with many a curl,
That clustered round her head.

Barefoot boy with cheeks of tan,
With thy turned-up pantaloon,
And thy merry whistled tune.

In wondrous merry mood,
And thought, as usual, men would say
They were exceeding good.

I stand by Empire's primal springs ;
And princes meet in every street,
And hear the tread of uncrowned kings !
13. Mrs. Siddons once had a pupil who was practicing
for the stage. The lesson was upon the “part” of a
young girl whose lover had deserted her. The rendering
did not please that Queen of Tragedy, and she said :
“Think how you would feel under the circumstances.
What would you do if your lover were to run off and
leave you ?” “I would look out for another one," said
that philosophic young lady; and Mrs. Siddons, with a
gesture of intense disgust, cried out, “ Leave me !” and
would never give her another lesson.
14. READING AS AN ACCOMPLISHMENT.
We had rather have a child return to us from school
a first-rate reader, than a first-rate performer on the
piano-forte. We should feel that we had a far better
pledge for the intelligence and talent of our child. The
accomplishment, in its perfection, would give more
pleasure. The voice of song is not sweeter than the
voice of eloquence. And there may be eloquent readers,
as well as eloquent speakers.

IV. LOUD FORCE.
Loud force is the tone used to express courage, bold-
ness, defiance, anger, grandeur, and sublimity. It is
used by the public speaker in addressing a large audi-
ence, or when speaking under the sway of strong
emotion.
This degree of force requires full and deep breathing,
and a vigorous use of the vocal organs.
The middle pitch is the appropriate key of loud force.
A high pitch weakens the effect of forcible reading or
declamation.
EXAMPLES.
1. Joy! Joy! Shout, shout aloud for joy.
2. Hark to the brazen blare of the bugle!
Hark to the rolling clatter of the drums.
3. Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, for-
ward, let us range;
Let the great world spin forever down the ring-
ing grooves of change.

A louder yet, and yet a louder strain.

And rouse him, like a rattling peal of thunder.

Revenge impatient rose.
He threw his blood-stained sword in thunder down,
And, with a withering look,

And blew a blast, so loud and dread,
Were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe:
And ever and anon, he beat
The doubling drum with furious heat. Collins.

And flýing vaulted either host with fire.
So under fiery cópe, together rushed
Both battles màin, with ruinous assáult
And inextinguishable rdge. All heaven
Resounded; and had èarth been then, all earth,
Had to her cènter shook. What wònder ? where
Millions of fierce encountering angels fought
On éither side, the lèast of whom could wield
These elements, and arm him with the force
Of all their règions.
THE BELLS.
Hear the loud alarum bells
Brazen bells !
What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells !
In the startled ear of night
How they scream out their affright!
Too much horrified to speak,
They can only shriek, shriek,
Out of tune,
In the clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire.
Leaping higher, higher, HIGHER,
With a desperate desire,
And a resolute endeavor,
Now, now to sit or never
By the side of the pale-faced moon! Poe.

V. VERY LOUD OR DECLAMATORY FORCE.
Very loud force prevails in oratorical declamation
before large audiences. It is also heard in the tones of
anger, of passion, of command, in calling or shouting,
and in intensely dramatic reading.
EXAMPLES.
1. Now for the fìght ! now for the cànnon peal,
Forward ! through blood and tòil, and cloud, and
fire!
Glorious the shout, the shock, the crash of stèel,
The volley's roll, the rocket's blasting spire.
2. To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek !
3. Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dèad.
4. Thy threats, thy mercy I defy,
I give thee in thy teeth the lîe.
5. He raised a shout as he drew on
Till all the welkin rang again:
“Elizabeth! Elizabeth!”
6. From every hill, by every sea,
In shouts proclaim the great decree,
“All chains are burst, all men are free!”
Hurrah, hurrah, hurrah!
7. SPARTACUS TO THE GLADIATORS.
[Radical and vanishing stress, and strongly marked circumflex in-

some Roman Adonis, breathing sweet perfume from his
cũrly locks, shall with his lily fingers pât your red
bràwn, and bet his sèsterces upon your blood. Hark!

If ye are beěsts, then stand here like fat ôxen, waiting
for the bútcher's knife! If ye are měn, follow me !
Strike down yon guàrd, gain the mountain pàsses, and
thère do bloody work, as did your sères at old Ther-
mòpylo! Is Spárta dead? Is the old Grecian spírit
frozen in your veins, that you do crouch and cower like
a belabored hound beneath his master's lăsh ? Oh, côm-
rades ! warriors ! Thrâcians ! if we můst fight, let us
fight for ourselves! If we mŭst slaughter, let us slaughter
our oppréssors! If we můst díe, let it be under the
clear skỳ, by the bright wàters, in noble, honorable
bàttle.

8. CATILINE'S DEFIANCE.
Conscript fáthers,
I do not rise to waste the night in words :
Let that plebeian talk; 't is not my tràde;
But here I stand for ràght !—Let him show proofs !
For Rôman right; though none, it seems, dare stand
To take their share with mè. Ay, cluster thère !
Cling to your màster, jùdges, Ròmans, slâves !
His charge is fâlse. I dâre him to his proofs.

A jewel worth whole hecatombs of lives !

Or Bàradas—or Orleans-track the robber-
Regàin the pàcket—or crawl on to age-
Age and gray hàirs like mine—and know thou 'st lost
That which had made thee great and saved thy country.
See me nòt till thou 'st bought the ràght to seek me.
Awày! Nay, chèer thee! thou hast not fail'd yet-
There's no such wôrd as fàil.

high mountain tóps, far above all the kingdoms of the
civilized world, and there might sée, coming úp, one
after another, the brávest and wisest of the ancient
warriors, and státesmen, and kings, and monarchs, and

to ask from them an expression of opinion upon such
a case as this, with a common vòice and in thunder tònes,
reverberating through a thousand válleys, and echoing
down the ages, they would crý: “Làberty, Freedom, the
Universal Brotherhood of Màn !” I join that shout; I
swell that anthem ; I echo that praise forever, and
for evermòre.
11. THE WAR INEVITABLE.
They tell us, sir, that we are weak-unable to cope
with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we
be stronger ? Will it be the next week, or the next
year? Will it be when we are totally disúrmed, and
when a British guárd shall be stationed in every house ?
Shall we gather strength by irresolution and ináction ?
Shall we acquire the means of effectual | resistance by
lying supinely on our bácks, and hugging the delusive
phantom of hópe, until our enemies shall have bound us
hánd and foot ? Sír, we are not weak, if we make a
proper use of those means which the God of nature
hath placed in our power. It is in vain, sir, to extènu-
ate the matter. Gentlemen may cry péace, péace !—but
there is nô peace. The war is actually begún ! The
next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our
ears the clash of resounding drms! Our bréthren are
already in the field! Whì stand we here idle ? What
is it that gentlemen wish? What would they hàve ?
Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at
the price of cháins and slăvery ? Forbid it, Almighty

VI. RECAPITULATION OF FORCE.
1. Force must be regulated by the thought or feeling to
be expressed.
2. Soft force prevails in the expression of peaceful
thought, of sentiment, of tranquillity, and of suppressed
emotion.
3. Moderate force is the natural tone of conversation
and of narrative, descriptive, and didactic composition.
4. Loud force prevails in the expression of anger, pas-
sion, sublimity, command, and strong feeling.
5. Very loud force prevails in calling and shouting ;
in cries of alarm, fear, and terror; and in intense dra-
matic expression.
EXAMPLES OF FORCE.
VERY SOFT.
Low, low, breathe and blow, wind of the western sea.
SOFT.

SECTION II.
STRESS OF VOICE.
Stress denotes the manner of applying volume of voice
to single words or sounds. The elocutionary divisions
of stress are:
1. Radical >
4. Thorough =
2. Median <>
5. Compound X
3. Vanishing >
6. Intermittent
The radical and the median stress are the most im-
portant and the most used of these divisions; and to
these the attention of school readers should be chiefly
directed. The other forms of stress mainly concern the
special elocutionist or the actor; and may, therefore, be
treated very briefly.
I. RADICAL STRESS.
1. In radical stress, the force strikes abruptly upon
the radix, or beginning of a word or a sound. It cor-
responds to the diminuendo in music.
2. It may be illustrated by exploding the full force
of the voice upon the initial vowel in the following
words ; (1) āle, ärm, all, õld, ooze. (2) ăt, ěnd, în, ón, úp.
3. Of this stress, Dr. Rush says : “ There are so few
speakers able to give a radical stress with this moment-
ary burst, and therefore so few who may compreheni
the mere description of it, that I must draw an illus-
tration from the effort of coughing. A single impulse
of coughing is not in all points exactly like the abrupt
voice on syllables, for that single impulse is a forcing
out of almost all the breath, which is not the case in
syllabic utterance; yet if the tonic element be employed
as the vocality of coughing, its abrupt opening will truly
represent the function of radical stress, when used in
Iliscourse.


## p. 156 (#162) ############################################

156
SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
4. “It is this stress which draws the cutting edge of
words across the ear, and startles even stupor into atten-
tion; this, which lessens the fatigue of listening, and
out-voices the murmur and unruly stir of an assembly;
and a sensibility to this, through a general instinct of
the animal ear, which gives authority to the groom, and
makes the horse submissive to his angry accent.
5. “Besides the fullness, loudness, and abruptness of
the radical stress, when employed for distinct articula-
tion, the tonic sound itself should be a pure vocality.
When mixed with aspiration, it loses the brilliancy that
serves to increase the impressive effect of the explosive
force.”
DISTINCTIONS OF RADICAL STRESS.
1. Radical stress may be distinguished as unimpas-
sioned and impassioned.
2. The unimpassioned radical is used in narrative,
descriptive, and didactic reading, to give a clear, dis-
tinct, energetic style of expression. The impassioned
radical is the strong, full, abrupt utterance which char-
acterizes the voice when under the influence of strong
passions, such as anger, hatred, etc. It is the stress of
authoritative command, of strength, and of power.
I. THE UNIMPASSIONED RADICAL.
This form of the radical stress is generally combined
with moderate force and middle pitch. In the unim-
passioned radical the vowel and liquid sounds are cut
short as in the staccato movement in music.
This stress is characteristic of vivacity, gayety, humor,
and of clear, distinct, and definite statement.
and of stress is staccato mool and pitch, In,

tion, the short vowel sounds, ā, ē, Y, , ; the long
vocals, ā, ē, ī, ō, ū.
2. Count from one to twenty with moderate force
and falling inflection, cutting short the words as in
staccato movement.
3. Is this a time to be gloomy and sad,
When our mother nature laughs around ?
When even the deep blue heavens look glad,
And gladness breathes from the blossoming ground ?
4. Hear the sledges, with the bells-silver bells,
What a world of merriment their melody foretells;
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
In the icy air of night!
EXAMPLES OF UNIMPASSIONED RADICAL.
1. Bob-o'-link, bob-o'-link,
Spink, spank, spink;
Chee! chee! chee!
2. Sometimes, with secure delight,
The upland hamlets will invite,
When the merry bells ring round,
And the jocund rebecs sound
To many a youth and many a maid,
Dancing in the checkered shade.
3. HUDIBRAS.
In mathematics he was greater
Than Tycho Brahe or Erra Pater;
For he, by geometric scale,
Could take the size of pots of ale ;
Resolve by sines and tangents, straight,
If bread or butter wanted weight;
And wisely tell what hour oth' day
The clock does strike, by algebra.

4. RHYME OF THE RAIL.
Singing through the forests,
Rattling over ridges,
Shooting under arches,
Rumbling over bridges ;
Whizzing through the mountains,
Buzzing o'er the vale-
Bless me! this is pleasant,
Riding on the rail !
5. SUMMER.
There's a dance of leaves in that aspen bòver,
There's a titter of winds in that beechen trèe,
There's a smile on the frùit, and a smile on the flower,
And a làugh from the brook that runs to the sea !
BRYANT.
6. SUMMER.
And what is so rare as a day in June ?
Then, if ever, come perfect days;
Then Heaven tries the earth if it be in tune,
And over it softly her warm ear lays;
Whether we look or whether we listen,
We hear life murmur or see it glisten;
Every clod feels a stir of might,
An instinct within it that reaches and towers,
And, groping blindly above it for light,
Climbs to a soul in grass and flowers.

THE DRUM.
At a distance, down the street, making music with their
feet,
Came the soldiers from the wars, all embellished with
their scars,
To the tapping of a drum, of a drum;
To the pounding and the sounding of a drum!
Of a drum, of a drum, of a drum! drum, drum, drum !
9. COMPENSATION.
Experienced men of the world know very well that it
is best to pay scot and lot as they go along, and that
a man often pays dear for a small frugality. The bor-
rower runs in his own debt. Has a man gained any-
thing who has received a hundred favors and rendered
none? Has he gained by borrowing, through indolence
or cunning, his neighbor's wares, or horses, or money ?
There arises on the deed the instant acknowledgment
of benefit on the one part, and of debt on the other;
that is, of superiority and inferiority. The transaction
remains in the memory of himself and his neighbor;
and every new transaction alters, according to its nature,
their relation to each other. He may soon come to see
that he had better have broken his own bones than to
have ridden in his neighbor's coach, and that “the
highest price he can pay for a thing is to ask for it.”

II. THE IMPASSIONED RADICAL.
1. The impassioned radical stress falls on the ear
with abrupt, explosive force, like the beat of a bass
drum. A good illustration of extreme radical stress is
afforded by loud, explosive laughter.
2. The impassioned radical marks positive assertion,
strong determination, and authoritative command. It
is the abrupt stress of courage, boldness, anger, and
hatred.
3. The absence of radical stress, so common in un-
trained readers and speakers, indicates feebleness, inde-
cision, and confusion or timidity. A lack of radical
stress may kill the most impressive sentiments, or may
transform a gay, joyous, lively piece of composition
into dull, joyless, or even melancholy expression.
4. Carried to excess, however, the radical stress be-
comes the mark of egotism, dogmatism, and undue self-
assertion. It often characterizes the rant of the stump
speaker who “tears a passion into tatters.”
5. There is little tendency in school to excess of
radical stress: on the contrary, there is generally a lack
of it.

II. MEDIAN STRESS.
1. The median stress corresponds to the "swell” in
music. It is strongest in the middle of a sound or a
word. It is adapted to the expression of harmonious
and poetic ideas.
2. “It is,” says Russell, “the natural utterance of those
emotions which allow the intermingling of reflection and
sentiment with expression, and which purposely dwell
on sound, as a means of enhancing their effect.
3. “This mode of stress is one of the most important


## p. 166 (#172) ############################################

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
in its effect on language, whether in the form of speak-
ing or of reading. Destitute of its ennobling and ex-
pansive sound, the recitation of poetry sinks into the
style of dry prose, the language of devotion loses its
sacredness, the tones of oratory lose their power over
the heart.
4. “There is great danger, however, of this natural
beauty of vocal expression being converted into a fault
by being overdone. The habit recognized under the name
of mouthing has an excessively increased and prolonged
median swell for one of its chief characteristics. In
this shape, it becomes a great deformity in utterance,-
particularly when combined with what is no infrequent
concomitant, the faulty mode of voice known as chant-
ing or singing. Like sweetness among savors, this truly
agreeable quality of sound becomes distasteful or dis-
gusting when in the least degree excessive.
5. “The practice of median stress, therefore, requires
very close attention. The spirit of poetry and the lan-
guage of eloquence,—the highest effects of human ut-
terance,—render it indispensable as an accomplishment
in elocution. But a chaste and discriminating ear is
requisite to decide the just degree of its extent.
6. “Median stress has the form of effusive utterance
in sublime, solemn, and pathetic emotions: it becomes
expulsive, in those which combine force with grandeur,
as in admiration, courage, authoritative command, indig-
nation, and similar feelings. But its effect is utterly in-
compatible with the abruptness of explosion. Its com-
paratively musical character adapts it, with special felicity
of effect, to the melody of verse, and the natural swell
of poetic expression.”
7. Median stress requires a prolongation of vowel and
liquid sounds; it is a contrast to the abruptness of the
radical stress. It prevails in combination with “pure
tone” and the “orotund.”

A soft, responsive voice was heard at every close,
And Hope, enchanted, smiled and waved her golden hair.
11. These are thy glorious works, parent of good,
Almighty! Thine this universal frame.
12. Then the angel threw up his glorious hands to
the heaven of heavens, saying: “End is there none to
the universe of God. Lo! also, there is no beginning.”
Peal out evermore,
Peal as ye pealed of yore,
Brave old bells, on each Sabbath day.

Their old, familiar carols play,
And wild and sweet,
The words repeat
Of peace on earth, good-will to men!

Sail on, 0 Union, strong and great !

In wayward, aimless course to tend,

From the roof along the spire :
Ah, the souls of those that die

Swell the deep bass of duty done,
And strike the key of time to be,

19. Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak
December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost
upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow : vainly I had sought
to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the
lost Lenore-
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels
name Lenore-
Nameless here for evermore.

How fair she grew from day to day!
What woman-nature filled her eyes-
What poetry within them lay!

So full of meaning, pure and bright,
As if she yet stood in the light
Of those oped gates of Paradise.

And snowy summits old in story:

Spreads its thin hands above the whitening embers

But O my gentle sisters! O my brothers !
These thick-sown snow-flakes hint of toil's release;
These feebler pulses bid me leave to others
The tasks once welcome-evening asks for peace.

Let me not vex the too long-suffering lyre ;
Though to your love untiring still beholden,
The curfew tells me-cover up the fire. HOLMES.

To the turtle-dove that lístens, while she glóats

Oh, from out the sounding cells,
What a gush of eùphony voluminously wells !
How it swells, how it dwells
On the Future! How it tells of the rapture that impels

Of the bells, bēlls, bēlls, bēlls, bēlls, bēlls, bēlls-
To the rhyming and the chiming of the bēlls.

[Read the following selection with orotund quality, slow movement,

Hail! holy Light-offspring of Heaven, first-born,
Or of the Eternal, co-eternal beam;
May I express thee unblamed ? since God is light,
And never but in unapproached light,
Dwelt from eternity-dwelt then in thee,
Bright effluence of bright Essence increate !
Or hear'st thou, rather, pure ethereal stream,
Whose fountain who shall tell ?-Before the sun,
Before the heavens thou wert, and, at the voice
Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest
The rising world of waters, dark and deep,
Won from the void and formless infinite.

1. The liberty of the press is the highest safeguard
to all free government. Ours could not exist without
it. It is like a great, exulting, and abounding river.
It is fed by the dews of heaven, which distill their
sweetest drops to form it. It gushes from the rill, as
it breaks from the deep caverns of the earth. It is
augmented by a thousand affluents, that dash from the
mountain top, to separate again into a thousand boun-
teous and irrigating streams around.
2. On its broad bosom it bears a thousand barks.
There genius spreads its purpling sail. There poetry
dips its silver car. There art, invention, discovery,

science, morality, religion, may safely and securely float.
It wanders through every land. It is a genial, cordial
source of thought and inspiration, whatever it touches,
whatever it surrounds. Upon its borders there grows
every flower of grace, and every fruit of truth. BAKER.
29. FROM THE BOOK OF PSALMS.
Bless the Lord, O my soul. O Lord my God, Thou
art very great ; Thou art clothed with honor and majesty :
who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; who
stretchest out the heavens like a curtain ; who layeth
the beams of His chambers in the waters; who maketh
the clouds His chariot; who walketh upon the wings of
the wind; who laid the foundations of the earth, that
it should not be removed forever.
. 30. OSSIAN'S ADDRESS TO THE SUN.
O thou that rollest above, round as the shield of my
fathers ! whence are thy beams, O sun! thy everlasting
light? Thou comest forth in thy awful beauty; the
stars hide themselves in the sky; the moon, cold and
pale, sinks in the western wave. But thou thyself
movest alone : who can be a companion of thy course ?
III. VANISHING STRESS.
1. The vanishing or terminal stress is used when the
force of voice hangs upon the final part of a word. It
corresponds to the crescendo in music. It is a form of
stress expressive of very strong emphasis, and is often
combined with the rising or falling circumflex.
2. Used with a moderate degree of force, this stress
is applied in the expression of petulance, of peevish-
ness, of impatience, of willfulness, and of querulous
complaint; combined with strong force, it is applied to
express persistent determination, astonishment, amaze-
ment, and horror.

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
173
3. Concerning the use of this stress, Prof. Russell
remarks: “Like all other forms of impassioned utter-
ance which are strongly marked in the usages of natural
habit, this property of voice is indispensable to appropri-
ate elocution, whether in speaking or reading. Without
'vanishing stress,' declamation will sometimes lose its
manly energy of determined will, and become feeble song
to the ear. High-wrought resolution can never be ex-
pressed without it. Even the language of protest, though
respectful in form, needs the aid of the right degree of
vanishing stress, to intimate its sincerity and its firm-
ness of determination, as well as its depth of conviction.
4. “But when we extend our views to the demands
of lyric and dramatic poetry, in which high-wrought
emotion is so abundant an element of effect, the full
command of this property of voice, as the natural utter-
ance of extreme passion, becomes indispensable to true,
natural, and appropriate style."
EXAMPLES.
[The italicized words have the vanishing stress, and are marked with
the circumflex inflection.]
1. I know we do not mean to submit. We never shåll
submit.
2. Earth may hide, waves engulf, fire consûme us,
But they shall not to slâvery doom us.
3. I'll have my bônd ; I will not hear thee speak:
I'll have my bônd : and therefore speak no môre.
4. But they shåll go to school. Don't tell me they
should n't. (You are so ăggravating, Caudle, you'd spoil
the temper of an angel !) They shåll go to school: mark
thăt! and if they get their deaths of cold, it's not my
fault; I did n't lend the umbrella.

IV. THOROUGH STRESS.
Thorough or through stress corresponds to the organ
tone in music. The force is powerful enough to per-
vade an entire word or sound — the beginning, the
middle, and the end. It is indicated thus : (=).
Thorough stress prevails in vehement declamation
and impassioned oratory when the speaker is under the
sway of intense excitement. It is also used in calling
or shouting, when the voice is rolled out in a full and
steady stream.
Carried to excess, this stress is characteristic of rant,
bombast, and the worst faults of untrained speakers.
EXAMPLES.
1. Vanguard ! to right and left the front unfold.
2. Peal! peal! peal!
Bells of brass and bells of steel.
3. “To all the truth we tell ! we tell !”
Shouted in ecstasies a bell.
4. And like a silver clarion rung,
“ Excelsior."
5. Advance your standards ! draw your willing swords.
6. Forward the light brigade!
7. Clang! clang! clang! the massive anvils rang.

peroration threw a glow over his countenance, like inspiration-
eye, brow, each feature, every line of his face seemed touched as
with a celestial fire. The swell and roll of his voice struck upon
the ears of the spell-bound audience, in deep and melodious
cadence, as waves upon the shore of the far-sounding sea. The
Miltonic grandeur of his words was the fit expression of his thought
and raised his hearers up to his theme. His voice, exerted to its
utmost power, penetrated every recess and corner of the Senate-
penetrated even the ante-rooms and stair-ways, as he pronounced
in the deepest tones of pathos these words of solemn significance :
I have not allowed myself, sir, to look beyond the
Union, to see what might lie hidden in the dark recess
behind. I have not coolly weighed the chances of pre-
serving liberty when the bonds that unite us together
shall be broken asúnder. I have not accustomed myself
to hang over the precipice of disunion, to see whether,
with my short sight, I can fathom the depth of the
abyss belów; nor could I regard him as a safe cóunselor
in the affairs of this government whose thoughts should
be mainly bent on considering, not how the Union may
be best preserved, but how tolerable might be the condi-
tion of the people when it shall be bròken up and
destroyed. While the Union lasts, we have high, excít-
ing, gràtifying prospects spread out before us, for us
and our children. Beyond thăt I seek not to penetrate
the veil. God grant that, in my day at least, that cúr-
tain may not rèse! God grant that on mỳ vísion never
may be opened what lies behand! When my eyes shall
be turned to behold, for the last tíme, the sun in héaven,
may I not see him shining on the broken and dishonored
fragments of a once glorious Union'; on States dissévered,
discórdant, belligerent; on a land rent with civil feúds,
or drenched, it may be, in fraternal blood! Let their
last feeble and lingering glánce, rather, behold the
gorgeous énsign of the repúblic, now known and honored
throughout the éarth, still full high advanced, its arms
and trophies streaming in their original lúster, not a

strèpe erásed or polluted, nor a single stàr obscúred ;
bearing for its motto, nò such miserable interrogatory as
“ What is all this worth ? ” nor those other words of
delusion and fòlly, “ Liberty first, and Union ăfter-
wards; but everywhere, spread all over in characters of
living lìght, blazing on all its ample folds, as they float
over the sea and over the land, and in every wind under
the whole heavens, that other sentiment, dear to every
trúe Américan héart-Liberty and Union, now and forèver,
óne and inseparable.
23. PERORATION OF BURKE'S SPEECH ON THE IMPEACHMENT OF
WARREN HASTINGS.
Of this famous speech Macaulay says : “The energy and pathos
of the great orator extorted expressions of unwonted admiration
from all; and, for a moment, seemed to pierce even the resolute
heart of the defendant. The ladies in the galleries, unaccustomed
to such displays of eloquence, excited by the solemnity of the occa-
sion, and perhaps not unwilling to display their taste and sensibility,
were in a state of uncontrollable emotion. Handkerchiefs were
pulled out; smelling-bottles were handed round; hysterical sobs
and screams were heard, and some were even carried out in fits.
At length, the orator concluded. Raising his voice, till the old
arches of Irish oak resounded, he said :
“I impeach him in the name of the Commons of Great
Bràtain in Parliament assèmbled, whose parliamentary
trust he has abùsed.
“I impeach him in the name of the Commons of Great
Britain, whose national chàracter he has dishònored.
“I impeach him in the name of the people of India,
whose làws, ràghts, and líberties he has subvèrted.
"I impeach him in the name of the people of India,
whose pròperty he has destroyed, whose coùntry he has
laid waste and dèsolate.
“I impeach him in the name of human núture itself,
which he has cruelly oùtraged, injured, and oppréssed, in
both sexes. And I impeach him in the núme and by the

virtue of those eternal láws of jàstice, which ought equally
to pervade every dge, condation, rànk, and situation, in
the world."
V. COMPOUND STRESS.
Compound stress is a combination of the radical and
the vanishing stress upon the same word. Indeed, it
may be considered as a very emphatic form of the
emotional circumflex inflection. It is applied, like the
circumflex, to express extreme astonishment, irony, sar-
casm, mockery, and contempt. It is the stress of ex-
treme emotion.
In the following examples, the words upon which the
compound stress falls are marked with the circumflex
inflection.
EXAMPLES.
1. Repeat, three times, with extreme astonishment:
áh! indeed!
2. Repeat, three times, with strong emphasis and the
falling circumflex : êve, âle, ârm, âll, ôld, ôoze.
3. Repeat, with strong force and the rising circumflex :
ä, ē, ī, ā, ū; the same with the falling circumflex.
4. Bănished from Rome! What's banished but set free
From daily contact of the things I loathe ?
He dâres not touch a hâir of Catiline.
5. KING JOHN.
Gone to be mărried ! gone to swear a peace !
Fălse blood to false blood joined ! gone to be friends!
Shall Louis have Blănche, and Blanche these provinces ?
SHAKESPEARE.
6. SPARTACUS.
Is Sparta dead? Is the old Grecian spirit frozen that
you do croặch and cower like a belabored hoặnd beneath
his master's lăsh ?

8. FROM CICERO'S ACCUSATION OF VERRES.
Is it come to this ? Shall an inferior măgistrate, a
góvernor, who holds his whole power from the Roman
people, in a Roman province, within sight of Italy, bånd,
scourge, törture with fire and red-hot plates of iron,
and at last put to the infamous death of the cross, a
Roman cắtizen ?
VI. INTERMITTENT STRESS, OR THE TREMOR.
1. Intermittent stress, or the tremor, is the tremulous
force of voice upon a sound or a word. The tremor is
characteristic of the tottering feebleness of old age, of
the weakness of sickness, or of the tones of a person
shivering and trembling with cold, or with fear.
2. It naturally occurs in the utterance of fear, grief,
joy, sobbing, and laughter, when the emotions are so
strong as to enfeeble the flow of breath. In extreme
pathos, the voice often trembles or quickens with emotion.
3. This form of stress must be very delicately applied,
for, in excess, it becomes ridiculous.
4. Concerning the appropriate application of this form
of stress, Prof. Russell remarks: “In the reading or the
recitation of lyric and dramatic poetry, this function of
voice is often required for full, vivid, and touching
expression. Without its appeals to sympathy, and its
peculiar power over the heart, many of the most beau-

tiful and touching passages of Shakespeare and Milton
become dry and cold. Like the tremolo of the accom-
plished vocalist in operatic music, it has a charm, for
the absence of which nothing can atone-since nature
suggests it as the genuine utterance of the most deli-
cate and thrilling emotion.
5. “The perfect command of tremor requires often-
repeated practice on elements, syllables, and words, as
well as on appropriate passages of impassioned lan-
guage.”
DRILL ON TREMOR.
1. Inhale ; give the tremulous sound of long a, thus :
ā—ā—ā—ā, etc., prolonged until the breath is exhausted.
2. In a similar manner, take each of the remaining
long vowel sounds, ē, ī, ā, ū.
3. Take a similar drill on ä; on a; on o.
EXAMPLES OF TREMOR.
1. OLD AGE.
Pity the sorrows of a poor old man,
Whose trembling limbs have borne him to your door,
Whose days are dwindled to the shortest span ;-
Oh! give relief; and Heaven will bless your store !

“Ho! why dost thou shiver and shake, Gaffer Gray ?
And why does thy nose look so blue ?”

'Tis I’m grown very old,
And my doublet is not very new; Well-a-day !”

So Mary said, and Dora hid her face
By Mary. There was silence in the room;
And all at once the old man burst in sobs :-
“ I have been to blame—to blame! I have killed my son !
I have killed him—but I loved him—my dear son !
May God forgive me !—I have been to blame.
Kiss me, my children ! ”
TENNYSON'S Dora.
6. GOODY BLAKE AND HARRY GILL.
She prayed, her withered hand uprearing,
While Harry held her by the arm-
“God! who art never out of hearing,
O may he never more be warm !”
The cold, cold moon above her head,
Thus on her knees did Goody pray :
Young Harry heard what she had said,
And icy cold he turned away.
No word to any man he utters,
Abed or up, to young or old;
But ever to himself he mutters,
“Poor Harry Gill is very cold.”
Abed or up, by night or day,
His teeth may chatter, chatter still:
Now think, ye farmers all, I pray,
Of Goody Blake and Harry Gill.

RECAPITULATION OF STRESS.
1. The radical is the stress of animation, of earnest-
ness, of assertion, of command, and of passion.
2. The median is the stress of sentiment, of pathos
and tenderness, of awe, reverence, sublimity, and enthu-
siasm.
3. Vanishing stress is the stress of very strong em-
phasis, of contempt and disdain, of willfulness, petulance,
and impatience.
4. Thorough stress is the stress of impassioned oratory,
and intense dramatic expression.
5. The compound is the stress of the circumflex inflec-
tion, of irony, sarcasm, contempt, and astonishment.

INTRODUCTORY.
1. The three leading divisions of movement, rate, or
time, in reading, are slow, moderate, and fast. These
distinctions are, for convenience, subdivided as follows:
1. Moderate (corresponding, in music, to andante). 2.
Fast (allegro). 3. Very fast (presto). 4. Slow (adagio).
5. Very slow (largo).
2. Different kinds of prose and verse require differ-
ent rates of movement, but the general principle that
governs all reading or speaking may be stated as fol-
lows: Read slowly enough for your hearers to compre-
hend, fully and easily, what is read.
3. Good extemporaneous speakers generally have a slow
and deliberate utterance, because they take time to think
what to say. They, also, give their hearers time to think
of what is said by the speaker.
4. The habit of slow reading may be acquired, not
hy a drawling, hesitating utterance, but by observing
rhetorical and grammatical pauses; by prolonging vocal
and liquid sounds; and by taking time to think of the
meaning of what is read.
5. The general principles governing movement are
well expressed in the following extract from Russell's
“ American School Reader :” “Everything tender, or sol-
emn, plaintive, or grave, should be read with great
moderation. Everything humorous or sprightly, every-

187
thing witty or amusing, should be read in a brisk and
lively manner.
6. “ Narration should be generally equable and flowing;
vehemence, firm and accelerated; anger and joy, rapid ,
whereas dignity, authority, sublimity, reverence, and awe
should, along with deeper tone, assume a slower movement.
7. “The movement should, in every instance, be adapted
to the sense, and free from all hurry on the one hand,
or drawling on the other.
8. “The pausing, too, should be carefully proportioned
to the movement or rate of the voice; and no change
of movement from slow to fast, or the reverse, should
take place in any clause, unless a change of emotion is
implied in the language of the piece.”
MOVEMENT DRILL.
1. Repeat, three times, the long vocals, ā, ē, ī, ō, ū:
(1) With low pitch and very slow movement. (2) With
middle pitch and slow movement. (3) With moderate
movement. (4) With fast movement. (5) With very
fast movement.
2. Count from one to twenty: (1) With slow move-
ment. (2) With moderate movement. (3) With fast
movement.
3. Repeat, with moderate movement-
The day is done, and the darkness
Falls from the wings of night
As a feather is wafted downwards
From an eagle in his flight.
I. MODERATE MOVEMENT.
Moderate movement is the characteristic rate in the
reading of didactic, descriptive, or narrative composition,
and of the poetry of sentiment.

IRVING,
EXAMPLES.
1. ENGLISH SCENERY.
The great charm, however, of English scenery, is the
moral feeling that seems to pervade it. It is associated
in the mind with ideas of òrder, of quiet, of sober, well-
established principles, of hoary úsage, and reverend cùstom.
Everything seems to be the growth of ages of regular
and peaceful existence. The neighboring village, with
its venerable cottages, its public gréen, sheltered by trées,
under which the forefathers of the present race have
spórted ; the antique family mánsion, standing apart in
some little rural domáin, but looking down with a pro-
tecting air on the surrounding scéne; all these common
features of English lándscape evince a calm and settled
security, a hereditary transmission of home-bred virtues
and local attachments, that speak deeply and toùchingly
for the moral character of the nation.
2. THE SEASONS IN SWEDEN.
I must not forget the suddenly changing sedsons of
the northern clime. There is no long and lingering
spring unfolding leaf and blossom one by one; no long
and lingering aútumn, pompous with many-colored leaves
and the glow of Indian súmmers. But winter and súm-
mer are wonderful, and pass into each other. The quail
has hardly ceased piping in the córn, when winter, from
the folds of trailing clouds, sows broadcast over the
land, snow, ścicles, and rattling hàil.
The days wane apace. Ere long the sun hardly rises
above the horizon, or does not rise at all. The moon
and the stars shine through the dày; only, at noon, they
are pale and wàn, and in the southern sky a red, fiery
glow, as of sunset, burns along the horizon, and then
goes out. And pleasantly, under the silver moon, and
under the silent, solemn stárs, ring the steel shoes of the
skaters on the frozen sèo, and voices, and the sound of
bells.
LONGFELLOW.

II. FAST MOVEMENT.
Fast, or quick, movement, is the characteristic rate in
the expression of mirth, fun, humor, gladness, joy, and
haste.
EXAMPLES.
1. PAUL REVERE'S RIDE.
A hurry of hoofs in a village street,
A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dúrk,
And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spárk
Struck out by a stéed that flies fearless and fléet :
That was all ! And yet, through the gloom and the light,
The fate of a nàtion was ràding that night;
And the spárk struck out by that steed, in his flight,
Kindled the land into flàme with its heat. LONGFELLOW.
2. L'ALLEGRO.
Haste thee, nymph, and bring with thee
Jèst and youthful Jollity,
Quips, and crànks, and wanton wàles,
Nods, and bècks, and wreathéd smiles
Such as hang on Hébe's cheek,
And love to live in dimple sleek;
Sport that wrinkled Care deràdes,
And Laughter holding both his sides.
Come, and trip it as ye go
On the light fantastic toe;
And in thy right hand lead with thee
The mountain nymph, sweet Làberty. Milton.
3. ONCE MORE.
“Will I come ?” That is pleasant ! I beg to inquire
If the gun that I carry has ever missed fire ?
And which was the muster-roll—mention but ône-
That missed your old comrade who carries the gùn !
You see me as always, my hand on the lock,
The cap on the nipple, the hammer full cock.

It is battered and brúised, but it always goes off !

Why, it scares me to fire, lest the pieces should fly
Like the cànnons that burst on the Fourth of July!

4. RHYME OF THE RAIL.
Singing through the forests,
Rattling over ridges,
Shooting under árches,
Rumbling over bridges ;
Whizzing through the mountains,
Buzzing o'er the vále,
Blèss me! this is pléasant,
Ríding on the rail !
5. THE MAY QUEEN.
You must wake and call me early, call me early, mother
dear;
To-morrow 'll be the happiest time of all the glad New
Year;
Of all the glad New Year, mother, the maddest, merriest
day ;
For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be
Queen o' the May.

Speed forth the signal! Norman, speed !
The summons dread brooks no delay.
Stretch to the race—away! away!
7. THE SUMMONS.

Come as the waves come, when navies are stranded.

Wide waves the eagle plume, blended with heather.
Cast your plaids, draw your blades, forward each man set;

8. THE SMILING LISTENER.
Precisely. I see it. You all want to say
That a tear is too sad and a smile is too gay ;
You could stand a faint smile, you could manage a sigh,
But you value your ribs, and you do n't want to cry.
It's awful to think of--how year after year
With his piece in his pocket he waits for you here;
No matter who's missing, there always is one
To lug out his manuscript, sure as a gun.
III. VERY FAST MOVEMENT.
Very fast movement is expressive of hurry, alarm,
confusion, flight, ecstatic joy, and ungovernable rage
and fury.
EXAMPLES.

Torrents less rapid and less ràsh.

When with its crackling sound the night
Is chequered with the northern light. BYRON.

3. FLIGHT.
Forth from the pass in tumult driven,
Like chaff before the wind of heaven,
The drchery appear;
For lafe! for làfe! their flight they ply;
While shriék, and shout, and battle-cry,
And pláids and bonnets waving high,
And broadswords flashing to the sky,
Are maddening in the rear.
4. GOOD NEWS.
I sprang to the stirrup, and Joris, and hè;
Í galloped, Dírck galloped, we galloped all three;
“ Good speed !” cried the watch as the gate-bolts undrew;
“Spèed !” echoed the wall to us galloping through.
Behind shut the postern; the lights sank to rest,
And into the midnight we galloped abrèast.
Not a word to each other; we kept the great páce,
Néck by néck, stríde by stríde, never changing our plàce;
I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,
Then shortened each stirrup and set the pique ríght,
Rebuckled the chéck-strap, chained slacker the bít,
Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit. BROWNING.
5. HOW THE OLD HORSE WON THE BET.
“ Bring forth the horse !” Alas! he showed
Not like the one Mazeppa rode ;
Scant-maned, sharp-backed, and shaky-kneed,
The wreck of what was once a steed;
Lips thin, eyes hollow, stiff in joints,
Yet not without his knowing points.
“ Gò !”—Through his ear the summons stung,
As if a battle-trump had rung;
The slumbering instincts long unstirred
Start at the old familiar word;
It thrills like flame through every limb-
What mean his twenty years to him ?

The savage blow his rider dealt
Fell on his hollow flanks unfelt;
The spur that pricked his staring hide
Unheeded tore his bleeding side;
Alike to him are spur and rein-
He steps a five-year-old again!
Before the quarter-pole was passed,
Old Hiram said, “He's going fast.”
Long ere the quarter was a half,
The chuckling crowd had ceased to laugh;
Tighter his frightened jockey clung
As in a mighty stride he swung,
The gravel flying in his track,
His neck stretched out, his ears laid back,
His tail extended all the while
Behind him like a rat-tail file !
Off went a shoe-away it spun,
Shot like a bullet from a gun;
The quaking jockey shapes a prayer
From scraps of oaths he used to swear;
He drops his whip, he drops his rein,
He clutches fiercely for a mane;
He'll lose his hold-he sways and reels-
He'll slide beneath those trampling heels !
But like the sable steed that bore
The spectral lover of Lenore,
His nostrils snorting foam and fire,
No stretch his bony limbs can tire;
And now the stand he rushes by,
And “Stop him! stop him!” is the cry,
Stand back! he's only just begun-
He's having out three heats in one!
Now for the finish! At the turn,
The old horse-all the rest astern-
Comes swinging in, with easy trot;
By Jove! he's distanced all the lot!

IV. Slow MOVEMENT.
Slow movement prevails in the utterance of praise
and adoration, and in all expression when the mind is
under the influence of meditation, grief, melancholy,
grandeur, sublimity, vastness, or power. It is the
characteristic rate of thoughtful and powerful oratory.
In slow movement, the rhetorical pauses are long, and
the voice dwells on the liquid and the long vowel
sounds.

móvements have been unraveled ; mighty láws have been
revealed; ponderous órbs have been wèighed; one barrier
after another has given way to the force of intellect;
until the mind, majestic in its strength, has mounted,
step by step, up the rocky height of its self-built
pýramid, from whose star-crowned súmmit it looks out
upon the grandeur of the úniverse self-clothed with the
prescience of a God.

2. THE RAVEN.
Ah, distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon

From my books surcease of sorrow-sorrow for the lost
Lenore-
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name
Lenore-
Nameless here for evermore.

Alone, alone, all, all alone,
Alone on the wide, wide sea;
And never a saint took pity on
My soul in agony.
The many men, so beautiful !
And they all dead did lie !
And a thousand thousand slimy things
Lived on-and so did I.
I closed my lids and kept them close,
Till the balls like pulses beat;
For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the sky
Lay like a load on my weary eye,
And the dead were at my feet.
4. THE HOUR OF DEATH.
Leaves have their time to fall,
And flowers to wither at the north-wind's breath,
And stars to set—but all,
Thou hast all seasons for thine own, O Death!

Whither, midst falling dew,
While glow the heavens with the last steps of day,
Far through their rosy depths dost thou pursue
Thy solitary way?

Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong, .
As, darkly painted on the crimson sky,
Thy figure floats along.

In this movement the rhetorical and grammatical
pauses are very long, and the vowel and liquid sounds
are dwelt upon and prolonged.
The prevailing inflection in this movement is the
monotone.

Nature seems dead; and wicked dreams abuse
The curtained sleeper.

Hear not my steps which way they walk, for fear
The very stones prate of my whereabouts,
And take the present horror from the time
Which now suits with it.

Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness.
This is the state of man; to-day he puts forth

The third day comes a frost, a killing frost;
And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
His greatness is a-ripening—nips his root,
And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,
Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
This many summers in a sea of glory-

10. DREAM OF DARKNESS.
The crowd was famished by degrees. But two
Of an enormous city did survive,
And they were enemies. They met beside
The dying embers of an altar-place,
Where had been heaped a mass of holy things
For an unholy usage. They raked up,
And, shivering, scraped with their cold, skeleton hands,
The feeble ashes; and their feeble breath
Blew for a little life, and inade a flame,
Which was a mockery. Then they lifted
Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld
Each other's aspects—saw, and shrieked, and died;
Even of their mutual hideousness they died,
Unknowing who he was, upon whose brow
Famine had written Fiend.

Through the forest, round the village.

PITCH OF VOICE.

*I. INTRODUCTORY.
1. Pitch, or key, denotes the highness or lowness of
the voice in tone. The range of the voice from the
lowest to the highest tone is called its compass.
2. The compass of the voice among readers corre-
sponds; in some degree, to the tenor, soprano, contralto,
and bass, among singers; but every voice has its own
relatively low, middle, and high tones.
3. For every one, the middle pitch is that tone to
which the voice inclines in conversation, or in unim-
passioned reading.
4. The three main divisions of pitch are the low, the
middle, and the high; but these, for convenience, are
subdivided into very low, low, middle, high, and very
high.
5. The general key in which a selection should be read
is determined by the general sentiment or character of
the piece.
6. In order to avoid monotony, there should be some
slight variation of pitch at the beginning of each suc-
cessive paragraph that marks a new topic of discourse,
or a change of idea.
7. Low pitch is the tone expressive of serious thought,
of awe, of reverence, of adoration, of horror, and of
despair.
8. Middle pitch is the tone of conversation, and of
unimpassioned narrative or descriptive reading.


## p. 200 (#206) ############################################

200
SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
9. High pitch is the tone of gayety, joy, and gladness;
of courage and exultation; and of shouting and calling.
10. Of the importance of drill exercises in pitch, Prof.
Monroe says: “One of the commonest faults in school
reading, and in the delivery of many public speakers,
is a dull monotony of tone. This sameness is still more
disagreeable to the ear when the voice is kept strained
upon a high key. Not less unpleasant is an incessant
repetition of the same cant or sing-song. Elocutionary
rules will do little or nothing toward removing these
faults. Faithfựl drill is needed, under the guidance of
good taste and a correct musical ear. To this must be
added an appreciation of the sentiment of the piece at
the moment of utterance.
11. “When the organs have been trained to freedom
and facility in all degrees of the musical scale, the
pupil will find it easy to modulate his voice in reading.
Vowels, words, and sentences should be practiced with
high, middle, and low pitch. Having these tones at his
command, the expressive reader will vary the pitch with
every shade of thought or emotion, so that a foreigner
who did not understand a word might listen with pleas-
ure to the play of intonation. Next to sweetness of
voice, a proper melody of delivery has the greatest
charm to the hearer.”
II. CONCERT DRILL ON PITCH.
1. Sing the scale, up and down: do, re, mï, fä, sõl,
lã, si, dõ.
2. Sing the scale with the long vowel sounds, instead
of note names : ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, ā, ē, 1.
3. Sound, not sing, the long vowels, ā, ē, ī, ā, ū, on
the key of dõ; of mï; of sõl; of do.
4. Sound the long vowels, ā, ē, ī, ā, ū: (1) With low

pitch. (2) With middle pitch. (3) With high pitch.
(4) With very high pitch.
5. Count from one to twenty: (1) In middle pitch.
(2) With low pitch. (3) With high pitch.
6. Repeat, five times, the word “all,” beginning with
very low pitch, and rising higher with each successive
repetition.
III. FAULTS IN PITCH.
1. The most common fault in school reading is the
high pitch known as the conventional “school tone,”
which grates on the ear like the filing of a saw. It
arises from an effort to read in a loud tone, and from
a habit of reading without any regard to thought or
feeling. This fault must be corrected by vocal drill on
a low key.
2. A common fault, particularly of girls, is that of
reading with feeble force and low pitch.
3. The failure to adapt the pitch to the sentiment or
emotion of what is read.
IV. EXAMPLES OF THE MIDDLE PITCH.
The middle pitch is the natural tone of ordinary con-
versation. It is the appropriate key for the reading of
unimpassioned narrative, descriptive, and didactic com-
position.
1. Give a boy address and accomplishments, and you
give him the mastery of palaces and fortunes where he
goes.
2. Wisdom is better than riches.

6. CONCORD RIVER.
We stand now on the river's brink. It may well be
called the Concord—the river of peace and quietness -
for it is certainly the most unexcitable and sluggish stream
that ever loitered imperceptibly towards its eternity, the
sea. Positively, I had lived three weeks beside it, be-
fore it grew quite clear to my perception which way
the current flowed. It never has a vivacious aspect,
except when a north-western breeze is vexing its sur-
face, on a sunshiny day.
From the incurable indolence of its nature, the stream
is happily incapable of becoming the slave of human
ingenuity, as is the fate of so many a wild, free, moun-
tain torrent. While all things else are compelled to
subserve some useful purpose, it idles its sluggish life
away in lazy liberty, without turning a solitary spindle,
or affording even water-power enough to grind the corn
that grows upon its banks.
7. WOUTER VAN TWILLER.
This, by the way, is a casual remark, which I would
not, for the universe, have it thought I apply to Gov-
ernor Van Twiller. It is true he was a man shut up
within himself, like an oyster, and rarely spoke except
in monosyllables; but then it was allowed he seldom
said a foolish thing. So invincible was his gravity that
he was never known to laugh, or even to smile, through
the whole course of a long and prosperous life. Nay,
if a joke were uttered in his presence, that set light-
minded hearers in a roar, it was observed to throw him
into a state of perplexity. Sometimes he would deign
to inquire into the matter, and when, after much ex-
planation, the joke was made as plain as a pike-staff,

V. EXAMPLES OF High PITCH.
Joy, mirth, and gayety incline the voice to pure tone
and high pitch. Calling to persons at a distance in-
clines the voice to high pitch and pure tone. Anger,
courage, boldness, and exultation incline the voice to
high pitch and loud force.

From the bells, bells, bells, bells,

13. THE CHARCOAL MAN.
Though rudely blows the wintry blast,
And sifting snows fall white and fast,
Mark Haley drives along the street,
Perched high upon his wagon-seat;
His somber face the storm defies,
And thus from morn till eve he cries :-
“Charco'! charco'!”
While echo faint and far replies :-
“ Hark, 0! hark, O!”
“ Charco’!”—“ Hark, 0!”Such cheery sounds
Attend him on his daily rounds. TROWBRIDGE.
14. THE LOST HEIR.
One day, as I was going by
That part of Holborn christened High,
I heard a loud and sudden cry
That chilled my very blood;
“O Lord ! oh, dear, my heart will break, I shall go stick
stark staring wild !
Has ever a one seen anything about the streets like a
crying, lost-looking child ?
The last time as ever I see him, poor thing, was with
i my own blessed motherly eyes,
Sitting as good as gold in the gutter, a - playing at
making little dirt pies.
Billy—where are you, Billy ?-I'm as hoarse as a crow,
with screaming for ye, you young sorrow!

And sha'n't have half a voice, no more I sha’n’t, for

Billy—where are you, Billy, I say? come Billy, come
home to your best of mothers !
I'm scared when I think of them cabroleys, they drive
so, they'd run over their own sisters and brothers.
Or may be he's stole by some chimbly-sweeping wretch,
to stick fast in narrow flues and what not,
And be poked up behind with a picked pointed pole, when
the soot has ketched, and the chimbly's red hot.
Oh, I'd give the whole wide world, if the world was
mine, to clap my two longin' eyes on his face;
For he's my darlin' of darlin's, and if he do n't soon come
back, you'll see me drop stone-dead on the place.
I only wish I'd got him safe in these two motherly
arms, and would n't I hug him and kiss him!
Lawk! I never knew what a precious he was—but a
child do n't feel like a child till you miss him.
Why, there he is ! Punch and Judy hunting, the young
wretch; it's that Billy as sartin as sin !
But let me get him home, with a good grip of his hair,
and I'm blest if he shall have a whole bone in his
skin!”
HOOD.
15. EXTRACTS FROM HOOD'S "TALE OF A TRUMPET.”
Of all old women hard of hearing,
The deafest, sure, was Dame Eleanor Spearing!
On her head, it is true,
Two flaps there grew,
That served for a pair of gold rings to go through;
But for any purpose of ears in a parley,
They heard no more than ears of barley.
However, in the peddler came,
And the moment he met the eyes of the dame,
Popped a trumpet into her ear:-

207
“There, ma'am! trụ it!
You need n't búy it-
The last new patent—and nothing comes nigh it,
For affording the deaf, at little expense,
The sense of hearing, and hearing of sense ?
A real blessing—and no mistake,
Invented for poor humanity's sake;
I would n't tell a tre, I would n't,
But my trumpets have heard what Solomon's could n't;
Only a guinea—and can't take léss.”
(“ That's very déar," says Dame Eleanor S.)
“There was Mrs. F.,
So very déaf,
That she might have worn a percussion-cap,
And been knocked on the head without hearing it sndp.
Well, I sold her a hórn, and the very néxt dày
She heard from her husband at Botany Bày !
Come-speak your mind—it's ‘No or Yês.'”
(“I've half a mind,” said Dame Eleanor S.)
“ Try it—bùy it !
Bug at_try it !
The last new patent, and nothing comes nìgh it.”
In short, the peddler so besét her-
Lord Bàcon could n't have gammoned her bétter-
With flatteries plump and indirect,
And plied his tongue with such efféct-
A tongue that could almost have buttered a crúmpet,
The deaf old woman bought the trumpet.

VI. EXAMPLES OF Low PITCH.
Low pitch is the characteristic key of the voice when
the mind is under the influence of serious, grave, and
impressive thoughts; and very low -pitch is the appro-
priate key for the expression of reverence, adoration,
horror, and despair.
1. FROM THE “RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER.”
An orphan's curse would drag to hell
A spirit from on high;
But oh! more horrible than that
Is the curse in a dead man's eye!
Seven days, seven nights I saw that curse,
And yet I could not die.
2. FROM THE “RAVEN.”
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there,
wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to
dream before ;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave
no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered
word “Lenore !”
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the
word “ Lenore !”
Merely this, and nothing more.
3. LAUS DEO.
Let us kneel;
God's own voice is in that peal,
And this spot is holy ground.
Lord, forgive us! What are wè,
That our eyes this glòry see,
That our ears have heard the sound !

4. FROM THE PSALMS.
He bowed the heavens, also, and came down; and
darkness was under his feet; and he rode upon a cherub,
and did fly; and he was seen upon the wings of the
wind; and he made darkness pavilions round about him,
dark waters, and thick clouds of the skies.
5. THE CHANDOS PICTURE.
The bell far off beats midnight; in the dark
The sounds have lost their way, and wander slowly
Through the dead air; beside me things cry, “Hark!”
And whisper words unholy. EDWARD POLLOCK.
6. THE IRON BELLS.
Hear the tolling of the bells-
Iron bells !
What a world of solemn thought their monody compels!
In the silence of the night,
How we shiver with affright
At the melancholy menace of their tone!
For every sound that floats
From the rust within their throats
Is a groan.
And the peoplemah, the people-
They that dwell up in the steeple,
All alone!
And who tolling, tolling, tolling,
In that muffled monotone,
Feel a glory in so rolling
On the human heart a stone;
They are neither man nor woman-
They are neither brute nor human-
They are ghouls ;
And their king it is who tolls-
And he rolls, rolls, rolls, rolls,
A pæan from the bells !

And his merry bosom swells
With the pæan of the bells !
And he dances and he yells;
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the pæan of the bells-
Of the bells !
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the throbbing of the bells-
Of the bells, bells, bells-
To the sobbing of the bells;
Keeping time, time, time,
As he knells, knells, knells,
In a happy Runic rhyme,
To the rolling of the bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells,
To the tolling of the bells-
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells-
To the moaning and the groaning of the bells !

VII. EXAMPLES OF VERY LOW PITCH.
1. Concerning the application of very low pitch in
reading and speaking, Prof. Russell remarks: “This low-
est form of pitch is one of the most impressive means
of powerful natural effect, in the utterance of all deep
and impressive emotions. The pervading and absorbing
effect of awe, amazement, horror, or any similar feeling,
can never be produced without low pitch and deep suc-
cessive notes; and the depth and reality of such emotions
are always in proportion to the depth of voice with which
they are uttered. The grandest descriptions in the ‘Par-
adise Lost,' and the profoundest meditations in the
Night Thoughts,' become trivial in their effect on the

ear, when read with the ineffectual expression insepara-
ble from the pitch of ordinary conversation or discourse.
2. “The vocal deficiency which limits the range of
expression to the middle and higher notes of the scale
is not, by any means, the unavoidable and necessary
fault of organization, as it is so generally supposed to
be. Habit is in this, as in so many other things, the
cause of defect. There is truth, no doubt, in the remark
so often made in defense of a high and feeble voice,
that it is natural to the individual, or that it is difficult
for some readers to attain to depth of voice without
incurring a false and forced style of utterance. But in
most cases it is habit, not organization, that has made
certain notes natural or unnatural—in other words,
familiar to the ear or the reverse.
3. “The neglect of the lower notes of the scale, and,
consequently, of the organic action by which they are
produced, may render a deep-toned utterance less easy
than it would otherwise be. But most teachers of elo-
cution are, from day to day, witnesses to the fact that
students, from the neglect of muscular action, and from
all the other enfeebling causes involved in sedentary
habits and intellectual application, sometimes commence
a course of practice with a high-pitched, thin, and fem-
inine voice, which seems at first incapable of expressing
a grave or manly sentiment, and, in some instances,
appears to forbid the individual from ever attempting
the utterance of a solemn thought, lest his treble tone
should make the effect ridiculous; but that a few weeks'
practice of vocal exercise on bass notes and deep emo-
tions, as embodied in rightly selected exercises, often
enables such readers to acquire a round and deep-toned
utterance, adequate to the fullest effects of impressive
eloquence.
4. “The exercise of singing bass, if cultivated as an
habitual practice, has a great effect in imparting com-

mand of deep-toned expression in reading and speaking.
Reading and reciting passages from Milton and from
Young, and particularly from the Book of Psalms, or
from hymns of a deeply solemn character, are exercises
of great value for securing the command of the lower
notes of the voice.”
5. In the following exercises the movement is very
slow, the pauses are very long, and the prevailing inflec-
tion the grave monotone.
1. THE GRAVE.
How frīghtful the gràve! how desērted and drèar !
With the howls of the storm-wind, the crēaks of the bīer,
And the whīte būnes āll clāttering together!
2. THE BELL OF THE ATLANTIC.
Tõll, toll, toll, thou bēll by bīllows swūng;
And, night and dāy, thy wārning words repēat with
moūrnful tòngue;
Töll for the quēenly boat, wrēcked on yān rõcky shore !
Sēa-weed is in her pālace wālls; she rīdes the sūrge no
more.
Mrs. Sigourney.
3. THE GHOST IN HAMLET.
I could a tāle unfold, whose līghtest word
Would hārrow up thy soul, frēeze thy yoũng blood,
Māke thy two eyes like stārs stārt from their sphēres,
Thy knotted and combīned locks to pārt,
And each partīcular hāir to stānd on ēnd,
Like quills upon the frētful porcupine.

VIII. RECAPITULATION OF PITCH.
1. Very low is the pitch of awe, of reverence, of solem-
nity, of melancholy, horror, and despair.
2. Low is the pitch of serious, grave, solemn, and im-
pressive thoughts and feelings.
3. Middle is the pitch of ordinary conversation, and
of unimpassioned narrative, descriptive, or didactic com-
position.
4. High pitch is the pitch of courage, boldness, exulta-
tion, wonder, and anger, and of shouting or calling.
5. Very high is the pitch of rapturous emotion, of un-
controllable passion, of terror, and pain.

CHAPTER V.
QUALITY OF VOICE.
INTRODUCTORY.
1. Quality of voice relates to the kind of tone used
in reading or speaking in order to express varied
thoughts and emotions.
2. The ever-varying intonations of a rich and culti-
vated voice constitute one of the greatest charms of a
good reader or speaker.
3. “In poetical and impassioned language,” says Prof.
Russell, “tones are often the most prominent and the
most important qualities of voice; and to give these
with propriety, force, and vividness, is the chief excel-
lence of good reading or recitation.
4. “The language of prose, being generally less
imaginative and exciting, does not require the extent
and power of tone used in poetry. But as true feeling
is, in both cases, the same in kind, though not in degree,
and as no sentiment can be uttered naturally without
the tone of its appropriate emotion, and no thought,
indeed, can arise in the mind without a degree of emo-
tion, a great importance is attached, even in the read-
ing or speaking of prose composition, to those qualities
of voice comprehended under the name of tones.
5. “Without these, utterance would degenerate into
a merely mechanical process of articulation. It is these
that give impulse and vitality to thought, and which
constitute the chief instruments of eloquence."

KINDS OF TONE.
The different qualities of tone may be classed as
follows:
1. Pure tone.
4. The Guttural.
2. The Orotund. 5. The Falsetto.
3. The Aspirated. 6. The Semitone.
Of these divisions, the pure tone and the orotund are
the most important, because they are most used in
reading
FAULTS IN QUALITY.
1. Perhaps the most common fault in school reading
consists in using one uniform tone for all kinds of
selections.
2. This hard, thin, high, grating quality is appropri-
ately termed the “school tone.”
3. The faulty habits of pupils in this respect are best
corrected by requiring pupils to repeat in concert, after
the teacher, short extracts which include great variations
of quality. Many timid pupils are, at first, frightened
at the sound of their own voices in any other tone than
the conventional school tone.
4. Another fault is the tendency to the nasal tone.
This high, thin, sharp, disagreeable tone is produced by
forcing the breath into the nose before it leaves the
mouth, and this fault in reading is the result of not
opening the mouth sufficiently in reading. It may be
broken up by persistent drill on the open vowel sounds,
and by exercises that keep the voice down to a low pitch,
I. PURE TONE.
1. Pure tone, or head tone, is a clear, smooth sound,
so formed as to have a slight resonance in the head or
through the nasal passages. A good illustration of this
quality is afforded by giving the sound of oo as in mốon,


## p. 217 (#223) ############################################

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
217
prolonged for ten seconds, in a thin, clear, gentle vocal
sound, on a moderately high pitch.
2. Pure tone is used in all quiet, gentle, subdued
forms of utterance; in the expression of pathos and
tenderness; in ordinary conversation ; in unimpassioned
reading; and in the prolonged tones of shouting or
calling, when the voice, raised to a high pitch, flows in
a thin, clear, penetrating volume.
3. “The production of pure and full tone,” says Prof.
William Russell, “is the common ground on which elo-
cution and vocal music unite, in elementary discipline.
Both arts demand attention to appropriate healthful
attitude, and to free, expansive, energetic action in the
organs.
4. “Both require erect posture, free opening of the
chest, full and regular breathing, power of producing
and sustaining any degree of volume of voice, and, along
with these, the habit of vivid, distinct articulation.
5. “Both equally forbid that imperfect and laborious
breathing which mars the voice, exhausts the organs,
and produces disease. Both tend to secure that healthy
vigor of organ which makes vocal exercise, at once, a
source of pleasure and a source of health.”

While the landscape round it measures.
2. O that this lovely vale were mine!
3. O then I see Queen Mab hath been with you !

1. The orotund is a round, deep, full, clear, resonant

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
221
chest tone of voice. It has the flow and fullness of an
organ-peal. It is the tone of emotion, excitement, and
passion.
2. The orotund has the smoothness of pure tone, but
combines it with a much heavier volume of sound.
The swelling tones of the orotund are the appropriate
means of expressing reverence, awe, sublimity, grandeur,
and strong feeling or passion. It prevails in oratorical
declamation and in the reading of lyric or dramatic
poetry.
3. The prevailing stress of the orotund is the median,
changing, however, under excitement, into the radical.
4. In the orotund utterance, the breathing must be
full and deep, to insure a good supply of breath; the
mouth must be well opened; all the vocal organs must
be called into full play; and then, in harmony with
strong emotions, the voice swells out like the blast of
a bugle or the resonant swell of an organ.
5. The three degrees of the orotund may be distin-
guished as the effusive, the expulsive, and the explosive.
OROTUND DRILL
1. Repeat, four times, in monotone, the long vocals,
ā, ē, ī, ā, ū.

And stopped at önce amid their maddest plùnge!
Motionless torrents! silent càtaracts!
Who made you glorious as the gates of hèaven ||
Beneath the keen full moon ? Who bade the sùn |
Clothe you with ràinbows ? Who, with living flowers
Of loveliest blúe, spread gàrlands at your feet ?-
Gód ! let the torrents like a shout of nations |
Answer! and let the èce-plains echo : Gốd !
Gôd ! sing, ye meadow-streams, with gladsone voice !
Ye pine-groves, with your soft and soul-like sounds !
And thèy too have a vòice, yon piles of snow,
And in their perilous fall / shall thủnder : Gốd !

6. EVE OF ELECTION.
Our hearts grow cold, we lightly hold
A right which brave men died to gain ;
The stake, the cord, the ax, the sword,
Grim nurses at its birth of pain.

O martyrs, with your crowns and palms !
Breathe through these throngs, your battle-songs,
Your scaffold prayers and dungeon psalms !

this mighty building! With what pomp do they swell
through its vast vàults, and breathe their awful har-
mony through these caves of death, and make the silent
sépulcher vocal! And now they rise in triumph and
acclamation, heaving higher and higher their accordant
nótes, and piling sòund on sound. And now they pàuse,
and the soft voices of the choir break out into sweet
gushes of melody; they soar alóft, and warble along the
roof, and seem to play about these lofty vaults like the
pure airs of heaven. Again the pealing organ heaves

EXPLOSIVE AND EXPULSIVE OROTUND.
These two forms of the orotund are often combined
in the same piece, and it is not easy to draw a marked
line of division. In impassioned declamation the utter-
ance changes from one to the other, according to the
degree of feeling or passion. The following extract
affords an illustration :
1. WEBSTER'S TRIBUTE TO MASSACHUSETTS.
Mr. Président, I shall enter on no encomium upon
Massachusetts; she nèeds none. There she is; behold
her, and judge for yourselves. There is her history;
the world knows it by heart. The pást, at least, is secùre.
There is Bòston, and Concord, and Lèxington, and
Bunker Hill; and there they will remain forèver. The
bones of her sóns, fallen in the great struggle for Inde-
pendence, now lie mingled with the soil of every State,
from New England to Geòrgia ; and there they will lie
forèver.
And, sir, where American Liberty raised its first voice,
and where its youth was nurtured and sustáined, there
it still lèves, in the strength of its mánhood, and full of
its original spirit. If discord and disunion shall wound
it; if party strife and blind ambition shall hawk at and
téar it; if folly and mádness, if uneasiness under salu-
tary and necessary restráint, shall succeed in separating
it from that Union by which alone its existence is made
súre it will stand, in the end, by the side of that crádle
in which its infancy was rocked ; it will stretch forth its
árm, with whatever of vigor it may still retáin, over the
friends who gather round it; and it will fall at last, if

fall it můst, amid the proudest monuments of its own
glóry, and on the very spot of its òrigin.
III. ASPIRATED QUALITY.
Aspirated quality means, in general, a combination of
tone with whisper, causing the huskiness and harshness
produced by a superabundance of breath under the in-
fluence of powerful emotions, such as anger, rage, terror,
and horror. The whisper represents the extreme of
aspirated quality.
THE WHISPER.
The pure whisper lies half way between breathing
and vocality. The half-whisper is a combination of
tone and whisper. The forcible whisper is a most val-
uable vocal exercise. It requires full, deep, and frequent
breathing, and the vigorous use of the lips, tongue, and
other vocal organs. The degrees of force in the whisper
are indicated by the terms effusive, expulsive, and ex-
plosive.
The pure whisper is rarely used in reading, the effect
being generally suggested by the half-whisper, or by aspi-
rated quality. The following exercises and examples are
given for the purposes of vocal training.

WHISPER DRILL
Practice each exercise with three degrees of force: (1)
Effusive, or soft. (2) Expulsive, or forcible. (3) Explo-
sive, or intense.
1. With effusive force, repeat as many times as pos-
sible without taking breath: ā–ē–ī–7–ū.
2. To ā, ē, ī, ō, ū, join f, and repeat as above; join
t; join h.
3. Count, in a whisper, from one to ten, with one
breath; from one to twenty; one to thirty, or more.
EXAMPLES OF EFFUSIVE WHISPER.
1. Step softly, and speak low.
2. Whisper! she is going to her final rest.
Whisper ! life is growing dim within her breast.
3. Hark! hist! around I list.
: The bounds of space all trace efface
' Of sound.
4. And his little daughter whispered,
As she took his icy hand:
“Is n't God upon the water,
Just the same as on the land ?”
5. And again to the child I whispered:
“ The snow that husheth all,
Darling, the merciful Father
Alone can make it fall !”
6. And the bridemaidens whispered: “'T were better by far,
To have matched our fair cousin with young Lochinvar."
7. The red rose cries, “She is near, she is near;"
And the white rose weeps, “She is late ;"
The larkspur listens, “I hear, I hear;"
And the lily whispers, “I wait.”

EXAMPLES OF EXPULSIVE WHISPER,
1. Or whispering with white lips, “The foe! they
come! they come!”
2. To bed, to bed; there's knocking at the gate.
Come, come, come, give me your hand.
3. Soldiers ! You are now within a few steps of the
enemy's outposts. Let every man keep the strictest
silence, under pain of instant death.
EXAMPLES OF EXPLOSIVE WHISPER.
1. Hark! I hear the bugles of the enemy. For the
boats! Forward ! Forward !
2. Hamlet. Săw! whô ?
Horatio. The king, your fàther.
* Hamlet. The king, my făther ?
3. Art thou some gód, some ångel, or some dévil,
That mak’st my blood run cold and my hair to stand !
WHISPER AND TONE.
In some of the following illustrations of aspirated
quality, the whisper predominates over tone ; in others,
the aspiration only affects the tone with a marked
roughness, huskiness, or aspirated harshness. The extent
to which aspirated quality may be applied is often a
matter of taste on the part of the reader.
EXAMPLES.
1. But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising
knell.
2. THE CURFEW BELL.
“Sexton,” Bessie's white lips faltered, pointing to the
prison old,
With its walls so dark and gloomy-walls so dark, and

"I've a lover in that prison, doomed this very night
to die,
At the ringing of the Curfew, and no earthly help is nigh.
Cromwell will not come till sunset,” and her face grew
strangely white,
As she spoke in husky whispers, “ Curfew must not ring
to-night."
3. MACBETH TO THE GHOST.
Avdunt ! and quit my sight! Let the earth hàde thee!
Thy bones are màrrowless, thy blood is cold :
Thou hast no speculàtion in those eyes
Which thou dost glàre with!
Hence, horrible shadow!
Unreal móckery, hènce !
4. HAMLET TO THE GHOST.
(Aspirated quality and occasional half-whisper.)
Àngels and ministers of gràce defènd ùs !
Be thou a spirit of health, or goblin dùmned-
Bring with thee airs from heaven, or blasts from hell-
Be thy intents wicked, or chàritable-
Thou com’st in such a questionable shă pe
That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee, Hamlet,
King, fàther, royal Dàne: Oh, ànswer me:
Let me not bùrst in ignorance ! but tell
Whụ thy canonized bones, hearséd in death,
Have burst their cèrements! whù the sepulcher,
Wherein we saw thee quietly inurned,
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
To cast thee up again? What may this mean,
That thou, dead corse, again, in complete steel,
Revisit’st thus the glimpses of the moon,
Making night hideous: and we fools of nature,
So horribly to shake our disposition,
With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls ?
Say, whî is this? whèrefore? what should we do?

5. FROM “EUGENE ARAM.”
(Horror and remorse. Aspirated pectoral and guttural quality.)
And, lo! the universal air
Seemed lit with ghastly flame;-
Ten thousand thousand dreadful eyes
Were looking down in blame:
I took the dead man by his hand,
And called upon his name !
O God! it made me quake to see
Such sense within the slain !
But when I touched the lifeless clay,
The blood gushed out amain!
For every clot, a burning spot
Was scorching in my brain !
And now, from forth the frowning sky,
From the heaven's topmost height,
I heard a voice—the awful voice
Of the blood-avenging sprite :-
“ Thou guilty man! take up thy dead
And hide it from my sight !”
6. MACBETH.
(Horror and fear. Intense suppressed force ; prevailing monotone ;
very slow movement ; strong aspirated quality.]
Now y'er the one hālf world
Nāture sēems dèad; and wīcked drēams abūse
The cūrtained sleep; now witchcraft cēlebrates
Pale Hécate's offerings; and wīthered murder,
Alārumed by his sēntinel, the wolf,
Whose howl's his wātch, thūs with his stēalthy pāce,
Towards his dēsign
Moves like a ghost.—Thou sūre and fīrm-sēt ēarth!
Hēar not my stēps, which wāy thēy wālk; for fear
The very stones prāte of my whereabout,
And tāke the prēsent hörror from the tīme
Which now sūits wīth it.

7. DARIUS GREEN AND HIS FLYING MACHINE.
Secrecy. Forcible whisper and half-whisper.]
And one by one, through a hole in the wall,
In under the dusty barn they crawl,
Dressed in their Sunday garments all;
And a very astonishing sight was that,
When each in his cobwebbed coat and hat
Came up through the floor like an ancient rat.
And there they hid;
And Reuben slid
The fastenings back, and the door undid.
“Keep dark !” said he,
“While I squint an' see what the’ is to see.”
“Hush !” Reuben said,
“He's up in the shed !
He's opened the winder-I see his head !
He stretches it out, an' pokes it about,
Lookin' to see 'f the coast is clear,
An' nobody near;-
Guess he don'o who's hid in here !
He's riggin' a spring-board over the sill !
Stop laffin', Solomon! Burke, keep still !
He's a-climbing out now-Of all the things !
What's he got on? I van, it's wings!
An' that 't other thing ? I vum, it's a tail!
An' there he sets like a hawk on a rail !
Steppin' careful, he travels the length
Of his spring-board, and teeters to try its strength.
Now he stretches his wings, like a monstrous bat;
Peeks over his shoulder, this way an' that,
Fer to see 'f there's any one passin' by;
But there's on'y a caʼf an'a goslin' nigh.
Flop-flop—an' plump
To the ground with a thump,
Flutterin' and founderin' all in a lump."

IV. GUTTURAL QUALITY.
The guttural, or throat, quality is the harsh, grating,
rasping utterance to which the voice tends in the ex-
pression of hatred, contempt, revenge, and loathing. It
is often combined with aspirated quality in the expres-
sion of extreme impatience or disgust, intense rage, and
extreme contempt.
EXAMPLES
1. OTHELLO.
Oh, that the slave had forty thousand lives,
My great revenge had stomach for them all.
2. THE SPY.
You shall die, base dog! and that before
Yon cloud has passed over the sun!
3. SHYLOCK TO ANTONIO.
Signior Antonio, màny a time and oft,
On the Rialto you have ràted me
About my môneys and my ûsances ;
Still have I bórne it with a patient shrúg,
For sŭfferance is the badge of all our tràbe :
You call me—misbelîever, cût-throat, dôg,
And spît upon my Jewish gàberdine,
And all for use of that which is mine own.
Well, thén, it now appears, you need mý help.
Go to, thèn; you come to me, and you say,
“Shýlock, we would have môneys ;” yộu say sò;
Yậu, that did void your rheum upon my bèard,
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cûr
Over your threshold; môneys is your sùit.
What should I say to you? Should I not sáy,
“Hath a dog mõney ? is it possible
A căr can lend thrée thousand dúcats ?” or
Shall I bend lów, and in a bốndman's key,
With bated breath, and whispering humbleness,

Say thîs :-
“Fair sír, you spât on me on Wednesday lást;
You spúrned me such a dáy; another time
You called me-dôg; and for these courtesies
I'll lènd you—thus much—mòneys.”
V. THE FALSETTO.
The falsetto is the thin, sharp, high-pitched tone pro-
duced when the voice breaks, or gets above its natural
compass. It is used by men when they imitate the voices
of women and children. It is the tone suitable for the
expression of old age, sickness, feebleness, pain, and
helpless terror.
1. “My child ! my child !” with sobs and tears,
She shrieked upon his callous ears.
2. “Billy-where are you, Billy, I say ? Come, Billy,
come home to your best of mothers !”
3. And even Tiny Tim, excited by the two young
Cratchits, beat on the table with the handle of his knife,
and feebly cried, “ Hurrah !”
4. Mr. Orator Puff had two tones in his voice,
The one squeaking thus, and the other down so;
In each sentence he uttered he gave you your choice;
For one half was B alt, and the rest G below.
Oh! oh! Orator Puff,
One voice for an orator's surely enough!
“Oh! save!” he exclaimed, in his he-and-she tones,
“Help me out! help me out! I have broken my bones !”
“ Help you out !” said a stranger, who passed, “ what
a bother!
Why, there's two of you there; can't you help one
another ?”
Oh! Oh! Orator Puff,
One voice for an orator's surely enough!

5. And in a coaxing tone he cries,
“ Charco'! charco'!”
And baby with a laugh replies,
“Ah, go! Ah, go !”
“ Charco'! "_" Ah, go !”
VI. THE SEMITONE.
When the voice slides through the interval of a semi-
tone only, it gives the plaintive tones expressive of
sadness, grief, or pathetic entreaty. If the inflection
runs through the interval of a tone and a half-a minor
third in music—it becomes more plaintive, and marks
a stronger degree of pathos or sadness; and when the
inflection extends into the minor fifth, it denotes still
stronger pathetic feeling
The semitone, then, is the plaintive tone in reading,
corresponding to the minor key in music. It should be
used delicately, for, in excess, it runs into the whine,
or becomes the affectation of cant.
SEMITONE DRILL.
1. Sound the vocals, ā, ē, ī, ā, ū, three times, on the
interval between C and C sharp; then on the minor
third ; then on the minor fifth.
2. Count from one to twenty on the same notes as
above.
EXAMPLES OF SEMITONE.
1. O come in life, or come in death,
O lost! my love, Elizabeth.
, 2. For I am poor and miserably old.
3. How many hired servants of my father's have
bread enough and to spare, and I perish with hunger !
I will arise and go to my father and will say to him,

LONGFELLOW.
And the hungry stars in heaven
Like the eyes of wolves glared at them!
“Give your children food, O Father!
Give us food, or we must perish !
Give me food for Minnehaha,
For my dying Minnehaha !”
Through the far-resounding forest,
Through the forest vast and vacant
Rang that cry of desolation;
But there came no other answer
Than the echo of his crying,
Than the echo of the woodlands,
“ Minnehaha ! Minnehaha !”

It came upon us by degrees,
We saw its shadow ere it fell,
The knowledge that our God had sent
His messenger for Babie Bell.
We shuddered with unlanguaged pain,
And all our thoughts ran into tears,
Like sunshine into rain.
We cried aloud in our belief,
“Oh, smite us gently, gently, God !
Teach us to bend and kiss the rod,
And perfect grow through grief.”
Ah, how we loved her, God can tell ;
Her heart was folded deep in ours;
Our hearts are broken, Babie Bell.

8. NEW YEAR'S EVE.
You 'll bury me, my mother, just beneath the hawthorn
shade;
And you'll come sometimes and see me where I am
lowly laid.
I shall not forget you, mother; I shall hear you when
you pass,
With your feet above my head in the long and pleasant
grass.
Good-night, good-night! When I have said good-night
for evermore,
And you see me carried out from the threshold of the
door,
Do n't let Effie come to see me till my grave be growing
green
She 'll be a better child to you than ever I have been.

9. FROM “BERTHA IN THE LANE."
[This extract should be read with subdued force, slow movement,
and prevailing poetic monotone and semitone.]
Colder grow my hands and feet;-
When I wear the shroud I made,
Let the folds lie straight and neat,
And the rosemary be spread ;-
That if any friend should come
(To see thee, sweet!), all the room
May be lifted out of gloom.
And, dear Bertha, let me keep
On my hand this little ring-
Which at nights, when others sleep,
I can still see glittering.
Let me wear it out of sight,
In the grave—where it will light
All the dark up, day and night.

On that grave drop not a tear !
Else, though fathom-deep the place,
Through the woolen shroud I wear
I shall feel it on my face.
Rather smile there, blessed one,
Thinking of me in the sun;
Or forget me—smiling on! E. B. BROWNING.
VII. RECAPITULATION OF QUALITY.
1. Pure tone is the tone of ordinary conversation, and
of unimpassioned didactic, narrative, or descriptive reading.
2. The orotund is the tone expressive of deep feeling,
of reverence, of sublimity, and of grandeur. It prevails
in oratorical declamation, and in the reading or recita-
tion of lyric or dramatic poetry.
3. Aspirated quality is expressive of secrecy, feebleness,
terror, horror, and amazement.
4. Guttural quality is expressive of disgust, impatience,
hatred, and revenge.
5. The semitone is the plaintive expression, in the minor
key, of pathos, pity, grief, or entreaty.

CHAPTER VI.
MODULATION AND STYLE OF
EXPRESSION.
SECTION I.
MODULATION.
1. Modulation is the variation in the tones of the
voice in order to express the ever-varying thought,
feeling, emotion, or passion to be expressed.
2. These changes depend largely upon the perception,
taste, and judgment of readers; upon the extent to
which readers are capable of entering into the spirit of
what they read; and upon the flexibility of the voice
in expressing different shades of emotion by appropri-
ate tones.
3. There are certain general principles that control
modulation, but there are no fixed rules of detail which
can be applied in the exercise of “good taste.”
4. “ The importance of this principle of adaptation of
voice,” says Prof. William Russell, “may be perceived
by adverting to the fact, that nothing so impairs the
effect of address, as the want of spirit and expression
in elocution.
5. “No gravity of tone, or intensity of utterance, or
precision of enunciation, can atone for the absence of
that natural change of voice, by which the ear is enabled
to receive and recognize the tones of the various emo-
tions accompanying the train of thought which the
speaker is expressing. These, and these only, can indi-


## p. 246 (#252) ############################################

246
SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
cate his own sense of what he utters, or communicate
it by sympathy to his audience.
6. “The adaptation of the voice to the expression of
sentiment is not less important, when considered in ref-
erence to meaning, as dependent on distinctions strictly
intellectual, or not necessarily implying a vivid or varied
succession of emotions.
7. “ The correct and adequate representation of con-
tinuous or successive thought, requires its appropriate
intonation ; as may be observed in those tones of voice
which naturally accompany discussion and argument,
even in their most moderate forms.
8. “The modulation or varying of tone is important,
also, as a matter of cultivated taste. It is the appropri-
ate grace of vocal expression ; it has a charm founded
in the constitution of our nature; it touches the finest
and deepest sensibilities of the soul; it constitutes the
spirit and eloquence of the human voice, whether re-
garded as the noblest instrument of music, or the
appointed channel of thought and feeling.”
1. GENERAL PRINCIPLES.
1. A low key is the natural expression of awe, rever-
ence, solemnity, sadness, and melancholy ; a high key, of
violent passions, such as anger and rage, joy and exulta-
tion. The middle key is the natural pitch of conversation,
and of unimpassioned narrative, descriptive, or didactic
writing.
2. Soft or gentle force is expressive of subdued feeling,
pathos, and tenderness; loud force, of strong passions
and oratorical declamation; moderate force, of unimpas-
sioned thought.
3. Slow movement is appropriate to the expression of
deep thought, power, grandeur, sublimity, solemnity; fast
movement is characteristic of vivacity, joy, and uncon-


## p. 247 (#253) ############################################

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
247
trolled passion; moderate movement, of unimpassioned
narrative, descriptive, or didactic pieces.
4. The whisper is expressive of secrecy, silence, or
extreme fear; guttural quality, of revenge, hatred, despair,
horror, or loathing; the orotund, of power, grandeur,
vastness, sublimity; the falsetto, of puerility or weak-
ness; the semitone, of sadness and pathetic entreaty.
5. The radical stress is expressive of command,
assertion, force, power, and excited feelings; the median
stress, of peace, tranquillity, solemnity, grandeur, sub-
limity, reverence, and awe.
6. Then there is the variety that arises from imitative
reading, or the suiting of the sound to the word, phrase,
or sentence; and that of personation, or the changes of
expression to denote the different characters in a dia-
logue or play.
II. STYLE OF READING.
1. The following analysis of a good style of reading
is taken from Russell's “ American School Reader”: “If
we observe attentively the voice of a good reader or
speaker, we shall find his style of utterance marked by
the following traits. His voice pleases the ear by its
very sound. It is wholly free from affected suavity;
yet, while perfectly natural, it is round, smooth, and
agreeable. It is equally free from the faults of feeble-
ness and of undue loudness.
2. “It is perfectly distinct, in the execution of every
sound, in every word. It is free from errors of negli-
gent usage and corrupted style in pronunciation. It
avoids a measured, rhythmical chant, on the one hand,
and a broken, irregular movement, on the other.
3. “It renders expression clear, by an attentive ob-
servance of appropriate pauses, and gives weight and
effect to sentiment, by occasional impressive cessations
of voice. It sheds light on the meaning of sentences,


## p. 248 (#254) ############################################

248
SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
by the emphatic force which it gives to significant and
expressive words.
4. “It avoids the 'school’ tone of uniform inflections,
and varies the voice upward or downward, as the suc-
cessive clauses of a sentence demand. It marks the
character of every emotion, by its peculiar traits of
tone; and hence its effect upon the ear, in the utterance
of connected sentences and paragraphs, is like that of
a varied melody, in music, played or sung with ever-
varying feeling and expression.”
SECTION II.
THE READING OF POETRY.
I. INTRODUCTORY.
1. Pupils are sometimes told to read verse as if it were
prose. Such a direction may be given to counteract
the tendency to sing-song, or it may be applied in the
reading of doggerel rhymes; but it cannot be applied to
the reading of poetry.
2. Poetry, being the language of imagination, senti-
ment, or passion, requires, as compared with prose, a
greater variety of expression. Moreover, poetry is
rhythmical and melodious, and, in reading it, attention
must be given to movement and harmony.
3. “The modulation of the voice,” says Prof. Russell,
“in adaptation to different species of metrical composi-
tion, is indispensable to the appropriate or effective
reading of verse. The purest forms of poetry become,
when deprived of this aid, nothing but awkward prose.
A just and delicate observance of the effect of meter,
on the other hand, is one of the surest means of im-
parting that inspiration of feeling which it is the de-
sign of poetry to produce.”


## p. 249 (#255) ############################################

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
249
4. In the reading of poetry, the pupil should bear in
mind the following hints : (1) The movement, or time,
in verse, is generally slower than in prose, the vowel
alá liquid sounds being slightly prolonged. (2) In
poetry, as compared with prose, the force is somewhat
softened for the sake of melody. (3) The existence of
meter in poetry requires a rendering of verse different
from the reading of prose. The meter should not be
made prominent, but should be delicately indicated. As
in prose, attention must be given to the sense, to em-
phagia, and to inflection.
II. CÆSURAL PAUSES.
The cæsural pause is a slight rest occurring some-
where near the middle of the line in certain kinds of
verse. In heroic and blank verse, it commonly falls at
the end of the fourth syllable. In sinoothly written
verse, the grammatical pause marking a phrase or a
clause is often made to coincide with the cæsural pause.
EXAMPLES.
1. This is the place, | the centre of the grove :
Here stands the oak, | the monarch of the wood.
How sweet and solemn is this midnight scene !
The silver moon, | unclouded, holds her way
Through skies where I could count each little star;
The fanning west wind | scarcely stirs the leaves.
2. A man he was to all the country dear,
And passing rich | with forty pounds a year;
Remote from towns | he ran his godly race,
Nor e'er had changed, I nor wished to change, his place;
Unpracticed he | to fawn, or seek for power,
By doctrines fashioned to the varying hour;
Far other aims | his heart had learned to prize,
More skilled to raise | the wretched than to rise.

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
JII. METER, OR RHYTHMICAL ACCENT.
1. Meter is the measure of rhythm, or metrical feet,
in poetry. One difference between the reading of prose
and of poetry consists in the distinctive marking of the
rhythm in verse. If read without regard to rhythm,
the sonorous harmony of the higher forms of poetry is
lost.
2. As some knowledge of prosody is generally obtained
from the school text-books on rhetoric, only an allusion
to the subject is necessary in a manual of elocution.
3. In reading poetry, the measure should be delicately
indicated, but not made so prominent as to run into
sing-song, or to break the grammatical relation of words.
4. The melody of verse often depends on making some
word, or successive words, slightly emphatic, as in the
following line from Longfellow's “Psalm of Life:”
“And things are not what they | seem.”
If “not” is emphasized, the rhythm is broken. So in
the successive stanzas of Bryant's “Planting of the
Apple-tree,” the emphasis in the last line of the suc-
cessive stanzas falls as follows :
1. “So plant we | the apple-tree.”
2. “When we plant | the apple-tree," etc.
IV. KINDS OF VERSE.
1. The following summary from Prof. Russell's “Amer-
ican Elocutionist” may be of interest to the critical
student: “The influence of the various kinds of verse
on the voice may be considered as affecting generally
the rate, or movement, and the time, of utterance.
2. “Thus, blank verse is remarkably slou, and stately
in the character of its tone; and the timing of the
pauses requires attention chiefly to length. Heroic verse
is commonly in the same prevailing strain, but not to
such an extent as the preceding.


## p. 251 (#257) ############################################

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
251
3. “The octo-syllabic meter is generally more quick and
lively in its movement, and the pauses are comparatively
brief. But, under the influence of slow time, it gives
intensity to grief, and tenderness to the pathetic tone.
4. “The quatrain, or four-lined stanza, in the common
form (called sometimes common meter), has a compara-
tively musical arrangement of the lines, and a peculiar
character in its cadence, which admits of its expressing
the extremes of emotion whether grave or gay. It prevails,
accordingly, in hymns and in ballads alike, whether the
latter are pathetic or humorous. It derives the former
character from the observance of slow rate, and the lat-
ter from quick rate.
5. “Trochaic verse has a peculiar energy, from the
abruptness of its character—the foot commencing either
with a long or an accented syllable. In gay pieces, and
with quick time in utterance, it produces a dancing strain
of voice, peculiarly adapted to the expression of joy ;
while in grave and vehement strains, with slow time, it
produces the utmost force and severity of tone. These
two extremes are strikingly exemplified in Milton's
L'Allegro' and `Il Penseroso. .
6. “ Anapostic meter has a peculiar fullness and sweet-
ness of melody. Slow time accordingly renders it deeply
pathetic, and quick time renders it the most graceful
expression of joy. This, as well as iambic and trochaic
verse, becomes well fitted to express the mood of calm-
ness and tranquillity, when the rate is rendered moderate.”
V. ACCENT OF WORDS.
The accent of a word is sometimes changed to prevent
breaking the measure, as in the following exainples :
1. Ye icefalls ! ye that from your dizzy heights
Adown enormous rav'ines slope amain.
2. That thou, dead corse, arrayed in com'plete steel.


## p. 252 (#258) ############################################

252
SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
3. And these few precepts in thy memory, see thou
charac'ter.
4. Then lend the eye a terrible aspecť.
5. I must be patient till the heavens look with an
aspecť more favorable.
VI. FINAL -ED.
The final -ed is often sounded as a separate syllable,
to prevent a break in the meter.
EXAMPLES.
1. To live with her and live with thee
In unreprovéd pleasures free.
2. Of linked sweetness long drawn out.
3. Rode arméd men adown the glen.
4. Through this the well-belovéd Brutus stabbed.
5. And as he plucked his curséd steel away.
6. To wear an undeservéd dignity.
7. That orbéd maiden with white fire laden.
8. Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer.
9 While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,
The advised head defends itself at home.
VII. RHYME.
In reading poetry, the words that rhyme must some-
times be specially emphasized. Sometimes, also, the pro-
nunciation of a word may be changed to make it rhyme
with another word, as wind for wỉnd.
In reading the following couplet from Hudibras,
“And pulpit, drum ecclesiastic,
He beat with drum instead of a stick,”
it becomes necessary to emphasize the a, or rather to


## p. 253 (#259) ############################################

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
253
sound the two words “a stick” like a word of two syl-
lables accented on the first, thus—a'stick.
In reading the following lines from the same poem,
the word “coloneling” is pronounced exactly as it is
spelled, colo nel ing, in four syllables :
“Then did Sir Knight abandon dwelling,
And out he rode a-coloneling.”
Also, in the following
“And wisely tell what hour o'th' day
The clock does strike, by algebrā,”
the long sound is given to final a in algebra, to make
the word rhyme with day.
In the following couplets from Holmes, the rhyming
words are italicized for emphasis :
“It is a pity and a shame-alas! alas ! I know it is,
To tread the trodden grapes again, but so it has been,
so it is."
In this example the three words,“ know it is,” are
pronounced like a word of three syllables, accented on
the first, thus—know'-it-is; so, also, so'-it-is.
VIII. EXAMPLES OF RHYME.
1. AT THE ATLANTIC DINNER.
I suppose it's myself that you 're making allusion to,
And bringing the sense of dismay and confusion to.
Of course some must speak—they are always selected to,
But pray what's the reason that I am expected to ?
I'm not fond of wasting my breath as those fellows do
That want to be blowing forever as bellows do;
Their legs are uneasy, but why will you jog any
That long to stay quiet beneath the mahogany ?
HOLMES.
2. CLASS MEETING, 1875.
It is a pity and a shame—alas ! alas ! I know it is,
To tread the trodden grapes again, but so it has been,
so it is;

The purple vintage long is past, with ripened clusters
bursting so
They filled the wine-vats to the brim—'t is strange you
will be thirsting so!
For who can tell by what he likes what other people's
fancies are ?
How all men think the best of wives their own par-
ticular Nancies are !
If what I sing you brings a smile, you will not stop
to catechise,
Nor read Baotia’s lumbering line with nicely scanning
Attic eyes.
Though on the once unfurrowed brows the harrow-teeth
of Time may show,
Though all the strain of crippling years the halting
feet of rhyme may show,
We look and hear with melting hearts, for what we all
remember is
The morn of Spring, nor heed how chill the sky of
gray November is.
Thanks to the gracious powers above from all mankind
that singled us,
And dropped the pearl of friendship in the cup they
kindly mingled us,
And bound us in a wreath of flowers with hoops of
steel knit under it; —
Nor time, nor space, nor chance, nor change, nor death
himself shall sunder it !
HOLMES.

SECTION III.
IMITATIVE READING.
The extent to which imitative reading, or the suiting
of sound to sense, may properly be carried, in certain
classes of selections, is a matter in regard to which
there is a diversity of opinion among elocutionists. It
is one of those questions of taste that cannot be regu-
lated by definite directions applicable to all cases. Some
general principles, however, may be laid down, from
which there is no intelligent dissent.
. The style of reading should be imitative in the sense
of making it conform to the spirit and meaning of the
piece.
In the utterance of words in which the sound seems
to approximate to the sense, such as buzz, hiss, thunder,
groan, sigh, scream, etc., the tone may be suggestive of
the idea. Thus, in reading such passages as,
“From his lips escaped a groan,"
though an actual groan would be ridiculous, the word
“groan” may be uttered so as to suggest a groan.
EXAMPLES.
1. Hear the loud alàrum bells—brázen bells.
2. Clang ! clang! the massive anvils ring.
3. Blow, bugle; answer echoes, dying, dying, dying.
4. Oh! the bells ! what a tale their terror tells
Of despair !
How they clang, and clash, and roar,
What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the palpitating air !
Wherever the author distinctly suggests an imitation,
it should be given so far as is consistent with good
taste. Thus, when Longfellow writes,
“And loud that clarion voice replied,”


## p. 256 (#262) ############################################

256
SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
it is evident that the refrain, “ Excelsior !” should be
given in a loud, clear, resonant manner.
EXAMPLES FOR PRACTICE.
1. A voice replied far up the height, “ Excelsior !”
2. She seemed in the same silver tones to say,
“Passing away, passing away!”
3. What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous
bird of yore
Meant in croaking, “Nevermore.”
4. An ancient time-piece says to all,
“ Forever-never ! Never-forever !”
5. “To all the truth we tell, we tell,”
Shouted in ecstasies a bell.
6. BUNKER HILL.
How the bayonets gleamed and glistened, as we looked
far down and listened
To the trampling and the drum-beat of the belted gren-
adiers.
Over heaps all torn and gory—shall I tell the fearful
story,
How they surged above the breastwork as a sea breaks
o’er a deck ;
How, driven, yet scarce defeated, our worn-out men
retreated,
With their powder-horns all emptied, like the swimmers
from a wreck!
HOLMES.
Imitation should not be too literal. The attempt is
sometimes made in reading Tennyson's “Bugle Song,”
to give a realistic imitation of the notes of a bugle.
While the professional reader may attempt such a feat
of vocal gymnastics, it is certainly outside of the limits
of good taste in school reading. The words, “ Blow,


## p. 257 (#263) ############################################

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
257
bugle, blow," may be given with a prolonged swell, and
in a thin, clear, pure tone, so as to suggest the bugle
note.
So in reciting Poe's “Bells,” the imitative rendering
is often carried to a ridiculous extreme. In these and
similar cases it is not a literal reproduction of the
sound that should be attempted, but an artistic and
idealized suggestion of it.
EXAMPLES.
1. And grummer, grummer, grummer,
Rolled the drum of the drummer,
Through the morn.
And rounder, rounder, rounder,
Roared the iron six-pounder,
Hurling death.
2. I hear them marching o'er the hill;
I hear them fainter, fainter still.
.. . 3. CHURCH BELLS.
“In deeds of love, excel ! excel !”
Chimed out from ivied towers a bell.
"O heed the ancient landmarks well !”
In solemn tones exclaimed a bell.
“Ye purifying waters swell!”
In mellow tones rung out a bell.
“To all the truth we tell! we tell!”
Shouted in ecstasies a bell.
4. WHEN THE COWS COME HOME.
When klingle, klangle, klingle,
Far down the dusty dingle,
The cows are coming home;
Now sweet and clear, now faint and low,
The airy tinklings come and go,
Like chimings from the far-off tower,

Or patterings of an April shower

5. CHARCOAL.
And thus from morn to eve he cried,
"Charco’! charco'!"
While echo faint and far replied,
“Charco'!”—“ Hark, O!"
And in a coaxing tone he cries,
“Charco'! charco’!”
And baby with a laugh replies,
“Ah, go !”—“Ah, go!”.
“Charco’!”—“Ah, go!"
6. FIRE.
Fire! fire! fire !
See the red flames leaping higher.
Peal! peal! peal !
Bells of brass and bells of steel.
Crash ! crash ! crash!
See the fiery surges lash!
Fire ! fire! fire !

And like a silver clarion rung—" Excelsior !”
And from his lips escaped a groan—“Excelsior !"
But still he answered with a sigh—“ Excelsior !"
A voice replied far up the height—" Excelsior !”

SECTION IV.
EXERCISES IN MODULATION.
Modulation is the variation of voice according to the
sentiment, thought, or emotion to be expressed. In im-
passioned reading, tones are the most prominent quali-
ties of voice.
Thorough drill on the following examples will break
up the tendency of pupils to read all kinds of selections
in one formal “school-tone." It is left for teachers and
pupils to exercise their own judgment and taste in the
rendering of these extracts, which embrace a wide range
of expression.
EXAMPLES.
1. Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,
Blow, bugle, answer echoes, dying, dying, dying.
2. The loud wind dwindled to a whisper low.
3. There is a silence where no sound may be.
4. I hear them marching o'er the hill,
I hear them fainter, fainter still.
5. “Cusha, cusha, cusha,” calling.
6. To arms ! to arms! to arms ! they cry.
7. Arm! arm !—it is—it is the cannon's opening roar.

Move slowly! move softly! the sentry may hear.

The infernal gates, and on their hinges grate
Harsh thunder !

Her ever-during gates, harmonious sound,
On golden hinges turning.

Like playful lambs on a mountain side.

Up the high hill he heaves a huge round stone.

And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows.

How frightful the grave! how deserted and drear!
With the howls of the storm-wind, the creaks of the bier,

How peaceful the grave! its quiet how deep!
Its zephyrs breathe calmly, and soft is its sleep,
And flow'rets perfume it with ether.

SECTION V.
DIALECT READING AND PERSONATION.
In dialect reading, the peculiarities of speech should
be reproduced with fidelity, but should not be exagger-
ated. In the reading of dialogues there is, of necessity,
a marked change of tone and manner when the reader
personates two or more characters.
EXAMPLES OF DIALECT READING.
1. SKIPPER IRESON'S RIDE.
Scores of women, old and young,
Strong of muscle, and glib of tongue,
Pushed and pulled up the rocky lane,
Shouting and singing the shrill refrain :
“ Here's Flud Oirson, fur his horrd horrt,
Torr'd an' futherr’d an' corr'd in a corrt
By the women o' Morble’ead !” WHITTIER.
2. THE DEACON'S MASTERPIECE.
But the Deacon swore, as deacons do,
With an “I dew vum,” or an “I tell yeou,"
He would build one shay to beat the taown,
'n' the kaounty 'n' all the kentry raoun';
It should be so built that it couldn' break daown.

Thut the weakes place mus' stan’ the strain;

3. SPRING.
O little city-gals, do n't never go it
Blind on the word o' noospaper or poet!
They’re apt to puff, an' May-day seldom looks
Up in the country ez it doos in books ;
They ’re no more like than hornets’-nests an'hives,
Or printed sarmons be to holy lives.

Tuggin' my foundered feet out by the roots,

Your muslin nosegays from the milliner's

An' dance your throats sore in morocker shoes ; .

1. Diwectly after the season is over in town, I always

the countwy—it's so awful dull—there's such a howid
noise of nothing all day; and there is nothing to see
but gween twees, and cows, and buttercups, and wab-
bits, and all that sort of cattle—I do n't mean exactly
cattle either, but animals, you know.
2. And then the earwigs get into your hair-bwushes
if you leave the bed-woom window open; and if you
lie down on the gwass, those howid gwasshoppers, all
legs, play at leap-frog over your nose, which is howible
torture, and makes you weady to faint, you know, if it
is not too far to call for assistance.
3. And the howid sky is always blue, and everything
bores you; and they talk about the sunshine, as if there
was more sunshine in the countwy than in the city-
which is abthurd, you know-only the countwy sun is
hotter, and bwings you all out in those howid fweckles,

7. THE HEATHEN CHINEE.
Which I wish to remark-
And my language is plain-
That for ways that are dark,
And for tricks that are vain,
The heathen Chinee is peculiar,
Which the same I would rise to explain.
Ah Sin was his name;
And I shall not deny,
In regard to the same,
What that name might imply;
But his smile it was pensive and child-like,
As I frequently remarked to Bill Nye.
It was August the third,
And quite soft was the skies-
Which it might be inferred
That Ah Sin was likewise ;
Yet he played it that day upon William
And me in a way I despise.
Which we had a small game,
And Ah Sin took a hand;
It was Euchre. The same
He did not understand ;
But he smiled as he sat by the table,
With a smile that was child-like and bland.
Yet the cards they were stocked
In a way that I grieve,
And my feelings were shocked
At the state of Nye's sleeve.

Which was stuffed full of aces and bowers,
And the same with intent to deceive.
But the hands that were played
By that heathen Chinee,
And the points that he made,
Were quite frightful to see;
Till at last he put down a right bower,
Which the same Nye had dealt unto me.
Then I looked up at Nye,
And he gazed upon me;
And he rose with a sigh,
And said, “Can this be ?
We are ruined by Chinese cheap labor”-
And he went for that heathen Chinee.
In the scene that ensued
I did not take a hand;
But the floor it was strewed,
Like the leaves on the strand,
With the cards that Ah Sin had been hiding,
In the game he“ did not understand.”
In his sleeves, which were long,
He had twenty-four packs-
Which was coming it strong,
Yet I state but the facts ;
And we found on his nails, which were taper,
What is frequent in tapers—that's wax.
Which is why I remark-
And my language is plain-
That for ways that are dark,
And for tricks that are vain,
The heathen Chinee is peculiar,
Which the same I am free to maintain.

“Hoping it's no harm, I've come to interview you.
I am connected with The Daily Thunderstorm."
“Come to what ?"
“ Interview you.”
“Ah! I see. Yes—yes. Um! Yes-yes.”
“Are you ready to begin ?”
“Ready.”
“How old are you?”
“ Nineteen in June.”
“Indeed! I would have taken you to be thirty-five
or six. Where were you born ?”
“ In Missouri ?”
“When did you begin to write ?”
“In 1836.”
“Why, how could that be, if you are only nineteen
now ?”
“I do n't know. It does seem curious, somehow.”
“It does indeed. Whom do you consider the most
remarkable man you ever met ?”
“Aaron Burr.”
“But you never could have met Aaron Burr, if you
are only nineteen years—’
“Now, if you know more about me than I do, what
do you ask me for ?”
“Well, it was only a suggestion; nothing more. How
did you happen to meet Burr ?”
“Well, I happened to be at his funeral one day; and
he asked me to make less noise, and—”
“But, good heavens! If you were at his funeral, he
must have been dead; and, if he was dead, how could
he care whether you made a noise or not ?”
“I do n't know. He was always a particular kind of
a man that way.”
“Still, I do n't understand it at all. You say he spoke
to you, and that he was dead ?”

"I did n't say he was dead.”
“But was n't he dead ?”.
“Well, some said he was, some said he was n't.”
“ What do you think?”
“Oh, it was none of my business. It was n't any of
my funeral.”
“Did you, However, we can never get this matter
straight. Let me ask about something else. What was
the date of your birth ?”
“Monday, October 31, 1693."
“What! Impossible! That would make you a hun-
dred and eighty years old. How do you account for
that ?”
“I do n't account for it at all.”
“But you said at first you were only nineteen, and
now you make yourself out to be one hundred and
eighty. It is an awful discrepancy."
“Why, have you noticed that ? (Shaking hands.) Many
a time it has seemed to me like a discrepancy; but
some how I could n't make up my mind. How quick
you notice a thing !”
“Thank you for the compliment, as far as it goes.
Had you, or have you, any brothers or sisters ?”
“Eh! 1-1-I think so—yes—but I do n’t remember.”
“Well, that is the most extraordinary statement I
ever heard.”
“Why, what makes you think that ?”
“How could I think otherwise ? Why, look here!
Who is this a picture of on the wall? Is n't that a
brother of yours ?”.
“Oh, yes, yes, yes! Now you remind me of it, that
was a brother of mine. That's William, Bill we called
him. Poor old Bill !”
“Why, is he dead, then?”
“Ah, well, I suppose so. We never could tell. There
was a great mystery about it.”

“That is sad, very sad. He disappeared, then ? "
“Well, yes, in a sort of general way. We buried
him.”
“Buried him! Buried him without knowing whether
he was dead or not?”
“Oh, no! Not that. He was dead enough."
“Well, I confess that I can't understand this. If you
buried him, and you knew he was dead—”
“No, no! We only thought he was.”
“Oh, I see! He came to life again ?"
“I bet he did n’t.”
“Well, I never heard anything like this. Somebody
was dead. Somebody was buried. Now, where was the
mystery ?”
"Ah, that's just it! That's it exactly! You see we
were twins—defunct and I; and we got mixed in the
bath-tub when we were only two weeks old, and one
of us was drowned. But we did n't know which. Some
think it was Bill; some think it was me.”
“Well, that is remarkable. What do you think?"
“Goodness knows! I would give whole worlds to
know. This solemn, this awful mystery has cast a
gloom over my whole life. But I will tell you a secret
now, which I never have revealed to any creature before.
One of us had a peculiar mark, a large mole on the
back of his left hand; that was me. That child was
the one that was drowned.”
“Very well, then, I do n't see that there is any mys-
tery about it, after all.”
“You do n’t ? Well, I do. Anyway, I do n't see how
they could ever have been such a blundering lot as to
go and bury the wrong child. But, 'sh! Don't men-
tion it where the family can hear of it. Heaven knows
they have heart-breaking troubles enough without adding
this.”

pains you have taken. But I was a good deal inter-
ested in that account of Aaron Burr's funeral. Would
you mind telling me what particular circumstance it
was that made you think Burr was such a remarkable
man ?”
“Oh, it was a mere trifle! Not one man in fifty
would have noticed it at all. When the sermon was
over, and the procession all ready to start for the
cemetery, and the body all arranged nice in the hearse,
he said he wanted to take a last look at the scenery;
and so he got up, and rode with the driver."

SHAKESPEARE.
HINTS ABOUT ADDITIONAL SELECTIONS.
Dialogues, dialect pieces, and humorous selections are
useful in school for the purpose of breaking up the
tendency to stiffness, formality, and monotony in read-
ing. There are times when the ripple of laughter is
music in the school-room, and when the sunlight of
humor is needed to dispel the mists of a gloomy day.
There seems to be no good reason why the flashes of
wit and humor that delight a whole nation should be
altogether shut out from the school-room, because they
do not form a part of “classic literature.” Though such
humorous and dialect selections might not seem appro-
priate for a drill-book like this volume, the wise and
cheerful teacher will make good use of them, taking
care, of course, to exclude objectionable selections.
Teachers will do well to bear in mind that the taste
of boys and girls from fourteen to eighteen years of
age is not so critical as that of men and women of
middle age.
These extracts should be read at sight, the book being
passed from hand to hand, and one book serving for
the whole class.
Many excellent selections can be found in such books
as Lowell's “Biglow Papers,” Dickens's “ Pickwick Pa-
pers,” Bret Harte's “Poems,” Saxe's “Poems,” Hood's
“Poems," Mark Twain's books, Monroe's “Humorous
Readings,” Garrett's “Speaker's Garland,” Shoemaker's
“Elocutionist's Annual," and many other books of
* Selections."

PART III.
MISCELLANEOUS SELECTIONS.
SECTION 1.
PROSE SELECTIONS.
1. ELOCUTIONARY TRAINING.
1. Elocutionary training should be begun in early
life, because then the vocal organs are flexible. It is a
serious defect in our school methods of instruction, that
the expressive faculties, comprising feeling, affection,
emotion, passion, imagination, fancy, association, imita-
tion, and description, are called so little into action.
Elocution, when properly taught, calls into active exer-
cise the expressive faculties, and tends to educate the
child as a social being.
2. In most ungraded schools in the country, and in
many city schools, an hour of the closing afternoon of
each week may be usefully devoted to declamation, dia-
logue, and select readings. It is not advisable to compel
every child in school to take part in these exercises, for
there are some who never can become good readers, and
others who are so awkward and diffident that it is cruel
to force them upon the school stage with a declamation.
3. Appropriate selections should at first be made by
(277)

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
the teacher; for the uncultivated taste of pupils will
lead them to choose pieces altogether too difficult, or
utterly worthless when committed to memory. Select
at times, for the boys, short prose declamations, which,
when learned, remain in the memory as models of pure
prose and patriotic feeling. If they learn a poem, let
it not be one made up of doggerel rhymes, or of pain-
ful attempts at a low order of wit.
4. A careful selection of pieces will be the surest
safeguard against the ranting, tearing, overstrained, the-
atrical style of florid oratory which so painfully mars
many school exhibitions. The teacher can take odd
moments at the intermission, or recess, or before and
after school, for the purpose of hearing rehearsals, and
giving special instructions.
5. Teachers should instruct pupils in the elements of
gesture. Gestures spring naturally from the close sym-
pathy of mind and body. A look of the eye, an
expression of the countenance, a movement of the hand,
often convey more than words can express. The prin-
ciples of gesture may be easily learned from any one of
several excellent works on elocution.
6. The reading and recitation of poetry by girls is an
indispensable part of the education of woman, as one
of the most efficient modes of discipline for the taste
and imagination. Many of the most exquisite passages
of the poets can never be fully appreciated until repeater
by the voice of woman.
7. It requires no close observer to perceive the effects
of poetry on the youthful mind. Childhood delights in
the melody of verse, and is pleased with its flowing
harmony of sound. In poetry are embodied some of
the most beautiful lessons of morality; and they are
presented in a manner which arrests the attention and
impresses the character. What teacher has not seen the
dull eye kindle, the vacant countenance take expression,

the face glow with emotion, and the whole boy become
lost in the sentiment of his declamation ?
8. Introduce elocution into school to cultivate a taste
for reading, to exercise and strengthen memory, to
awaken feeling, to excite imagination, and to train those
who are to enter the professions, to become graceful
and pleasing speakers. Introduce it as a relief from
study, a pleasing recreation, and a source of intellectual
enjoyment. Introduce it as a part of the æsthetic edu-
cation so peculiarly appropriate for woman. Make it
as a part of the education of man as an expressive being.
2. GOOD READING.
1. There is one accomplishment, in particular, which I
would earnestly recommend to you. Cultivate assidu-
ously the ability to read well. I stop to particularize
this, because it is a thing so very much neglécted, and
because it is such an elegant and charming accomplish-
ment. Where one person is really interested by músic,
twenty are pleased by good reading. Where one person
is capable of becoming a skillful musician, twenty may
become good rèaders. Where there is one occasion suit-
able for the exercise of musical talent, there are twènty
for that of good rèading.
2. The culture of the voice necessary for rèading well,
gives a delightful charm to the same voice in conversà-
tion. Good réading is the natural exponent and vehicle
of all good things. It seems to bring dead aúthors to
làfe again, and makes us sit down familiarly with the
gréat and good of all ages.
3. What a fascinátion there is in really good rèading!
What a power it gives one! In the hospital, in the
chamber of the invalid, in the nursery, in the doméstic
and in the social circle, among chosen friends and com-
pdnions, how it enables you to minister to the amuse-

ment, the comfort, the pleasure of déar ones as no other
art or accomplishment càn. No instrument of man's
devising can reach the héart as does that most wonder-
ful instrument, the human vòice.
4. If you would double the value of all your other
acquisitions, if you would add immeasurably to your
ówn enjoyment and to your power of promoting the
enjoyment of others, cultivate, with incessant care, this
divine gèft. No music below the skies is equal to that
of pure, silvery spéech from the lips of a man or woman
of high culture.
JOHN 8. Hart.
3. THE MUSIC OF THE HUMAN VOICE.
1. Willis, in his essay on “unwritten music,” has placed
the appropriate sound of the female voice among the
most beautiful of its forms; and there is, unquestiona-
bly, a fine analogy between the sound of the running
brook, the note of the wood-bird, the voice of a happy
child, the low breathing of a flute, and the clear, soft
tone of a woman's voice, when it utters the natural
music of home—the accents of gentleness and love.
2. To a well-tuned ear, there is a rich, deep melody
in the distinctive bass of the male voice, in its subdued
tones. But the key-note of poetry seems to have been
lent to woman. On the ear of infancy and childhood,
her voice was meant to fall as a winning prelude to all
the other melodies of nature; the human nerves are
attuned, accordingly, to the breath of her voice; and,
through life, the chords of the heart respond most
readily to her touch.
3. Yet how often is this result impeded by the pro-
cesses of artificial culture; by the over-excitement of
mind and nerve, attending excessive application ; by that
unwise neglect of health and healthful action, which
dims the eye and deadens the ear to beauty, and robs

281
of otherwise spirit w
life of the joyous and sympathetic spirit which is native
to childhood; and which, otherwise, would ever be gush-
ing forth in notes of gladness and endearment, the
physical not less than the moral charm of human
utterance !
4. There are beautiful exceptions, undoubtedly, to this
general fact of ungainly habit. But the ground of just
complaint is, that there is no provision made in our
systems of education for the cultivation of one of
woman's peculiar endowments—an attractive voice. Our
girls do not come home to us, after their period of
school life, qualified to read with effect in their own
language. There is wanting in their voices that adap-
tation of tone to feeling, which is the music of the
heart in reading; there is wanting that clear, impressive
style which belongs to the utterance of cultivated taste
and judgment, and which enhances every sentiment by
appropriate emphasis and pause; there is even a want
of that distinct articulation which alone can make sound
the intelligible medium of thought. Prof. William RUSSELL.
4. THE ART OF READING.
1. The art of reading well is an accomplishment that
all desire to possess, many think they have already,
and that a few set about to acquire. These, believing
their power is altogether in their genius, are, after a
few lessons from an elocutionist, disappointed at not
becoming themselves at once masters of the art; and
with the restless vanity of their belief, abandon the
study for some new subject of trial and failure. Such
cases of infirmity result in part from the wavering
character of the human tribe; but they chiefly arise
from defects in the usual course of instruction.
2. Go to some of our colleges and universities, and
observe how the art of speaking is not taught there.

See a boy of but fifteen years, with no want of youth-
ful diffidence, and not without a craving desire to
learn, sent upon a stage, pale and choking with appre-
hension; being forced into an attempt to do that,
without instruction, which he came purposely to learn ;
and furnishing amusenient to his classmates, by a
pardonable awkwardness, that should be punished, in
the person of his pretending but neglectful preceptor,
with little less than scourging.
3. Then visit a conservatorio of music; observe there
the elementary outset, the orderly task, the masterly
discipline, the unwearied superintendence, and the in-
cessant toil to reach the utmost accomplishment in the
Singing-Voice; and afterwards do not be surprised that
the pulpit, the senate, the bar, and the chair of medical
professorship, are filled with such abominable drawlers,
mouthers, mumblers, clutterers, squeakers, chanters, and
inongers in monotony; nor that the Schools of Singing
are constantly sending abroad those great instances of
vocal wonder who triumph along the crowded resorts
of the world; who contribute to the halls of fashion
and wealth their most refined source of gratification ;
who sometimes quell the pride of rank by a momentary
sensation of envy; and who draw forth the adıniration
and receive the crowning applause of the prince and sage.
4. The high accomplishments in elocution are sup-
posed to be universally the unacquired gifts of genius,
and to consist of powers and graces beyond the reach
of art. So seem the plainest services of arithmetic to
a savage; and so, to the slave, seem all the ways of
music which modern art has so accurately penned, as
to time, and tune, and momentary grace. Ignorance
knows not what has been done; indolence thinks nothing
can be done; and both uniting, borrow from the abused
eloquence of poetry an aphorism to justify supineness
of inquiry.

5. ON LEARNING BY HEART.
1. Till he has fairly tried it, I suspect a reader does
not know how much he would gain from committing to
memory passages of real excellence; precisely because
he does not know how much he overlooks when merely
reading. Learn one true poem by heart, and see if
you do not find it so. Beauty after beauty will reveal
itself, in chosen phrase, or happy music, or noble sug-
gestion, otherwise undreamed of. It is like looking at
one of Nature's wonders through a microscope.
2. Again : how much in such a poem that you really
did feel admirable and lovely on a first reading, passes
away, if you do not give it a further and much better
reading !-passes away utterly, like a sweet sound, or
an image on the lake, which the first breath of wind
dispels. If you could only fix that image, as the pho-
tographers do theirs, so beautifully, so perfectly! And
you can do so! Learn it by heart, and it is yours for
ever!
3. I have said, a true poem; for naturally men will
choose to learn poetry—from the beginning of time they
have done so. To immortal verse the memory gives a
willing, a joyous, and a lasting home. Some prose,
however, is poetical, is poetry, and altogether worthy
to be learned by heart; and the learning is not so very
difficult. It is not difficult or toilsome to learn that
which pleases us; and the labor, once given, is forgot-
ten, while the result remains.
4. Poems, and noble extracts, whether of verse or of
prose, once so reduced into possession and rendered
truly our own, may be to us a daily pleasure ;-better
far than a whole library unused. They may come to us
in our dull moments, to refresh us as with spring flowers ;
in our selfish musings, to win us by pure delight from
the tyranny of foolish castle-building, self-gratulations,

and mean anxieties. They may be with us in the work-
shop, in the crowded street, by the "fireside; sometimes,
perhaps, on pleasant hill-sides, or by sounding shores ;-
noble friends and companions—our own! never intru-
sive, ever at hand, coming at our call.
5. For those, in particular, whose leisure time is short,
I believe there could not be a better expenditure of
time than deliberately giving an occasional hour-it
requires no more—to committing to memory chosen
passages from great authors. If the mind were thus
daily nourished with a few choice words of the best
English poets and writers ; if the habit of learning by
heart were to become so general, that, as a matter of
course, any person presuming to be educated might be
expected to be equipped with a few good pieces -I be-
lieve that it would lead, much more than the mere
sound of it suggests, to the diffusion of the best kind
of literature and to the right appreciation of it; and
that men would not long rest satisfied with knowing a
few stock pieces.
6. The only objection I can conceive to what I have
been saying is, that a relish for higher literature may
be said to be the result of cultivation, and to belong
· only to the few. But I do not admit that even the
higher literature must belong only to the few. Poetry
is, in the main, essentially catholic-addressed to all
men; and though some poetry requires knowledge and
culture, much, and that the noblest, needs only natural
feeling, and common experience. Such poetry, taken in
moderation, followed with genuine good-will, shared in
common, will be intelligible and delightful to most men
who take the trouble to be students at all, and ever
more and more so.
7. Perhaps, also, there may be a fragment of truth in
what Charles Lamb has said—that any spouting “withers
and blows upon a fine passage ;” that there is no enjoy-

285
ing it after it has been “pawed about by declamatory
boys and men." But surely there is a reasonable habit
of recitation as well as an unreasonable one; there is
no need of declamatory pawing. To abandon all recita-
tion, is to give up a custom which has unquestionably
given delight and instruction to all the races of man-
kind. If our faces are set against vain display, and set
towards rational enjoyment of one another, we need not
fear that our social evenings will be marred by an oc-
casional recitation. And, moreover, it is not for recit-
ing's sake that I chiefly recommend this most faithful
form of reading-learning by heart.
8. I come back, therefore, to this, that learning by
heart is a good thing, and that it is neglected among us.
Why is it neglected ? Partly because of our indolence;
but partly, I believe, because we do not sufficiently con-
sider that it is a good thing, and needs to be taken in
hand. We need to be reminded of it. I here remind
you. Like a town-crier, ringing my bell, I would say
to you,“Oyez, oyez! Lost, stolen, or strayed, a good
ancient practice—the good ancient practice of learning
by heart. Every finder shall be handsomely rewarded.”
9. If you ask, “What shall I learn?” the answer is,
do as you do with tunes—begin with what you sincerely
like best, what you would most wish to remember, what
you would most enjoy saying to yourself or repeating
to another. You will soon find the list inexhaustible.
Then “keeping up” is easy. Every one has spare ten
minutes : one of the problems of life is how to employ
them usefully. You may well spend some in looking
after and securing this good property you have won.

6. SCHOOL LIBRARIES.
1. The influence of well-selected books in a school is
second only to that of the teacher; and in many in-
stances the information, self-gleaned by the pupils, is
the most valuable part of a common-school education.
2. A teacher may fail in the discharge of duty; but
the golden grains of thought gleaned from good books
will spring up in the youthful minds and yield their
fruit, just as certainly as the fertile soil of our beauti-
ful valleys rewards the toil of the husbandman with a
bountiful harvest.
3. The object and aim of the public school should be
to give children a thirst for information, a taste for
reading; to make them alive to knowledge; to set them
out on the path of self-education through life. Why
teach them to read at all, if books be not afterwards
furnished for them to read ?
4. Not many years ago, in one of the obscure towns
of Massachusetts, there lived a farmer's boy who “went
to a common school” in the winter, and worked on the
farm in summer. The books of a little town library
fell into his hands; he devoured them, and hungered
for more. He grew to be a man, and was acknowledged
by all to be the most distinguished American educator
of his time.
5. Every public school in our country is a debtor to
Horace Mann. He thus graphically sums up the advan-
tage of a school library : “Now no one thing will
contribute more to intelligent reading in our schools
than a well-selected library; and, through intelligence,
the library will also contribute to rhetorical ease, grace,
and expressiveness. Wake up a child to a consciousness
of power and beauty, and you might as easily confine
Hercules to a distaff, or bind Apollo to a tread-mill, as
to confine his spirit within the mechanical round of a

287
school-room where such mechanism still exists. Let a
child read and understand such stories as the friendship
of Damon and Pythias, the integrity of Aristides, the
fidelity of Regulus, the purity of Washington, the invinci-
ble perseverance of Franklin, and he will think differently
and act differently all the days of his remaining life.
6. “Let boys or girls of sixteen years of age read an
intelligible and popular treatise on astronomy and geol-
ogy, and from that day new heavens will bend over their
heads, and a new earth will spread out beneath their feet.
A mind accustomed to go rejoicing over the splendid
regions of the material universe, or to luxuriate in the
richer worlds of thought, can never afterwards read like
a wooden machine-a thing of cranks and pipes—to say
nothing of the pleasures and the utility it will realize.”
7. POEMS.
1. Now I tell you a poem must be kept and used,
like a meerschaum or a violin. A poem is just as
porous as the meerschaum—the more porous it is, the
better. I mean to say that a genuine poem is capable
of absorbing an indefinite amount of the essence of our
own humanity-its tenderness, its heroism, its regrets,
its aspirations—so as to be gradually stained through
with a divine secondary color derived from ourselves.
So, you see, it must take time to bring the sentiment
of a poem into harmony with our nature by staining
ourselves through every thought and image our being
can penetrate.
2. Then, again, as to the mere music of a new poem ;
why, who can expect anything more from that than
from the music of a violin fresh from the maker's
hands ? Now you know very well that there are no
less than fifty-eight different pieces in a violin. These

288
SCHOOL ELOCUTION
pieces are strangers to each other, and it takes a cen-
tury, more or less, to make them thoroughly acquainted.
At last they learn to vibrate in harmony, and the in-
strument becomes an organic whole, as it were a great
seed capsule, which had grown from a garden-bed in
Cremona, or elsewhere. Besides, the wood is juicy and
full of sap for fifty years or so, but at the end of fifty
or a hundred more gets tolerably dry and comparatively
resonant.
3. Do n't you see that all this is just as true of a
poem? Counting each word as a piece, there are more
pieces in an average copy of verses than in a violin.
The poet has forced all these words together, and fast-
ened them, and they do n't understand it at first. But
let the poem be repeated aloud, and murmured over in
the mind's muffled whisper often enough, and at length
the parts become knit together in such absolute soli-
darity that you could not change a syllable without the
whole world's crying out against you for meddling with
the harmonious fabric.
HOLMES.
8. SCROOGE AND MARLEY.
1. Marley was dead, to begin with. There is no doubt
whatever about that. The register of his burial was
signed by the clergyman, the clerk, the undertaker, and
the chief mourner. Scrooge signed it. And Scrooge's
name was good upon 'Change, for anything he chose to
put his hand to. Old Marley was as dead as a door-
nail.
2. Mind! I do n't mean to say that I know, of my
own knowledge, what there is particularly dead about
a door-nail. I might have been inclined myself, to
regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece of ironmongery
in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is in

289
the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb
it, or the country's done for. You will therefore per-
mit me to repeat, emphatically, that Marley was as dead
as a door-nail.
3. Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did.
How could it be otherwise ? Scrooge and be were
partners for I do n't know how many years. Scrooge
was his sole executor, his sole administrator, his sole
assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and
sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dread-
fully cut up by the sad event, but that he was an ex-
cellent man of business on the very day of the funeral,
and solemnized it with an undoubted bargain.
4. Scrooge never painted out old Marley's name.
There it stood, years afterwards, above the warehouse
door: Scrooge and Marley. The firm was known as
Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people new to the
business called Scrooge, Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,
but he answered to both names. It was all the same
to him.
5. Oh! but he was a tight-fisted hand at the grind-
stone, Scrooge! A squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scrap-
ing, clutching, covetous old sinner! Hard and sharp
as flint from which no steel had ever struck out gen-
erous fire; secret, and self-contained, and solitary as an
oyster. The cold within him froze his old features,
nipped his pointed nose, shriveled his cheek, stiffened
his gait; made his eyes red, his thin lips blue; and
spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice. A frosty rime
was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry
chin. He carried his own low temperature always
about with him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and
did n't thaw it one degree at Christmas.
6. External heat and cold had little influence on
Scrooge. No warmth could warm, no wintry weather
chill him. No wind that blew was bitterer than he, no
19

falling snow was more intent upon its purpose, no
pelting rain less open to entreaty. Foul weather did n't
know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow,
and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over
him in only one respect. They often “came down
handsomely," and Scrooge never did.
7. Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say,
with gladsome looks,“ My dear Scrooge, how are you?
When will you come to see me?” No beggars implored
him to bestow a trifle, no children asked him what it
was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all his life
inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge.
Even the blind men's dogs appeared to know him; and
when they saw him coming on, would tug their owners
into doorways and up courts; and then would wag
their tails as though they said, “No eye at all is better
than an evil eye, dark master!”
8. But what did Scrooge care! It was the very
thing he liked. To edge his way along the crowded
paths of life, warning all human sympathy to keep its
distance, was what the knowing ones called “nuts” to
Scrooge.
9. Once upon a time-of all the good days in the
year, on Christmas eve-old Scrooge sat busy in his
counting-house. It was cold, bleak, biting weather :
foggy withal; and he could hear the people in the
court outside go wheezing up and down, beating their
hands upon their breasts, and stamping their feet upon
the pavement stones to warm them. The city clocks
had only just gone three, but it was quite dark already
it had not been light all day—and candles were flaring
in the windows of the neighboring offices, like ruddy
smears upon the palpable brown air. The fog came
pouring in at every chink and key-hole, and was so
dense without, that although the court was of the nar-
rowest, the houses opposite were mere phantoms. To

see the dingy cloud come drooping down, obscuring
everything, one might have thought that Nature lived
hard by, and was brewing on a large scale.
10. The door of Scrooge's counting-house was open,
that he might keep his eye upon his clerk, who in a
dismal little cell beyond, a sort of tank, was copying
letters. Scrooge had a very small fire, but the clerk's
fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one
coal. But he could not replenish it, for Scrooge kept
the coal-box in his own room; and so surely as the
clerk came in with the shovel, the master predicted that
it would be necessary for them to part. Wherefore, the
clerk put on his white comforter, and tried to warm
himself at the candle; in which effort, not being a man
of a strong imagination, he failed.
11. “A merry Christmas, uncle! God save you!”
cried a cheerful voice. It was the voice of Scrooge's
nephew, who came upon him so quickly that this was
the first intimation Scrooge had of his approach.
“ Bah!” said Scrooge; “ humbug !”
“ Christmas a humbug, uncle! You do n't mean that,
I am sure ?”
12. “I do. Out upon merry Christmas! What's
Christmas time to you but a time for paying bills
without money; a time for finding yourself a year
older, and not an hour richer; a time for balancing
your books and having every item in 'em through a
round dozen of months presented dead against you ?
If I had my will, every idiot who goes about with
Merry Christmas' on his lips should be boiled with his
own pudding, and buried with a stake of holly through
his heart. He should !”
“Uncle !”
13. “Nephew, keep Christmas in your own way, and
let me keep it in mine."
“Keep it! But you do n't keep it.”
I had my will
his lips should of holly through

“Let me leave it alone, then. Much good may it do
you! Much good it has ever done you!”
14.“ There are many things from which I might
have derived good, by which I have not profited, I dare
say, Christmas among the rest. But I am sure I have
always thought of Christmas time, when it has come
round-apart from the veneration due to its sacred
origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from
that—as a good time; a kind, forgiving, charitable,
pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long
calendar of the year, when men and women seem by
one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to
think of people below them as if they really were fel-
low-travelers to the grave, and not another race of
creatures bound on other journeys. And therefore,
uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver
in my pocket, I believe that it has done me good, and
will do me good; and I say, God bless it !”
The clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded.
15. “Let me hear another sound from you,” said
Scrooge, “and you 'll keep your Christmas by losing
your situation! You ’re quite a powerful speaker, sir,"
he added, turning to his nephew. “I wonder you do n't
go into Parliament.”
“Do n't be angry, uncle. Come! Dine with us to-
morrow.”
16. Scrooge said that he would see him-yes, indeed
he did. He went the whole length of the expression,
and said that he would see him in that extremity first.
“But why ?” cried Scrooge's nephew. “Why ?”
“Why did you get married ?”.
“ Because I fell in love."
17. “Because you fell in love !” growled Scrooge, as
if that were the only one thing in the world more rid-
iculous than a merry Christmas. “Good-afternoon!”
“Nay, uncle, but you never came to see me before

that happened. Why give it as a reason for not coming
now ?”
“Good-afternoon !”
“I want nothing from you; I ask nothing of you ;
why cannot we be friends ?”.
“Good-afternoon !”
18. “I am sorry, with all my heart, to find you so
resolute. We have never had any quarrel to which I
have been a party. But I have made the trial in homage
to Christmas, and I 'll keep my Christmas humor to the
last. So a merry Christmas, uncle !”
“Good-afternoon!”
“And a happy New Year!”
“Good-afternoon!”
DICKENS'S “ Christmas Carol."
9. DEFENSE OF POETRY.
1. We believe that poetry, far from injuring society,
is one of the great instruments of its refinement and
exaltation. It lifts the mind abòve ordinary life, gives
it a rèspite from depressing cáres, and awakens the con-
sciousness of its affinity with what is púre and noble.
In its legitimate and highest efforts, it has the same
tendency and aim with Christidnity; that is, to spàr-
itualize our nature.
2. Trúe, poetry has been made the instrument of více,
the pander of bad pássions; but when genius thus
stoops, it dims its fíres, and parts with much of its
power; and even when Poetry is enslaved to licéntious-
ness and misènthropy, she can not wholly forget her
trúe vocation. Strains of púre féeling, touches of tender-
ness, images of innocent háppiness, sympathies with what
is good in our náture, bursts of scorn or indignation
at the hollowness of the world, passages true to our
moral nature, often escape in an immóral work, and

SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
show us how hard it is for a gifted spirit to divorce
itself wholly from what is good.
3. Poetry has a natural alliance with our best affèc-
tions. It delights in the beauty and sublimity of outward
náture and of the soul. It indeed portrays with terrible
energy the excèsses of the pássions, but they are passions
which show a mighty nature, which are full of power,
which command áwe, and excite a deep though shudder-
ing sympathy
4. Its great téndency and púrpose is to carry the mind
beyond and above the beaten, dústy, wéary walks of ordi-
nary life; to lift it into a pùrer element, and to breathe
into it more profound and génerous emotion. It reveals
to us the loveliness of ndture, brings back the freshness
of youthful fèeling, revives the relish of simple pleasures,
keeps unquenched the enthusiasm which warmed the
spring-time of our bèing, refines youthful love, strength-
ens our interest in human náture by vivid delineations
of its tenderest and loftiest fèelings, spreads our sympa-
thies over all classes of society, knits us by new ties with
Universal bèing, and, through the brightness of its pro-
phetic visions, helps faith to lay hold on the future làfe.
5. We are aware that it is objécted to poetry that it
gives wrong views and excites false expectations of life,
peoples the mind with shadows and illusions, and builds
up imagination on the ruins of wisdom. That there is
a wisdom against which poetry wárs- the wisdom of the
sēnses, which makes physical comfort and gratification
the supreme good, and wealth the chief interest of life-
we do not denġ; nor do we deem it the least sérvice
which poetry renders to mankind, that it redèems them
from the thralldom of this earth-born prudence.
6. But, passing over this topic, we would observe that
the complaint against poetry, as abounding in illusion
and decéption, is, in the main, groundless. In many
poems there is more of trắth than in many histories and

295
philosophic theories. The fictions of génius are often the
véhicles of the sublimest vérities, and its flashes often
open new règions of thought, and throw new light on
the mysteries of our bèing. In poetry, when the letter is
fălsehood, the spirit is often profoundest wisdom.
7. And if trûth thus dwells in the boldest fictions of
the poet, much more may it be expected in his delinea-
tions of life; for the present life, which is the first stáge
of the immortal mind, abộunds in the materials of poetry,
and it is the high office of the bard to detect this divine
element among the grosser labors and pleasures of our
earthly being. The present life is nột wholly prosaic,
precise, táme, and finite. To the gëfted eye it abounds
in the poétic.
8. The affections, which spread beyond ourselves and
stretch far into futúrity; the workings of mighty pássions,
which seem to arm the soul with an almost superhuman
énergy; the innocent and irrepressible joy of infancy;
the bloon, and búoyancy, and dazzling hopes of youth ;
the throbbings of the heart, when it firstwakes to love,
and dreams of a happiness too vast for earth; woman,
with her beaúty, and gráce, and gentleness, and fullness
of feeling, and depth of affection, and blushes of púrity,
and the tónes and looks which only a mother's heart can
inspíre—these are all poetical.
9. It is not trûe that the poet paints a life which
does not exist. He only extracts and concentrates, as it
wére, life's ethereal èssence, arrests and condénses its
volatile fràgrance, brings together its scattered bèauties,
and prolongs its more refined but evanescent jòys. And
in thỏs he does well; for it is good to feel that life is
not wholly usurped by cares for subsistence and physical
gratifications, but admits, in measures which may be
indefinitely enlárged, sentiments and delights worthy of
a higher bèing.

10. FALSTAFF.
(This extract affords an example of “humorous style,” with prevail-
ing circumflex inflections.]
1. There is something cordial in a făt mán. Every-
body likes hăm, and he likes éverybody. Food does a făt
man gôod ; it clàngs to him; it fràctifies upon him; he
swells nóbly out, and fills a génerous spèce in life. A
făt man, therefore, almost in virtue of being a fat mán,
is, per sé, a popular màn; and he commonly deserves his
popularity.
2. A făt man feels his position sólid in the world;
he knows that his being is cognizable ; he knows that
he has a márked plàce in the úniverse, and that he need
take no extraordinary pains to advertise mankind that
he is among them; he knows that he is in no danger
of being overlộoked.
3. A făt man is the nearest to that most perfect of
figures, a mathemátical sphere; a thin man, to that most
limited of conceivable dimensions, a simple lîne. A făt
man is a being of harmónious volume, and holds relations
to the material universe in every direction ; a thin man
has nothing but length ; a thin man, in fact, is but the
continuation of a pôint.
4. Well then might Falstaff exult in his sèze ; well
might he mock at the prince, and his other léan contêm-
poraries; and, accordingly, when he would address the
prince in terms the most degráding, he heaps èpithet
upon èpithet, each expressive of the utmost lèanness.
“ Awây, you stârveling,” he exclaims; “ you eel-skin ; you
dried neats-tongue; you stôck-fish. O for bréath to utter
what is like thee!”
5. Falstaff was an ěpicure, but no glûtton. He was
not a great eater, for his bill contained a halfpenny-
worth of bread to an intolerable quantity of sâck. And
although Falstaff was a large držnker, he was no inebriate.

And here we conceive a consúmmate àrt in Shákespeare,
who sustains Falstaff throughout in our intelléctual
respect. . . .
6. As to lies, they were in the way of his vocàtion.
The highest stretch of imagination could not even sús-
pect him of verăcity; and if he had any dúpes, they were
strongly in love with decèption. His lies, too, were the
lies of a professed and known wît; they were designed
only for lúdicrous èffect, and generally were little more
than cómic exaggeràtions. In the events at Gad's hill,
and those that immediately follow them, there is an
epitome of the whole character of Falstaff; but there is,
at the same tíme, an evident design on the part of the
poet, to bring out his peculiarities with grotésque extràv-
agance, and to produce the broadest and the most comic
result. . . .
7. Falstaff has both wit and hùmor ; but more of wit,
I think, than húmor. Between wit and humor there is
an evident distinction, but to submit the distinction to
minute criticism would require more time than we can
spàre; and, after all, it is more easy to feel than to
explâin it. Wit implies thought ; húmor, sensibility. Wit
deals with ideas; húmor, with âctions and with mân-
ners. Wit may be a thing of pure imagination ; húmor
involves sentiment and character. Wit is an éssence ;
húmor, an incarndtion.
8. Wit and humor, however, have some qualities in
common. Both develop unexpected andlogies; both in-
clude the principles of contrast and assimilation; both
detect inward resěmblances amidst éxternal dìfferences,
and the result of both is pléasurable surprise ; the sur-
prise from wit excites admirátion, the surprise from
húmor stimulates mérriment, and produces làughter.
9. Falstaff's wăt is rich as his imagination ; as prolífic
as it is felàcitous. It is pùngent, còpious, brilliant in
expression, and decisive in effèct. It never falls short of

HENRY GILES.
11. WEALTH.
1. As soon as a stranger is introduced into any com-
pany, one of the first questions which all wish to have
answered, is, How does that man get his living? And
with reason. He is no whole man until he knows how
to earn a blameless livelihood. Society is barbarous,
until every industrious man can get his living without
dishonest customs.
2. Every man is a consumer, and ought to be a pro-
ducer. He fails to make his place good in the world,
unless he not only pays his debt, but also adds some-
thing to the common wealth. Nor can he do justice
to his genius, without making some larger demand on
the world than a bare subsistence. He is by constitu-
tion expensive, and needs to be rich.
.
3. Wealth has its source in applications of the mind
to nature, from the rudest strokes of spade and ax,
up to the last secrets of art. Intimate ties subsist be-
tween thought and all production ; because a better or-
der is equivalent to vast amounts of brute labor. The
forces and the resistances are Nature's, but the mind
acts in bringing things from where they abound to where
they are wanted; in wise combining; in directing the
practice of the useful arts, and in the creation of finer
values, by fine art, by eloquence, by song, or the repro-
ductions of memory.
4. Wealth is in applications of mind to nature; and
the art of getting rich consists not in industry, much
less in saving, but in a better order, in timeliness, in
being at the right spot. One man has stronger arms,
or longer legs; another sees by the course of streams,

and growth of markets, where land will be wanted,
makes a clearing to the river, goes to sleep, and wakes
up rich. Steam is no stronger now, than it was a hun-
dred years ago; but is put to better use. A clever
fellow was acquainted with the expansive force of steam ;
he also saw the wealth of wheat and grass rotting in
Michigan. Then he cunningly screws on the steam-pipe
to the wheat crop. Puff now, 0 Steam! The steam
puffs and expands as before, but this time it is dragging
all Michigan at its back to hungry New York and
hungry England.
5. Coal lay in ledges under the ground since the
flood, until a laborer with pick and windlass brings it
to the surface. We may well call it black diamonds.
Every basket is power and civilization. For coal is a
portable climate. It carries the heat of the tropics to
Labrador and the polar circle: and it is the means of
transporting itself whithersoever it is wanted. Watt
and Stephenson whispered in the ear of mankind their
secret, that a half ounce of coal will draw two tons a
mile, and coal carries coal, by rail and by boat, to make
Canada as warm as Calcutta, and with its comfort brings
its industrial power.
6. When the farmer's peaches are taken from under
the tree, and carried into town, they have a new look,
and a hundredfold value over the fruit which grew on
the same bough, and lies fulsomely on the ground.
The craft of the merchant is this bringing a thing from
where it abounds, to where it is costly.
7. Wealth begins in a tight roof that keeps the rain
and wind out; in a good pump that yields you plenty
of sweet water; in two suits of clothes, so to change
your dress when you are wet; in dry sticks to burn;
in a good double-wick lamp; and three meals; in a
horse, or a locomotive, to cross the land; in a boat to
cross the sea; in tools to work with ; in books to read;

and so, in giving, on all sides, by tools and auxiliaries,
the greatest possible extension to our powers, as if it
added feet, and hands, and eyes, and blood, length to
the day, and knowledge, and good-will.
8. Wealth begins with these articles of necessity. And
here we must recite the iron law which Nature thunders
in these northern climates. First, she requires that each
man should feed himself. If, happily, his fathers have
left him no inheritance, he must go to work, and by
making his wants less, or his gains more, he must draw
himself out of that state of pain and insult in which
she forces the beggar to lie. She gives him no rest
until this is done. She starves, taunts, and torments
him, takes away warmth, laughter, sleep, friends, and
daylight, until he has fought his way to his own loaf.
Then, less peremptorily, but still with sting enough,
she urges him to the acquisition of such things as be-
long to him. Every warehouse and shop-window, every
fruit-tree, every thought of every hour, opens a new
want to him, which it concerns his power and dignity
to gratify.

12. THE ASTRONOMER'S VISION.
[This extract, translated and paraphrased by Professor Mitchell, is
characterized by solemnity and sublimity, awe and wonder. It should
be read with subdued force, median stress, orotund quality, low pitch.]
1. Gód called up from dreams a man into the vesti-
bule of heaven, saying, “Come thou hither and see the
glory of my house.” And to the servants that stood
around his throne he said, “ Take him, and undress him
from his robes of flèsh: cleanse his vísion, and put a
new breath into his nòstrils: only touch not with any
change his human heàrt—the heárt that wèeps and
trèmbles.”

guide, the man stood ready for his infinite voyage ; and
from the terraces of héaven, without sound or farewell,
at once they wheeled away into endless spàce. Some-
times with the solemn flight of angel wing they fled
through infinite realms of dárkness, through wildernesses
of death, that divided the worlds of làfe; sometimes
they swept over frontiers that were quickening under
prophetic mótions from God.
3. Thén from a distance that is counted only in
hěaven, làght dawned for a time through a sleepy film;
by unutterable páce, the light swept to them, they, by
unutterable páce, to the lìght. In a moment, the rúshing
of plànets was upon them: in a moment, the blázing of
sùns was around them.
4. Then came etérnities of twilight, that revealed, but
were not revealed. On the right hand and on the lèft
toward mighty constellátions, that by self-repetitions and
answers from afár, that by counter-positions, built up
triúmphal gátes, whose árchitraves, whose archways-
horizontal, upright-résted, rose at altitude, by spans
that seemed ghostly from infinitude. Without méasure
were the architraves, past númber were the árchways,
beyond mémory the gòtes.
5. Within were stairs that scaled the etérnities below;
above was beldw—belów was abòve, to the man stripped
of gravitating bòdy: dépth was swallowed up in height
insurmòuntable, herght was swallowed up in dépth un-
fàthomable. Suddenly, as thus they rode from infinite
to infinite, súddenly, as thus they tilted over abysmal
worlds, a mighty crỳ aròse—that systems more mystéri-
ous, that worlds more bíllowy,—other héights and other
dépths,—were coming, were néaring, were at hànd.
6. Then the man sighed, and stooped, shuddered, and
wèpt. His overladen héart uttered itself in téars, and
he said: “Angel', I will go no fàrther. For the spirit
of man acheth with this infànity. Insùfferable is the
overladen Sighed, and , were ats and other

glory of God. Let me lie down in the gráve and hide
me from the prosecution of the infinite; for énd, I see,
there is none."
7. And from all the listening stárs that shone around
issued a choral voice: “The man speaks trùly: énd
there is none, that ever yet we heard of.” “End is
there none ?” the angel solemnly demánded. “Is there
indeed no end ?-and is this the sorrow that kills you ?”
But no voice answered, that he might answer himself.
Then the ángel threw up his glorious hands to the
heaven of heavens, saying, “ End' is there none to the
universe of God. Ló! álso, there is no beginning."
13. EDUCATION.
1. Suppose it were perfectly certain that the life and
fortune of every one of us would, one day or other,
depend upon his winning or losing a game at chess.
Do n't you think that we should all consider it to be a
primary duty to learn at least the names and the moves
of the pieces; to have a notion of a gambit, and a keen
eye for all the means of giving and getting out of check ?
Do you not think that we should look with a disappro-
bation amounting to scorn, upon the father who allowed
his son, or the state which allowed its members, to grow
up without knowing a pawn from a knight?
2. Yet it is a very plain and elementary truth, that
the life, the fortune, and the happiness of every one of
us, and, more or less, of those who are connected with
nis, do depend upon our knowing something of the rules
of a game infinitely more difficult and complicated than
chess. It is a game which has been played for untold
ages, every man and woman of us being one of the
two players in a game of his or her own. The chess-
board is the world, the pieces are the phenomena of the

303
universe, the rules of the game are what we call the
laws of Nature.
3. The player on the other side is hidden from us.
We know that his play is always fair, just, and patient.
But also we know, to our cost, that he never overlooks
a mistake, or makes the smallest allowance for ignorance.
To the man who plays well, the highest stakes are paid,
with that sort of overflowing generosity with which the
strong shows delight in strength. And one who plays
ill is checkmated—without haste, but without remorse.
4. Well, what I mean by Education is learning the
rules of this mighty game. In other words, education
is the instruction of the intellect in the laws of Nature,
under which name I include not merely things and their
forces, but men and their ways; and the fashioning of
the affections and of the will into an earnest and loving
desire to move in harmony with those laws. For me,
education means neither more nor less than this. Any-
thing which professes to call itself education must be
tried by this standard, and if it fails to stand the test,
I will not call it education, whatever may be the force
of authority, or of numbers, upon the other side.
5. It is important to remember that, in strictness,
there is no such thing as an uneducated man. Take an
extreme case. Suppose that an adult man, in the full
vigor of his faculties, could be suddenly placed in the
world, as Adam is said to have been, and then left to
do as he best might. How long would he be left un-
educated ? Not five minutes. Nature would begin to
teach him, through the eye, the ear, the touch, the
properties of objects. Pain and pleasure would be at
his elbow telling him to do this and avoid that; and by
slow degrees the man would receive an education, which,
if narrow, would be thorough, real, and adequate to his
circumstances, though there would be no extras and
very few accomplishments.

6. Those who take honors in Nature's university, who
learn the laws which govern men and things and obey
them, are the really great and successful men in this
world. Those who won't learn at all are plucked; and
then you can't come up again. Nature's pluck means
extermination.
7. Thus the question of compulsory education is set-
tled so far as Nature is concerned. Her bill on that
question was framed and passed long ago. But, like
all compulsory legislation, that of Nature is harsh and
wasteful in its operation. Ignorance is visited as sharply
as willful disobedience-incapacity meets with the same
punishment as crime. Nature's discipline is not even a
word and a blow, and the blow first; but the blow
without the word. It is left to you to find out why
your ears are boxed.
HUXLEY.
14. MATHEMATICS AND PHYSICS.
1. For all the higher arts of construction, some
acquaintance with mathematics is indispensable. The
village carpenter, who, lacking rational instruction, lays
out his work by empirical rules learnt in his appren-
ticeship, equally with the builder of a Britannia Bridge,
makes hourly reference to the laws of quantitative rela-
tions. The surveyor on whose survey the land is
purchased, the architect in designing a mansion to be
built on it, the builder in preparing his estimates, his
foreman in laying out the foundations, the masons in
cutting the stones, and the various artisans who put up
the fittings, are all guided by geometrical truths. Rail-
way-making is regulated from beginning to end by
mathematics : alike in the preparation of plans and sec-
tions, in staking out the line, in the mensuration of
cuttings and embankments, in the designing, estimating,

305
and building of bridges, culverts, viaducts, tunnels, sta-
tions. And similarly with the harbors, docks, piers, and
various engineering and architectural works that fringe
the coasts and overspread the face of the country, as
well as the mines that run underneath it.
2. Out of geometry, too, as applied to astronomy, the
art of navigation has grown; and so, by this science,
has been made possible that enormous foreign commerce
which supports a large part of our population, and
supplies us with many necessaries and most of our
luxuries.
3. And nowadays even the farmer, for the correct
laying out of his drains, has recourse to the level—that
is, to geometrical principles. When from those divisions
of mathematics which deal with space, and number, some
small smattering of which is given in schools, we turn
to that other division which deals with force-of which
even a smattering is scarcely ever given-we meet with
another large class of activities which this science pre-
sides over.
4. On the application of rational mechanics depends
the success of nearly all modern manufacture. The
properties of the lever, the wheel and axle, etc., are
involved in every machine; every machine is a solidified
mechanical theorem; and to machinery in these times
we owe nearly all production.
5. Trace the history of the breakfast-roll. The soil
out of which it came was drained with inachine-made
tiles; the surface was turned over by a machine; the
seed was put in by a machine; the wheat was reaped,
thrashed, and winnowed by machines; by machinery it
was ground and bolted; and had the flour been sent to
Gosport, it might have been made into biscuits by a
machine.
6. Look round the room in which you sit. If mod-
ern, probably the bricks in its walls were machine-made ;
20

by machinery the flooring was sawn and planed, the
mantel-shelf sawn and polished, the paper-hangings made
and printed; the veneer on the table, the turned legs of
the chairs, the carpet, the curtains, are all products of
machinery.
7. And your clothing-plain, figured, or printed-is
it not wholly woven, nay, perhaps even sewed, by ma-
chinery? And the volume you are reading—are not its
leaves fabricated by one machine and covered with these
words by another ? Add to which, that, for the means
of distribution over both land and sea, we are similarly
indebted.
8. And then let it be remembered that according as
the principles of mechanics are well or ill used to these
ends, comes success or failure—individual and national.
The engineer who misapplies his formulæ for the strength
of materials, builds a bridge that breaks down. The
manufacturer whose apparatus is badly devised, can not
compete with another whose apparatus wastes less in
friction and inertia.
9. The ship-builder adhering to the old model is out-
sailed by one who builds on the mechanically justified
wave-line principle. And as the ability of a nation to
hold its own against other nations depends on the skilled
activity of its units, we see that on such knowledge
may turn the national fate. Judge, then, the worth of
mathematics.
10. Pass next to physics. Joined with mathematics,
it has given us the steam-engine, which does the work
of millions of laborers. That section of physics which
deals with the laws of heat, has taught us how to econ-
omize fuel in our various industries; how to increase
the produce of our smelting furnaces by substituting
the hot for the cold blast; how to ventilate our mines;
how to prevent explosions by using the safety-lamp;
and, through the thermometer, how to regulate innumer-

able processes. That division which has the phenomena
of light for its subject, gives eyes to the old and the
myopic; aids through the microscope in detecting dis-
eases and adulterations; and by improved lighthouses
prevents shipwrecks.
11. Researches in electricity and magnetism bave saved
incalculable life and property by the compass; have
subserved sundry arts by the electrotype; and now, in
the telegraph, have supplied us with the agency by
which, for the future, all mercantile transactions will be
regulated, political intercourse carried on, and perhaps
national quarrels often avoided. While in the details
of indoor life, from the improved kitchen range up to
the stereoscope on the drawing-room table, the applica-
tions of advanced physics underlie our comforts and
gratifications.

PROSE DECLAMATIONS.
1. CHARACTER OF TRUE ELOQUENCE.
[This speech is characterized by full declamatory force, long pauses,
strong emphasis, prevailing downward inflection, orotund quality, and
radical stress. Require pupils to give reasons for the marking of rhe-
torical pauses and inflections. ]

tóil for it, but they will toil in vàin. Wórds and phrases
may be marshaled in every way, but they can not com-
pass it. It must exist in the màn, in the subject, and
in the occàsion.
2. Affected pássion, intense expréssion, the pomp of
declamation, àll | may aspire after it; they cannot reach
it. It comes, if it come at áll, like the outbreaking of
a fountain from the earth, or the bursting forth of vol-
canic fères, with spontàneous, oràginal, nátive fòrce.
3. The gráces | taught in the schools, the costly brna-
ments and studied contrivances of speech, shock and
disgùst men, when their own lives, and the fate of their
wives, their children, and their country, hang on the
decision of the hour. Then, words have lost their power,
rhetoric is võin, and all elàborate bratory | contèmptible.
Even genius itself | then feels rebùked and subdùed, as
in the presence of hàgher qualities. Then, pàtriotism |
is èloquent; then, self-devòtion | is èloquent.
4. The cléar conception, outrunning the deductions of
logic, the high pùrpose, the firm resòlve, the dauntless
spèrit, speaking on the tongue, béaming from the eye,
informing évery fèature, and urging the whole mán |
ònward, right ònward, to his object--this, this I is éloquence ;
or, rather, it is something greater and higher than all
eloquence—it is dction, noble, sublème, godlike action.
2. NATIONAL GREATNESS.
1. I believe there is no permanent gréatness to a
nation except it be based upon morality. I do not care
for military greatness or military renown. I care for
the condition of the people among whom I live. There
is no man in England who is less likely to speak irrev-
erently of the crown and monarchy of England than I
ain; but crówns, coronets, míters, military display, the
pomp of war, wide colonies, and a huge émpire are, in

country, dwells in the cottage ; and unless the light of
your constitution can shine thère, unless the beauty of
your legislation and excellence of your statesmanship
are impressed there in the feelings and condition of the
people, rely upon it you have yet to learn the duties of

3. THE PASSING OF THE RUBICON.
[An example of impassioned argumentative declamation.]
1. A gentleman, Mr. President, speaking of Cæsar's
benevolent disposition, and of the reluctance with which
he entered into the civil war, obsérves, “ How long did
he pàuse upon the brink of the Rubicon ?” How càme
he to the brink of that river ? How dàred he cross it ?
Shall private men respect the boundaries of private
property, and shall a man pay no respect to the bound-
aries of his country's rights? How dared he cross that
river? O, but he pâused upon the brink! He should
have pérished upon the brink ere he had crossed it!
2. Whù did he pause? Why does a man's heart pàl-
pitate when he is on the point of committing an un-
láwful dèed? Why does the very mûrderer, his victim
sleeping before him, and his glaring eye taking the
measure of the blow, strike wide of the mortal part ?
Because of cônscience ! 'T was thât made Cæsar pause
upon the brink of the Rubicon.

of the Rubicon? What was the Rubicon? The boundary
of Cæsar's province. From what did it separate his
province ? From his country. Was that country a
désert ? No: it was cúltivated and fèrtile ; rách and
populous ! Its sons were men of génius, spírit, and gèn-
erosity! Its daughters were lóvely, susceptible, and chàste !
Fraendship was its inhabitant! Love was its inhabitant !
Domestic affèction was its inhabitant! Lberty was its
inhabitant! All bounded by the stream of the Rubicon !
4. What was Cæsar, that stood upon the brink of
that river? A trâitor, bringing war and pestilence into
the hèart of that country! No wonder that he paused-
no wonder if, his imagination wrought upon by his con-
science, he had beheld blood instead of wàter; and heard
gróans instead of murmurs ! No wonder if some gorgon
horror had turned him into stone upon the spot ! But,
no !—he cried, “The die is cast !”. He plùnged !-he
crossed !—and Rome was free no more!

vation of every good prínciple and every good hábit,
we may hope to enjoy the blessing through Ďur day,
and to leave it unimpaired to our children. Let us feel
deeply how much of what we áre, and what we posséss,
we owe to this liberty, and these institutions of govern-
ment.
3. Nature has, indeed, given us a soil which yields
bounteously to the hands of industry; the mighty and
fruitful ocean is before us, and the skies over our heads
shed health and vigor. But what are lànds, and sèas,
and skies, to civilized inán, without society, without
knowledge, without mòrals, without religious cùlture ?
and how can these be enjoyed, in all their extént, and
all their excellence, but under the protection of wise
institutions and a free government ?
4. Fellow-citizens, there is not one of us here présent
who does not, at this moment, and at every moment,
experience in his own condítion, and in the condition
of those most near and déar to him, the influence and
the benefits of this liberty, and these institutions. Let
us then acknowledge the blèssing ; let us feel it deeply
and powerfully ; let us cherish a strong affection for it,
and resolve to maintáin and perpètuate it. The blood
of our fáthers, let it not have been shed in vàin; the
great hope of postérity, let it not be blàsted.

5. THE AMERICAN WAR.
1. These abominable principles, and this more abom-
inable avówal of them, demand the most decisive indig-
ndtion! I call upon that Right Reverend Bènch, those
holy ministers of the Gospel, and pious pastors of our

to vindicate the religion of their God! I appeal to

upon the Bishops | to interpose the unsullied sánctity I
of their làwn, upon the jùdges I to interpose the púrity |
of their èrmine, to save us from this pollution !
2. I call upon the honor of your Lòrdships, to rever-
ence the dignity of your úncestors, and to maintain
your dwn! I call upon the spirit and humánity of my
country, to vindicate the nátional chàracter! I invoke
the génius of the Constitùtion! From the tapestry | that

Lórd | frowns with indignation at the disgráce of his
country !

connéctions, friends, and relátions, the merciless cănnibal,
thirsting for the blood of mán, woman, and child ? Send

horrible hôunds of savage wår!

7. THE VOICES OF THE DEAD.
1. The world | is filled with the voices of the dead.
They speak | not from the public records of the great
world only, but from the private history | of our own
experience. They speak to us | in a thousand remém-
brances, in a thousand incidents, évents, and associàtions.
They spéak to us, not only from their silent gráves, but
from the throng of làfe. Though they are invísible, yet
life is filled | with their presence. They are with us
by the silent fíreside and in the secluded chàmber.
They are with us | in the paths of society, and in the
crowded assemblies of mèn.
2. They speak to us from the lonely wáy-side; and
they speak to us | from the venerable walls | that echo
to the steps of a múltitude and to the voice of prdyer.
Go where we will, the dead | are with us. We làve, we
convèrse with those who once lived | and conversed
with us. Their well-remembered tone | mingles with the
whispering breeze, with the sound of the falling leaf,
with the jubilee shout of the spring-time.—The éarth
| is filled | with their shadowy tràin.

3. But there are more substàntial expressions of the
presence of the déad | with the làving. The earth | is
filled with the làbors, the works, of the dead. Almost
all the làterature in the world, the discoveries of science,
the glories of úrt, the ever-enduring témples, the dwelling-
places of generátions, the comforts and improvements of
lífe, the languages, the máxims, the opinions of the living,
the very frame-work of society, the institutions of nations,
the fabrics of émpires—all | are the works of the dead.
By thèse, they | who are dead | yet speak. ORVILLE DEWEY.
8. GRATTAN'S REPLY TO MR. CORRY.
[An example of impassioned sarcasm and invective.]
1. Has the gentleman dòne ? Has he completely done?
He was unparliamentary from the beginning to the end
of his speech. There was scarce a word he uttered that
was not a violátion of the privileges of the House. But
I did not call him to order,—whý ? because the limited
talents of some men render it impossible for them to
be sevěre withôut being unparliamentary. But before I
sit down, I shall show him how to be severe ând par-
liamentary at the same time.
2. The right honorable gentlemen has called me “an
unimpěached trâitor." I ask why not “ trăitor," unquali-
fied by any èpithet ? I will tell him: it was because he
dûrst not. It was the act of a côward, who raises his
arm to strike, but has not courage to give the blow. I
will not call him věllain, because it would be unparlin-
mentary, and he is a privy counselor. I will not call
him fool, because he happens to be cháncellor of the
exchèquer. But I say, he is one who has abused the
privilege of Parliament and the freedom of debate, by
uttering language which, if spoken out of the House, I
should answer only with a blów. I care not how high

his situátion, how lów his cháracter, how contémptible
his spéech ; whether a privy counselor or a pàrasite, my
answer would be a blów.
3. I have retúrned,—not as the right honorable mem-
ber has said, to raise another storm,—I have returned
to discharge an honorable debt of grátitude to my
country, that conferred a great reward for păst services,
which, I am proud to say, was not greater than my
desèrt. I have returned to protect that Constitution of
which I was the parent and founder, from the assassi-
nàtion of such men as the right honorable gentleman
and his unworthy associates. They are corrúpt, they are
sedîtious, and they, at this very moment, are in a con-
spîracy against their country. I have returned to refute
a líbel, as fálse as it is malàcious, given to the public
under the appellation of a report of the committee of
the Lòrds. Here I stând, ready for impéachment or trèal.
I dâre accusation. I defy the honorable gentleman; I
defy the gôvernment; I defy their whole phalanx; let
them come forth. I tell the ministers, I will neither
gåve quarter nor tåke it. I am here to lay the shat-
tered remains of my constitution on the floor of this
House, in defense of the liberties of my country.
9. SUPPOSED SPEECH OF JOHN ADAMS IN
SUPPORT OF AMERICAN INDEPENDENCE.
1. Sink or swin, live or die, survive or pèrish, I give
my hánd and my heart to this vòte. It is true, indeed,
that in the beginning we aimed not at Independence.
But there's a Divinity which shapes our ends. The
injustice of England has driven us to drms; and, blindedi
to her own interest for our good, she has obstinately
persisted, till Independence is now within our grasp.
We have but to reach forth to it, and it is oùrs.

2. Why, then, should we defer the Declaration? Is
any man so weak as now to hope for a reconciliation
with England ? Do we mean to submit to the measures
of Parliament, Boston port-bill and áll ? I know we do
not mean to submit. We never shàll submit.
3. Sir, the Declaration will inspire the people with
increased courage. Instead of a long and bloody war
for restoration of privileges, for redress of grievances,
for chartered inimúnities, held under a British king, set
before them the glorious object of entire Independence,
and it will breathe into them anew the breath of life.
4. Read this Declaration at the head of the army:
every sword will be drawn from its scábbard, and the
solemn vow úttered, to maintain it, or to perish on the
field of hònor. Publish it from the pulpit ; religion will
approve it, and the love of religious liberty will cling
róund it, resolved to stánd with it, or fall with it.
5. Send it to the public halls; proclaim it thère. Let
thér hear it who heard the first roar of the enemy's
cànnon ; let them see it who saw their brothers and their
sons fall on the field of Bunker Hill, and in the streets
of Lexington and Concord, and the very walls will cry
out in its support.
6. Sir, before God, I believe the hour is come. My
júdgment approves this measure, and my whole heàrt is
àn it. All that I háve, and all that I ám, and all that
I hope, in this life, I am now ready here to stàke upon
it; and I leave off as I begàn, that live or dàe, survive
or pèrish, I am for the Declardtion. It is my living
sentiment, and, by the blessing of God, it shall be my
dying sentiment: Independence now; and Independence
forever.

10. THE CONSTITUTION AND THE UNION.
[In this speech the movement is slow; the utterance deliberate, the
pauses long; and the inflections strongly marked.]
1. For myself, I propose, Sír, to abide by the prin-
ciples and the púrposes which I have avowed. I shall
stànd bù the Union, and by all / who stand bŷ it. I
shall do justice to the whole country, according to the
best of my ability, in all I sày, and act for the good of
the whole coúntry | in all I dò. I mean to stand upon
the Constitùtion. I need no other plàtform. I shall know
but one country.
2. The ends I aim at | shall be my country's, my
Góds, and Trùth's. I was born | an Américan; I will .
líve an Américan; I shall die an Amèrican; and I intend
to perform the duties incumbent upon me, in that
character to the end of my career. I mean to do this,
with the absolute disregàrd of personal consequences.
3. What are l personal consequences ? What is the
individual mán, with all the good or evil that may be-
tide him, in comparison with the good or evil | which
may befall a great coúntry in a crisis like thàs, and in
the midst of great transactions | which concern that
coúntry's fàte? Let the consequences | be what they will.
I am càreless. No man can suffer too much, and no
man can fall too sòon, if he suffer | or if he fall | in
defense of the liberties | and Constitution of his country.
WEBSTER.
11. THE CONSTITUTION.
1. Never did there devolve on any generation of men
higher trusts than now devolve upon us, for the pres-
ervation of this Constitution, and the harmony and
peace of all who are destined to live under it. Let us
make our generation one of the strongest and brightest
links in that golden chain which is destined, I fondly

believe, to grapple the people of all the States to this
Constitution for ages to come.
2. We have a great, popular, constitutional govern-
ment, guarded by law and by judicature, and defended
by the affections of the people. No monarchical throne
presses these States together. They live and stand upon
a government popular in its form, representative in its
character, founded upon principles of equality, and so
constructed, we hope, as to last forever.
3. In all its history it has been beneficent. It has
trodden down no man's liberty, it has crushed no State.
Its daily respiration is liberty and patriotism. Its
youthful veins are full of enterprise, courage, and hon-
orable love of glory and renown. Large before, the
country has now, by recent events, become vastly larger.
This republic now extends, with a vast breadth, across
the whole continent. The two great seas of the world
wash the one and the other shore. We realize on a
mighty scale the beautiful description of the ornamental
edging of the bucklers of Achilles :
“Now the broad shield complete, the artist crowned
With his last hand, and poured the ocean round.
In living silver seemed the waves to roll,
And beat the buckler's verge and bound the whole.”
DANIEL WEBSTER.
12. DUTIES OF AMERICAN CITIZENS.
1. We have indulged in gratifying recollections of
the past, in the prosperity and pleasures of the present,
and in high hopes for the future. But let us remember
that we have duties and obligations to perform, corre-
sponding to the blessings which we enjoy.
2. Let us remember the trust, the sacred trust, attach-
ing to the rich inheritance which we have received from
our fathers. Let us feel our personal responsibility, to

319
the full extent of our power and influence, for the
preservation of the principles of civil and religious lib-
erty. And let us remember that it is only religion, and
morals, and knowledge, that can make men respectable
and happy, under any form of government.
3. Let us hold fast the great truth, that communities
are responsible, as well as individuals; that no govern-
ment is respectable, which is not just; that without un-
spotted purity of public faith, without sacred public prin-
ciple, fidelity, and honor, no mere forms of government,
no machinery of laws, can give dignity to political society.
In our day and generation let us seek to raise and im-
prove the moral sentiment, so that we may look, not
for a degraded, but for an elevated and improved future.
4. And when both we and our children shall have
been consigned to the house appointed for all living,
may love of country and pride of country glow with
equal fervor among those to whom our names and our
blood shall have descended.
5. And then, when honored and decrepit age shall
lean against the base of this monument, and troops of
ingenuous youth shall be gathered round it, and when
the one shall speak to the other of its objects, the pur-
poses of its construction, and the great and glorious
events with which it is connected, there shall rise from
every youthful breast the ejaculation, “ Thank God, I-
I also—am an American !”
DANIEL WEBSTER.
13. LABOR.
1. Lábor is heaven's great ordinance for human im-
pròvement. Let not the great ordinance be broken down.
What do I sáy ? It is broken down; and hàs been
broken down for ages. Let it, then, bebùilt again ;
hère, if ánywhere, on the shores of a new world—of a
new civilization.

2. But hów, it may be asked, is it broken down ? Do
not men tóil ? it may be said. They do, indeed, tòil;
but they too generally dó, because they mùst. Many
submit to it, as to, in some sort, a degrading necessity;
and they desire nothing so much on earth as an escape
from it. This way of thinking is the heritage of the
absurd and unjust feudal system, under which serfs
lábored, and gentlemen spent their lives in fighting and
fèasting. It is time that this opprobrium of toil were
done awày.
3. Ashamed to tỏil! Ashamed of thy dingy workshop
and dusty lábor-field; of thy hard hánd, scarred with
service more honorable than that of wúr; of thy soiled
and weather-stained gárments, on which mother Nature
has embroidered míst, sún and ráin, fire and stéam-
her own heraldic honors !
4. Ashămed of those tókens and titles, and envious of
the flaunting robes of imbecile ždleness and vănity! It
is treason to Nature; it is impiety to Heaven : it is
breaking Heaven's grcát òrdinance. Tóil—tóil—either of
the bráin, of the heárt, or of the hánd—is the only trúe
mànhood, the only trúe nobility!
ORVILLE DEWEY.
14. THE FUTURE OF AMERICA.
1. It cannot be denied, but by those who would dis-
pute against the sún, that with America, and in America,
a néw èra commences in human affàirs. This éra is
distinguished by free representative governments, by en-
tire religious liberty, by improved systems of national
intercourse, by a newly awakened and an unconquerable
spirit of free inquiry, and by a diffusion of knowledge
through the community, such as has been before alto-
gether unknówn and unheard of.

native land, is inseparably connected, fast bound up, in
fórtune and by fáte, with these gréat interests. If they
făll, wé fall with them; if they stěnd, it will be because
we have upheld them.
3. Let us contemplate, then, this connection which
binds the prosperity of others to our own; and let us
manfully discharge all the dúties which it imposes. If
we cherish the virtues and the principles of our fathers,
Héaven will assist us to carry on the work of human
liberty and human hàppiness.
4. Auspicious ómens chèer us. Great exámples are
before us. Our own fírmament now shines brightly upon
our pàth. Wáshington is in the clear upper skỳ. Those
other stars have now joined the American constellation ;
they circle round their center, and the heavens beam
with new light. Beneath this illumination, let us walk
the course of life, and at its clóse devoutly commend
our beloved country, the common parent of us áll, to
the Divine Benignity.
DANIEL WEBSTER.
15. PATRIOTISM.
1. Bereft of patriotism, the heart of a nation will be
cold and cramped and sordid; the arts will have no
enduring impulse, and commerce no invigorating soul;
society will degenerate, and the mean and vicious will
triumph. Patriotism is not a wild and glittering passion,
but a glorious reality. The virtue that gave to Paganism
its dazzling luster, to Barbarism its redeeming trait, to
Christianity its heroic form, is not dead. It still lives
to console, to sanctify humanity. It has its altar in
every clime; its worship and festivities.
2. On the heathered hills of Scotland, the sword of
Wallace is yet a bright tradition. The genius of France,
in the brilliant literature of the day, pays its high

homage to the piety and heroism of the young Maid
of Orleans. In her new Senate-hall, England bids her
sculptor place, among the effigies of her greatest sons,
the images of Hampden and of Russell. In the gay
and graceful capital of Belgium, the daring hand of
Geefs has reared a monument full of glorious meaning
to the three hundred martyrs of the revolution.
3. By the soft blue waters of Lake Lucerne stands
the chapel of William Tell. On the anniversary of his
revolt and victory, across those waters, as they glitter
in the July sun, skim the light boats of the allied can-
tons, from the prows hang the banners of the republic,
and as they near the sacred spot, the daughters of Lu-
cerne chant the hymns of their old poetic land. Then
bursts forth the glad Te Deum, and Heaven again hears
the voice of that wild chivalry of the mountains, which
five centuries since pierced the white eagle of Vienna,
and flung it bleeding on the rocks of Uri.
T. F. MEAGHER.
16. THE FOURTH OF JULY.
1. On the Fourth of July, 1776, the representatives
of the United States of America, in Congress assembled,
declared that these United Colonies are, and of right
ought to be, free and independent States. This decla-
ration, made by most patriotic and resolute men, trust-
ing in the justice of their cause, and the protection of
Providence--and yet not without deep solicitude and
anxiety-has stood for seventy-five years, and still stands.
2. It was sealed in blood. It has met dangers and
overcome them; it has had enemies, and it has con-
quered them; it has had detractors, and it has abashed
them all; it has had doubting friends, but it has cleared
all doubts away; and now, to-day, raising its august
form higher than the clouds, twenty millions of people

contemplate it with hallowed love; and the world beholds
it, and the consequences which have followed, with pro-
found admiration.
3. This anniversary animates, and gladdens, and unites
all American hearts. On other days of the year we may
be party men, indulging in controversies more or less
important to the public good; we may have likes and
dislikes, and we may maintain our political differences
often with warm, and sometimes with angry feelings.
But to-day we are Americans all in all, nothing but
Americans.
4. As the great luminary over our heads, dissipating
mists and fogs, cheers the whole hemisphere, so do the
associations connected with this day disperse all cloudy
and sullen weather, and all noxious exhalations in the
minds and feelings of true Americans. Every man's
heart swells within him ;-every man's port and bearing
become somewhat more proud and lofty, as he remem-
bers that seventy-five years have rolled away, and that
the great inheritance of liberty is still his; his, undi-
minished and unimpaired; his, in all its original glory;
his to enjoy, his to protect, and his to transmit to future
generations.
DANIEL WEBSTER.
17. TRUE GREATNESS.
1. The poet tells us, in pathetic cadence, that
“The paths of glory lead but to the grave.”
But this is true only in the superfàcial sense. It is
true that the fámous and the obscure, the devoted and
the ignóble, “alike await the inevitable hòur.” But the
path of trŭe glory does not énd in the gràve. It passes
through it to larger opportunities of sèrvice.
2. A great nature is a sèed. “It is sown a nátural
body; it is raised a spiritual body.” It germinates thus

in this world as well as in the other. Was Warren
bèried when he fell on the field of a deféat, pierced
through the bráin, at the commencement of the Revo-
lútion, by a búllet that put the land in mourning?
3. Nd; the monument that has been raised where his
blood reddened the sód-gránite though it be in a hun-
dred courses—is a feeble witness of the permanence and
influence of his spirit among the American people. He
mounted into literature from the moment that he fèll ;
he began to move the soul of a great community; and
part of the principle and enthúsiasm of Massachusetts
to-dáy is due to his sácrifice, to the presence of his spirit
as a power in the life of the State.
4. Did Montgomery lose his influence as a force in
the Revolútion, because he died without victory on its
thréshold, pierced with three wounds, before Quebec ?
Philadelphia was in téars for him; his eulogies were
uttered by the most eloquent tongues of América and
Britain, and a thrill of his power beats in the volumes
of our history, and runs yet through the onset of every
Irish brigade beneath the American bánner, which he
planted on Montreal.
5. Did Lăwrence die when his breath expired in the
defeat on the sea, after his exclamation, “Don't give
up the ship!” What victorious captain in that naval
war shed forth such power ? His spirit soared and
touched every flág on every fràgate, to make its red more
commánding and its stars flame bràghter ; it went abroad
in sòngs, and every sailor felt him and feels him now as
an inspiration. .
6. The soul is not a shădow. The body is. Génius is
not a shădow; it is súbstance. Pátriotism is not a shădow ;
it is light. Great purposes, and the spirit that counts
death nothing in contrast with honor and the welfare of
our country—these are the witnesses that man is not a
passing vápor, but an immortal spirit. THOMAS STARR KING.

18. THE NORMANS.
1. In 1066, the Normans invaded England, and the
battle of Hastings broke, forever, the Saxon and Danish
power. But years passed, and several monarchs filled
and vacated the English throne before these Norman
pioneers had accomplished their work, and molded the
nation to their will.
2. They were warriors—not reformers. They were
greedy of power, but impatient of its exercise upon
themselves; greedy of wealth, but lavish in its expend-
iture. They were reckless alike of their own and the
life of others. Turbulent, unruly-equally dangerous
to the people whom they subdued, and to the princes
who led them to conquest. Gallant men, full of deeds
of knightly courtesy, yet reddening their hands with
the blood of civil broil, and ever ready to maintain
their right with their swords.
3. Men of clear intellect and giant will, they acknowl-
edged an uncertain allegiance to their king, and only
bowed their necks to the yoke of God, when at the
close of life they deemed it necessary to assume the
monastic habit, or to do penance of their goods for the
salvation of their souls.
4. From these stern and bloody men, “who came in
with the Conqueror," or followed in the train of his
successors, the noblest families of England are proud
to derive their descent; and even we republicans, upon
this distant coast, and at this late period of time, do
not refuse our admiration to these Norman pioneers,
who, through the mists of the past, loom up like giants
before us.
5. Yet our admiration of these old warriors, the ad-
miration of the world for them, is not because they
shed blood, or amassed or squandered wealth, or swore
fealty to their kings, or broke their oaths in rebellion,

or committed or abstained from the crimes that were
common to their age. The Norman pioneers are enrolled
in history among the most illustrious of men, because
in the dark and troublous times in which they lived, in
the midst of confusion and blood, with strong hands
and undaunted hearts, they laid deep the first founda-
tions of English liberty, and became the fathers of that
system of common law which, at the end of eight hun-
dred years, is the protection and the glory of all who
speak the English tongue.

19. WASHINGTON'S BIRTHDAY.
1. Inspiring auspices, this day, surround us and cheer
us. It is the anniversary of the birth of Washington.
We should know this, even if we had lost our calendars,
for we should be reminded of it by the shouts of joy
and gladness. The whole atmosphere is redolent of his
name; hills and forests, rocks and rivers, echo and re-
echo his praises.
2. All the good, whether learned or unlearned, high
or low, rich or poor, feel, this day, that there is one
treasure common to them all, and that is the fame and
character of Washington. They recount his deeds, pon-
der over his principles and teachings, and resolve to be
more and more guided by them in the future.
3. To the old and the young, to all born in the land,
and to all whose love of liberty has brought them from
foreign shores to make this the home of their adoption,
the name of Washington is this day an exhilarating
theme. Americans by birth are proud of his character,
and exiles from foreign shores are eager to participate
in admiration of him; and it is true that he is this
day, here, everywhere, all the world over, more an object
of love and regard than on any day since his birth.

4. On Washington's principles, and under the guid-
ance of his example, will we and our children uphold
the Constitution. Under his military leadership our
fathers conquered; and under the outspread banner of
his political and constitutional principles will we also
conquer.
5. To that standard we shall adhere, and uphold it
through evil report and through good report. We will
meet danger, we will meet death, if they come, in its
protection ; and we will struggle on, in daylight and in
darkness, ay, in the thickest darkness, with all the
storms which it may bring with it, till
“Danger's troubled night is o'er,
And the star of Peace return."

20. NATIONS AND HUMANITY.
1. It was not his olive valleys and orange groves
which made the Greece of the Greek. It was not for
his apple orchards or potato fields that the farmer of
New England and New York left his plow in the
furrow and marched to Bunker Hill, to Bennington, to
Saratoga. A man's coủntry is not a certain area of
lănd, but it is a prânciple; and pătriotism is lòyalty to
that prìnciple. The secret sanctification of the soil and
synıbol of a country is the idéa which they represent ;
and this idea the patriot worships through the name
and the sìmbol.
2. So with passionate héroism, of which tradition is
never weary of tenderly telling, Arnold von Winkelreid
gathers into his bosom the sheaf of foreign spears. So,
Nathan Hale, disdaining no service that duty demánds,
perishes untimely with no other friend than Gód and
the satisfied sense of dùty. So, through all history from
the beginning, a noble army of mártyrs has fought

fiercely, and fallen brávely, for that unseen místress,
their country. So, through all history to the end, thật
army must still márch, and fight, and füll.
3. But countries and fámilies are but núrseries and
ànfluences. A man is a fáther, a brother, a Gérman, a
Róman, an Américan; but beneath all thěse relations,
he is a màn. The end of his human destiny is not to
be the best German, or the best Róman, or the best
fáther ; but the best man he can be. George W. CURTIS.
21. CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON.
1. Sir, it matters very little what immediate spót may
be the birthplace of such a man as Wàshington. No
people can cláim, no coúntry can appròpriate him. The
boon of Providence to the human ráce, his fame is etérnity,
and his residence creàtion. Though it was the defeat
of our árms, and the disgrace of our pólicy, I almost
blèss the convúlsion in which he had his òrigin. If the
heavens thundered, and the earth rócked, yet, when the
storm pássed, how prúre was the climate that it cleared ;
how bright, in the brow of the firmament, was the plánet
which it revealed to us!
2. In the production of Wăshington, it does really
appear as if Nature was endeavoring to impròve upon
herself, and that all the virtues of the ăncient world
were but so many studies preparatory to the patriot of
the new. Individual instances no doubt there were-
splendid exemplifications of some single qualificàtion.
Cæsar was mèrciful; Scipio was continent ; Hannibal was
pàtient ; but it was reserved for Wăshington to blend
them all in one, and, like the lovely masterpiece of the
Grecian artist, to exhíbit, in one glow of associated
beauty, the pride of every model, and the perfection of
every màster.

3. As a géneral, he marshalled the peasant into a vèt-
eran, and supplied by discipline the absence of experience ;
as a stătesman, he enlarged the policy of the cabinet
into the most comprehensive system of general advàn-
. tage ; and such was the wisdom of his viéws, and the
philosophy of his counsels, that to the soldier and the
stătesman, he almost added the character of the sâge !
A conqueror, he was untainted with the crime of blood ;
a revolútionist, he was free from any stain of tréason ;
for aggression comměnced the contest, and his country
called him to the command.
4. Liberty unsheathed his sword, necessity stáined, vic-
tory returned it. If he had paused here, history might
have doubted what station to assègn him ; whether at
the head of her citizens or her soldiers, her héroes or her
pàtriots. But the last glorious act crowns his career,
and banishes all hesitàtion. Whó, like Washington, after
having emancipated a hémisphere, resigned its crówn,
and preferred the retirement of domestic life to the
adoration of a lánd he might be almost said to have
created ?

22. BUNKER-HILL MONUMENT.
1. The Bunker-Hill monument is finished. Here it
stànds. Fortunate in the natural eminence on which
it is placed—higher, infinitely higher, in its objects and
púrpose, it rises over the land, and over the séa ; and
vísible, at their homes, to three hundred thousand citi-
zens of Massachúsetts—it stánds, a memorial of the
pást, and a monitor to the présent, and all succeeding
generations.
2. I have spoken of the loftiness of its pùrpose. If
it had been without any other design than the creation
of a work of árt, the granite of which it is composed

would have slept in its native bed. It hâs a purpose ;
and thắt purpose gives it character. That púrpose
enrobes it with dignity and moral gràndeur. That wéll-
known purpose it is, which causes us to look up to it with
a feeling of àwe. It is itself the brator of this occdsion.
3. It is not from my lips, it is not from any húman
lips, that that strain of eloquence is this day to flów,
most competent to move and excite the vast multitudes
around. The potent speaker stands motionless befòre
them. It is a plain shaft. It bears no inscriptions,
fronting to the rising sún, from which the future anti-
quarian shall wipe the dúst. Nor does the rising sun
cause tones of mùsic to issue from its sùmmit. But
at the rising of the sun, and at the setting of the sun,
in the blaze of noon-day, and beneath the milder efful-
gence of lùnar light, it looks, it speaks, it acts, to the
full comprehension of every American mind, and the
awakening of glowing enthusiasm in every American
heàrt.
4. Its silent, but awful útterance; its deep páthos, as
it brings to our contemplation the 17th of June, 1775,
and the consequences which have resulted to us, to our
cóuntry, and to the world, from the events of that day,
and which we know must continue to rain influence on
the destinies of mankind to the end of tíme; the eleva-
tion with which it raises us high above the ordinary
feelings of life--surpass all that the study of the closet,
or even the inspiration of gènius can prodùce.
5. To-dáy, it speaks to us. Its fóture auditories will
be through successive generations of mén, as they rise
up before it, and gather round it. Its speech will be of
patriotism and courage ; of civil and religious lìberty ;
of free government; of the moral improvement and ele-
vation of mankand; and of the immortal mémory of
those whó, with heroic devotion, have sacrificed their
lives for their country.

23. THE BIRTHDAY OF WASHINGTON.
1. The birthday of the “Father of his Country”! May
it ever be freshly remembered by American hearts !
May it ever re-awaken in them a filial veneration for
his memory; ever rekindle the fires of patriotic regard
for the country which he loved so well, to which he
gave his youthful vigor and his youthful energy, during
the perilous period of the early Indian warfare; to which
he devoted his life in the maturity of his powers, in the
field ; to which again he offered the counsels of his wis-
doin and his experience, as president of the convention
that framed our Constitution; which he guided and
directed while in the chair of state, and for which the
last prayer of his earthly supplication was offered up,
when it came the moment for him so well, and so
grandly, and so calmly, to die.
2. He was the first man of the time in which he grew.
His memory is first and most sacred in our love, and
ever hereafter, till the last drop of blood shall freeze in
the last American heart, his name shall be a spell of
power and of might.
3. Yes, gentlemen, there is one personal, one vast
felicity, which no man can share with him. It was the
daily beauty, and towering and matchless glory of his
life which enabled him to create his country, and at the
same time secure an undying love and regard from
the whole American people. “The first in the hearts
of his countrymen !" Yes, first ! He has our first and
most fervent love.
4. Undoubtedly there were brave and wise and good
men, before his day, in every colony. But the Amer-
ican nation, as a nation, I do not reckon to have begun
before 1774. And the first love of that Young America
was Washington. The first word she lisped was his
name. Her earliest breath spoke it. It still is her

proud ejaculation; and it will be the last gasp of her
expiring life!
5. Yes; others of our great men have been appre-
ciated—many admired by all; but him we love; him we
all love. About and around him we call up no dissen-
tient and discordant and dissatisfied elements—no sec-
tional prejudice nor bias—no party, no creed, no dogma
of politics. None of these shall assail him. Yes; when
the storm of battle blows darkest and rages highest, the
memory of Washington shall nerve every American
arm, and cheer every American heart.
RUFUS CHOATE.
24. THE NATIONAL CLOCK.
1. Every nation is like a clock, the forces at work
within carrying forward some purpose or plan of Proy-
idence with patient constancy; but when the season
comes that the sixtieth minute is dúe, and a new hour
must be sounded, perhaps not for the nătion alone, but
for the world, thén—then the clock strikes, and it may
be with a force and résonance that startles and inspires
the race.
2. The first American revolútion was such a period—
thát was the glory of it. The English Góvernment had
oppressed our fàthers. It tried to break their spårit.
For several years it was a dark tàme, like the hours
before the striking of the dàwn.
3. But the Colonial time-piece kept tícking, ticking to
the pressure of the English Government, the giant
wheels playing calmly till about 1775', when there was
a strange stír and buzz within the càse. The péople
could not bear any more of it. But the sixtieth minute
cáme, and the clock struck.
4. The world hèard—the battle of Léxington-one; the
Declaration of Independence—twò; the surrender of Bur-

góyne-thrèe; the siege of Yorktown—four; the Treaty
of Páris,fìve the inauguration of Wushington—six.
5. And then it was súnrise of the néw dày, of which
we have seen yet only the glórious forendon.
Thomas STARR KING.
25. FREE SCHOOLS.
1. It is impossible for us adequately to conceive the
boldness of the measure which aimed at universal edu-
cation through the establishment of Free Schools. As
a fact, it had no precedent in the world's history; and,
as a theory, it could have been refuted and silenced by
a more formidable array of argument and experience
than was ever marshaled against any other institution
of human origin.
2. But time has ratified its soundness. Two centuries
of successful operation now proclaim it to be as wise
as it was courageous, and as beneficent as it was disin-
terested. Every community in the civilized world awards
it the meed of praise, and States at home, and nations
abroad, in the order of their intelligence, are copying
the bright example.
3. What we call the enlightened nations of Christen-
dom are approaching, by slow degrees, to the moral
elevation which our ancestors reached at a single bound;
and the tardy convictions of the one have been assimi-
lating, through a period of two centuries, to the intuitions
of the other.
4. The establishment of Free Schools was one of those
grand mental and moral experiments whose effects could
not be developed and made manifest in a single genera-
tion. But now, according to the manner in which human
life is computed, we are the sixth generation from its
founders; and have we not reason to be grateful, both
to God and man, for its unnumbered blessings? The

sincerity of our gratitude must be tested by our efforts
to perpetuate and to improve what they established.
The gratitude of the lips only is an unholy offering.
HORACE MAXN.
26. THE BALLOT.
1. Consider, for a moment, what it is to cást a vòte.
It is the token of inestimable privileges, and involves
the responsibilities of an heréditary trùst. It has passed
into your hands as a rìght, reaped from fields of suffer-
ing and blood.
2. The grandeur of hòstory is represented in your act.
Men have wrought with pen and tongue, and pined in
dungeons, and died on scáffolds, that you might obtain
this synıbol of fréedom, and enjoy this consciousness of
a sácred individuálity. To the ballot have been trans-
mítted, as it were, the dignity of the scéptre and the
potency of the sword.
3. And that which is so potent as a răght, is also
pregnant as a dûty; a duty for the présent and for the
fùture. If you will, that folded léaf becomes a tongue
of jòstice, a voice of òrder, a force of imperial làw-
securing rights, abolishing abúses, erecting new institu-
tions of trúth and love. And, however you will, it is
the expression of a sólemn responsibility, the exercise of
an immeasurable power for good or for évil, now and
hereafter.
4. It is the medium through which you act upon
your country--the organic nérve which incorporates you.
with its life and welfare. There is no agent with which
the possibilities of the republic are more intimately in-
mbled. none upon which we can fall back with more
iðnfidence than the bàllot-box.

27. EDUCATIONAL POWER.
1. The true teacher must have the faith of martyrs.
In the limited horizon of the school-room, the teacher
can dimly see only the beginning of the effects of his
training upon his pupils. The solid and lasting results,
the building up of character, the creative power of
motives, are made evident only in the wider circle of
the world, and at the end of a life-time. Hence the
power of the teacher, like that of the silent and invis-
ible forces of nature, is only feebly realized.
2. I once visited, in the Sierra, a quartz mine of
fabulous richness. Deep in the bowels of the earth,
swarthy miners were blasting out the gold-bearing rock;
above, the powerful mill was crushing the quartz with
its iron teeth. In the office, piles of yellow bars, ready
to be sent to the mint to be poured into the channels
of trade, showed the immediate returns of well-directed
labor and wisely invested capital. An hour later, I
stepped into a public school-house not half a mile distant,
where fifty children were conning their lessons. What
does the school yield, I asked myself, on the invest-
ment of money by the State ? The returns of the mine
were made in solid bullion; the school returns were all
far in the unknown future.
3. I crossed the continent from the Pacific to the
Atlantic on the grandest commercial highway ever built,
and all along, towns, villages, cities, mines, farms, machine
shops, manufactories, and converging roads bore evidence
of the mighty physical forces of the nation; and when I
entered a meeting of the National Educational Association
in a Boston school-house, where two hundred thoughtful
men and women were assembled, it seemed, after wit-
nessing the gigantic play of industrial and commercial
forces, that the school-masters and school-mistresses were
lookers-on and idlers in the bustling life around.


## p. 336 (#342) ############################################

4. But when, in the mild summer evening, I walked
under the elms of Boston Common and reflected that
independence was once only a dim idea in the minds of
a few leading patriots; that the engine which had whirled
me over the iron track, three thousand miles in seven
days, was once only an idea in the brain of an enthu-
siast; that the telegraph wires, radiating like nerves
from the centers of civilization, were created by the in-
ventive genius of an educated thinker, I realized that
there is a silent power, mightier than all mechanical
forces, which preserves, directs, and controls the material
prosperity of a great nation.
5. I go out into the streets of the great commercial
center of our country. I hear everywhere the hum of
industry, and see around the stir of business. I see the
steamships plying like gigantic shuttles to weave a net-
work of commercial relations between the new world
and the old. I see the smoke of manufactories where
skillful artisans are constructing the marvelous produc-
tions of inventive genius. The banks are open; keen
capitalists are on 'Change; and the full tide of human-
ity is pulsating through every artery of the town. The
results of business are solid and tangible. I step into
the New York Normal College where a thousand young
women are fitting for the profession of teaching, and if
asked for the tangible results of the educational invest-
ment, the evidences are not at hand.
6. But when I pause to consider that intelligence is the
motive power of trade; that the city with its banks, ware-
houses, churches, residences, and manufactories, is the
product of skilled labor; that the steamship is navigated
by means of science, and is built as a triumph of art: that
science surveyed the railroad lines, and that skill runs
the trains freighted with the products of industry and
art; then I begin to perceive some connection between
educational forces and the material results of civilization.

28. SCHOOLS AND TEACHERS.
1. Looking into the near future, I see the aisles of
the school-room widen into the broad streets of the city.
The boys are business men. One commands the steam-
ship, one operates the telegraph, and another runs an en-
gine; one is a railroad director, and another rides over
the road to take his seat in the senate of the United
States. One works a gold mine, another an iron mine,
and another a coal mine; one is a merchant, one a banker,
one a Wall-street speculator; one is a farmer in the
west, another a manufacturer in the east; one is a mer-
chant, another a mechanic, and a third is an inventor.
2. The girls have become women. Some preside as
queens in home circles, some are teachers, some are
writers, some are artists, and others are skilled in
household work. I realize that the life of a nation is
made up of mothers that guard the homes of the men
who drive the plow, build the ships, run the mills, work
the mines, construct machinery, print the papers, shoulder
the musket, and cast the ballots; and it is for all these
that the public schools have done and are now doing
their beneficent work.
3. When I ponder over the far-reaching influence of
the teacher and the school, I comprehend, in some
measure, the relation to our national well-being, of our
American system of free public schools—the best, not-
withstanding its defects and shortcomings, that the
world has ever known. It is the duty of every teacher
to strive with all his heart, and with all his soul, and
with all his might, to perfect a system of education
which shall train a race of men and women in the next
generation, that shall inherit, with the boundless re-
sources of our favored land, something of the energy,
enterprise, talent, and character of the sturdy pioneers
who settled and subdued the wilderness.

4. Only timid and despairing souls are frightened into
the belief that the foundations of society are breaking
up on account of over-education in the common schools.
Neither representatives of the Caste of Capital nor the
Caste of Culture can convince the American people that
vice, crime, idleness, poverty, and social discontent are
the necessary result of an elementary education among
the workers of society. No demagogue, with specious
statements, can lead any considerable number of citizens
to regard the school-master as a public enemy.
5. The free common school is the Plymouth Rock of
American liberty. If the system of free schools, as now
conducted and organized, fails to meet the needs of
social progress, not the extent, but the kind and quality,
of education must be changed. Neither high school nor
university must be lopped off from our free-school system.
6. It is only through skilled labor, wisely and intelli-
gently directed, that a people can become or remain
permanently prosperous and happy; it is only by means
of intelligent and educated voters that liberty can be
preserved; and it is only by means of a more complete
education among all classes that humanity can rise to
a higher type of social evolution. There is no slavery
so oppressive as that of ignorance.
29. ELEMENTS OF THE AMERICAN
GOVERNMENT.
1. The English colonists in America, generally speak-
ing, were men who were seeking new homes in a new
world. They brought with them their families and all
that was most dear to them. Many of them were edu-
cated men, and all possessed their full share, according
to their social condition, of knowledge and attainments
of that age.

2. The distinctive characteristic of their settlement is
the introduction of the civilization of Europe into a
wilderness, without bringing with it the political insti-
tutions of Europe. The arts, sciences, and literature of
England came over with the settlers. That great por-
tion of the common law which regulates the social and
personal relations and conduct of inen, came also.
3. The jury cane; the habeas corpus came; the tes-
tamentary power came; and the law of inheritance and
descent came also, except that part of it which recog-
nizes the rights of primogeniture, which either did not
come at all, or soon gave way to the rule of equal par-
tition of estates among children.
4. But the monarchy did not come, nor the aristocracy,
nor the Church, as an estate of the realm. Political
institutions were to be framed anew, such as should be
adapted to the state of things. But it could not be
doubtful what should be the nature and character of
these institutions. A general social equality prevailed
among the settlers, and an equality of political rights
seemed the natural, if not the necessary consequence.

Foot-prints | on the sands of time.
8. Foot-prints, that perhaps another,
Sailing o'er life's solemn máin-
A forlorn | and shipwrecked brother-
Seeing, shall take heart again.
9. Let us, then, be úp and doing,
With a heart | for any fate;
Still achieving, still pursúing,
Learn to lábor , and to wàit.

4. APOSTROPHE TO THE OCEAN.
[This poem is to be read with slow movement, median stress, expul.
sive orotund quality, and strong force.]
1.
There is a pléasure | in the pathless woods,
There is a rápture | on the lonely shòre,
There is sóciety, where none intrùdes,
By the deep sèa, and music in its ròar.
I love not man the léss, but nature | mòre,
From these our interviews, in which I steal |
From all I may be, or have been before,
To mingle with the universe, and feel |
What I can ne'er expréss, yet can not all conceal.
2.
Rõll on, thou dēep and dārk blūe ocean, róll !
Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain.
Mán | marks the larth with rùin—his control |
Stops with the shère ;-upon the watery pláin |
The wrécks / are all thy deed, nor doth remain |
A shàdow of man's rávage, save his own,
When, for a moment, like a drop of ráin,
He sinks into thy dépths | with bubbling gróan-
Without a gráve, unknēlled, uncoffined, and unknown.
3.
The armaments | which thunderstrike the walls |
Of rock-built cities, bidding nations quáke, |
And monarchs tremble in their cápitals;
The oak levíathan, whose huge rabs make |
Their clay creator | the vain títle take
Of lord of thee, and arbiter of war
Thése | are thy toys, and, as the snowy flake,
They melt into thy yeast of waves, which mar
Alike the Armada's pride, or spoils of Trafalgàr.

Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thèe ; —
Assýria, Greece, Róme, Cárthage, what are they?
Thy waters | washi'd them power | while they were frée,
And many a týrant | since ; their shores obey |
The stránger, slúve, or sàvage; their decay |
Has dried up réalms to dèserts : not so thôu;
Unchángeable | save to thy wild waves' pláy,
Time writes nó wrànkle on thine azure brow :
Such as creation's dáwn behéld, thou rollest now.

Thou glorious mèrror, where the Almighty's form
Glasses itself in tèmpests ; in all tàme,
Cálm or convùlsed-in breeze, or gále, or stórm-
Icing the póle, or in the torrid clime |
Dark héaving ; boundless, ēndless, and sublīme!
The image of etèrnity—the throne
Of the Invisible ; even from out thy slime
The monsters of the dèep | are made ; each zóne |
Obeys thee; thou goest forth, drēad, fāthomless, aldne.
6.
And I have ldved thee, ócean! and my joy |
Of youthful sports / was on thy brèast to be
Bórne, like thy búbbles, onward ; from a boy |
I wantoned with thy breakers—they | to me |
Were a delàght; and, if the freshening sea |
Made them a térror, 't was a pleasing féar;
For I was, as it were, a child of thèe,
And trusted to thy bíllows fár and nèar,
And laid my hand upon thy mánemas do I hère.

5. BATTLE OF WATERLOO.
There was a sound of revelry by night,
And Belgium's cápital had gathered then
Her beaúty and her chavalry, and bright
The lamps shone o'er fair women and bráve mèn;
A thoúsand heárts beat hàppily; and when
Músic arose with its voluptuous swell,
Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spdke again,
And all went mérry as a màrriage-bell ;-
But hùsh! hàrk! a deep sound strikes like a rising knèll !
2.
Did ye not héar it ?-Nò; 't was but the wind,
Or the càr rattling o'er the stony street:
On with the dànce! let joy be unconfined ;
No sleep till mòrn, when youth and pleasure meet
To chase the glowing hours with flying féet,
But hårk !—that heavy sound breaks in once more,
As if the clduds its ècho would repeat;
And nèarer, clèarer, dèadlier than before !
Arm! ARM! it is—it is—the cànnon's opening roar !
3.
Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fró,
And gathering téars, and tremblings of distress,
And cheeks all pále, which but an hour ago
Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness;
And there were sudden pàrtings, such as press
The làfe from out young hearts, and choking sàghs
Which ne'er might be repeated; who could guess
If ever more should meet those inutual eyes,
Since upon night so swéet such awful mòrn could rise ?

And there was mounting in hot hàste; the stéed,
The mustering squádron, and the clattering cár,

And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;
And the deep thúnder peal on peal afár;
And néar, the beat of the alárming drùm
Roused up the soldier ere the morning stàr;
While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,
Or whispering with white lips: “ The fde! They come !

And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,
Dewy with nature's téar-drops, as they páss,
Griéving, if aught inanimate e'er griéves,
Over the unretúrning bràve—alás !-
Ere evening to be trodden fike the grass,
Which now beneath them, but above shall grow
In its něxt verdure, when this fiery mass
Of living válor, rolling on the fóe,
And burning with high hópe, shāll mõulder cold and low

Last noon beheld them full of lústy life;
Last éve in Beaùty's circle proudly gdy;
The midnight brought the signal-sound of stràfe ;
The mórn, the marshaling in arms—the dáy,
Battle's magnificently stern arrdy!
The thunder-clouds close d'er it, which, when rént,
The earth is covered thick with other clay-

bearing the lily, palm, and javelin, and beneath, in the foreground,
the sick and maimed, who are healed by her intercession.
1. Whene'er a noble deed | is wrought,
Whene'er is spoke | a noble thought,
Our hearts, in glad surprise,
To higher lèvels | rise.
2. The tidal wave of deeper souls |
Into our inmost being | rólls,
And lifts us | unawares
Out of all meaner càres.
3. Honor to those whose words and deeds
Thus help us in our daily needs.
And | by their óverflow
Raise us | from what is low!
4. Thus thought I, as by night I réad |
Of the great army of the dead,
The trenches | cold and dámp,
The starved | and frozen càmp;

In dreary hospitals of páin-
The cheerless corridors,
The cold | and stony floors.
6. Ló! in that house of misery |
A lady | with a lamp | I see |
Pass through the glimmering gloom,
And flit | from room to room.

The speechless sufferer | turns to kiss |
Her shádow, as it falls |
Upon the darkening walls.

7. THE DEATH STRUGGLE.
[An example of animated and impassioned description, characterized

“Now yield thee, or, by Him who made
The world, thy heàrt's blood dyes my blade !”
“Thy threats, thy mercy I defý!
Let recreant yiéld, who fears to dîe."
- Like adder darting from his cóil,
Like wolf that dashes through the toil,
Like mountain-cat who guards her young,
Full at Fitz-James's throat he sprùng;
Received, but recked not of a wound,
And locked his arms his foeman round.-
Now, gallant Saxon, hold thine own!
No maiden's arm is round thee thrówn!

That desperate grasp thy frame might feel
Through bars of brass and triple steel !
They túg, they stráin ! dówn, dówn, they gò,
The Gael above, Fitz-James below.
The Chieftain's gripe his throat compressed;
His knee was planted in his brèast;
His clotted locks he backward threw,
Across his brow his hand he drew,
From blood and mist to clear his sight,
Then gleamed aloft his dagger bright!
- But hate and fury ill supplied
The stream of life's exhausted tide;
And all too late the advantage came,
To turn the odds of deadly gàme;
For, while the dagger gleamed on high,
Reeled soul and sénse, reeled brain and èye.
Down came the blow! but in the heath
The erring bláde found bloodless shèath.
The struggling foe may now unclasp
The fainting Chief's relaxing gràsp;
Unwounded from the dreadful close,
But breathless áll, Fitz-James aròse.

1. Have you read in the Talmud of old,
In the Legends the Rabbins have told
Of the limitless realms of the air;
Have you réad it—the marvelous stóry
Of Sandalphon, the Angel of Glóry,
Sandálphon, the Angel of Práyer ?

Of the City Celestial he waits,
With his feet on the ladder of light,

That, crowded with angels unnúmbered,
By Jacob was seen, as he slúmbered
Alone in the desert at night?
3. The Angels of Wind and of Fire
Chant only one hymn, and expíre
With the song's irresistible stress-
Expire in their rapture and wonder,
As harp-strings are broken asunder
By music they throb to express.
4. But serene in the rapturous throng,
Unmoved by the rush of the song,
With eyes unimpassioned and slów,
Among the dead ángels, the deathless
Sandálphon stands listening, breathless,
To sounds that ascend from below;- .
5. From the spirits on earth that adóre,
From the souls that entreat and implóre
In the fervor and passion of prayer;
From the hearts that are broken with losses,
And weary with dragging the crosses
Too heavy for mortals to beàr.
6. And he gathers the prayers as he stánds,
And they change into flowers in his hands,
Into garlands of purple and rèd ;
And beneath the great arch of the portal,
Through the streets of the City Immortal
Is wafted the fragrance they shed.
7. It is but a legend I know,
A fáble, a phántom, a show,
Of the ancient Rabbinical lóre;
Yet the old mediæval tradition,
The beautiful, strange superstition,
But haunts me and holds me the mòre.

8. When I look from my window at night,
And the welkin above is all whíte,
All throbbing and panting with stárs,
Among them, majestic, is standing
Sandálphon, the ángel, expanding
His pínions in nebulous bàrs.
9. And the légend, I féel, is a párt
Of the hunger and thirst of the heart-
The frenzy and fire of the brain,
That grasps at the fruitage forbidden,
The golden pomegranates of Eden,
To quiet its fever and pain. LONGFELLOW.

1. In their ragged regiméntals,
Stood the old Continentals,

When the Grenadiers were lúnging,
And like hail fell the plunging
Cannon-shot;
When the files
Of the ísles,
From the smoky night encampment bore the banner of
the rampant
Únicorn,
And grummer, grummer, grummer, rolled the roll of the
drummer,
Through the mòrn!

And with guns horizontal,
Stood our sères ;

And the balls whistled déadly,
And in streams flashing rédly
Blazed the fires ;
As the roar
On the shore,
Swept the strong battle-breakers o'er the green-sodded
acres
Of the plàin ;
And louder, louder, louder, cracked the black gunpowder,
Cracked amàin !
3. Now like smiths at their fórges
Worked the red St. George's
Cannonièrs ;
And the villainous “saltpéter”
Rang a fierce, discordant méter
Round their ears;
As the swift
Stórm-drift,
With hot, sweeping ánger, came the horse-guards' clangor
On our flànks.
Then higher, higher, higher, burned the old-fashioned fire
Through the rànks !
4. Then the old-fashioned Colonel
Galloped through the white infernal
Powder-cloud;
And his broadsword was swinging,
And his brazen throat was ringing
Trùmpet-loud.
Then the blue
Bullets fléw,
And the trooper-jackets rédden at the touch of the leaden
Rifle-breath.
And rounder, rounder, rounder, roared the iron six-pounder,
Hurling death!

10. THE WINDS.
[Read this poem line by line, and let the class repeat, in concert,
after you. Then require each pupil, in turn, to go upon the platform
and read one stanza, subject to the criticism of the class and teacher.]
1.
Ye winds, ye unseen currents of the air,
Softly ye played, a few brief hours agó;
Ye bore the murmuring bèe; ye tossed the hair
O'er maiden cheeks that took a frèsher glow;
Ye rolled the round white cloud through depths of blue,
Ye shook from shaded flowers the lingering dèw;
Before you the catàlpa’s blossom fléw,
Light blossoms, dropping on the grass like snów.
2.
What change is this? Ye take the càtaract's sound;
Ye take the whirlpool's fury and its might;
The mountain shùdders as ye sweep the ground;
The valley woods lie próne beneath your flight;
The clouds before you shoot like eagles past;
The homes of men are rocking in your blàst;
Ye lift the roofs like autumn leaves, and cast,
Skyward, the whirling fragments out of sight.
3.
The weary fowls of heaven make wing in vain,
To 'scape your wràth; ye seize and dash them dèad ;
Against the earth ye drive the roaring ràin ;
The harvest field becomes a ràver's bed ;
And torrents tumble from the hills around;
Plains turn to lákes, and villages are drowned;
And wailing vòices, midst the tempest's sound,
Ríse, as the rushing waters swéll and spread.
4.
Ye dart upon the deep; and straight is heard
A wilder roar; and men grow pale and prày;

355
Ye fling its floods around you, as a bird
Flings o'er his shivering pluines the fountain's spray.
See! to the breaking mast the sàilor clings;
Ye scoop the ocean to its briny springs,
And take the mountain billow on your wings,
And pile the wreck of nàvies round the bay.
5.
Why rage ye thùs ?-no strife for liberty
Has made you mád; no tyrant, strong through féar,
Has chained your pinions till ye wrenched them frée,
And rushed into the unmeasured atmosphere;
For ye were born in freedom where ye blow;
Free o'er the mighty deep to come and gò;
Earth's solemn woods were yours, her wastes of snow,
Her isles where summer blossoms all the year.
6.
O ye wild winds; a mightier power than yours
In chains upon the shore of Eùrope lies ;
The sceptered throng, whose fetters he endúres,
Watch his mute throes with tèrror in their eyes;
And armed wdrriors all around him stànd,
And, as he struggles, tighten every bánd,
And lift the heavy spear, with threatening hánd,
To pierce the victim, should he strive to rise.
7.
Yet oh! when that wronged Spirit of our race
Shall break, as soon he must, his long-worn cháins,
And leap in freedom from his prison-place,
Lord of his ancient hills and fruitful pláins,
Let him not rise, like these mad winds of air,
To waste the loveliness that time could spáre,
To fill the earth with wóe, and blot the fair
Unconscious breast with blood from húman veins.

But may he like the Spring-time come abroad,
Who crumbles Winter's gyves with gentle might,
When in the genial breeze, the breath of God,
Come spouting up the unsealed springs to light;
Flowers start from their dark prisons at his feet,
The woods, long dúmb, awake to hymnings sweet ;
And morn and eve, whose glimmerings almost méet,
Crowd back to narrow bounds the ancient night.

11. THE DAY IS DONE.
1. The day is dòne, and the darkness
Falls from the wings of Night,

From an eagle in his flight.
2. I see the lights of the village
Gleam through the rain and the mist,
And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me
That my soul cannot resist.
3. A feeling of sadness and longing,
That is not akin to páin,
And resembles sorrow only,
As the mist resembles the rain.
4. Come, read to me some poem,
Some simple and heartfelt láy,
That shall soothe this restless feeling,
And banish the thoughts of dày.

Not from the bards sublíme,
Whose distant footsteps echo

Their mighty thoughts suggést
Life's endless tóil and endeavor ;
And to-night I long for rèst.
7. Read from some húmbler poet,
Whose songs gushed from his heart,
As showers from the clouds of summer,
Or téars from the eyelids stàrt;
8. Whó, through long days of lábor,
And nights devoid of éase,
Still heard in his soul the music
Of wonderful melodies.
9. Such songs have power to quiet
The restless pulse of care,
And come like the benediction
That follows after pràyer.
10. Then read from the treasured volume
The poem of thy choice,
And lend to the rhyme of the poet
The beauty of thy vòice.
11. And the night shall be filled with mùsic,
And the cares that infest the day,
Shall fold their tents like the Arabs,
And as silently steal awày.

Alone the chirp of flitting bírd,
And talk of children on the hill,
And bell of wandering kène | are heard.
4. No solemn host goes trailing by
The black-mouthed gún | and staggering wáin ;
Men start not at the battle-cry;
Oh, be it never héard again !
5. Soon rested those who fought; but thou,
Who minglest in the hårder strife
For truths which men receive not nów,
Thị warfare | only ends with làfe.
6. A friendless warfare ! lingering long |
Through weary dáy | and weary year.
A wild and many-weaponed thróng |
Hang on thy frónt, and flánk, and rear.
7. Yet nerve thy spirit to the proof,
And blench not at thy chosen lót;
The timid good may stand aloof,
The sage may frówn-yet faint thou not.
8. Nor heed the shaft | too surely cást,
The foul | and hissing bolt of scórn;
For with thy side | shall dwell, at lást,
The victory of endurance | born.
9. Tráth | crushed to earth | shall rìse again ;
The eternal years of God are hers;
But Érror | wounded, writhes in páin,
And dies among his worshipers.

Hast thou a chàrm to stay the morning-star
In his steep course? So lòng he seems to pause
On thy bald, awful head, O sovereign Blànc!
The Arve and Arveiron at thy base
Rave ceaselessly ; but thou, most awful fórm,
Risest from forth thy silent sea of pines,
How sìlently! Around thee and above,
Dèep is the air and dàrk; substantial black;
An ébon màss: methinks thou pàercest it
As with a wèdge ! But when I look again,
It is thine own cálm hòme, thy crystal shrine,
Thy hábitation from éternity.
O dread and silent Mount ! I gazed upon thee,
Till thóu, still present to the bodily sense,
Didst vànish from my thòught: entranced in práyer,
I worshiped the Invisible alone.
Yet, like some sweet, beguiling mélody-
So sweet, we know not we are listening to it-
Thou, the meanwhile, wast blending with my thought,
Yea, with my làfe and life's own secret joy;

From dark and icy càverns called you forth,

For ever sháttered and the same for èver ?

And stopped at önce amid their maddest plùnge!

Beneath the keen full moon ? Who bade the sun
Clothe you with ràinbows? Who, with living fldwers

Utter forth “Gôd !” and fill the hills with praise.
Once more, hoar móunt ! with thy sky-pointing peak,
Oft from whose feet the avalanche, unhéard,
Shoots dównward, glittering through the pure seréne,
Into the depth of clouds that veil thy breast-
Thou, too, again, stupendous mountain! thóu,
That, as I raise my héad, awhile bowed low
In adoration, upward from thy base
Slow-traveling with dim eyes suffused with tears,
Solemnly seemest, like a vapory cldud,
To rise before me-rèse, oh, èver rise;
Rise, like a cloud of incense, from the earth!
Thou kingly spèrit throned among the hills,

And tell the stàrs, and tell yon rising sùn,

And choral symphonies, dáy without night,
Circle his throne rejòicing; ye, in Héaven,
On earth, join àll ye creatures, to extol
Him first, him lást, him midst, and without ènd.
Fairest of stàrs, last in the train of night,
If better thou belong not to the dáwn,
Sure pledge of day, that crown'st the smiling morn
With thy bright círclet, próise him in thy sphére,
While dày arises, that sweet hour of prime.
Thou Sùn, of this great world both eye and soul,
Acknowledge him thy grèater; sound his praise
In thy éternal course, both when thou climb'st,
And when high noon hast gained, and when thou fållet
Mdon, that now meet'st the oricnt Sún, now fly'st,
With the fixed stàrs, fixed in their orb that flies;
And ye five other wandering fires, that move
In mystic dánce not without sóng, resound
Hís praise, who out of dárkness called up làght.
Air, and ye elements, the eldest birth
Of Nature's womb, that in quaternion run,
Perpétual círcle, múltiform.; and mix
And nourish áll things; let your ceaseless change
Vary to our great Máker still new pràise.

Ye místs and exhalùtions, that now rise
From hill or steaining láke, dúsky or gráy,
Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold,
In honor to the world's great Author rìse ;
Whether to deck with clouds the uncolored ský,
Or wet the thirsty earth with falling shòwers,
Rísing or fàlling, still advance his pràise.
His praise, ye winds, that from four quarters blow,
Breathe sóft or loud ; and wave your tops, ye pines,
With every plant, in sign of worship, wàve.
Fountains, and ye that warble as ye flow,
Melódious murmurs, warbling, tune hís pràise.
Join voices all, ye living souls: ye birds,

Bear on your wings and in your notes his pràise.

To him who | in the love of Nature holds
Communion with her visible fórms, she speaks
A várious lànguage ; for his gáyer hours |
She has a voice of gladness, and a smile
And eloquence of beauty, and she glides
Into his dárker musings with a mild |
And healing sympathy, that steals awày
Their sharpness | ere he is aware. When thoughts |
Of the last bitter hour | come like a blight |
Over thy spírit, and sad images |
Of the stern ágony, and shroud, and páll,
And breathless dárkness, and the narrow hóuse,
Make thee to shúdder | and grow sick at heart,

Earth and her wáters, and the depths of áir-
Comes | a still vòice :—Yet a few dáys / and thee |
The all-beholding sún | shall see no more
In all his course ; nor yet in the cold ground,
Where thy pale form was laid with many téars,
Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist |
Thý image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall clàim
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again ;
And, lost each hùman tráce, surrendering up
Thine indivàdual being, shalt thou go
To mix forever with the elements,
To be a brother | to the insensible rock |
And to the sluggish clòd, which the rude swain
Turns with his sháre, and trèads upon. The oak
Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mòld.
Yet not to thine eternal resting-place!
Shalt thou retire alone—nor could'st thou wish |
Couch móre magnàficent. Thou shalt lie down ||
With patriarchs | of the infant world—with kings,
The powerful of the earth—the wèse, the good,
Fair fórms, and hoary séers of ages pást,
All | in one mighty sèpulcher. The hills,
Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sún; the vàles,
Stretching in pensive quietness between;
The venerable woods ; rívers, that move
In májesty; and the complaining bròoks,
That make the meadows grèen ; and, poured round áll
Old ocean's gray and melancholy waste-
Are but the solemn decorations | áll ||
Of the great tomb of màn! The golden sùn,
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,
Are shining on the sad abodes of déath,
Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread
The globe | are but a handful | to the tribes

Scoùrged to his dungeon; but, sustained and soothed
By an unfaltering trúst, approach thy gráve |
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.

Ring in the love of truth and right,

The wind is gathering in the west;
The upturned leaves first whiten and flutter,
Then droop to a fitful rest;
Up from the stream with sluggish flap
Struggles the gull, and floats away;
Nearer and nearer rolls the thunder-clap;
We shall not see the sun go down to-day.
Now leaps the wind on the sleepy marsh,
And tramples the grass with terrified feet;
The startled river turns leaden and barsh-
You can hear the quick heart of the tempest beat.

Look! look !—that livid flash!
And instantly follows the rattling thunder,
As if some cloud-crag, split asunder,
Fell, splintering with a ruinous crash,
On the earth, which crouches in silence under;
And now a solid gray wall of rain
Shuts off the landscape, mile by mile.
For a breath's space I see the blue wood again,
And, ere the next heart-beat, the wind-hurled pile,
That seemed but now a league aloof,
Bursts rattling over the sun-parched roof.

[To be read with declamatory and dramatic force, radical and

1. When Freedom from her mountain height
Unfurled her standard to the air,
She tore the azure robe of night,
And set the stars of glory there;
She mingled with its gorgeous dyes
The milky baldric of the skies,
And striped its pure celestial white
With streakings of the morning light;
Then, from his mansion in the sun,
She called her eagle-bearer down,
And gave into his mighty hand
The symbol of her chosen land.
2. Majestic monarch of the cloud !
Who rear'st aloft thy regal form,
To hear the tempest-trumpings loud
And see the lightning lances driven,
When strive the warriors of the storm,
And rolls the thunder-drum of heaven,-
Child of the Sun! to thee 'tis given
To guard the banner of the free;
To hover in the sulphur-smoke,
To ward away the battle-stroke,
And bid its blendings shine afar,
Like rainbows on the cloud of war-
The harbingers of victory!
3. Flag of the brave! thy folds shall fly,
The sign of hope and triumph high,
When speaks the signal trumpet tone,
And the long line comes gleaming on.
Ere yet the life-blood, warm and wet,
Has dimmed the glistening bayonet,

Each soldier's eye shall brightly turn
To where thy sky-born glories burn;
And, as his springing steps advance,
Catch war and vengeance from the glance;
And, when the cannon-mouthings loud
Heave in wild wreaths the battle-shroud,
And gory sabres rise and fall
Like shoots of flame on midnight's pall,
Then shall thy meteor glances glow,
And cowering foes shall fall beneath
Each gallant arm that strikes below
That lovely messenger of death.
4. Flag of the seas ! on ocean's wave
Thy stars shall glitter o'er the brave.
When Death, careering on the gale,
Sweeps darkly round the bellied sail,
And frighted waves rush wildly back,
Before the broadside's reeling rack,
Each dying wanderer of the sea
Shall look at once to heaven and thee,
And smile to see thy splendors fly,
In triumph, o'er his closing eye.
5. Flag of the free heart's only home,
By angel hands to valor given,
Thy stars have lit the welkin dome,
And all thy hues were born in heaven.
Forever float that standard sheet!
Where breathes the foe but falls before us,
With Freedom's soil beneath our feet,
And Freedom's banner waving o'er us !

In gulfs enchanted, where the siren sings,
And coral reefs lie bare,
Where the cold sea-maids rise to sun their streaming
hair.
2.
WI
Its webs of living gauze no more unfurl;
Wrecked is the ship of pearl !
And every chambered cell,
Where its dim dreaming life was wont to dwell,
As the frail tenant shaped his growing shell,
Before thee lies revealed-
Its irised ceiling rent, its sunless crypt unsealed !
3.
Year after year beheld the silent toil
That spread his lustrous coil;
Still, as the spiral grew,
He left the past year's dwelling for the new,
Stole with soft step its shining archway through,
Built up its idle door,
Stretched in his last found home, and knew the old no
more.
4.
Thanks for the heavenly message brought by thee,
Child of the wandering sea,
Cast from her lap forlorn!

From thy dead lips a clearer note is born
Than ever Triton blew from wreathéd horn!
While on my ear it rings,
Through the deep caves of thought I hear a voice that
sings-
5.
Build thee more stately mansions, O my soul,
As the swift seasons roll!
Leave thy low-vaulted past !
Let each new temple, nobler than the last,
Shut thee from heaven with a dome more vast,
Till thou at length art free,
Leaving thine outgrown shell by life's unresting sea!

24. KENTUCKY BELLE.
1.
Summer of 'sixty-three, sir, and Conrad was gone away,
Gone to the county-town, sir, to sell our first load of hay;
We lived in the log-house yonder, poor as ever you ’ve
seen;
Röschen there was a baby, and I was only nineteen.
2.
Conrad, he took the oxen, but he left Kentucky Belle.
How much we thought of Kentuck, I could n't begin to
tell—
Came from the Blue-Grass country; my father gave her
to me
When I rode north with Conrad, away from the Ten-
nessee.
Conrad lived in Ohio, a German he is, you know;
The house stood in broad cornfields, stretching on, row
after row.

The old folks made me welcome; they were kind as
kind could be ;
But I kept longing, longing, for the hills of the Ten-
nessee.
Oh ! for a sight of water, the shadowed slope of a hill!
Clouds that hang on the summit, a wind that never is
still !
But the level land went stretching away to meet the
sky,
Never a rise, from north to south, to rest the weary eye!
5.
From east to west, no river to shine out under the moon,
Nothing to make a shadow in the yellow afternoon :
Only the breathless sunshine, as I looked out, all forlorn ;
Only the “rustle, rustle,” as I walked among the corn.
6.
When I fell sick with pining, we did n't wait any more,
But moved away from the corn-lands, out to this river-
shore-
The Tuscarawas it's called, sir; off there's a hill, you
see;
And now I've grown to like it next best to the Ten-
nessee.
7.
I was at work that morning. Some one came riding
like mad
Over the bridge and up the road—Farmer Rouf's little
lad.
Bareback he rode; he had no hat; he hardly stopped
to say,
“ Morgan's men are coming, Frau ; they ’re galloping on
this way.

“I'm sent to warn the neighbors. He is n't a mile
behind ;
He sweeps up all the horses—every horse that he can
find.
Morgan, Morgan the raider, and Morgan's terrible men,
With bowie-knives and pistols, are galloping up the
glen!”
9.
The lad rode down the valley, and I stood still at the
door;
The baby laughed and prattled, played with spools on
the floor;
Kentuck was out in the pasture; Conrad, my man, was
gone.
Near, nearer, Morgan's men were galloping, galloping on!
10.
Sudden I picked up baby, and ran to the pasture-bar;
“Kentuck!” I called—“ Kentucky!” She knew me ever
so far!
I led her down the gully that turns off there to the right,
And tied her to the bushes, her head just out of sight.
11.
As I ran back to the log house, at once there came a
sound-
The ring of hoofs, galloping hoofs, trembling over the
ground-
Coming into the turnpike out from the White-Woman
Glen,
Morgan, Morgan the raider, and Morgan's terrible men.
12.
As near they drew and nearer, my heart beat fast in
alarm;

But still I stood in the door-way, with baby on my arm.
They came; they passed ; with spur and whip in haste
they sped along-
Morgan, Morgan the raider, and his band, six hundred
strong
13.
Weary they looked and jaded, riding through night and
through day;
Pushing on east to the river, many long miles away,
To the border-strip where Virginia runs up into the west,
And fording the Upper Ohio before they could stop to rest.
14.
On like the wind they hurried, and Morgan rode in
advance;
Bright were his eyes like live coals, as he gave me a
sideways glance;
And I was just breathing freely, after my choking pain,
When the last one of the troopers suddenly drew his rein.
15.
Frightened I was to death, sir; I scarce dared look in
his face,
As he asked for a drink of water, and glanced around
the place.
I gave him a cup, and he smiled—'t was only a boy,
you see;
Faint and worn; with dim-blue eyes; and he'd sailed
on the Tennessee.
16.
Only sixteen he was, sir-a fond mother's only son-
Off and away with Morgan before his life had begun !
The damp drops stood on his temples; drawn was the
boyish mouth;
And I thought me of the mother waiting down in the
South.

17.
Oh! pluck was he to the backbone, and clear grit through
and through;
Boasted and bragged like a trooper; but the big words
would n't do; —
The boy was dying, sir, dying, as plain as plain could be,
Worn out by his ride with Morgan up from the Ten-
nessee.
18.
But when I told the laddie that I too was from the
South,
Water came in his dim eyes, and quivers around his
mouth.
“Do you know the Blue-Grass country ?” he wistful
began to say;
Then swayed like a willow-sapling, and fainted dead
away.
19.
I had him into the log house, and worked and brought
him to;
I fed him, and I coaxed him, as I thought his mother’d
do;
And when the lad got better, and the noise in his head
was gone,
Morgan's men were miles away, galloping, galloping on.
20.
“Oh, I must go,” he muttered; “I must be up and away!
Morgan-Morgan is waiting for me! Oh, what will
Morgan say ?”
But I heard a sound of tramping and kept him back
from the door-
The ringing sound of horses' hoofs that I had heard
before.

21.
And on, on, came the soldiers—the Michigan cavalry---
And fast they rode, and black they looked, galloping
rapidly,–
They had followed hard on Morgan's track; they had
followed day and night ;
But of Morgan and Morgan's raiders they never had
caught a sight.
22.
And rich Ohio sat startled through all those summer
days;
For, strange, wild men were galloping over her broad
highways,
Now here, now there, now seen, now gone, now north,
now east, now west,
Through river-valleys and corn-land farms, sweeping
away her best.
23.
A bold ride and a long ride! But they were taken at
last.
They almost reached the river by galloping hard and fast;
But the boys in blue were upon them ere ever they
gained the ford,
And Morgan, Morgan the raider, laid down his terrible
sword.
24.
Well, I kept the boy till evening—kept him against .
his will-
But he was too weak to follow, and sat there pale and
still.
When it was cool and dusky—you 'll wonder to hear
me tell
But I stole down to that gully, and brought up Ken-
tucky Belle.

25.
I kissed the star on her forehead-my pretty, gentle
lass-
But I knew that she'd be happy back in the old Blue-
Grass.
A suit of clothes of Conrad's with all the money I had,
And Kentuck, pretty Kentuck, I gave to the worn-out
lad.
26.
I guided him to the southward as well as I knew how;
The boy rode off with many thanks, and many a back-
ward bow;
And then the glow it faded, and my heart began to
swell,
As down the glen away she went, my lost Kentucky
Belle !
27.
When Conrad came in the evening, the moon was shin-
ing high ;
Baby and I both were crying—I could n't tell him
why-
But a battered suit of rebel gray was hanging on the
wall,
And a thin, old horse with drooping head, stood in
Kentucky's stall.
28.
Well, he was kind, and never once said a hard word to
me;
He knew I could n't help it—'t was all for the Tennessee.
But, after the war was over, just think what came to
pass,
A letter, sir; and the two were safe back in the old
Blue-Grass.

The lad got over the border, riding Kentucky Belle;
And Kentuck she was thriving, and fat, and hearty, and
well;
He cared for her and kept her, nor touched her with
whip or spur.
Ah! we've had many horses since, but never a horse
like her!

25. THE CHARCOAL MAN.
1. Though rudely blows the wintry blast,
And sifting snows fall white and fast,
Mark Haley drives along the street,
Perched high upon his wagon seat;
His somber face the storm defies,
And thus from morn till eve he cries,—
“ Charcoʻ! charcoʻ!”
While echo faint and far replies -
“Hark, 0! Hark, 0 !”
“ Charco’!”—“ Hark, 0 !”–Such cheery sounds
Attend him on his daily rounds.
2. The dust begrimes his ancient hat;
His coat is darker far than that ;
'T is odd to see his sooty form
All speckled with the feathery storm ;
Yet in his honest bosom lies
Nor spot nor speck,—though still he cries,
“ Charco'! charco?!”
And many a roguish lad replies -
" Ark, ho ! ark, ho !”
“ Charco'!” _“ Ark, ho !”-Such various sounds
Announce Mark Haley's morning rounds.

3. Thus all the cold and wintry day
He labors much for little pay;
Yet feels no less of happiness
Than many a richer man, I guess,
When through the shades of eve he spies
The light of his own home, and cries, -
“ Charco'! charco'!”.
And Martha from the door replies, —
“ Mark, ho! Mark, ho!”
“ Charco?!”—Mark, ho !”-Such joy abounds
When he has closed his daily rounds.
4. The hearth is warm, the fire is bright;
And while his hand, washed clean and white,
Holds Martha's tender hand once more,
His glowing face bends fondly o’er
The crib wherein his darling lies,
And in a coaxing tone he cries,
“ Charco'! charco'!”
And baby with a laugh replies,
“Ah, go! ah, go !”
“ Charco’!”—“ Ah, go !”—while at the sounds
The mother's heart with gladness bounds.
5. Then honored be the charcoal man !
Though dusky as an African,
'Tis not for you, that chance to be
A little better clad than he,
His honest manhood to despise,
Although from morn till eve he cries,-
“ Charco'! charco’! ” .
While mocking echo still replies -
“ Hark, 0! hark, O!”
“ Charco’!”—“ Hark, 0 !”—Long may the sounds
Proclaim Mark Haley's daily rounds. TROWBRIDGE.

26. GRANDMOTHER'S STORY OF BUNKER HILL.
[The spirited rendering of this graphic picture affords a wide scope
for variety of expression. Care must be taken not to overdo it.]
1.
’T is like stirring living embers when, at eighty, one
remembers
All the achings and the quakings of “the times that
tried men's souls”;
When I talk of Whig and Tory, when I tell the Rebel
story,
To you the words are ashes, but to me they're burning
coals.
I had heard the muskets' rattle of the April running
battle;
Lord Percy's hunted soldiers, I can see their red coats
still;
But a deadly chill comes o'er me, as the day looms up
before me,
When a thousand men lay bleeding on the slopes of
Bunker's Hill.
’T was a peaceful summer's morning, when the first
thing gave us warning
Was the booming of the cannon from the river and the
shore:
“ Child,” says grandma, “what's the matter, what is all
this noise and clatter ?
Have those scalping Indian devils come to murder us
once more ?”
Poor old soul! my sides were shaking in the midst of
all my quaking,
To hear her talk of Indians when the guns began to roar:

She had seen the burning village, and the slaughter
and the pillage,
When the Mohawks killed her father with their bullets
through his door.
5.
Then I said, “Now, dear old granny, do n't you fret and
worry any,
For I'll soon come back and tell you whether this is
work or play ;
There can't be mischief in it, so I won't be gone a
minute"-
For a minute then I started. I was gone the livelong
day.
. 6.
o time for bodice-lacing or for looking-glass grimacing;
Down my hair went as I hurried, tumbling half-way
to my heels ;
God forbid your ever knowing, when there's blood
around her flowing,
How the lonely, helpless daughter of a quiet household
feels!
In the street I heard a thumping; and I knew it was
the stumping
of the Corporal, our old neighbor, on that wooden ley
he wore,
With a knot of women round him,-it was lucky I had
found him,
LU I followed with the others, and the Corporal marched
before.
They were making for the steeple,—the old soldier and
his people;

The pigeons circled round us as we climbed the creak-
ing stair,
Just across the narrow river-0, so close it made me
shiver !-
Stood a fortress on the hill-top that but yesterday was
bare.
Not slow our eyes to find it; well we knew who stood
behind it,
Though the earthwork hid them from us, and the stub-
born walls were dumb:
Here were sister, wife, and mother, looking wild upon
each other,
And their lips were white with terror as they said, THE
HOUR HAS COME!
10.
The morning slowly wasted, not a morsel had we
tasted,
And our heads were almost splitting with the cannons'
deafening thrill,
When a figure tall and stately round the rampart strode
sedately;
It was PRESCOTT, one since told me; he commanded on
the hill.
11.
Every woman's heart grew bigger when we saw his
manly figure,
With the banyan buckled round it, standing up so
straight and tall;
Like a gentleman of leisure who is strolling out for
pleasure,
Through the storm of shells and cannon-shot he walked
around the wall.

12.
At eleven the streets were swarming, for the red-coats
ranks were forming;
At noon in marching order they were moving to the piers;
How the bayonets gleamed and glistened, as we looked
far down and listened
To the tramping and the drum-beat of the belted gren-
adiers !
13.
At length the men have started, with a cheer (it seemed
faint-hearted),
In their scarlet regimentals, with their knapsacks on
their backs,
And the reddening rippling water, as after a sea-fight's
slaughter,
Round the barges gliding onward blushed like blood
along their tracks.
14.
So they crossed to the other border, and again they
formed in order;
And the boats came back for soldiers, came for soldiers,
soldiers still:
The time seemed everlasting to us women faint and
fasting,
At last they ’re moving, marching, marching proudly up
the hill.
15.
We can see the bright steel glancing all along the lines
advancing-
Now the front rank fire a volley—they have thrown
away their shot;
For behind their earth work lying, all the balls above
them flying,
Our people need not hurry; so they wait and answer not.

16.
Then the Corporal, our old cripple (he would swear some-
times and tipple),-
He had heard the bullets whistle in the old French
war) before,—
Calls out in words of jeering, just as if they all were
hearing,—
And his wooden leg thumps fiercely on the dusty belfry
floor :-
17.
“Oh! fire away, ye villains, and earn King George's
shillin's,
But ye 'll waste a ton of powder afore a 'rebel’ falls ;
You may bang the dirt and welcome, they ’re as safe as
Dan'l Malcolm
Ten feet beneath the gravestone that you've splintered
with your balls !”
18.
In the hush of expectation, in the awe and trepidation
Of the dread approaching moment, we are wellnigh
breathless all ;
Though the rotten bars are failing on the rickety belfry
railing,
We are crowding up against them like the waves against
a wall.
19.
Just a glimpse (the air is clearer), they are nearer,-
nearer, -nearer,
When a flash—a curling smoke-wreath-then a crash-
the steeple shakes-
The deadly truce is ended; the tempest's shroud is
rended;
Like a morning mist it gathered, like a thunder-cloud
it breaks !

O the sight our eyes discover as the blue-black smoke
blows over !
The red-coats stretched in windrows as a mower rakes
his hay;
Here a scarlet heap is lying, there a headlong crowd is
flying
Like a billow that has broken and is shivered into
spray.
21.
Then we cried, “The troops are routed ! they are beat-
it can't be doubted !
God be thanked, the fight is over!”-Ah! the grim old
soldier's smile !
“Tell us, tell us why you look so ?” (we could hardly
speak, we shook so),-
“Are they beaten ? Are they beaten ? ARE they beaten ?”
-“Wait a while.”
22.
O the trembling and the terror! for too soon we saw
our error:
They are baffled, not defeated; we have driven them
back in vain,
And the columns that were scattered, round the colors
that were tattered,
Toward the sullen silent fortress turn their belted breasts
again.
23.
All at once, as we are gazing, lo the roofs of Charles-
town blazing!
They have fired the harmless village ; in an hour it will
be down;
The Lord in heaven confound them, rain his fire and
brimstone round them,-

or
The robbing, murdering red-coats that would burn a
peaceful town!
24.
They are marching, stern and solemn; we can see each
massive column
As they near the naked earth-mound with the slanting
walls so steep.
Have our soldiers got faint-hearted, and in noiseless
haste departed ?
Are they panic-struck and helpless ? Are they palsied
or asleep?
25.
Now! the walls they ’re almost under! scarce a rod the
foes asunder!
Not a firelock flashed against them! up the earthwork
they will swarm !
But the words have scarce been spoken, when the omi-
nous calm is broken,
And a bellowing crash has emptied all the vengeance
of the storm!
26.
So again, with murderous slaughter, pelted backwards
to the water,
Fly Pigot's running heroes and the frightened braves
of Howe;
And we shout, “ At last they ’re done for, it's their
barges they have run for :
They are beaten, beaten, beaten; and the battle 's over
now !”
27.
And we looked, poor timid creatures, on the rough old
soldier's features,
Our lips afraid to question, but he knew what we would
ask:

“Not sure,” he said ; “ keep quiet,-once more, I guess,
they 'll try it,
Here's damnation to the cut-throats !”—then he handed
me his flask,
28.
Saying, “Gal, you're looking shaky; have a drop of
old Jamaiky;
I'm afeard there 'll be more trouble afore the job is
done ;"
So I took one scorching swallow; dreadful faint I felt
and hollow,
Standing there from early morning when the firing was
begun.
29.
All through those hours of trial I had watched a calm
clock-dial,
As the hands kept creeping, creeping,—they were creep-
ing round to four,
When the old man said, “They're forming with their
bagonets fixed for storming :
It's the death-grip that's a coming,—they will try the
works once more.”
30.
With brazen trumpets blaring, the flames behind them
glaring,
The deadly wall before them, in close array they come;
Still onward, upward toiling, like a dragon's fold un-
coiling, -
Like the rattlesnake's shrill warning the reverberating
drum!
31.
Over heaps all torn and gory—shall I tell the fearful
story,

How they surged above the breastwork, as a sea breaks
o'er a deck;
How, driven, yet scarce defeated, our worn-out men re-
treated,
With their powder-horns all emptied, like the swimmers
from a wreck ?
32.
It has all been told and painted; as for me, they say
I fainted,
And the wooden-legged old Corporal stumped with me
down the stair:
When I woke from dreams affrighted, the evening lamps
were lighted,
On the floor a youth was lying; his bleeding breast
was bare.
33.
And I heard through all the flurry, “Send for WARREN!
hurry! hurry!
Tell him here's a soldier bleeding, and he 'll come and
dress his wound!”
Ah, we knew not till the morrow told its tale of death
and sorrow,
How the starlight found him stiffened on the dark and
bloody ground.
.
34.
Who the youth was, what his name was, where the
place from which he came was,
Who had brought him from the battle, and had left
him at our door,
He could not speak to tell us; but 't was one of our
brave fellows,
As the homespun plainly showed us which the dying
soldier wore.

For they all thought he was dying, as they gathered
round him crying,-
And they said, “0, how they'll miss him !” and, “ What
will his mother do ?”
Then, his eyelids just unclosing like a child's that has
been dozing,
He faintly murmured, “Mother!”and—I saw his eyes
were blue.
36.
—“Why, grandma, how you 're winking !”—Ah, my child,
it sets me thinking
Of a story not like this one. Well, he somehow lived
along;
So we came to know each other, and I nursed him like
a—mother,
Till at last he stood before me, tall, and rosy-cheeked,
and strong
37.
And we sometimes walked together in the pleasant sum-
mer weather;
–“ Please to tell us what his name was ?”—Just your
own, my little dear,
There's his picture Copley painted: we became so well
acquainted,
That-in short, that's why I'm grandma, and you chil-
dren all are here !
