 PREFACE 
 
 IN preparing this Elocution Manual, the writer has made it 
 his aim to bring together selections that will be suitable 
 alike for class study, the drawing-room, and for public 
 reading ; and only those have been included that have 
 been proved by experience to be adapted to such purposes. 
 
 Among them are also to be found many new adaptations 
 from standard authors, condensed so as to bring them 
 within the scope of public recital. 
 
 The introductory rules have been made as brief as is 
 consistent with clearness, and the various exercises illus- 
 trating each of the rules have been specially chosen for 
 their effectiveness. 
 
 The writer desires to express his thanks to those authors 
 and publishers too numerous to mention individually 
 who have kindly granted him permission to make use of 
 copyright matter of much interest and value. 
 
 Should he unintentionally have committed any infringe- 
 ment of copyright, he desires to express his deep regret, and 
 trusts that such trespass will be forgiven.

 ELOCUTION 
 
 Definition. Elocution (from elocutus, e> out, and 
 loquor, I speak) is the art of delivering a discourse 
 impressively in public, and includes management of 
 the voice and gesture in speaking. Good elocution 
 consists in the natural expression of thought by 
 speech and gesture, and calls into play the organs 
 of articulation the palate the tongue the teeth 
 and the lips. 
 
 The Voice. The distinctive aim in vocal develop- 
 ment is to secure that purity, power, and variety of 
 tone which must unite to give character to the voice. 
 There are three distinct qualities of voice which ought 
 to be cultivated by all who aim at good, expressive 
 and impassioned speaking and reading, ist. Pure or 
 natural voice. 2nd. Orotund voice, ^rd. Aspirated 
 voice. 
 
 Pure Voice is employed in all utterances in which 
 the speaker addresses himself to the understanding, 
 and in which his chief aim is to be understood. It 
 is the perfection of vocal sound in giving expression 
 to gentle and moderate emotion. 
 
 Orotund Voice is employed to express whatever 
 is grand or sublime. Grandeur of thought and

 2 ELOCUTION 
 
 intensity of emotion demand a volume, force, and 
 resonance of tone, which mere purity of voice cannot 
 supply, and which can be attained only by the 
 careful cultivation of this improved condition of 
 voice. 
 
 Aspirated Voice expresses secrecy, fear, anger, 
 revenge, disgust, and all malignant passions ; as 
 well as all earnest utterances in their most intense 
 force. As an exercise if practised with force sufficient 
 to create such a full and distinct articulation as is 
 necessary in public speaking, it is of special benefit 
 in the attainment of a deep and free method of 
 breathing. 
 
 EXERCISES IN PURE VOICE 
 
 I. The grass is just as green, Tom ; barefooted boys at play 
 Were sporting just as we did then, with spirits just as gay. 
 But the Master sleeps upon the hill, which coated o'er 
 
 with snow, 
 Afforded us a sliding place, some forty years ago. 
 
 2. She was dead. No sleep so beautiful and calm, so free 
 from traces of pain, so fair to look upon. She seemed a 
 creature fresh from the hand of God, and waiting for the 
 breath of life ; not one who had lived, and suffered death. 
 
 EXERCISES ON OROTUND VOICE 
 
 3. And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, 
 lo, there was a great earthquake; and the sun became 
 black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon became as blood ; 
 and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig 
 tree eastern her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a 
 mighty wind. And the heaven departed as a scroll when 
 it is rolled together. And every mountain and island were

 ELOCUTION 3 
 
 moved out of their places; and the kings of the earth, 
 and the great men, and the rich men, and the chief 
 captains and the mighty men, and every bondman and 
 every freeman, hid themselves in the dens and in the 
 rocks of the mountains ; and said to the mountains and 
 rocks, Fall on us, and hide us from the face of him that 
 sitteth on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb : 
 for the great day of his wrath is come ; and who shall be 
 able to stand ? 
 
 4. The curfew tolls the knell of parting day, 
 The lowing herd winds slowly o'er the lea, 
 The ploughman homeward plods his weary way, 
 And leaves the world to darkness and to me. 
 
 EXERCISES ON THE ASPIRATED VOICE 
 
 5. Hark ! they whisper : angels say, 
 " Sister spirit, come away." 
 What is this absorbs me quite, 
 Steals my senses, shuts my sight, 
 Drowns my spirits, draws my breath? 
 Tell me, my soul, can this be death ? 
 
 6. Soldiers ! You are now within a few steps of the 
 enemy's outposts. Our scouts report them as slumbering 
 in parties around their watch-fires, and utterly unprepared 
 for our approach. A swift and noiseless advance around 
 that projecting rock and we are upon them. We capture 
 them without the possibility of resistance. Forward ! 
 
 Articulation. Articulation consists in the correct 
 and distinct utterance of sounds, syllables, and words. 
 The importance of a clear and distinct articulation 
 cannot be over-estimated. It gives to speech a 
 polish and finish which amply repay the time and 
 attention bestowed upon its cultivation.

## p. 4 (#20) ###############################################


 
 4 ELOCUTION 
 
 In acquiring a correct articulation the ear should 
 be trained to distinguish the finer shades of difference 
 in sounds, and the organs of speech should be care- 
 fully exercised until they are able to produce with 
 ease all the different sounds to which the human 
 voice is capable of giving utterance. 
 
 Modulation. By modulation is meant that 
 variety of tone and expression of the voice by 
 means of which the various sentiments contained 
 in any passage are illustrated. 
 
 It bears to a passage as a whole the same relation 
 that articulation bears towards inflection in sentences 
 or parts of a sentence. 
 
 It is simply a higher form of inflection, and not 
 only includes inflection, but also embraces pitch, 
 force, rate of utterance, emphasis, and pause. 
 
 Inflection. Inflection is a sliding of the voice 
 either upwards or downwards ; it gives the true 
 expression to speech. 
 
 Simple inflections are of two kinds the upward 
 or rising inflection, and the downward or falling 
 inflection. The union of these two inflections upon 
 the same syllable is called a compound inflection. 
 When the tone is not inflected, it is called a mono- 
 tone. 
 
 The acute accent ( ' ) denotes the rising, and the 
 grave accent ( x ) the falling inflection. 
 
 EXPRESSIVE QUALITIES OF THE INFLECTIONS 
 
 Rising tones appeal, falling tones assert. 
 Rising tones entreat or supplicate ; falling tones 
 command.

## p. 5 (#21) ###############################################


 
 ELOCUTION 5 
 
 Rising tones express ignorance or doubt; falling 
 tones express conviction or certainty. 
 
 Interrogative sentences to which a simple " Yes " 
 or " No " can be returned as an answer terminate 
 with the rising inflection ; when they cannot be so 
 answered, they end with the falling inflection. 
 
 7. Art thou a friend to Roderick ? 
 Hold thou the watch to-night ? 
 Did he speak properly ? 
 He went willing ly, not unwillingly. 
 It was done correctHy, not incorrectly. 
 
 All negative sentences and portions of sentences, 
 and sentences or clauses of sentences where the 
 meaning remains incomplete, end with the rising 
 inflection. 
 
 8. I cannot vouch my tale is true, 
 Nor say, indeed, 'tis wholly new ; 
 But true or false, or new or old, 
 I think you'll find it fairly told. 
 A Frenchman, who had ne'er before 
 Set foot upon a foreign shore, 
 Weary of home, resolved to go 
 And see what Holland had to show. 
 He didn't know a word of Dutch, 
 But that could hardly grieve him much ; 
 He thought, as Frenchmen always do, 
 That all the world could "Parley voo." 
 
 9. Oh, tell me, where did Katy live ? 
 And what did Katy do ? 
 And was she very fair and young ? 
 And yet so wicked, too ?

## p. 6 (#22) ###############################################


 
 6 ELOCUTION 
 
 Did Katy love a naughty man, 
 Or kiss more cheeks than one ? 
 I warrant Katy did no more 
 Than many a Kate has done. 
 
 Exclamations consisting of only one word take the 
 rising inflection ; as 
 
 10. What! H6w! Hurr'ah ! 
 
 The falling inflection should be used when the 
 sense is complete, whether at the end of a sentence 
 or a clause of a sentence. 
 
 II. Blessed are the merciful : for they shall obtain mer'cy. 
 Blessed are the pure in heart : for they shall see G6d. 
 Blessed are the peacemakers : for they shall be called 
 the children of God. 
 
 12. In peace, Love tunes the shepherd's reed, 
 In war, he mounts the warrior's steed, 
 
 In halls, in gay attire is seen ; 
 
 In hamlets, dances on the green. 
 
 Love rules the court, the camp, the gr6ve, 
 
 And men be!6w and saints above. 
 
 For love is heav'en, and Heav'en is 16ve. 
 
 13. " My fairest child, I have no song to give you ; 
 No lark could pipe to skies so dull and grey 
 Yet, ere we part, one lesson I can leave you 
 
 For every day. 
 
 " Be good, sweet maid, and let who will be clever, 
 Do noble things, not dream them, all day long : 
 And so make life, death, and that vast forever 
 One grand, sweet song."

## p. 7 (#23) ###############################################


 
 ELOCUTION 7 
 
 Compound Inflections are of two kinds rising 
 followed by the falling and falling followed by rising. 
 They are used to express extreme surprise, sarcasm, 
 contempt, and irony. 
 
 EXAMPLES 
 14. Do ! I tell you, I rather guess 
 
 She was a wonder, and nothing less. 
 
 15. Hath a dog money ? Is it possible a cur can lend three 
 thousand ducats? 
 
 EXAMPLE OF THE MONOTONE 
 
 16. Holy ! holy ! holy ! Lord God of Sabaoth. 
 
 Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean 'roll. 
 
 Pitch, Force, and Rate of Utterance. Pitch 
 is that quality which distinguishes between a high 
 or shrill, and a deep or round voice; light and 
 joyous emotions require a high pitch, as well as the 
 extremes of grief, pain, and fear. 
 
 The pitch deepens in proportion to the serious- 
 ness or solemnity of a passage. In elocution there 
 are three natural divisions of pitch high, medium, 
 and low. In each of these subdivisions may be made. 
 
 Force is something altogether distinct from pitch, 
 and relates to the loudness, and softness, of the voice. 
 Changes of force are produced by the different 
 degrees of power with which the breath is applied 
 upon the vocal cords. 
 
 In force, as in pitch, the reader should be able to

## p. 8 (#24) ###############################################


 
 8 ELOCUTION 
 
 recognise at least three degrees soft, medium, and 
 loud. 
 
 Rate of Utterance depends on the idea contained 
 in the passage read, and on the impression intended 
 to be left on the mind of the hearer. 
 
 The natural divisions of rate are slow, medium, 
 and quick, and from these other divisions may be 
 made. Light and buoyant moods and passages 
 illustrating rapidity of action require a correspond- 
 ingly quick rate of utterance ; dignity requires 
 regularity of movement ; while passages conveying 
 ideas of solemnity, reverence, awe, melancholy, and 
 despair, require a slower rate. 
 
 EXERCISES IN PITCH 
 High Pitch 
 
 17. Go ring the bells and fire the guns, 
 And fling the starry banners out ; 
 Shout " Freedom " till your lisping ones 
 Give back their cradle shout. 
 
 Medium Pitch 
 18. When on my day of life the night is falling, 
 
 And in the winds from unsunned spaces blown, 
 I hear far voices out of darkness calling 
 My feet to paths unknown. 
 
 Deep Pitch 
 
 19. The Lord doth reign and clothed is He 
 
 With majesty most bright : 
 His works do show Him clothed to be, 
 
 And girt about with might. 
 The world is also stablished 
 
 That it cannot depart, 
 Thy throne is fixed of old, and Thou 
 From everlasting art.

## p. 9 (#25) ###############################################


 
 ELOCUTION 9 
 
 EXERCISES IN FORCE 
 Soft 
 
 20. Flow softly, flow by lawn and lea, 
 
 A rivulet, then a river ; 
 No more by thee my steps shall be, 
 Forever and forever. 
 
 Medium 
 
 21. I grieve for life's bright promise, just shown and then 
 
 withdrawn ; 
 But still the sun shines round me, the evening bird 
 
 sings on, 
 
 And I again am soothed, and beside the ancient gate, 
 In this soft evening sunlight, I calmly stand and wait. 
 
 Loud 
 
 22. Come one, come all ! this rock shall fly 
 From its firm base as soon as I. 
 
 EXERCISES IN RATE OF UTTERANCE 
 
 Medium Rate 
 
 23. Maud Muller, on a summer's day, 
 Raked the meadow, sweet with hay, 
 Beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth 
 Of simple beauty and rustic health." 
 
 Quick Rate 
 
 24. So light to the croup the fair lady he swung, 
 So light to the saddle before her he sprung ; 
 
 " She is won ! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur ; 
 They'll have fleet steeds that follow ! " 
 Quoth young Lochinvar. 
 
 Slow Rate 
 
 25. Hear the tolling of the bells 
 
 Iron bells ! 
 What a world of solemn thought their monody compels !

## p. 10 (#26) ##############################################


 
 io ELOCUTION 
 
 In the silence of the night 
 How we shiver with affright 
 At the melancholy menace of their tone ! 
 For every sound that floats 
 From the rust within their throats 
 Is a groan. 
 
 Emphasis. Emphasis is a stress laid on a par- 
 ticular word or phrase in order to enforce a meaning. 
 It is required in the case of words which mark a 
 new idea, and words contrasted with one another. 
 
 Note. In order to acquire a habit of reading with 
 a just emphasis, it is necessary previously to study 
 the construction, meaning, and spirit of every 
 sentence, and to adhere, as nearly as possible, to the 
 manner in which we distinguish one word from 
 another in ordinary conversation. 
 
 EXERCISES ON EMPHASIS 
 
 26. You are not wood, you are not stones, but men. 
 
 27. When people are determined to quarrel, a straw will 
 
 furnish the occasion. 
 
 28. The wise and the foolish, the -virtuous and the evil, the 
 
 learned and the ignorant, the temperate and the 
 profligate must often be blended together. 
 
 The Pause. Pauses are of two kinds, grammatical 
 and rhetorical. 
 
 The grammatical pause is used mainly as a guide 
 to the author's meaning. 
 
 The rhetorical pause gives a peculiar force to the 
 words which precede or follow it, and is a most im- 
 portant element in good elocution. Rhetorical pauses

## p. 11 (#27) ##############################################


 
 ELOCUTION ii 
 
 are of various lengths and may be made either im- 
 mediately before or immediately after an emphatic 
 word, according to the taste and judgment of the 
 speaker. The student must, however, be very careful 
 in his employment of a rhetorical pause, as a wrong 
 use may entirely alter the meaning of a sentence. 
 
 EXAMPLES OF THE PAUSE 
 
 29. Oh ! pardon me ! thou bleeding piece of earth, 
 That I am meek and gentle with these butchers. 
 
 30. Woman, without her, man is a brute. 
 
 31. A sailor going to sea, his wife desires the prayers of 
 the congregation. 
 
 32. A thing of beauty is a joy for ever : 
 Its loveliness increases ; it will never 
 Pass into nothingness ; but still will keep 
 A bower quiet for us, and a sleep 
 Full of sweet dreams, and health, and quiet breathing. 
 
 Quotations and Parenthetical Clauses should be 
 spoken in a different tone of voice from the rest of 
 the sentence, and generally more quickly than the 
 main sentence. 
 
 33. If there is a power above us (and that there is all 
 nature cries aloud through all her works), He must delight 
 in virtue ; and that which He delights in must be happy. 
 
 34. Thou happy, happy elf ! (but stop first let me kiss 
 away that tear). Thou tiny image of myself! (my love, he's 
 poking peas into his ear). Thou merry laughing sprite with 
 spirits feather light, untouched by sorrow and unsoiled by 
 sin ! (Good heavens ! the child is swallowing a pin).

## p. 12 (#28) ##############################################


 
 12 ELOCUTION 
 
 Where dialogue and narrative occur in the same 
 piece, the narrative portion must be given in a 
 different tone from the dialogue ; the different char- 
 acters in the dialogue must be kept distinct from one 
 another ; and the tone of the voice as regards force, 
 pitch, and rate of utterance should be suited to the 
 nature and spirit of the passage. 
 
 EXAMPLES 
 
 35. Hark ! below the gates unbarring ! 
 
 Tramp of men and quick commands ! 
 " 'Tis my lord come back from hunting." 
 And the Duchess claps her hands. 
 
 Slow and tired came the hunters ; 
 
 Stopped in darkness in the court. 
 " Ho this way, ye laggard hunters ! 
 
 To the Hall ! What sport, what sport ? " 
 
 Slow they entered with their master ; 
 
 In the hall they laid him down 
 On his coat were leaves and blood stains, 
 
 On his brow an angry frown. 
 
 THE POWER OF HABIT 
 J. B. GOUGH 
 
 36. I remember once riding from Buffalo to the Niagara 
 Falls ; and I said to a gentleman, 
 
 " What river is that, sir ? " 
 
 "That is the Niagara River," he said. 
 
 "Well, it is a beautiful stream," said I, "bright, fair, 
 beautiful, and glassy. How far off are the rapids ? "

 " Only a mile or two." 
 
 " Is it possible that only a mile from us we shall find the

 "You will find it so, sir." 
 
 And so I found it ; and that first sight of the Niagara I 
 shall never forget. Now, young men, launch your bark on 
 that Niagara River; it is bright, smooth, beautiful, and 
 glassy. 
 
 Down the stream you glide, oars, sails, and helm in 
 proper trim, and you set out on your pleasure excursion. 
 Suddenly some one cries out from the bank, "Young men, 
 Ahoy ! " 
 
 "What is it?" 
 
 "The rapids are below you." 
 
 " Ha, ha ! we have heard of the rapids, but we are not 
 such fools as to get there. If we go too fast, then we shall 
 up with the helm and steer to the shore ; we will set the 
 mast in the socket, hoist the sail, and speed to the land. 
 Then on, boys ; don't be alarmed there is no danger." 
 
 " Young men, Ahoy ! " 
 
 "What is it?" 
 
 " The rapids are below you ! " 
 
 "Ha, ha, we will laugh and quaff; all things delight us. 
 What care we for the future? No man ever saw it. 
 Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. We will enjoy 
 life while we may ; we will catch pleasure as it flies. This 
 is enjoyment; time enough to steer out of danger when 
 we are sailing swiftly with the current." 
 
 " Young men, Ahoy ! " 
 
 "What is it?" 
 
 "Beware ! Beware ! The rapids are below you ! " 
 
 Now you see the water foaming all around. See how 
 fast you pass that point ! Up with the helm ! Now turn !

 whipcords upon your brow ! Set the mast in the socket ! 
 hoist the sail ! Ah ! it is too late ! Shrieking, cursing, 
 howling, blaspheming, over you go. Thousands go over 
 the rapids every year, through the power of habit, crying all

 Gesture. While speech is the verbal manifestation 
 of thought and feeling " Gesture is nature's language, 
 and makes its way to the heart without utterance of 
 sound." It supplements speech, and, by its added 
 grace, furnishes to the hearer a picture complete in all 
 its parts. Some gesture is absolutely necessary in 
 effective speaking, but it should be used as sparingly 
 as possible and never without a definite reason, which 
 could if required be stated in writing ; let the eye do 
 more than the hand. Stand before your audience 
 erect, with your shoulders well braced back and your 
 chest expanded. In conversational gesture, the face 
 should be open and cheerful ; in oratorical, confident 
 and animated ; while dramatic gesture requires great 
 intensity of feeling, movement, and facial ex- 
 pressions. 
 
 It is impossible to use correct and graceful gesture 
 if you have not thoroughly committed your piece to 
 memory. Remember, 
 
 True ease in action comes from art, not chance, 
 As those move easiest who have learned to dance.

 A PSALM OF LIFE 
 H. W. LONGFELLOW 
 
 TELL me not in mournful numbers, 
 
 Life is but an empty dream ! 
 For the soul is dead that slumbers, 
 
 And things are not what they seem. 
 
 Life is real ! Life is earnest ! 
 
 And the grave is not its goal ; 
 Dust thou art, to dust returnest, 
 
 Was not spoken of the soul. 
 
 Not enjoyment, and not sorrow, 
 
 Is our destined end or way ; 
 But to act, that each to-morrow, 
 
 Finds us farther than to-day. 
 
 Art is long, and Time is fleeting, 
 
 And our hearts though stout and brave, 
 
 Still like muffled drums are beating 
 Funeral marches to the grave. 
 
 In the world's broad field of battle, 
 
 In the bivouac of Life, 
 Be not like dumb, driven cattle ! 
 
 Be a hero in the strife !

 TRUE COURAGE 
 GEORGE E. HOWARD 
 
 I WAS strolling one day by the harbour that shelters 
 
 England's might, 
 Where gather the steel-clad warships made ready for deadly 
 
 fight; 
 
 And I spake to an ancient seaman, as I gazed across the bay 
 To where on the dim grey waters Lord Nelson's Victory lay ; 
 And we spoke of his fame and glory, and the courage of 
 
 Britain's sons, 
 And how they died for England, as they stood behind the 
 
 guns:

 But lie said, in the heat of battle 'twas easy enough to fight, 
 But the grandest kind of courage was to dare to do the right : 
 To stand for Truth and Duty thro' taunts from friends 
 
 grown cold, 
 Thro' threats and deadly danger, and this is the tale he told. 
 
 I'll spin you a true short yarn, sir, to show you what I mean, 
 Of a voyage I sailed long years ago on the clipper Ocean 
 
 Qu&en. 
 
 We were homeward bound from the East, sir, with a valu- 
 able cargo too, 
 We were thirty men on board, sir, captain and mates and 
 
 crew ; 
 And a fair rough lot were most, sir, who'd a hell of the 
 
 fo'c's'le make, 
 All save the 'prentice lad, sir, a bright young lad named 
 
 Blake; 
 And a smart true boy was he, sir, and well he did his 
 
 work : 
 But the men they all despised him, tho' never a job he'd 
 
 shirk, 
 For never an ugly word, sir, or an oath from his lips would 
 
 fall, 
 But he'd say his prayers and read his Book in the cuddy 
 
 afore them all. 
 
 Well, all went much as usual with cloud and breeze and 
 
 brine, 
 Till we lost the favouring Trade Winds when we'd nearly 
 
 crossed the line ; 
 When the wind dropped dead, the sails hung limp, and 
 
 never an inch moved we 
 As we lay like a log on the heaving breast of the glassy 
 
 Tropic sea. 
 
 For ten long days we waited, and never a breeze came nigh,

 Not a ripple on the burning sea, not a cloud in the blazing 
 
 sky; 
 
 It was dull and weary waiting, but none of us felt alarm 
 For we knew 'twas nothing more, sir, than a regular 
 
 Doldrum calm, 
 Till a man fell sick, then another, and the captain's brow 
 
 grew black 
 And a shiver of fear ran thro' the ship when 'twas 
 
 whispered, "Yellow Jack." 
 
 We all of us knew what that meant ; all who had sailed 
 
 East before, 
 And those who hadn't had heard enough of the scourge of 
 
 the Eastern shore ; 
 How worse than a storm of shrapnel the fever attacks a 
 
 town; 
 For the stricken must die alone, sir, when the helpers 
 
 themselves are down. 
 
 We weren't no extra cowards in the Ocean Queen that trip ; 
 And thro' many a storm and hurricane we'd weathered the 
 
 staunch old ship ; 
 But there wasn't a man on board, sir, who didn't fear it 
 
 more 
 Than the wildest blasts of the cyclone storm or the breakers' 
 
 angry roar ; 
 And the captain swore he'd rather face the worst that ever 
 
 blew, 
 Than be becalmed and helpless, with fever among the crew. 
 
 'Twas then that we lost heart, sir, as we marked each droop- 
 ing sail ; 
 
 'Twas then we longed for a wind, sir, for a breeze or a 
 tearing gale ; 
 
 For next day three more were taken, and both the mates 
 had died,

 And in two days there were fourteen down and three'd 
 
 gone over the side : 
 And I for one despaired, sir, for that night when the sun 
 
 sank red 
 The Ocean Queen was captainless, for the captain he was 
 
 dead. 
 Then we thought that all was over, with none but a 
 
 'prentice hand 
 To lay our course o'er the trackless deep and guide us to 
 
 the land ; 
 And we tried to drown in drink, sir, that fear we dared to 
 
 know, 
 While the rest were dying an awful death in the stifling 
 
 bunks below. 
 
 For we all of us held aloof, sir, and none of us ventured 
 
 nigh, 
 For we feared the dread infection, and we left them there 
 
 to die. 
 And 'twas only the 'prentice lad, sir, who dared the danger 
 
 brave, 
 And did his best to ease their pain, and what he could to 
 
 save; 
 And when we tried to stop him, and spoke of the risk he 
 
 ran, 
 " It's only my duty I do," he said, " my duty to God and 
 
 man ! " 
 Still one by one we sickened in the deadly fever's 
 
 Till Blake and I alone were left becalmed on the plague- 
 
 struck ship : 
 And when one day a grey cloud rose above a line of 
 
 foam 
 We'd hardly the heart to raise a cheer, and set her head for 
 
 home.

 As he'd borne his shipmates' taunts, sir, in the cause of 
 
 Truth and Right ; 
 As he'd braved the deadly sickness, so he bore himself that 
 
 night : 
 
 And the last I remember was the sight of his steadfast form 
 As he stood at the wheel 'mid the lightning's glare and the 
 
 thunder of the storm. 
 I was struck by a falling spar, sir, and the very next thing I 
 
 knew 
 Was a hospital ward ashore, sir, where they'd carried our 
 
 helpless crew. 
 But 'twas Blake who steered us to port, sir, and this I say 
 
 and hold, 
 
 That never a truer hero e'er sailed the seas of old. 
 That's my idea of courage, sir; do right for the right's 
 
 own sake. 
 Last time I sailed in the Ocean Queen the captain's name 
 
 was Blake.

 Sitting throned above the waters, dreaming sadly, hand in

 And the sad sea, sighing, sobbing, throbbing, wailing o'er

 And the faces that I long for evermore. 
 
 Still the cottage walls are standing in the Glen of Dreams

 But the light is gone for ever that to me was guiding star,

 "OLD LETTERS" 27 
 
 How faint and how faded the writing appears, 
 
 As I gaze through the mist of some twoscore years ; 
 
 There's Ella, my darling, how sweetly she wrote, 
 
 I remember so well, 'twas a little pink note. 
 
 No trace of the pure tint remains on its hue, 
 
 'Tis soiled and discoloured, and brown stained all through, 
 
 There's a mist on my glasses, I cannot see well, 
 
 And the line, too, is blurred where she wrote her farewell. 
 
 I have married and twice since that little pink note, 
 
 In her innocent girlhood, sweet Ella wrote ; 
 
 She faded away in the fragrant spring time, 
 
 And the bells had to toll, when I thought they would 
 
 chime. 
 
 I've almost forgotten how Ella looked now, 
 With the smile on her lip, and the thought on her 
 
 brow; 
 
 For memory grows, oh, so weary and weak ! 
 But still I remember her soft dimpled cheek ; 
 And I seem to stand in my youth's bright morn, 
 As I read the wee note so soiled and torn. 
 
 Lying just near it, I next see the end 
 Of a letter, 'twas written by Tom, my friend ; 
 And bold and broad are the strong dark lines, 
 He writes from his home in the land of vines ; 
 There are health and strength in each daring thought, 
 And laughter and fun with each word enwrought ; 
 And speech seems there on the time-worn page, 
 All shrivelled and stained by the touch of age. 
 
 Then the letters grew few and far between, 
 He had dearer friends on his way I ween ; 
 And I have loved others, perchance, as well, 
 Yet round the torn paper there hangs a spell.

 Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse ; 
 
 The stockings were hung by the chimney with care 
 
 In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there ; 
 
 The children were nestled all snug in their beds, 
 
 While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads ; 
 
 And Mamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap, 
 
 Had just settled our brains for a long winter nap, 
 
 When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter, 
 
 I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter. 
 
 Away to the window I flew like a flash, 
 
 Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash. 
 
 The moon, on the breast of the new-fallen snow, 
 
 Gave a lustre of midday to objects below ; 
 
 When, what to my wandering eyes should appear, 
 
 But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny reindeer, 
 
 With a little old driver, ^lively and quick, 
 
 I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick. -*>* ** 
 
 More rapid than eagles his coursers they came, 
 
 And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name :

 As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, 
 When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky, 
 So, up to the house-top the coursers they flew, 
 With the sleigh full of toys and St. Nicholas too. 
 And then in a twinkling I heard on the roof 
 The prancing and pawing of each little hoof. 
 As I drew in my head, and was turning around, 
 Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound. 
 He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot, 
 And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot 
 A bundle of toys he had flung on his back, 
 And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack. 
 His eyes how they twinkle ! his dimples how merry ! 
 His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry ; 
 His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow, 
 And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow. 
 The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth, 
 And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath. 
 He had a broad face and a little round belly 
 That shook, when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly. 
 He was chubby and plump a right jolly old elf; 
 And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself. 
 A wink of his eye, and a twist of his head, 
 Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread. 
 He spoke not a word, but bent straight to his work, 
 And filled all the stockings ; then turned with a jerk, 
 And laying his finger aside of his nose, 
 And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose. 
 He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle, 
 And away they all flew like the down ofr'a thistle ; 
 But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight, 
 " Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night ! "

 AT THE OPERA 
 
 (ADAPTED) 
 LORD LYTTON 
 
 IN Paris it was, at the Opera there ; and she looked like a 
 queen of old time that night ; with the wreath of pearls in 
 her raven hair, and the brooch on her breast, so bright. 
 The moon on the tower slept soft as snow ; and who was 
 not thrilled in the strangest way as we heard him sing, 
 while the gas burned low, " Non ti scordar di me " ? Side by 
 side in our box we sat together, my bride betrothed and I ; 
 my gaze was fixed on my opera-hat and hers on the stage 
 hard by ; and both were silent, and both were sad : like a 
 queen, she leaned on her full white arm, with that regal, 
 indolent air she had ; so confident of her charm ! I have 
 no doubt she was thinking then of her former lord good 
 soul that he was ! who died the richest and roundest of 
 men, the Marquis of Carabas. I hope that, to get to the 
 kingdom of heaven, through a needle's eye he had not to 
 pass ; I wish him well for the jointure given to my lady of 
 Carabas. 
 
 Meanwhile, I was thinking of my " first " love, as I had 
 not been thinking of aught for years ; till, over my eyes, 
 there began to move something that felt like tears. I 
 thought of the dress that she wore last time, when we stood 
 'neath the cypress-trees together, in that lost land, in her 
 own soft clime, in the crimson evening weather; and the 
 jasmine-flower in her fair young breast ; (O, the faint sweet 
 smell of that jasmine-flower !) and the last bird singing 
 alone in his nest; and the one star over the tower. I 
 thought of our little quarrels and strife, and her letter that 
 brought me back my ring ; and it all seemed then, in the 
 waste of life, such a very little thing ! For I thought of her

 grave below the hill, which the sentinel cypress-tree stands 
 over; and I thought, "Were she only living still, how I 
 could forgive her, and love her ! " And I swear, as I 
 thought of her thus, in that hour, and of how, after [all, 
 old things are best, that I felt the scent of that jasmine- 
 flower which she used to wear in her breast ! It smelt so 
 faint, and it smelt so sweet, it made me creep, and it made 
 me cold ! like the scent that steals from the crumbling 
 sheet where a mummy is half unrolled. 
 
 And I turned and looked ! . . . She was sitting there, 
 in a dim box over the stage ! and drest in that muslin 
 dress, with that full soft hair, and that jasmine in her 
 breast ! I was here, and she was there ! and the glittering 
 horse-shoe curved between ; from my bride betrothed, with 
 her raven hair, I turned to my bride that was to have been 
 to my early love, with her eyes downcast, and over her 
 primrose-face the shade : in short, from the future back to 
 the past, there was but a step to be made ! To my early 
 love, from my future bride, one moment I looked. Then 
 ... I stole to the door I traversed the passage and 
 down at her side I was sitting a moment more ! My think- 
 ing of her, or the music's strain, or something which never 
 will be exprest, had brought her back from the grave again, 
 with the jasmine on her breast ! She is not dead ! and she 
 is not wed ! but she loves me now, and she loved me then ; 
 at the very first words that her sweet lips said 5 my heart 
 grew youthful again ! The Marchioness there, of Carabas, 
 she is wealthy and young and handsome still ; and but for 
 her . . . Well, we'll let that pass ; she may marry whomso- 
 ever she will : but I will marry my own " first " love, with 
 her primrose-face, for old things are best ! and the flower 
 in her bosom, I prize it above the brooch in my lady's 
 breast ! 
 
 The world is filled with folly and sin, and love must cling 
 where it can, I say : for beauty is easy enough to win ; but

 most women and men, there's a moment when all would go 
 smooth and even, if only the dead could find out when to

 (By special permission of the Author) 
 
 [In the hurricane which struck the squadron of warships (British, 
 American, and German) stationed at watch in Apia Harbour, Samoa, 
 those of the vessels which survived the night held to their moorings, 
 fearing to run for the open water on account of the long and perilous 
 line of reef. At last H.M.S. Calliope (pronounce Cal-li-o-pe), under 
 Captain Kane, made the attempt. And as, in the teeth of the gale, 
 with straining engines, the English cruiser made her way out, the crew 
 of the American Trenton, in admiration, forgetting their own apparently 
 imminent fate, raised a ringing cheer, which was answered back from 
 the deck of the Calliope.'} 
 
 OUT of the midnight creeping came 
 
 That wind of death ; 
 
 The foam upcurled on the waves like flame, 
 Beneath its breath, 
 
 One moment, peace and calm ; 
 
 Through fringe of reed and palm 
 The twinkling shore-lights danced in view ; 
 
 The next, our spars were bending, 
 
 And cord and canvas rending, 
 
 And clouds and ocean blending 
 Swept on us ere we knew !

 Caught in its giant grip 
 Was every gallant ship ; 
 Such wrestling none had known before ; 
 
 No strain like this the groaning cables knew, 
 
 With blast so fierce the sudden tempest blew 
 From off that island shore. 
 
 At sunset there were seven afloat, 
 At midnight all the wild wind smote, 
 
 At dawn the yeasty waves were over three. 
 Then who might dare to seek relief, 
 To run betwixt the outer reef, 
 
 The shore and reef, and reach the open sea ? 
 
 She dared, the English ship ! 
 Her cables she would slip 
 In all that war of wind and wave, 
 
 Knowing that there was safety out beyond 
 
 For those who dared to quit the straining bond 
 That yet might snap or save. 
 
 And as with slow and labouring stroke 
 From out that perilous strait she broke, 
 
 Forth from the Trenton's deck there rose a cry ! 
 A generous shout of glad acclaim, 
 Of joy no selfish fear could tame, 
 
 Stronger than death, to see our ship go by. 
 
 That cheer, in their distress, 
 Our hardihood to bless, 
 Not unto us alone shall ring : 
 Louder than the loud cry we gave them back, 
 The voice of England, following in its track 
 Their praise well-pleased shall sing ;

 We fight the battles of the Lord, 
 
 And never may we yield 
 A foot we measure with the sword 
 
 On the red harvest-field ; 
 And we will not retreat, while one 
 
 Stout heart remains to fight ; 
 Let England hold what England won,

 THERE was once a man, and his rod and line he took, 
 For he said, " I'll go a-fishing in the neighbouring brook ; " 
 And it chanced a little maiden was walking out that day, 
 And they met in the usual way. 
 
 Then he sat him down beside her, and an hour or two 
 
 went by, 
 
 But still upon the grassy brink his rod and line did lie ; 
 " I thought," she shyly whispered, " you'd be fishing all the 
 
 day ! " 
 
 And he was in the usual way. 
 
 So he gravely took his rod in hand, and threw the line 
 
 about, 
 
 But the fish perceived distinctly he was not looking out ; 
 And he said, " Sweetheart, I love you," but she said she 
 
 could not stay, 
 
 But she did in the usual way. 
 
 Then the stars came out above them, and she gave a little 
 
 sigh, 
 As they watched the silver ripples like the moments 
 
 running by ; 
 " We must say good-bye," she whispered, by the alders old 
 
 and gray. 
 
 And they did in the usual way. 
 
 And day by day beside the stream, they wandered to and 
 
 fro, 
 
 And day by day the fishes swam securely down below,

 WE are the Choice of the Will : God, when He gave the 
 
 word 
 
 That called us into line, set in our hand a sword ; 
 Set us a sword to wield none else could lift and draw, 
 And bade us forth to the sound of the trumpet of the Law. 
 East and West and North, wherever the battle grew, 
 As men to a feast we fared, the work of the Will to do. 
 But upon vast beginnings, bidding Anarchy cease 
 (Had he hacked it to the Pit, we had left it a place of 
 
 peace !) 
 
 Marching, building, sailing, pillar of cloud or fire, 
 Sons of the Will, we fought the fight of the Will, our sire. 
 Road was never so rough that we left its purpose dark ; 
 Stark was ever the sea, but our ships were yet more stark ; 
 We tracked the winds of the world to the steps of their 
 
 very thrones ; 
 The secret parts of the world were salted with our bones

 Till now the name of names, England, the name of might, 
 Flames from the austral bounds to the ends of the boreal 
 
 night ; 
 And the call of her morning dream goes in a girdle of 
 
 sound, 
 Like the voice of the sun in song, the great globe round 
 
 and round ; 
 
 And the shadow of her flag, when it shouts to the mother- 
 breeze, 
 
 Floats from shore to shore, of the universal seas ; 
 And the loneliest death is fair with a memory of her 
 
 flowers, 
 And the end of the road to Hell with the sense of her dews 
 
 and showers ! 
 
 Who says that we shall pass, or the fame of us fade and die, 
 While the living stars fulfil their round in the living sky ? 
 For the sire lives in his sons, and they pay their father's debt, 
 And the lion has left a whelp wherever his claw was set ; 
 And the lion in his whelps, his whelps that none shall brave, 
 Is but less strong than Time and the great all-whelming 
 
 Grave.

 Now in that tomb and I shall feel thee guarding 
 
 Me, out of all the world ; for me discarding 
 
 Yon heaven, thy home, that waits and opes its door ! 
 
 I would not look up thither past thy head 
 Because the door opes, like that child I know, 
 
 For I should have thy gracious face instead, 
 
 Thou bird of God ! And wilt thou bend me low 
 
 Like him, and lay, like his, my hands together 
 
 And lift them up to pray, and gently tether 
 
 Me as thy lamb there, with thy garments spread ? 
 
 If this was ever granted, I would rest 
 
 My head beneath thine, while thy healing hands 
 
 Close covered both my eyes beside thy breast, 
 
 Pressing the brain, which too much thought expands, 
 
 Back to its proper size again, and smoothing 
 
 Distortion down till every nerve had soothing, 
 And all lay quiet, happy, and suppressed.

 What was it underneath his plaid his little hands clasped

 Twas the bannocks which that morning his mother had

 From out her scanty store of meal, and now, with many a

 Had sent by Jamie, her ain boy, a trusty lad and brave,

 And held him o'er a clefted rock, a chasm deep and wild. 
 So deep it was the trees below like willow wands did seem,

 horrid dream. 
 He looked up to the sky above, and then at the men 
 
 close by, 
 Had they no little ones at home, and could they let him 
 
 die? 
 
 But no one spoke, or no one moved, or lifted hand to save 
 From such a fearful awful death the little lad so brave, 
 "It's waefu' deep," he shuddering cried, "but, oh! I canna

 Long, long within that lonely cave shall Tarn Roy wait 
 
 for you, 
 And long for thy welcome coming waits the mother on

 And watches and cries, " Come, Jamie, lad," through the

 No more adown the rocky path you come with fearless

 Or on the moor and mountains take the good man's daily

 But up in heaven tbe shining ones, a wondrous story tell, 
 Of a child snatched up from a rocky gulf that's nae sae

 And there before the great white throne, forever blessed

 I DREAMED I saw two souls set forth 
 Through life, and bearing loads ; 
 
 They both were bent on Heaven's ascent, 
 But followed different roads. 
 
 The one chanced on a well-worn track, 
 
 Where saints had trod before ; 
 And running straight soon reached the gate 
 
 Of Rest for Evermore. 
 
 The other God knows why he found 
 
 No path so sanctified 
 Went blundering on from dawn till dawn, 
 
 Till all the world had died. 
 
 For many a tempting turn he took, 
 
 To be betrayed by Sin. 
 How oft he fell he wept to tell, 
 
 Yet dared to hope to win. 
 
 So when the tired world's toils were o'er, 
 
 And all the seasons past, 
 Sad, sick, and sore, he reached God's door, 
 
 And crept in least and last. 
 
 And some stood by who wondered why 
 
 The Master spake no blame ; 
 They had not heard His tender word : 
 
 "/know the way you came."

 How fareth the Fraulein, your daughter dear ? " 
 
 " My beer is fresh, and my wine is bright ; 
 
 My child will be shrouded and buried to-night." 
 
 They drew the door of her death-room back, 
 There she slept in her coffin black : 
 
 The first he lifted the veil from the dead, 
 And bared his curls, and bended, and said, 
 
 " Ah ! could'st thou but live again, maiden, here 
 From this day forth I would love thee dear ! " 
 
 The second spread softly the face-cloth again, 
 And his tears fell fast as the midsummer rain. 
 
 "Dead! art thou, Lisbeth? cold, lip and brow. 
 Ah, God ! I learn how I loved thee now ! " 
 
 But the third in his hand did the little hand take, 
 And kissed the white forehead, and smiled and spake, 
 
 " I love thee to-day as I loved thee before, 
 I shall love thee as truly for evermore."

 And her boats were manned in silence, and in silence 
 
 pulled away, 
 
 And in silence every gunner took his post. 
 With a volley from her broadside the citadel she woke, 
 And they hammered back like heroes all the night ; 
 But before the morning broke she had vanished through 
 
 the smoke, 
 With her prize upon her quarter grappled tight. 
 
 It was evening at St Helen's in the great and gallant 
 
 time, 
 
 And the sky behind the down was flushing far ; 
 And the flags were all a-flutter and the bells were all 
 
 a-chime 
 
 When the frigate cast her anchor off the bar. 
 She'd a right fighting company, three hundred men and 
 
 more, 
 
 Nine-and-forty guns in tackle running free ; 
 And they cheered her from the shore for her colours at 
 
 the fore 
 When the bold Menelaus came from sea.

 THE LAST OF THE EURYDICE 
 
 SIR NOEL PATON

 THE training ship Eurydice, 
 
 As brave a craft, I ween, 
 
 As ever bore brave men who loved 
 
 Their country and their queen. 
 
 Built when a ship, sir, was a ship, 
 
 And not a steam-machine. 
 
 A year or more, she had been out 
 
 Cruising the Indian Seas, 
 
 And now with all her canvas bent 
 
 Before a homeward breeze, 
 
 Up Channel in her pride she came 
 
 The saucy Eurydice. 
 
 " Only an hour from Spithead, lads ; 
 
 Only an hour from home." 
 
 So sang the captain's cheery voice, 
 
 As she clove the sunlit foam ; 
 
 And each young sea-dog's heart sang back 
 
 " Only an hour from home." 
 
 We saw the hills of Devon rise 
 
 Far in the Sabbath sun ; 
 
 We marked each hamlet gleaming white ; 
 
 The church spires one by one ;

 OUR FOLKS 53 
 
 We thought we heard the church bells ring 
 To hail our voyage done. 
 
 No warning ripple crisped the wave, 
 
 To tell of danger nigh ; 
 
 Nor looming rack, nor driving scud 
 
 From out a smiling sky ; 
 
 With noise as of the trump of doom, 
 
 The squall broke suddenly. 
 
 A giant squall of wind and snow 
 
 From off the Devon shore, 
 
 It caught us in its blinding whirl 
 
 One instant, and no more ; 
 
 For ere we dreamt of trouble near, 
 
 All earthly hope was o'er. 
 
 No time to shorten sail no time 
 
 To change the vessel's course ; 
 
 The squall had caught her crowded masts 
 
 With swift resistless force ; 
 
 Only one shrill despairing cry, 
 
 Rose o'er the tumult hoarse. 
 
 And broadside the great ship went down, 
 Amid the whirling foam, 
 And with her our four hundred men 
 Went down in sight of home. 
 (Fletcher and I alone were saved) 
 Only an hour from home.

 And so fair Annie blooms no more ! . . . and that's the

 And soldiers whisper : " Boys, be still ; there's some bad 
 
 news from Granger's c folks.' " 
 
 He turned his back the only foe that ever saw it on this 
 
 grief, 
 And, as men will, keeps down the tears kind Nature sends 
 
 to Woe's relief, 
 Then answers " Thank you, Hal, I'll try ; but in my throat 
 
 there's something chokes, 
 Because, you see, I've thought so long to count her in among 
 
 ' our folks.' 
 
 " I daresay she is happier now ; but still I can't help think- 
 ing too, 
 
 I might have kept all trouble off, by being tender, kind, and 
 true 
 
 But maybe not . . . She's safe up there ! and, when God's

 She'll stand by Heaven's gate, I know, and wait to welcome

 ANON. 
 
 A PARSON, who a missionary had been, 
 And hardships and privations oft had seen, 
 While wandering far on lone and desert strands, 
 A weary traveller in benighted lands, 
 Would often picture to his little flock 
 The terrors of the gibbet and the block ; 
 How martyrs suffer'd in the ancient times, 
 And what men suffer now in other climes ; 
 And though his were eloquent words and deep, 
 His hearers oft indulged themselves in sleep. 
 He marked with sorrow each unconscious nod, 
 Within the portals of the house of God. 
 And once this new expedient thought he'd take 
 In his discourse, to keep the rogues awake. 
 Said he, " While travelling in a distant state, 
 I witness'd scenes which I will here relate. 
 'Twas in a deep uncultivated wild, 
 Where noontide glory scarcely ever smiled j 
 Where wolves in hours of midnight darkness howl'd, 
 Where bears frequented, and where panthers prowl'd,

 And on my word, mosquitoes there were found ; 
 
 Many of which, I think, would weigh a pound ! 
 
 More fierce and ravenous than the hungry shark 
 
 They oft were known to climb the trees and bark ! " 
 
 The audience seem'd taken by surprise, 
 
 All started up and rubb'd their wondering eyes. 
 
 At such a tale they were all much amazed, 
 
 Each drooping lid was in an instant raised, 
 
 And we must say in keeping heads erect, 
 
 It had its destined and desired effect. 
 
 But tales like this credulity appall'd ; 
 
 Next day the deacons on the pastor call'd, 
 
 And begged to know how he could ever tell 
 
 The foolish falsehoods from his lips that fell. 
 
 " Why, sir," said one, " think what a monstrous weight ! 
 
 Were they as large as you were pleased to state ? 
 
 You said they'd weigh a pound ! It can't be true. 
 
 We'll not believe it, though 'tis told by you ! " 
 
 " Ah, but it is ! " the parson quick replied ; 
 
 " In what I stated you may well confide ; 
 
 Many, I said, sir, and the story's good 
 
 Indeed I think that many of them would ! " 
 
 The deacon saw at once that he was caught 
 
 Yet deemed himself relieved, on second thought. 
 
 " But then the barking think of that, good man ! 
 
 Such monstrous lies ! Explain it, if you can ! " 
 
 "Why, that, my friend, I can explain with ease

 HOW JIMMY TENDED THE BABY

 I NEVER could see the use of babies. We have one at our 
 house that belongs to mother, and she thinks everything of

 it. I can't see anything wonderful about it. All it can do 
 is to cry, and pull hair, and kick. It hasn't half the sense 
 of my dog, and can't even chase a cat. Mother and Sue 
 wouldn't have a dog in the house, but they are always 
 going on about the baby, and saying, "Ain't it perfectly 
 sweet ? " 
 
 The worst thing about a baby is that you're expected to 
 take care of him, and then you get scolded afterwards. 
 Folks say, " Here, Jimmy, just hold the baby a minute, 
 there's a good boy ; " and then as soon as you have it, they 
 say, " Don't do that ! Just look at him ! That boy will 
 kill the child ! Hold it up straight, you good-for-nothing 
 little wretch ! " 
 
 It's pretty hard to do your best and then be scolded for 
 it; but that's the way boys are treated. Last Saturday, 
 mother and Sue went out to make calls, and told me to 
 stay at home and take care of the baby. There was a 
 cricket match, but what did they care for that ? They 
 didn't want to go to it, and so it made no difference 
 whether I went to it or not. They said they would be 
 gone only a little while, and if the baby waked up, I was 
 to play with it, and keep it from crying, and " Be sure not 
 to let it swallow any pins." Of course, I had to do it. 
 The baby was sound asleep when they went out ; so I left 
 it just a few minutes, while I went to see if there was any 
 pie in the pantry. If I was a woman, I wouldn't be so 
 dreadfully suspicious as to keep everything locked up. 
 When I got back upstairs again, the baby was awake, and 
 was howling like he was full of pins. So I gave him the 
 first thing that came handy to keep him quiet. It 
 happened to be a bottle of French polish, with a sponge 
 on the end of a wire, that Sue uses to black her boots, 
 because girls are too lazy to use the regular brush. The 
 baby stopped crying as soon as I gave him the bottle, and 
 I sat down to read a paper. The next time I looked a

 him, he'd got out the sponge and about half of his face was 
 jet black. This was a nice fix, for I knew nothing could 
 get the black off his face, and when mother came she 
 would say the baby was spoiled, and I had done it. Now, 
 I think an all black baby is ever so much more stylish than 
 an all white baby, and when I saw that the baby was part 
 black, I made up my mind that if I blacked it all over it 
 would be worth more than it ever had been, and perhaps 
 mother would be ever so much pleased. 
 
 So I hurried up, and gave it a good coat of black. You 
 should have seen how that baby shined. The polish dried 
 as soon as it was put on, and I had just time to get baby 
 dressed again, when mother and Sue came in. I wouldn't 
 lower myself to repeat their unkind language. 
 
 When you've been called a murdering little villain, and 
 an unnatural son, it will rankle in your heart for ages. 
 After what they said to me, I didn't even seem to mind 
 father, but went upstairs with him almost as if I was going 
 to church, or something that didn't hurt much. 
 
 The baby is beautiful and shiny, though the doctors say 
 it will wear off in a few years. Nobody shows any 
 gratitude for all the trouble I took, and I can tell you, it 
 isn't easy to black a baby without getting it into his eyes 
 and hair. I sometimes think it is hardly worth to live in 
 this cold and unfeeling world.

 Among the buried ages, and did lay 
 The pulses of my heart beneath the touch 
 Of the rude minstrel Time, that he should play 
 Thereon, a melody which might seem such 
 As musing spirits love, mournful, but not too much ! 
 
 I had a dream and there mine eyes did see 
 The shadows of past deeds like present things 
 The sepulchres of Greece and Hespery, 
 ^Egyptus, and old lands, gave up their kings, 
 Their prophets, saints, and minstrels, whose lute-strings 
 Keep a long echo yea, the dead, white bones 
 Did stand up by the house whereto Death clings, 
 And dressed themselves in life, speaking of thrones, 
 And fame, and power, and beauty, in familiar tones ! 
 
 I went back further still, for I beheld 
 What time the earth was one fair Paradise 
 And over such bright meads the waters welled, 
 I wot the rainbow was content to rise 
 Upon the earth, when absent from the skies ! 
 And there were tall trees that I never knew, 
 Whereon sate nameless birds in merry guise, 
 Folding their radiant wings, as the flowers do, 
 When summer nights send sleep down with the dew. 
 
 Anon there came a change a terrible motion, 
 That made all living things grow pale and shake ! 
 The dark Heavens bowed themselves unto the ocean, 
 Like a strong man in strife Ocean did take 
 His flight across the mountains ; and the lake 
 Was lashed into a sea where the winds ride : 
 Earth was no more, for in her merrymake 
 She had forgot her God Sin claimed his bride, 
 And with his vampire breath sucked out her life's fair tide !

 Life went back to her nostrils, and she raised 
 Her spirit from the waters once again 
 The lovely sights, on which I erst had gazed, 
 Were not though she was beautiful as when 
 The Grecian called her " Beauty " sinful men 
 Walked i' the track of the waters, and felt bold 
 Yea, they looked up to Heaven in calm disdain, 
 As if no eyes had seen its vault unfold 
 Darkness and fear and death ! as if a tale were told ! 
 
 And ages fled away within my dream ; 
 And still Sin made the heart his dwelling-place, 
 Eclipsing Heaven from men ; but it would seem 
 That two or three dared commune face to face, 
 And speak of the soul's life, of hope, and grace 
 Anon there rose such sounds as angels breathe 
 For a God came to die, bringing down peace 
 "Pan was not;" and the darkness that did wreathe 
 The earth, passed from the soul Life came by death !

 As this storm-coquette with her lightsome skip. 
 
 Hark ! from aloft, a skyward hail, 
 
 Sings down for sailor-tools below ; 
 A boy springs lightly to the rail, 
 
 A blue-ey'd boy, aloft to go. 
 No fear has he, this sailor child, 
 His flaxen curls the winds blow wild : 
 His feet are bare, his heart beats free, 
 His face but new brown burnt at sea, 
 And he sings as he clambers with height'ning glee, 
 Now clinging by cords that mere threads seem to be. 
 From the round-top he climbs to the cross-trees above 
 Oh ! fond, doting mother, could'st but see thy love 
 Higher and higher, his curls dazzling bright, 
 His heart leaps with pride, he reaches the height, 
 Where a sailor's at work on the uppermost spar, 
 Singing songs of the home that he's leaving afar. 
 There's a crack and a scream and the man hugs the mast, 
 As he views, in cold horror, the boy falling fast, 
 With vainly-spread arms, to the ocean's blue breast, 
 To the high-leaping wave and its hungering crest, 
 And the ship's flitting shadow fall low like a pall, 
 As the sea-birds scream by with a requiem call !

 And now he lay with a deadly wound ; 
 
 Shot down by a coward's hand. 
 While Jack, with the whistling balls around, 
 
 In the light of the dying day, 
 Stood over the crowd in the court beneath, 
 
 And kept them awhile at bay. 
 There was just one pathway up to the house, 
 
 And the rebels held back a space, 
 For they saw the mouth of the great black gun 
 
 That pointed down in their face ; 
 And they knew that the boy by the cannon's side 
 
 Was the son of the man they'd shot ; 
 Knew that the lad had his father's grit, 
 
 And would die ere he'd leave the spot. 
 He stood in the shade of the loaded gun, 
 
 Unharmed by the shots of the foe ; 
 One touch with the ready match in his hand 
 
 Meant death in that crowd below. 
 " Stand back ! " they shouted. " Back from the gun 
 
 You'll die, if you dare refuse ; 
 But show us the place where your father hides, 
 
 And your life shall be spared ! Now choose ! " 
 Clear came the boyish voice from above,

 Than live to think of my father's fate, 
 
 And I like a coward stood by.

 He thought you were good and true, 
 And why should you seek his life to-night,

 He stopped, and a howl of heedless rage 
 
 Came up from the men below, 
 But still they paused, for up to that gun 
 
 They knew it meant death to go. 
 Once more they cried " Will you stand from the gun, 
 
 And show us the tyrant's den ? " 
 " No ! never a step," was the firm reply, 
 
 As their rifles rang out again. 
 And there in the cannon's shade he stood, 
 
 With both hands armed for the fight, 
 His father's pistol clasped in his left, 
 
 The ready match in his right. 
 He looked away o'er the plain beyond, 
 
 Whence the help of his friends might come, 
 And he prayed for the tramp of the Highlanders, 
 
 And the sound of their pipe and drum. 
 But he saw not that creeping, snake-like form 
 
 Up in the shadow glide, 
 Till crack ! went a rifle, and Jack's left arm 
 
 Dropped helplessly by his side. 
 He reeled and fell, and a savage yell 
 
 Came up through the narrow pass, 
 As the Sepoys broke from the court below 
 
 And charged in a solid mass. 
 Up ! and up ! with a maddened rush, 
 
 Howling like beasts of prey,

 Leaving the trace of its awful flight

 Dying and dead in a mingled mass 
 
 Lying like leaves around. 
 And the living paused to look on the dead, 
 
 O'erawed by that ghastly sight, 
 But only a moment, then sprang on the boy 
 
 With cries that rang through the night. 
 They struck at his face with their cruel fists, 
 
 They threw him down on the ground, 
 They searched the house, but their search was vain 
 
 Then back they came with a bound. 
 They jerked him up by his wounded arm, 
 
 And madly hissed in his ear,

 A flush spread over the boy's pale face, 
 
 But he lifted a fearless eye, 
 " Sell you my father's life ? " he said, 
 
 " Never ! I'd sooner die." 
 They tied him there to the cannon's mouth, 
 
 They loaded it swift again ; 
 " Five minutes to choose, for we'll fire that gun, 
 
 When the clock on yon tower strikes ten." 
 All alone in the face of death, 
 
 None that could save him nigh ; 
 Just five minutes of youth's sweet life 
 
 How hard did it seem to die ! 
 One I Away o'er the darkened plain 
 
 He looked with a longing gaze, 
 On and up where the silent stars 
 
 Watched with their kindly rays.

 FOR FATHER'S SAKE 69 
 
 " Father in Heaven," he softly prayed, 
 
 " Help me to feel Thou'rt nigh ; 
 Save me : or grant that for father's sake 
 
 I won't be afraid to die." 
 Two ! He looked at the great dark tower ; 
 
 Soon would its deep-tone bell 
 Boom aloud through the silent night, 
 
 Ringing his own death knell. 
 Three ! Is it fancy ? Down there below, 
 
 Right by the myrtle grove, 
 Strange shadows mingle with bush and tree 
 
 Shadows that seem to move 
 Nearer and near ; gliding swift 
 
 Under the trees they go, 
 Forms of men on a secret march, 
 
 Can it be friend or foe ? 
 Four ! Behind him a sepoy stands 
 
 Waiting the fatal chime ; 
 Only a minute ! if these be friends, 
 
 God grant they may be in time ! 
 See ! they pause in the palm trees shade, 
 
 They form into line again ; 
 Hark ! 'tis the rattle of bayonets ! 
 
 At last ! 'tis his father's men ; 
 Men who have fought by the Major's side 
 
 In many a hard-won strife, 
 Bringing back at the bayonet's point 
 
 A message of death and life. 
 The sepoy hears ! he has seized a match 
 
 Too late ! From the wall's deep shade 
 A form has sprung, and the sepoy falls 
 
 'Neath the swing of a British blade. 
 Charge ! Was ever a wilder cheer ?

 'Mid the rattle of drum, and the bagpipes shriek, 
 
 Came on with a swinging stride. 
 Up in a glittering wall of steel 
 
 That the rebels resist in vain, 
 Cutting them down as the reaper's scythe 
 
 Cuts through the autumn grain ; 
 Bearing them back till the last that lives 
 
 Has fled, and the fight is won ; 
 And a shout goes up from the men once more, 
 
 A cheer for their Major's son. 
 They carry him safe to his father's side, 
 
 They watch, as with tears of joy 
 The father raises a feeble arm, 
 
 And clasps it round his boy. 
 Did they live ? Ay, both ! and for many a day 
 
 The men by their camp fires spake 
 Of the boy that stood by the gun that night, 
 
 And fought for his father's sake.

 A YARN I've got to spin as how I've heard my old dad tell, 
 
 Of a gallant little hero who a-board the Vicfry fell ; 
 
 He was brimmin' full o' courage, and was just the sort o' 
 
 lad 
 
 To make the sort o' sailor that our Navy's always had 
 As powder-monkey, little Jim was pet o' all the crew, 
 With his flaxen hair so curly, an' his pretty eyes o' blue ; 
 An' the bo's'un always said as how that what got over him, 
 Was the chorus of a sailor's song, as sung by Little Jim.

 " Soon we'll be in London town, sing, my lads, ye ho ! 
 An' see the king in a golden crown : sing, my lads, ye ho ! 
 Heave ho ! on we go, sing, my lads, ye ho ! 
 Who's a-feared to meet the foe ? sing, my lads, ye ho ! " 
 
 In 'ninety-eight we chas'd the foe right into " Bonky Bay," 
 And we fought away like niggers all the night till break o' 
 
 day. 
 
 The foeman's flagship Or-i-ent was blow'd away sky high, 
 With the admiral an' all his crew an' sarve 'em right,

 Now Little Jim was in the thick o' all the fire and smoke, 
 An' he seemed to think that fightin' hard was nothin' but a 
 
 joke, 
 
 For he handed up the powder from the magazine below, 
 An' all the while a-singin', like as if his pluck to show 
 
 (Chorus.} 
 
 But Little Jim was book'd, for as the fight was just on won 
 A musket bullet pick'd him off, a-fore his song was done, 
 They took him to the cockpit, where a-smilin' he did lie, 
 And the sailors well, there warn't a man but somehow 
 
 pip'd his eye. 
 Says Jim " My lads, don't fret for me, but if the shore ye 
 
 see, 
 
 Give a kiss to dear old mother, an' say it came from me." 
 An' there never was a braver heart that serv'd our gracious

 " GOOD-NIGHT ! Good-night ! The feast is done, 
 I must be getting on my way. 
 ' Happy the bride the sun shines on ! ' 
 And never brighter sunlight shone 
 Than ours this happy bridal day ! 
 Another glass ? Well, then, just one. 
 A parting bumper, as you say, 
 Swiftly the smiling hours fly past, 
 When young feet trip it on the floor. 
 What ! Yet another dance ? one more ? 
 My fiddle's tired ... old ! I, too ! 
 Well, look you if I play for you, 
 You will not grudge my fiddler's fee ? 
 And what is that, you ask, What 
 And how much ? Why, listen this 
 A good, fair, honest, buxom kiss ! 
 You'll pay ? Then, for your dance ; here 'tis ! " 
 He fiddled well, and well the feet 
 The floor in tuneful measure beat. 
 And fast and faster went the bow,

 The dancers danced : till when the flight 
 Of foot and bow were at their height,

 And through the merry laughing rout 
 The rhythm of the polka swung, 
 The fiddler broke off with a shout. 
 
 "Good-night ! This time, good-night, indeed, 
 
 In vain ye tempt, in vain ye plead. 
 
 No ; not another bar I'll play. 
 
 Have ye not danced enough, I say ? 
 
 Toed it and heeled it all the night ? 
 
 For shame ! You're cruel. Nay is nay. 
 
 I've far to go : and ere 'twas light 
 
 This morning did I start from home. 
 
 We've had a jolly day ! Now, come !

 And see me safe outside the door. 
 
 Charles, here's my hand. God bless you, boy ! 
 
 Marie, Good-night ! Health, wealth, and joy 
 
 Be yours and always all thro' life ! 
 
 Here's health to bridegroom and to wife ! " 
 
 The farewell voices die away. 
 
 The light that streamed with ruddy ray 
 
 Out from the open cottage door 
 
 Fades down and dwindles more and more : 
 
 And now it gleams, and now 'tis gone ! 
 
 The road turns sharply to the right ; 
 
 Up the hillside he trudges on 
 
 As best he can. 
 
 'Tis dead of night. 
 
 The clouds are scurrying o'er the sky, 
 The wind, with ghostly homeless sigh, 
 Wails in the trees : and hark ! hard by, 
 The night-jar croaks with bodeful cry.

 Some snow fell on the hills last night. 
 
 Above the woods of fir and pine, 
 
 The great slopes, looming phantom-white, 
 
 Across the midnight darkness shine. 
 
 But naught of this the fiddler heeds ; 
 
 Well-used to dark and lonesome ways, 
 
 Onward with stumbling feet he speeds, 
 
 And only thinks of all the day's 
 
 Good fare and fun and that sweet fee 
 
 She gave and gave so willingly ! 
 
 Meanwhile, come courage ! step along 
 
 And cheer the darkness with a song. 
 
 "A merry heart is good sometimes." 
 
 Here are the cross roads. Shall we keep 
 
 The highroad, or that short cut try, 
 
 And save a good two miles thereby ? 
 
 A thousand feet or more below, 
 
 The village lies : and yonder, see ! 
 
 The first white little patch of snow. 
 
 The road or short cut shall it be ? 
 
 The wood, perhaps, is dark and black 
 
 At night. Ah, bah ! We know each yard ; 
 
 No fear of straying from the track. 
 
 Safe, safe enough ! and not so hard 
 
 As that long road. We'll try the wood. 
 
 The moon will soon have risen. Good. 
 
 So in we go. 
 
 Dark, dark and still, 
 Among the tall black pines : so dark 
 You scarce can see a tree until 
 Your hand, in passing scrapes the bark. 
 Onward he trudges. Not a sound. 
 He knows each turn and inch of ground.

 How silent 'tis in here ! And hark ! 
 
 What's that ? 'Twas some one following ! 
 
 No, no : but he has ceased to sing 
 
 A sense of loneliness has put 
 
 Its finger on his lip : his foot 
 
 Is somehow spurred to hasten on. 
 
 Look ! stop a minute, something shone 
 
 Out of the darkness yonder. There ! 
 
 It shone again and now 'tis gone. 
 
 He turns to look behind, and sees 
 
 What seem two eyes of greenish glare 
 
 That watch him from between the trees 
 
 Two cruel spectral eyes that stare ! 
 
 His heart is nipped with sudden frost 
 
 Of fear. Those eyes ! and see ! another pair ! 
 
 Mon Dieu ! and there ! and there ! and there ! 
 
 Encircled by them everywhere ! 
 
 "A pack of wolves ! I'm lost ! I'm lost ! " 
 
 He looks at them with freezing breath 
 He knows they are the eyes of Death. 
 His voice breaks up the silent air 
 In shout on shout. Against a pine 
 He sets his back. 
 
 He feels his life each moment hangs 
 Over the edge of doom. But see 
 That pair of eyes is coming close, 
 Closer, and closer 
 
 He faints and slips 
 Upon the smooth fir-needles, grips 
 A branch, and in the struggle twangs 
 The fiddle slung behind his back. 
 And in a moment all the pack 
 Of wolves start back, and listen dazed

 Arrested ! Like a flash there shoots 
 
 Across the fiddler's brain a tale 
 
 Once heard, of how these savage brutes 
 
 Are tamed by music. 
 
 Swift as the thought, the violin 
 
 Is clutched, the bow is poised : and thin 
 
 And shrill, as if with frightened wail, 
 
 The strings, with almost human cry, 
 
 Croak out their challenge, and begin 
 
 Their grim death-dance of agony. 
 
 Play, fiddler, play ! for life you play. 
 
 Give them your best. No moment stay. 
 
 Play, play, with quickening pulse and breath. 
 
 That cat-gut is the leash of Death ; 
 
 Once broke or slipped, 'tis at your throat. 
 
 Play, man, as never yet did man 
 
 Since first the fiddling world began ! 
 
 So great is music's magic spell, 
 
 It binds in one heaven, earth, and hell. 
 
 Ah, God ! a string breaks with a snap ! 
 
 No time to fix another one ! 
 
 On, on ! pray heaven the others last ! 
 
 A twang a cry ! Another's gone ! 
 
 Sense almost swoons hope stands aghast. 
 
 Nothing he sees but eyes eyes eyes ! 
 
 " Help ! Help ! I'm lost ! " A twang a crack ! 
 
 The third string gone : but one remains. 
 
 The brutes begin to feel the reins 
 
 Are growing slack. They edge more near, 
 
 With more of hunger, less of fear.

 The end is surely come at last. 
 
 The poor scraped notes diminish fast, 
 
 Although he works with might and main. 
 
 It is too much ! It is too much ! 
 Ah ! neither tortured string nor heart 
 Can any longer bear their part : 
 They snap beneath this final touch. 
 
 Both in that awful moment fail, 
 
 And sense goes out in one sharp wail 
 
 One last despairing cry for help ! 
 
 But lo ! as all the savage pack 
 
 Bark out the signal for attack, 
 
 A shot is heard : a whip's sharp crack ! 
 
 Jangle of sledge-bells on the snow ! 
 
 And bang ! bang ! bang ! the rifles go. 
 
 Two brutes fall dead with snarl and yelp ; 
 The rest, like cowards, all turn tail, 
 And, skurrying off in wild affright, 
 Vanish as spectres in the night.

 When suddenly in Adria we saw the rockets leap ;

 And we heard our captain say 
 As we lowered boats away, 
 
 "She cannot last much longer, for her hull is lying 
 deep." 
 
 And we toiled through all that night, 
 
 And by gray of morning light, 
 
 Though the master still stood by her, we had rescued 
 
 twenty-nine ; 
 
 But he cried from off the wreck : 
 "With a wounded man on deck, 
 What master would forsake a man ? 
 His fate shall be mine." 
 
 And our hearts were sorely tried 
 
 As we pulled off from her side, 
 
 For his courage seemed to shame us, 
 
 As from death and doom we fled. 
 
 Then the Aidar rolled in pain, 
 
 Foundered head-first in the main, 
 
 And we felt the whirlpool surges as we plied our oars in 
 
 dread. 
 
 Oh, the glory of that grave ! 
 Oh, the wild, unfeeling wave ! 
 Never better heart of Englishman had sunk beneath the 
 
 sea, 
 
 What a death to show man great ! 
 What a deed outfacing fate ! 
 Britain's sons by such self-conquest shall a wide world's

 How we rowed across the swirl ! 
 Heedless all of water- whirl ! 
 How the sea-foam spray right over,

 But the master bravely cried, 
 
 When the coxswain came beside : 
 
 " Save the fireman ! he is helpless ! I am sound of lung 
 
 and bone! 
 
 He who brought me from the deep, 
 Twenty fathoms, sure can keep 
 Life or death, it little matters, if there's duty to be 
 
 done." 
 
 So with skill of hand and oar, 
 
 Very gently then we bore 
 
 The fireman, nigh to swooning from the bitter cold and 
 
 pain. 
 
 But no word of praise would come 
 As full-hearted we went home, 
 With the truest master-mariner that ever sailed the main.

 whom it is published as a musical monologue) 
 
 [A holiday in Rome the azure sky was all unflecked by clouds as if 
 the eye of the Eternal looked from Heaven's high dome on the great 
 city proud, imperial Rome ! 
 
 The Coliseum was crowded, row on row, a sea of human faces all 
 aglow with mad excitement, for the day would be a rare occasion of 
 wild revelry. For there were gladiator fights and shows of manly 
 strength and as a fitting close to the diversions of that joyous time a 
 band of Christians, whose most heinous crime was preaching a new 
 doctrine, were to be thrown to the lions that all the crowd might see 
 how little the strange God to whom they prayed cared if His followers 
 were stoned or flayed. 
 
 The sports are over and the setting sun is hurrying towards the west, 
 as if to shun the sickening sight. A sudden hush upon the people fell, 
 and then uprose a fierce and savage yell.] 
 
 "SEE where they come, that faithful little band, 
 Chanting a hymn about their fatherland : 
 The Heaven of which they speak with so much joy, 
 That home of happiness without alloy. 
 See yonder maiden with the saint-like face 
 And form of beauty full of fire and grace, 
 She lifts her head as if she were a queen, 
 No trace of fear in her actions seen. 
 Now come the lions growling mad with rage, 
 Hungry and glad to leave their tight-barred cage. 
 See yonder royal beast with flowing mane 
 Lashing his side and roaring with disdain,

 Gazing around upon the yelling crowd, 
 Answering their shouts by growlings long and loud. 
 The maiden stands as statue-like as death, 
 The crowd in terror gaze with bated breath. 
 While as she stands, there falls just at her feet 
 A lovely rose, still filled with perfume sweet. 
 
 Upward she gazes with wide-open eyes, 
 
 Ah ! well she knows who flung the dainty prize. 
 
 'Tis he, her lover, who had vainly tried 
 
 To win her from the faith for which she died. 
 
 He worshipped Venus, Bacchus, and the train 
 
 Of heathen gods who do their votaries chain 
 
 To sinful pleasures, making virtue nought. 
 
 She was a Christian, and had often sought 
 
 To stir his heart with love of Him who died, 
 
 But he had laughed at her most earnest prayer, 
 
 And toss'd a goblet in the sunny air, 
 
 And said, "We live and die, then take our fill 
 
 Of pleasure now, and let them groan that will. 
 
 Why should we waste our youth in solemn fast, 
 
 If we are buried just like dogs at last? 
 
 Nay, drive this Christian nonsense from your head 
 
 And be my own, and then when we are wed 
 
 We will worship Venus and the God of Love. 
 
 Give me your hand, say 'Yes,' my gentle dove." 
 
 And as she told him she must confess 
 Her faith in Christ, though martyrdom no less 
 Was the reward of all who worshipped Him, 
 Of all who dared to chant their holy hymn. 
 And now she was to prove her faith by death.

 Upon her cheek. She stood with anguish dumb, 
 
 And strained her eyes to see if he would come 
 
 To watch her die. The rose had fallen there, 
 
 She stooped and placed it in her raven hair. 
 
 Then looked again and saw her lover's face, 
 
 And arms held down as if he would embrace 
 
 Her even now. A moment, and she turned from her set 
 
 purpose. 
 
 Then new ardour burned within her breast 
 And she stood proud and calm, as if she knew 
 The lions could do her no harm 
 And then uprose the Christians' holy hymn. 
 The sickening sight now makes the senses swim 
 And we will draw a veil o'er the sad scene. 
 
 Night in the Coliseum the crowd has gone 
 One being wanders in that scene forlorn. 
 He stands upon the place where she had died, 
 And breathes the name of Christ the crucified. 
 And stooping down, among the martyred dead, 
 He finds a rose now dyed a deeper red. 
 Some fragments of a dress he knew was hers, 
 He places in his breast and new life stirs within 
 His heart, and as he leaves the place 
 With head bowed low, with slow and solemn pace 
 He softly murmurs as he homeward goes : 
 "Jesus, be Thou my guide till life shall close." 
 But was he coward ? Did he hide away ? 
 Not many weeks on a great festal day, 
 Another band of Christians stood to die, 
 Lifting their glorious hymn of triumph high. 
 Where she had stood he boldly takes his stand, 
 A withered rose clasped in his strong right hand.

 THE MONK AND THE BIRD 
 SIR ALFRED LYALL 
 
 (From "Verses Written in India" by special permission 
 of the Author) 
 
 IN a valley encircled by endless woods, 
 Silent and sombre, a convent stood ; 
 In front a garden ; beyond the pale 
 The forest spread over hill and dale, 
 And its paths were seldom trod. 
 
 One summer evening of ages gone 
 A gray monk worked in the garden alone, 
 Heavily turning the deep clay soil ; 
 And his breath came hard with the straining toil, 
 As he prayed aloud to God. 
 
 " Alas ! " cried he, " for the path is steep 
 And the goal is far, and the slow hours creep. 
 When shall I finish the tale of my years, 
 Of days in silence and nights in tears, 
 And come to my promised rest ? " 
 
 He lifted his face to the comforting sky, 
 And he saw, where sat in a tree hard by, 
 A bird whose plumes like the rainbow shone ; 
 It sang three notes with a silvery tone, 
 And as if to a new-built nest. 
 
 Over the garden he saw it flit 
 Into the forest ; and there it lit. 
 Again in the leaves its song he heard ; 
 He was fain to follow the beautiful bird, 
 And he entered the woodland maze.

 The bird flew slowly from bough to bough, 
 Up the valley-side to the low hill's brow ; 
 From the spreading beech on the mossy bank 
 To the willow weeping o'er marsh pools dank ; 
 He could but follow and gaze. 
 
 Ever it fluttered above his head ; 
 Ever it looked, and was lingering led 
 Through grassy glades and tangled woods, 
 Deep into shady solitudes 
 Of many a fern-clad hollow. 
 
 For he thought that a bird so rich and so rare 
 Never had floated on summer air ; 
 He could not lose it, he needs must roam ; 
 It seemed to beckon and bid him come : 
 He could not choose but follow. 
 
 At last on a wych elm, gnarled and gray, 
 As the monk drew nearer, it seemed to stay, 
 Then spread its wings for a sudden flight 
 Over the tree-tops, out of his sight ; 
 And he turned back drearily. 
 
 He reached his garden in twilight dim ; 
 The trees looked gaunt and the convent grim ; 
 He rang -at the gate as vesper tolled, 
 And the porter opened it, blind and old, 
 And he entered wearily. 
 
 But the hall had suffered a secret change. 
 With unknown faces and accent strange 
 The monks rose up as they heard his name ; 
 They asked his errand and whence he came. 
 And he told them his tale forlorn.

 THE MONK AND THE BIRD 85 
 
 Some counted their beads, one muttered a prayer ; 
 He knew not why they should gather and stare. 
 He stood in the midst like one distraught, 
 And the friendly voices in vain he sought 
 Of the freres he had left that morn. 
 
 At last came the abbot, aged and bent ; 
 He scanned his features with eyes intent ; 
 And he cried, " Be it he or his wandering ghost, 
 'Tis the face of the monk in the forest lost 
 Some forty summers agone ! 
 
 " Is he roaming still, though the mass was said 
 And the requiem sang for a brother dead ! 
 Does he dream he has rambled this livelong day ? 
 'Tis two-score years since he vanished away ! " 
 But the monk gave answer none. 
 
 Save only he said, " Have I journeyed so long? 
 Welcome at last is the evensong ; 
 Let me take the sleep I have earned so well." 
 And he died that night in his ancient cell, 
 And the brethren closed his eyes. 
 
 So the prayer was granted : from youth to age 
 God shortened the term of his pilgrimage : 
 The said years passed like a day's sunlight, 
 And the sweet-voiced bird with the plumage bright 
 Was a bird of Paradise.

 He was playing at Plymouth a rubber of bowls 
 When the great Armada came. 
 
 But he said, " They must wait their turn, good souls," 
 And he stooped and finished the game. 
 
 Fifteen sail were the Dutchmen bold, 
 
 Duncan he had but two : 
 
 But he anchored them fast where the Texel shoaled, 
 
 And his colours aloft he flew. 
 
 " I've taken the depth to a fathom," he cried 
 
 And I'll sink with a right good will, 
 
 For I know when we're all of us under the tide 
 
 My flag will be fluttering still." 
 
 Splinters were flying, above, below, 
 
 When Nelson sailed the sound : 
 
 " Mark you, I wouldn't be elsewhere now," 
 
 Said he, " for a thousand pound ! " 
 
 The Admiral's signal bade him fly, 
 
 But he wickedly wagged his head, 
 
 He clapped his glass to his sightless eye, 
 
 And " I'm blessed if I see it," he said. 
 
 Admirals all, they said their say 
 
 (The echoes are ringing still), 
 
 Admirals all, they went their way 
 
 To the haven under the hill. 
 
 But they left us a kingdom none can take,

 THE DEATH OF ARNKEL 
 
 EDMUND GOSSE 
 (By special permission of the Author] 
 
 ACROSS the roaring board in Helgafell, 
 Above the clash of ringing horns of ale, 
 The guests of Snorri, reddened with the frost, 
 Weighed all their comrades through a winter night, 
 Disputing which was first in thew and brain, 
 And courteous acts of manhood ; some averred 
 Their host, the shifty Snorri, first of men, 
 While some were bent to Arnkel, some to Styrr. 
 Then Thorleif Kimbi shouted down the hall, 
 " Folly and windy talk ! the stalwart limbs 
 Of Styrr, and that sharp, goodly face of thine, 
 All-cunning Snorri, make one man, not twain, 
 One man in friendship and in Rede, not twain, 
 Nor that man worthy to be named for skill, 
 Or strength, or beauty, or for popular arts, 
 With Arnkel, son of Thorolfthe grim ghost, 
 Wit has he, tough not lacking therewithal 
 In sinew ; see to it, comrades, lest he crush 
 The savage leaders of our Oligarchy, 
 Vast, indolent, mere masks of men, 
 Unfit for civic uses ; his the hand 
 To gather all our forces like the reins 
 Of patient steeds, and drive us at his will. 
 Unless we stir betimes, and are his bane." 
 
 So from his turbulent mouth the shaft struck home, 
 
 Venomed with envy and the jealous pride 
 
 Of birth ; and ere they roared themselves to rest,

 THE DEATH OF ARNKEL 89 
 
 The chieftains vowed that Arnkel must be slain, 
 
 Nor waited many days ; for one clear night 
 
 Freystein, the spy, as near his sheep he watched, 
 
 Saw Arnkel fetching hay from Orlgstad, 
 
 With three young thralls of his own household folk. 
 
 And left the fold, and crept across the fell, 
 
 And wakened from their first sweet midnight sleep 
 
 The sons of Thorbrand, and went on, and roused 
 
 Snorri, who dreamed of blood and dear revenge. 
 
 Then through the frosty moonlit night they sped, 
 
 Warmed to the heart with hopes of murderous play. 
 
 Nine men from Snorri's house, and by the sea 
 
 At Alpafjord they met the six men armed 
 
 With Thorleif ; scarcely greeted they, but skimmed 
 
 Along the black shore of the flashing Fjord, 
 
 Lit by the large moon in a cloudless sky, 
 
 Over the swelling, waving ice they flew, 
 
 Grinding the tufts of grass beneath their sleighs, 
 
 So silent that the twigs of juniper 
 
 Snapped under them, sharp, like a cracking whip, 
 
 Echoing, and so to Orlgstad they came. 
 
 But Arnkel saw them through the cold bright air, 
 
 And turned, and bade the three young thralls haste home, 
 
 To bring back others of their kith to fight ; 
 
 So maddened by base fear, they rushed and one, 
 
 Or ever he neared the homestead, as he fled 
 
 Slipped on the forehead of a mountain force, 
 
 And volleying down from icy plain to plain, 
 
 Woke all the echoes of that waterfall, 
 
 And died, while numb with fright the others ran. 
 
 But Arnkel bowed, and loosened from his sleigh 
 The iron runner with its shining point, 
 And leaped upon the fence, and set his back 
 Against the hay-stack, through the frosty night

 Its warm deep odour passed into his brain. 
 But Snorri and his fellows with no word 
 Sprang from their sleighs, and met below the fence, 
 And reaching upwards with their brawny arms, 
 Smote hard at Arnkel. With the runner he, 
 Cleaving with both hands, parried blow on blow, 
 Till, shaft by shaft their spears splintered and snapt ; 
 Nor would they yet have reached him but that he, 
 Gathering a mighty stroke at Thorleif s head, 
 Dashed down his runner on the icy fence 
 And shivered it, while backwards Thorleif fell, 
 Bending the slimness of his supple loins, 
 Unwounded. Then a moment's space they stood 
 Silent. They from the hay-stack at his back, 
 His glittering sword and buckler Arnkel seized, 
 And like a wild-cat clomb the stack, and stood 
 Thigh deep astride upon the quivering hay, 
 Raining down thrusts and blinding all his foes 
 With moony lightnings from the flashing steel. 
 But Thorleif clambered up behind his back, 
 And Snorri with his shield before his face 
 Harried him through the wavering veil of hay, 
 And Styrr, like some great monster of the falls, 
 Swayed his huge broadsword in his knotted fists 
 And swept it, singing, through the helm and brain, 
 And deep sank Arnkel on the bloody stack. 
 
 They wrapped his corse in hay, and left him there ; 
 
 To whom within the silence of the night 
 
 Came that dark ghost, his father, whose black face 
 
 Affrights the maidens in the milking-stead. 
 
 And till, afar along the frozen road, 
 
 The tinkling of the sleighs he heard, and knew 
 
 That all too late the thralls of Arnkel came.

 THE NEW BONNET 
 
 He hung above the body of his son, 
 Casting no shadow in the dazzling moon, 
 Cursing the gods with inarticulate voice, 
 And cursing that too-envious mood of men 
 That brooks no towering excellence, nor heeds 
 Virtue, nor welfare of th' unsceptred state. 
 
 THE NEW BONNET 
 M. T. MORRISON 
 
 A FOOLISH little maiden bought a foolish little bonnet, 
 With a ribbon, and a feather, and a bit of lace upon it ; 
 And that the other maidens of the little town might know it, 
 She thought she'd go to meeting the next Sunday just to 
 
 show it. 
 
 But though the little bonnet was scarce larger than a dime, 
 The getting of it settled proved to be a work of time. 
 So, when 'twas fairly tied, all the bells had stopped their 
 
 ringing, 
 And when she came to meeting, sure enough the folks were 
 
 singing. 
 
 So this foolish little maiden stood and waited at the door ; 
 And she shook her ruffles out behind, and smoothed them 
 
 down before. 
 
 " Hallelujah ! Hallelujah ! " sang the choir above her head. 
 " Hardly knew you ! hardly knew you " were the words she 
 
 thought they said. 
 
 This made the little maiden feel ; o very, very cross, 
 That she gave her little mouth a twist, her little head a 
 
 toss ; 
 For she thought the very hymn they sang was all about her 
 
 bonnet, 
 With the ribbon, and the feather, and the bit of lace upon it.

 And she would not wait to listen to the sermon or the 
 
 prayer, 
 But pattered down the silent street, and hurried up the 
 
 stair, 
 
 Till she reached her little bureau, and in a band-box on it 
 Had hidden, safe from critic's eye, her foolish little bonnet. 
 Which proves, my little maidens, that each of you will find 
 In every Sabbath service but an echo of your mind ; 
 And the silly little head that's filled with silly little airs 
 Will never get a blessing from sermon or from prayers.

 'Tis night. The cabin door is shut, the room, 
 
 Though poor, is warm, and has a flickering light 
 
 By which you just distinguish, through the gloom, 
 
 A shelf with rows of plates that glimmer bright. 
 
 Some nets hung out to dry upon the wall, 
 
 And at the farthest end a curtained bedstead tall ; 
 
 Near it a mattress on rude benches spread 
 
 A nest of souls five children sleeping there ; 
 
 Upon the hearth some embers glowing red ; 
 
 And by the bedside, wrapped in thought and prayer, 
 
 The mother kneeling, anxious and alone, 
 
 While out of doors, the winds, the rocks, the night, 
 
 The gloomy ocean lifts its ceaseless moan.

 With chance and danger he has had to fight, 
 No matter what the weather good or bad ; 
 The children hunger and are thinly clad ; 
 So in his little sailing boat each night 
 He must set off, however hard it blows ; 
 His wife remains at home to wash and sew, 
 Prepare the bait, and mend the nets, and keep 
 Watch o'er the herring-broth their only meal 
 Till, all the children being put asleep, 
 She can pray God for her dear husband's weal. 
 She takes her lantern and her cloak may be

 If still the beacon light be burning clear, 
 And if the waves are less, and daybreak near. 
 She wanders on no window shows a light ; 
 Sudden her glance, intent to find her way 
 Meets an old hovel, fallen to decay ; 
 
 No fire within 'tis black and cold as night. 
 
 From the low roof the rugged thatch flies fast, 
 
 And the door rattles loosely in the blast. 
 
 " Ah I the poor widow I forgot her quite ! 
 
 My husband found her worse the other day.

 She knocks, she listens, no one speaks or stirs ; 
 
 Jenny stands shiv'ring at the broken door ; 
 
 " Sick and with such young children, sick and poor 
 
 She has but two, but then her husband's dead." 
 
 She knocks and calls, " What, neighbour! all in bed?" 
 
 Still the same silence " Well, she must sleep fast ; 
 
 No use in calling." All at once the blast 
 
 Beat on the door and blew it open wide. 
 
 But what has Jenny in that cabin done,

 What is it, she, with troubled glance, has laid 
 
 Upon her bed, behind the curtain's shade ? 
 
 When she got home it was the break of day. 
 
 She sat down pale and trembling, some regret 
 
 Seemed to be weighing on her mind, she let 
 
 The brow she clasped fall heavy on the bed, 
 
 And, in short sentences, she said, 
 
 " My husband ! Heavens / What will the poor man say 1 " 
 
 Sudden the door bursts open, lets a track 
 
 Of cold light in : upon the threshold stands, 
 
 Dragging his dripping net with both his hands, 
 
 The fisher, calling gaily, " Well I I'm back." 
 
 "What weather?" " Bad." "What sort of haul?" 
 
 " Why none. 
 
 There was a teaser of a wind that blew, 
 And once I thought 'twas getting on towards morn 
 We should capsize the cable broke in two.

 She leaves two children boy and girl quite small

 The man looked grave at once, and flung away

 To tell their noble qualities is quite beyond refusing : 
 
 So I'll praise the little women, and you'll find the thing 
 
 amusing ; 
 They are, I know, as cold as snow, while flames around 
 
 diffusing. 
 They're cold without, whilst warm within the flame of love 
 
 is raging ; 
 They're gay and pleasant in the street, soft, cheerful, and 
 
 engaging ; 
 They're thrifty and discreet at home, the cares of life 
 
 assuaging : 
 All this and more; try, and you'll find how true is my 
 
 presaging. 
 
 In a little precious stone what splendour meets the eyes ! 
 In a little lump of sugar how much of sweetness lies ! 
 So in a little woman love grows and multiplies : 
 You recollect the proverb says A word unto the wise. 
 A pepper-corn is very small, but seasons every dinner 
 More than all other condiments, e'en though 'tis sprinkled 
 
 thinner : 
 
 Just so a little woman is, if Love will let you win her, 
 There's not a joy in all the world that's possible without 
 
 her. 
 
 And as within the little rose you'll find the richest dyes, 
 And in a little grain of gold much price and value lies ; 
 As from a little balsam much odour doth arise, 
 So in a little woman there's a taste of paradise. 
 E'en as the little ruby its secret worth betrays, 
 Colour and price and virtue in the clearness of its rays, 
 Just so a little woman much excellence displays, 
 Beauty and grace and love and fidelity always. 
 The skylark and the nightingale, though small and light of 
 
 wing, 
 Warble more sweetly in the grove than all the birds that 
 
 sing:

 And so a little woman, though a very little thing, 
 
 Is sweeter far than sugar, aifci -flowers that bloom in spring. 
 
 The magpie and the golden thrush have many a thrilling 
 
 note, 
 
 Each as a gay musician doth strain his little throat, 
 A merry little songster in his green and yellow coat : 
 And such a little woman is, when Love doth make her dote. 
 There's nought can be compared to her, throughout the 
 
 wide creation ; 
 
 She is a paradise on earth, our greatest consolation, 
 So cheerful, gay and happy, so free from all vexation : 
 In fine, she's better in the proof than in anticipation. 
 If as her height increases are woman's charms decreased, 
 Then surely it is good to be from all the great released. 
 Now, of two evils choose the less, said a wise man in the 
 
 East; 
 By consequence, of woman-kind be sure to choose the 
 
 least.

 Rapt in silent ecstasy 
 Of divinest self-surrender, 
 Saw the Vision and the Splendour. 
 
 Deep distress and hesitation 
 Mingled with his adoration ; 
 Should he go, or should he stay ? 
 Should he leave the poor to wait 
 Hungry at the convent gate, 
 Till the Vision passed away ? 
 Should he slight his radiant guest, 
 Slight his visitant celestial, 
 For a crowd of ragged, bestial 
 Beggars at the convent gate ? 
 Would the Vision there remain ? 
 Would the Vision come again ? 
 
 Then a voice within his breast 
 Whispered, audible and clear, 
 As if to the outward ear 
 " Do thy duty ; that is best ; 
 Leave unto thy Lord the rest ! "

 On the Blessed Vision bent,

 Looking through the iron grating,

 TO-DAY the people gather from the streets, 
 To-day the soldiers muster near and far ; 
 Peace, with a glad look and a grateful, meets 
 Her rugged brother War. 
 
 To-day the Queen of all the English land, 
 She who sits high o'er Kaisers and o'er Kings, 
 Gave with her royal hand th' Imperial hand 
 Whose grasp the earth en-rings 
 
 Her Cross of Valour to her worthiest ; 
 No golden toy with milky pearls besprent, 
 But simple bronze, and for a warrior's breast 
 A fair, fit ornament. 
 
 And richer than red gold that dull bronze seems, 
 Since it was bought with lavish waste of worth 
 Whereto the wealth of Earth's gold-sanded streams 
 Were but a lack, and dearth. 
 
 Muscovite metal makes this English Cross, 
 Won in a rain of blood and wreath of flame ; 
 The guns that thundered for their brave lives' loss 
 Are worn hence, for their fame ! 
 
 Ay, listen ! all ye maidens laughing-eyed, 
 And all ye English mothers, be aware ! 
 Those who shall pass before ye at noontide

 There are things of which I may not speak ; 
 
 There are dreams that cannot die ; 
 There are thoughts that make the strong heart weak, 
 And bring a pallor into the cheek, 
 And a mist before the eye. 
 
 And the words of that fatal song 
 Come over me like a chill : 
 " A boy's will is the wind's will, 
 And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." 
 
 Strange to me now are the forms I meet 
 
 When I visit the dear old town ; 
 But the native air is pure and sweet, 
 And the trees that o'ershadow each well-known street, 
 As they balance up and down, 
 Are singing the beautiful song, 
 Are sighing and whispering still : 
 " A boy's will is the wind's will, 
 And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." 
 
 And Deering's Woods are fresh and fair, 
 
 And with joy that is almost pain 
 My heart goes back to wander there, 
 And among the dreams of the days that were, 
 I find my lost youth again. 
 
 And the strange and beautiful song, 
 The groves are repeating it still : 
 " A boy's will is the wind's will, 
 And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts."

 WHEN I WAS A BOY 107 
 
 Often I think of the beautiful town 
 
 That is seated by the sea ; 
 Often in thought go up and down 
 The pleasant streets of that dear old town, 
 And my youth comes back to me. 
 And a verse of a Lapland song 
 Is haunting my memory still : 
 " A boy's will is the wind's will, 
 And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." 
 
 I can see the shadowy lines of its trees, 
 
 And catch in sudden gleams, 
 The sheen of the far-surrounding seas, 
 And islands that were the Hesperides 
 Of all my boyish dreams. 
 
 And the burden of that old song, 
 It murmurs and whispers still : 
 " A boy's will is the wind's will, 
 And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." 
 
 I remember the black wharves and the slips, 
 
 And the sea-tides tossing free ; 
 And Spanish sailors with bearded lips, 
 And the beauty and mystery of the ships, 
 And the magic of the sea. 
 
 And the voice of that wayward song 
 Is singing and saying still : 
 " A boy's will is the wind's will, 
 And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." 
 
 I remember the bulwarks by the shore, 
 
 And the fort upon the hill : 
 The sunrise gun, with its hollow roar, 
 The drum-beat repeated o'er and o'er,

 And the bugle wild and shrill. 
 
 And the music of that old song 
 
 Throbs in my memory still : 
 " A boy's will is the wind's will, 
 And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." 
 
 I remember the sea-fight far away, 
 How it thundered o'er the tide ! 
 And the dead captains, as they lay 
 In their graves, o'erlooking the tranquil bay, 
 Where they in battle died. 
 
 And the sound of that mournful song 
 Goes through me with a thrill : 
 " A boy's will is the wind's will, 
 And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." 
 
 I can see the breezy dome of groves, 
 The shadows of Deering's Woods ; 
 And the friendships old and the early loves 
 Come back with a Sabbath sound, as of doves 
 In quiet neighbourhoods. 
 
 And the verse of that sweet old song 
 It flutters and murmurs still : 
 "A boy's will is the wind's will, 
 And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts." 
 
 A LIGHTHOUSE LEGEND 
 
 ANON. 
 
 OUT on a surf-swept rock 'midst ocean's wrath, 
 A lighthouse stood ; and there for twelve long years 
 Had dwelt the keeper, and his only child. 
 This was her little world, naught else she knew, 
 Nor e'er had passed beyond her island home. 
 Thus pleasantly her youthful days sped on ;

 A LIGHTHOUSE LEGEND 109 
 
 Nor dreamed she of a wider world beyond, 
 Save when in the far distance she descried 
 The landing graceful forms of passing ships, 
 That seemed to beckon her to lands beyond. 
 Then would she to her father's side repair 
 And question him of things nor seen nor felt, 
 And he consenting oft would fire her mind 
 With fairy tales of many distant lands, 
 Till fancy, fed by solitude, would grow 
 To keen desire to know them for herself. 
 Then in her thoughtful face and longing eyes, 
 The old man read the wishes of her heart, 
 And felt that soon he'd keep his watch alone. 
 He grudged not that, for she his only child 
 Would waste her fair young life in rude retreat 
 Familiar only to wide ocean's wrath. 
 And so one lovely morn when sea and sky 
 Were all aglow, a boat bore her away. 
 
 Three years have passed. 'Twas summer's even again, 
 
 And in his room the keeper sat and read 
 
 Some cheering words, for oft he read and smiled, 
 
 Then read again, and, smiling, paused to think. 
 
 A soiled and crumpled note, yes, but 'twas dear, 
 
 For came it from his loved one with the news 
 
 That soon she hoped to be at home again. 
 
 Then, rising from his seat, he looked abroad, 
 
 Adown the western steeps the great round sun 
 
 Was slowly passing, 'midst a blaze of gold 
 
 That threw across the ocean's beating breast 
 
 A quivering line of light. 
 
 Sweet eventide ! what memories round thee cling ! 
 Of years long gone, beloved friends passed away ; 
 And musing thus, he fell asleep and dreamt

 He stood alone upon a silent shore, 
 
 Lapped by the voiceless waves of dreaming sea ; 
 
 Ever its restless waters rose and fell, 
 
 Yet mutely crept up on the shining strand, 
 
 And back returned in silence smooth and slow ; 
 
 For long it seemed he stood and viewed with awe, 
 
 The wondrous working of this silent sea. 
 
 Till suddenly there rose from out its depths 
 
 A cloud-like shape that form and being took 
 
 Like to an angel robed in dazzling white. 
 
 Instant each wavelet seemed to find a tongue 
 
 That sent its murmuring music far along 
 
 In dying cadence down the shadowy shore. 
 
 Nearer, with inexperienced move it stole, 
 
 And louder grew the voices of the deep ; 
 
 Anon it paused, and rising to a form 
 
 Of more than mortal height sank slowly down 
 
 With piercing shriek into the yawning depths 
 
 That rolled around in silence as before. 
 
 Trembling with fear the keeper woke. All still 
 
 And deep dead night around. No light on high. 
 
 The lamp hung black within its gloomy sphere ; 
 
 The lighthouse dark its purpose false a dream, 
 
 Ay, he had slept, God knows what this might bring ! 
 
 Amazed he stood like one with broken mind 
 
 Till o'er the darkened sea a wild shriek rang 
 
 Like living echo of his scarce dead dream. 
 
 With nervous haste he quickly lit the torch, 
 
 Then flashed its beams upon a scene of death. 
 
 Too late ! too late ! the reef had worked its woe, 
 
 Prone on the midnight surge a gallant ship lies low. 
 
 All night in agony of mind he sat, 
 
 And prayed as never sufferer prayed for day. 
 
 And when the shimmering light proclaimed the dawn,

 His laggard eye swept towards the cruel reef 
 In search of wreck, to learn the direful tale. 
 Yet nothing but the vast and wandering sea 
 Now met his gaze ; nor plank nor floating spar 
 Remained to tell the horror of the night. 
 He tottered down and crept among the rocks 
 To a tide-swept bay, that opened from the reefs ; 
 Oh ! something kin to human form was there, 
 A seaman's body ! No, a maiden fair, 
 Floating with pale dead face, serenely calm, 
 That neither death, nor stroke of rude rough wave, 
 Had robbed of beauty, nor the girlish grace 
 Which lingered there to tell what once she was, 
 Borne on the throbbing bosom of the deep, 
 Which seemed to animate her own. She looked 
 She looked an angel sleeping in the blue of heaven. 
 One look the keeper gave, one look of pain, 
 And then he knew his child had come again.

 No breath, no stir ; but everywhere 
 The cold frost crawleth slow, 
 
 And Frank and Teuton side by side 
 Lie stiffening in the snow, 
 
 While piteously each marble face 
 Gleams in the ruby glow. 
 
 No sound ; but yonder 'midst the dead 
 There stands one steed snow-white, 
 
 And clinging to its chilly mane, 
 Half swooning, yet upright, 
 
 Its rider totters, breathing hard, 
 Bareheaded in the light ! 
 
 Hans Vogel. Spectacles on nose, 
 
 He gasps and gazes round 
 He shivers as his eyes survey 
 
 That wintry battle-ground 
 Then, parch'd with thirst and chill with cold, 
 
 He sinks, without a sound. 
 
 Before his vision as he lies 
 
 There gleams a quaint old town, 
 
 He sees the students in the street 
 Swaggering up and down, 
 
 While at a casement sits a maid 
 In clean white cap and gown. 
 
 Hans Vogel thinks, " My time hath come ! 
 
 Ne'er shall these eyes of mine 
 Behold poor Annchen, or the trees 
 
 Of dear old Ehbrenstein ! "

 To God he mutters now a prayer, 
 
 Quaking in every limb ; 
 Trembling he holds it to the light ! 
 
 'Tis full unto the brim ! 
 A flask ! a brimming flask of wine ! 
 
 And God hath sent it him !

 Prepares to quaff his prize, 
 
 When lo ! a sound he starts and meets 
 A pair of burning eyes ! 
 
 Propt on a bed of comrades dead, 
 
 His faint breath swiftly flying, 
 His breast torn open by a shell, 
 
 A Grenadier is lying : 
 Grim as a wolf, with gleaming fangs, 
 
 The Frenchman glareth, dying ! 
 
 White is his hair, his features worn 
 
 With many a wild campaign, 
 He rocks his head from side to side

 He groans athirst, with open mouth,

 He groans athirst, with open mouth, 
 And slowly glazing eyes.

 Again now totters he 
 So spent now is that wolf of war 
 
 He scarce can hear or see. 
 Hans Vogel holds his hand, and takes 
 
 His head upon his knee ! 
 
 Then down the dying Frenchman's throat 
 
 He sends the liquor fine :

 While pouring down the wine 
 " Hadst thou not play'd me such a trick, 
 
 It might have all been thine ! "

 Of his good Fatherland 
 The Frenchman hears an alien sound 
 
 And cannot understand, 
 But he can taste the warm red wine 
 
 And feel the kindly hand.

 " FLASH ! " 
 
 (THE FIREMAN'S STORY) 
 WILL CARLETON 
 
 " FLASH " was a white-foot sorrel, an' run on Number 
 
 Three : 
 
 Not much stable manners an average horse to see ; 
 Notional in his methods strong in loves an' hates ; 
 Not very much respected, or popular 'mongst his mates. 
 
 Dull an' moody an' sleepy, an' " off " on quiet days ; 
 Full o' turbulent, sour looks, an' small, sarcastic ways ; 
 Scowled an' bit at his partner, an' banged the stable floor 
 With other means intended to designate life a bore. 
 
 But when, be't day or night time, he heard the alarm-bell 
 
 ring, 
 He'd rush for his place in the harness with a regular tiger 
 
 spring ; 
 An' watch, with nervous shivers, the clasp of buckle an' 
 
 band, 
 Until 'twas plainly evident he'd like to lend a hand. 
 
 An' when the word was given, away he would rush an' tear, 
 As if a thousand witches was rumplin' up his hair, 
 An' craze the other horses with his magnetic charm, 
 Till every hoof-beat sounded a regular fire-alarm !

## p. 117 (#133) ############################################


 
 "FLASH!" 117 
 
 Never a horse a jockey would notice an' admire 
 
 Like Flash in front of his engine a-runnin' to a fire ; 
 
 Never a horse so lazy, so dawdlin', an' so slack, 
 
 As Flash upon his return trip, a-drawin' the engine back. 
 
 Now, when the different horses gets tender-footed an' old, 
 They're no use in our business ; so Flash was finally sold 
 To quite a respectable milkman, who found it not so fine 
 A-bossin' one o' God's creatures outside its natural line. 
 
 Seems as if I could see Flash a-mopin' along here now, 
 Feelin' that he was simply assistant to a cow ; 
 But sometimes he'd imagine he heard the alarm-bell's din, 
 An' jump an' rear for a season before they could hold him 
 in; 
 
 An' once, in spite o' his master, he strolled in 'mongst us 
 
 chaps, 
 
 To talk with the other horses, of former fires, perhaps ; 
 Whereat the milkman kicked him ; whereat, us boys to 
 
 please, 
 He begged that horse's pardon upon his bended knees. 
 
 But one day, for a big fire as we was makin' a dash, 
 Both o' the horses we had on somewhat resemblin' Flash, 
 Yellin' an' ringin' an' rushin', with excellent voice an' heart, 
 We passed the poor old fellow, a-tuggin' away at his cart. 
 
 If ever I see an old hoss grow upward into a new 
 If ever I see a milkman whose traps behind him flew, 
 'Twas that old hoss, a-rearin' an' racin' down the track, 
 An' that respectable milkman a-trying to hold him back. 
 
 Away he rushed like a cyclone for the head o' " Number 
 
 Three," 
 Gained the lead, an' kept it, an' steered his journey free ;

 Dodgin' waggons an' horses, an' still on the keenest " silk," 
 An' furnishin' all that neighbourhood with good, respectable 
 milk. 
 
 Crowd a-yellin' an' runnin', an' vainly hollerin' " Whoa ! " 
 Milkman bracin' an' sawin', with never a bit o' show ; 
 Firemen laughin' an' chucklin' an' shoutin' " Good ! go in ! " 
 Hoss a-gettin' down to it an' sweepin' along like sin. 
 
 Finally came where the fire was halted with a " thud " : 
 Sent the respectable milkman heels over head in mud ; 
 Watched till he see the engines properly workin' there, 
 After which he relinquished all interest in the affair. 
 
 Moped an' wilted an' dawdled, " faded away " once more, 
 Took up his old occupation considerin' life a bore ; 
 Laid down in his harness, an' sorry I am to say 
 The milkman he had drawn there took his dead body away. 
 
 That's the whole o' my story : I've seen, more'n once or 
 
 twice, 
 
 That poor dead animals' actions is full o' human advice ; 
 An' if you ask what Flash taught, I'll simply answer, then, 
 That poor old horse was a symbol of some intelligent men. 
 
 An' if, as some consider, there's animals in the sky, 
 
 I think the poor old fellow is gettin' another try ; 
 
 But if he should sniff the big fire that plagues the abode o' 
 
 sin, 
 It'll take the strongest angel to hold the old fellow in. 
 
 BEN HAZZARD'S GUESTS 
 
 ANNA P. MARSHALL 
 
 BEN HAZZARD'S hut was smoky and cold, 
 Ben Hazzard, half blind, was weak and old, 
 And he cobbled shoes for his scanty gold.

## p. 119 (#135) ############################################


 
 BEN HAZZARD'S GUESTS 119 
 
 Sometimes he sighed for a larger store 
 Wherewith to bless the wandering poor ; 
 For he was not wise in worldly lore. 
 The poor were Christ's, he knew no more. 
 One night a cry from the window came 
 Ben Hazzard was sleepy, and tired, and lame 
 
 " Ben Hazzard, open," it seemed to say ; 
 
 " Give shelter and food, I humbly pray." 
 Ben Hazzard lifted his old grey head 
 To listen. " Tis very cold," he said, 
 And his old frame shook in his cheerless bed, 
 " But the wanderer must be comforted." 
 Out from his straw he painfully crept, 
 And over the frosty floor he stept, 
 While under the door the snow-wreaths swept. 
 " Come in, in the name of the Lord," he cried, 
 As he opened the door and held it wide. 
 A milk-white kitten was all he spied, 
 Trembling and crying there at his feet, 
 Ready to die in the bitter sleet. 
 
 Ben Hazzard, amazed, stared up and down ; 
 
 The candles were out in all the town ; 
 
 The stout house doors were carefully shut, 
 
 Safe bolted were all but old Ben's hut. 
 
 " I thought that somebody called," he said ; 
 
 "Some dream or other got into my head. 
 
 Come, then, poor pussy, and share my bed." 
 
 But first he sought for a rusty cup, 
 
 And gave his guest a generous sup. 
 
 Then out from the storm, the wind, and the sleet, 
 
 Puss joyfully lay at old Ben's feet. 
 
 Truly it was a terrible storm ; 
 
 Ben feared he should never more be warm.

 But just as he began to be dozy, 
 
 And puss was purring soft and cosy, 
 
 A voice called faintly before his door : 
 
 " Ben Hazzard, Ben Hazzard, help, I implore 
 " Give drink, and a crust from out your store." 
 
 Ben Hazzard opened his sleepy eyes, 
 
 And his wrinkled face showed great surprise, 
 
 Out from his bed he stumbled again, 
 
 Teeth chattering with neuralgic pain, 
 
 Caught at the door in the frozen rain. 
 
 " Come in, in the name of the Lord," he said ; 
 
 "With such as I have thou shalt be fed." 
 
 Only a little black dog he saw 
 
 Whining and shaking a broken paw. 
 
 " Well, well," cried Ben Hazzard, " I must have dreamed, 
 
 But verily like a voice it seemed. 
 
 Poor creature," he added, with husky tone, 
 
 His feet so cold they seemed like stone, 
 
 " Thou shalt have the whole of my marrow bone." 
 
 He went to the cupboard, and took from the shelf 
 
 The bone he had saved for his very self. 
 
 Then, after binding the broken paw, 
 
 Half dead with cold, went back to his straw. 
 
 Under the ancient blue bed-quilt he crept, 
 
 His conscience was white, again he slept. 
 
 " Ben Hazzard, for Christ's sweet sake, come here ! " 
 And once more he stood at the open door, 
 And looked abroad, as he looked before, 
 This time full sure was a voice he heard ; 
 But all that he saw was a storm-tossed bird, 
 With weary pinion and beaten crest, 
 And a red blood-stain on his snowy breast. 
 " Come in, in the name of the Lord," he said, 
 Tenderly raising the drooping head,

 And tearing his tattered coat apart, 
 
 Laid the cold bird on his own warm heart. 
 
 The sunrise flashed on the snowy thatch 
 As an angel lifted the wooden latch ; 
 Ben woke in a flood of golden light, 
 And knew the voice that had called all night, 
 And steadfastly gazing, without a word, 
 Beheld the messenger from the Lord. 
 He said to Ben, with a wondrous smile, 
 The three guests sleeping all the while ; 
 
 " Thrice happy is he that blesseth the poor ; 
 The humblest creatures that sought thy door, 
 For Christ's sweet sake thou hast comforted." 
 "Nay, 'twas not much," Ben humbly said, 
 With a rueful shake of his old grey head. 
 " Who giveth all of his scanty store, 
 In Christ's dear name, can do no more. 
 Behold, the Master who waiteth for thee 
 Saith, 'Giving to them, thou hast given to Me.'" 
 Then, with Heaven's light on his face, "Amen, 
 I come in the name of the Lord," said Ben. 
 
 "Frozen to death," the Watchman said 
 When at last he found him in his bed, 
 With a smile on his face so strange and bright, 
 He wondered what old Ben saw that night. 
 Ben's lips were silent, and never told, 
 He had gone up higher to find his gold.

 He did not see the starlight on the Laspun hills,

 He saw the April noon on his books aglow, 
 The Wistavie trailing in at the window wide ; 
 
 He heard his father's voice from the terrace below 
 Calling him down to ride. 
 
 He saw the grey little church across the park, 
 
 The mounds that hid the lov'd and honour'd dead ; 
 
 The Norman arch, the chancel softly dark, 
 The brasses black and red. 
 
 He saw the school close sunny and green, 
 
 The runner beside him, the stand by the parapet wall, 
 The distant tape and the crowd roaring between, 
 
 His own name over all. 
 
 He saw the dark wainscot and timber'd roof, 
 The long tables, and the faces merry and keen ; 
 
 The college eight and their trainer dining aloof, 
 The dons on the dais serene.

 And strode to his ruin'd camp below the wood ; 
 
 He drank the breath of the morning cool and sweet ; 
 His murderers round him stood. 
 
 Light on the Laspun hills was broadening fast, 
 The blood-red snow-peaks chill'd to a dazzling white 
 
 He turn'd and saw the golden circle at last, 
 Cut by the Eastern height.

 Nelson, in blood-stained robe, behold appear ! 
 The shades are stricken with unwonted fear, 
 And round him crowd the ghosts of men of might. 
 Cries Alexander, riveting his sight, 
 
 " What lustrous mortal thou, that enterest here ? " 
 " 'Tis I who raised from thraldom to her sphere 
 Europe, bowed down, half captive from the fight, 
 Incarnadined with blood I left the wave, 
 A bolt upon the furious Gaul I threw, 
 My country raises trophies o'er my grave ! " 
 On this the Macedonian weeps anew ; 
 He to whom victory vast regions gave, 
 Envies the man who did one race subdue.

 IN the deepening shades of twilight 
 Stood a maiden young and fair, 
 
 Rain-drops gleamed on cheek and forehead, 
 Rain-drops glistened in her hair.

 DOWN THE TRACK 125 
 
 Where the bridge had stood at morning 
 
 Yawned a chasm, deep and black ; 
 Faintly came the distant rumbling 
 
 From the train far down the track. 
 
 Paler grew each marble feature, 
 
 Faster came her frightened breath, 
 Charlie kissed her lips at morning, 
 
 Now was running down to death ! 
 Must she stand and see him perish ? 
 
 Angry waters answer back : 
 Louder comes the distant rumbling 
 
 From the train far down the track. 
 
 At death's door faint hearts grew fearless ; 
 
 Miracles are sometimes wrought, 
 Springing from the heart's devotion 
 
 In the forming of a thought. 
 From her waist she tears her apron, 
 
 Flings her tangled tresses back, 
 Working fast, and praying ever 
 
 For the train far down the track. 
 
 See ! a lurid spark is kindled, 
 
 Right and left she flings the flame, 
 Turns and glides with airy fleetness 
 
 Downward toward the coming train ; 
 Sees afar the red eye gleaming 
 
 Through the shadows still and black : 
 Hark ! a shriek prolonged and deafening 
 
 They have seen her down the track ! 
 
 Onward comes the train now slower, 
 
 But the maiden Where is she ? 
 Flaming torch and flying footsteps 
 
 Fond eyes gaze in vain to see.

 With a white face turned to heaven, 
 
 All the sunny hair thrown back, 
 There they found her, one hand lying 
 
 Crushed and bleeding on the track. 
 
 Eager faces bent above her, 
 
 Wet eyes pitied, kind lips blessed ; 
 But she saw no face save Charlie's 
 
 'Twas for him she saved the rest. 
 Gold they gave her from their bounty ; 
 
 But her sweet lips wandered back 
 To the face whose love will scatter 
 
 Roses all along life's track.

 IT was a sweltering English summer day. The birds 
 chirped in feeble enjoyment of the drowsy heat, the grass- 
 hopper shrilled incessantly from cool and tangled grasses. 
 One lame traveller came toiling up a stiffish slope in the 
 lane, bearing a bundle on his shoulder. Arrived at the 
 top of the slope, the lame traveller sat down in shadow on 
 a smooth table of rock. He was lank in build, and sallow 
 in complexion. His nose and his beard were each long 
 and pointed ; his cheek-bones were prominent, his cheeks 
 were sunken, and his eyes as bright as a hawk's. The 
 seat he had taken was a low one, and his figure being 
 tall and gaunt, his knees were ungracefully prominent. 
 He sat in an attitude of great fatigue, his head drooping, 
 and his arms hanging loose at his sides. After a time he

 shook off this broken look, and began to explore his 
 waistcoat pockets with an aspect of anxiety. A smile 
 crossed his features ; and between finger and thumb he 
 drew out a very little bit of twist tobacco. This he 
 shredded with an enormous pocket-knife, and packed care- 
 fully into the bowl of a well-blacked clay pipe. He then 
 made another search in his waistcoat pockets ; and again 
 he smiled as he drew forth a single lucifer match. 
 
 " I do not think as there was ever anybody in my family 
 as was gifted with miraculous powers. Theer ain't a breath 
 of air stirrin' at this minute; but this is the last lucifer 
 match I have, and I've only got to strike it to raise some 
 gentle zephyr that'll just come round the one corner that 
 ain't guarded and blow it out. Now that's a remarkable 
 fact, and if anybody was to be here, and I was to bet on 
 the zephyr, the atmosphere would lie in dead stillness till 
 this match had burned clean through, and then most 
 likely it'd blow a tornado just to rile me. If this lucifer 
 don't strike, or if it blows out, or the pipe won't draw, I 
 sha'n't see a human creetur for ten mile." Then he rubbed 
 the end of the match gently on a bit of stone, and smiled 
 to see the flame. He gave a pull at his pipe, smiled again, 
 pulled gently till flame and tobacco just kissed each other. 
 Then came disaster. " 'Tain't no use throwin' stones at 
 Destiny, I might ha' been prepared for it. I meant that 
 smoke to do for dinner. Well, Hiram, you've played the 
 prodigal, and I reckon you'll ha' to come down to the 
 swine-husks yet Hello ! Air you hungry ? " 
 
 This query was addressed to a dog, which was coming 
 towards the traveller. The man broke off a very small 
 piece of bread and offered it. " No, you air not hungry, 
 when you air, you'll know better'n turn up your nose at 
 dry bread. And I'll tell you what 'tis, my canine friend, 
 I hope you never may be. If you'd the brains to have the 
 heart, you'd be nigh on cryin' to see a citizen of the Great

 Republic takin' his last meal with a hundred an' fifty mile 
 afore him, and blank starvation at the end of it Coin', 
 are you? Well, good-bye. I suppose my conversation's 
 kind o' dull to a prosperous dog like you." 
 
 When the lame traveller, having finished his scanty meal, 
 came limping down the lane, he caught sight of a figure a 
 hundred yards away, and scanned him with keen eyes. 
 
 " Now, that's a lord o' the sile, I reckon. Looks born 
 to order other folks around while he slides along easy." 
 
 " Good afternoon," said the stranger, in a cheery voice. 
 "Going on to Brierham?" 
 
 "If that's the next town on this road, I'm goin' there." 
 
 " Yes, it's the next town." 
 
 " Can you tell me how far it is ? " 
 
 "About nine miles. If you are willing to earn a few 
 shillings, I will ask you to take a note for me." 
 
 "I guess, I'm game to render any service to anybody 
 who can pay me." 
 
 " Wait a minute, then," and, drawing a note-book from 
 his breast-pocket, he wrote a few lines on one of its pages, 
 tore out the leaf, folded it, and wrote an address upon it. 
 "Ask for Mr Valentine Strange at the Manor House. 
 Anybody will direct you. And this will pay you for your 
 trouble. I've nothing but gold. Well, there you are. 
 You don't earn half a sovereign so easily every day, I 
 suppose ? " 
 
 " If you'll say how much of this I am to keep, I'll hand 
 over the balance at the other end." 
 
 " Oh, keep the lot." 
 
 " Well, I suppose you can afford it. It's the first wind o' 
 fortune as has blowed my way for a pretty square half of 
 eternity, and that's a fact. I can't give you a permanent 
 address to write to just at present ; but if you happen to 
 want a share of it, you've only got to find me, and I'll split 
 my bottom dollar."

 " That's very good of you ; you're an American, I 
 think ? " 
 
 " Yes, sir." 
 
 "There are not many Americans who think it worth 
 their while to try their fortunes in the old country." 
 
 " No, they air a sensible people as a rule." 
 
 "You'll deliver the letter, won't you ? " 
 
 " Wait a minute, mister. You might like to know as you 
 are the man that's turned my fortune. And if ever you get 
 in a real corner, you might do worse than ask Providence 
 to furnish a moment'ry interview with Hiram Search. 
 That's me. I ain't a lot to look at; but if ever you're 
 cornered, you ask to see me." 
 
 They parted, and went their separate ways. Hiram put 
 the coin away, and jerked along until he reached the town 
 and inquired for the Manor House. It was a mile beyond 
 the town, said the man he asked. Hiram groaned in spirit, 
 but buckled loyally to his task and went on. Evening was 
 merging slowly into night as Hiram halted before a grim- 
 looking old house of dark stone. There was not a light 
 visible ; and Hiram searched for the bell-handle in some 
 misgiving lest the place should prove empty. The peal he 
 rang brought an immediate answer. The footman looked 
 down on Hiram Search and his bundle with a glance of 
 swift disdain, and closed the door in his face. Hiram took 
 the bell-handle in his lean fingers and pulled as though 
 he sounded an alarm of fire. The footman returned 
 indignant. "Wotter yer a-makin' that row for?" he 
 demanded. 
 
 " When you require to know what a man wants, it's a 
 roundabout way to shut the door on him. You should 
 find out first, and shut the door after." 
 
 " I can't stand 'eah all night. Wottah yah want?" 
 
 " Young man, your clothes air too many for you. You

 menial ! " 
 
 " Hany hanswer ? " 
 
 " Ask your master, you po-maytum'd slave." 
 
 "Wait there." He made as if to close the door; but 
 the lame traveller thrust in his bundle. " Shet that door 
 again afore you've done my arrand, you poor clothes-hoss, 
 an' I'll ring the bell off the handle." 
 
 " Hoskins," said a voice from the hall, "what's the matter 
 there ? " 
 
 " Pusson with a note, sir." 
 
 "For whom ?" 
 
 " Valentine Strange, Esq.," said Hiram. 
 
 " Come in. Where is the note ? Who sends it ? " 
 
 " Your polite menial has the note." 
 
 Valentine Strange took the letter, opened it, and read it 
 slowly with a puzzled look. Having read it he glanced at 
 Hiram with an inquiring smile. The note was written 
 in English, but the characters were Greek. It ran 
 thus : 
 
 ; DEAR VAL, I have nothing to say, but I wanted to 
 give the queer fish who carries this something to do to 
 excuse charity. Let me know if you receive it. Yours, 
 
 "GERARD LUMBY." 
 
 " Come this way. Where did you get this note ? " 
 " Somewhere 'bout five hundred mile back, countin' by 
 a lame man's measure. You might call it ten." 
 " When did you get it ? " 
 " This afternoon, four hours ago." 
 " You look tired." 
 
 " Appearances are not always deceptive." 
 " Where are you going ? 
 "London."

 " Were you paid for bringing this note ? " 
 
 " I was so." 
 
 " Well, this is a very important document indeed. You 
 have proved a trusty messenger, and you deserve to be 
 rewarded. There's an extra half-crown for you." 
 
 "Look here, mister. If you don't mind, I want to ask 
 a question. Who wrote that note ? " 
 
 " Why do you want to know ? " 
 
 " Wai, the man that wrote that note brought me the first 
 streak of luck I've had sence I landed in this country. 
 Now you've widened the streak not much; but you've 
 widened it, and I'm thankful for it. From this out I'm 
 bound to prosper. Now, I want to know the name of the 
 man that did me this good turn. If it's all the same to 
 you, mister, I should like to know it." 
 
 "There you are," said Strange, laughing. He laid the 
 note on the edge of the billiard-table, and pointed to the 
 signature, which, like the rest of the epistle, was in Greek 
 characters. To his surprise, the gaunt Yankee leaned over 
 it, evinced no dismay or wonder, but spelled it out. 
 
 " Gerard Lumby. Thank you, I sha'n't forget." 
 
 " Ah, you read Greek, do you ? Did you master the 
 contents of this important state document by the way ? " 
 
 " There's your coin, Colonel. Here, you flunkey, let me 
 out of this d'ye hear ? You and your master air a 
 pair." 
 
 And with features flushed and his keen eyes glittering 
 with anger, Hiram Search strode out of the room.

 CORPORAL DICK'S PROMOTION 
 SIR A. CONAN DOYLE 
 
 (From Songs of Action (Smith, Elder & Co.), by special per- 
 mission of the Author) 
 
 THE Eastern day was well-nigh o'er 
 When parched with thirst and travel-sore, 
 Two of Macdonald's flanking corps 
 
 Across the Desert were tramping. 
 They had wandered off from the beaten track 
 And now were wearily harking back, 
 Ever staring round for the signal jack 
 
 That marked their comrades camping. 
 
 The one was Corporal Robert Dick, 
 Bearded and burly, short and thick, 
 Rough of speech and in temper quick, 
 
 A hard-faced old rapscallian. 
 The other, fresh from the barrack square, 
 Was a raw recruit, smooth cheeked and fair, 
 Half-grown half- drilled, with the weedy air 
 
 Of a draft from the home battalion. 
 
 Weary and parched and hunger-torn, 
 They had wandered on from early morn, 
 And the young boy-soldier limped forlorn, 
 
 Now stumbling and now falling. 
 Around the orange and sand-curves lay, 
 Flecked with boulders black or grey, 
 Death-silent, save that far away 
 
 A kite was shrilly calling. 
 A kite ? Was that a kite ? The yell 
 That shrilly rose and faintly fell ? 
 No kite's, and yet the kite knows well

 The long-drawn wild halloo. 
 And right athwart the evening sky 
 The yellow sand-spray spurtled high, 
 And shrill and shriller swelled the cry 
 
 Of "Allah! Allahu!" 
 
 The Corporal peered at the crimson West, 
 
 Hid his pipe in his khaki vest. 
 
 Growled out an oath and onward pressed 
 
 Still glancing over his shoulder. 
 "Bedouins, mate," he curtly said; 
 "We'll find some work for steel and lead, 
 And maybe sleep in a sandy bed, 
 
 Before we're one hour older. 
 
 "But just one flutter before we're done. 
 Stiffen your lips and stand, my son ; 
 We'll take this blooming circus on : 
 
 Ball cartridge ! load. Now steady ! " 
 With a curse and a prayer the two faced round, 
 Dogged and grim they stood their ground, 
 And their breech-blocks snapped with a crisp clear sound 
 
 As the rifles sprang to the "ready." 
 
 Alas for the Emir Alia Khan ! 
 
 A hundred paces before his clan, 
 
 That ebony steed of the prophet's breed 
 
 Is the foal of death and of danger. 
 A sputter of fire, a gasp of pain, 
 A bluish blurr on the yellow plain, 
 The chief was down, and his bridle rein 
 
 Was in the grip of the stranger. 
 
 With the light of hope on his rugged face, 
 The Corporal sprang to the dead man's place,

 One prick with the steel, one thrust with the heel, 
 
 And where was the man to outride him? 
 A grip of his knees, a toss of his rein, 
 He was settling her down to her gallop again, 
 When he stopped, for he heard just one faltering word 
 From the young recruit beside him. 
 
 One faltering word from pal to pal, 
 
 But it found the heart of the Corporal. 
 
 He had sprung to the sand, he had lent him a hand ; 
 
 " Up, mate ! They'll be 'ere in a minute ; 
 Off with you ! No palaver ! Go ! 
 I'll bide be'ind and run this show. 
 Promotion has been cursed slow, 
 
 And this is my chance to win it." 
 
 Into the saddle he thrust him quick, 
 Spurred the black mare with a bayonet prick. 
 Watch her gallop with plunge and with kick 
 
 Away o'er the desert careering. 
 Then he turned with a softened face, 
 And loosened the straps of his cartridge-case, 
 While his thoughts flew back to the dear old place 
 
 In the sunny Hampshire clearing. 
 
 The young boy-private glancing back, 
 Saw the Bedouins' wild attack, 
 And heard the sharp Martini crack. 
 
 But as he gazed, already 
 The fierce fanatic Arab band 
 Was closing in on every hand, 
 Until one tawny swirl of sand 
 
 Concealed them in its eddy. 
 
 A squadron of British horse that night, 
 Galloping hard in the shadowy light ;

 And found the Corporal lying 
 Silent and grim on the trampled sand, 
 His rifle grasped in his stiffened hand, 
 With the warrior pride of one who died 
 
 'Mid the ring of the dead and the dying. 
 
 And still while twilight shadows fall, 
 
 After the evening bugle call, 
 
 In bivouac or in barrack-hall, 
 
 His comrades speak of the Corporal, 
 
 His death and his devotion. 
 And there are some who like to say 
 That perhaps a hidden meaning lay 
 In the words he spoke, and that the day 
 When his rough bold spirit passed away 
 
 Was the day that he won promotion.

 The streets were flooded and the street lamps cast dancing 
 reflections on them. Omnibuses were crowded and cabs 
 those gondolas of London flitted forward, the back- 
 glasses of their lamps shining like fire-flies, green and blue 
 and red, through the mist. 
 
 Excitement was in the air. People smiled as they 
 passed and strangers shook hands and greeted each other. 
 The newsboys, as they rushed past crying each successive

 136 ELOCUTION 
 
 It was a night of national rejoicing, for away on a distant 
 battlefield the pluck of England's sons had won for her a 
 great victory. The bells were pealing, and groups stood 
 in open doorways discussing the news and speculating as 
 to the result. 
 
 Down St Martin's Lane towards Charing Cross came a 
 pitiful figure a man evidently very weak from a recent 
 illness and shaken with a racking cough a thin blue suit 
 buttoned tightly round his neck, no overcoat, and boots 
 that soaked up the moisture like a sponge. 
 
 At the corner of Trafalgar Square he stood shivering for 
 a moment undecided where to go. A woman begged a 
 copper. He did not answer. He mechanically drew his 
 hand from his pocket. He held a sixpence. The woman 
 took it and hurried away. He watched her go, and with 
 her the whole of his worldly possessions. The rain 
 came driving in stinging sheets across the Square, and 
 the man turned to seek shelter under the lee wall on 
 its far side. Thinking only of the shelter he stumbled 
 against the step at the base of Gordon's Statue. The moon 
 burst forth from the driving clouds and threw a strange 
 ghostly radiance round that well-loved head, until it seemed 
 the bronze effigy bore a halo that was heavenly. A sudden 
 change came over the man. A moment since he was a 
 poor shivering piece of London wreckage. Now standing 
 back two or three paces he drew himself up and stood at 
 attention looking up at the figure England loves so well, 
 round which the watery moonbeams played. Two or three 
 minutes passed, the face of the man grew flushed, and then 
 labouring under great excitement he tore open his soaking 
 jacket and took a step nearer his hero. The light glinted 
 on two medals and on the Khedive's Star and clasps that 
 adorned his breast. To his excited fancy it seemed that 
 the Hero of Khartoum his hero smiled on him. 
 Staggering blindly forward he leaned against the pedestal

 of the statue and burst into tears. He strove to give 
 utterance to his rushing thoughts, strove to tell the man 
 whose life he had fought to save that the medals he had 
 won he had never, and would never, part with, sought to 
 tell him of the weary years of illness, misery and wretched- 
 ness but the words would not come, and then a great 
 peace fell on him. 
 
 He was a lad again amongst the Cumberland Hills. He 
 thought of the day he left his village with the Queen's 
 uniform covering his breast, the sorrowful parting from the 
 farm with the old folks dim-eyed and wistful. Then 
 sterner thoughts came of the troopship and the whaleboats 
 on the Nile. 
 
 The weary, weary weeks of labour under a scorching sun. 
 Then that desperate dash across the desert. The fight at 
 Abu-Klea, the maddening thirst of the men as they fought 
 to reach the waters of Gak-dool. He lived them all again, 
 and each scene came back with its awful vividness as he 
 thought of those blind night marches with the ever raging 
 thirst and the cry " Water, water ! " and after all, those 
 fateful words that came, " Too late, too late, Khartoum has 
 fallen." 
 
 He remembered how even the private soldiers cursed 
 and raged and almost mutinied at the news. Then his 
 weary days of fever in the hospital, the kind-eyed nurses 
 as they flitted from one bed to another with hands ever 
 gentle and voices ever soft, of one ah ! 
 
 But a " Hey, my man, you cannot sleep there," in a gruff 
 but kindly voice and a hand laid on his shoulder recalled 
 him to reality and to misery. He rose without a word, 
 and with a last look at the statue he drifted down White- 
 hall. 
 
 The river flowed on dark and mysterious, the lamp 
 reflections on its bosom danced and beckoned, and long 
 ere the dawn, the soldier had touched the outstretched

 hand and answered the welcome smile of the Hero of 
 Khartoum. 
 
 " Death's dreamy voice rings ever on, like a far-off trumpet call. 
 The heroes drop off one by one, and England sees them fall.

 ANON. 
 
 THE Princess was queenly and fair in the face, 
 And she was the last of a royal race. 
 From far and near came her suitors proud, 
 But she looked at none in that goodly crowd. 
 
 Nineteen summers had passed away, 
 And she knew nothing of love's sweet sway ; 
 Nor prince, nor knight, nor gentle squire 
 Could light in her breast the sacred fire. 
 
 " It were best for the people that thou shouldst wed 
 And raise up princes," the greybeards said. 
 But no man moved that heart of stone, 
 And the Princess lived and ruled alone. 
 
 Yet oft to herself she whispered low : 
 
 " A time will come, be time swift or slow, 
 
 When my heart to its master must outward go. 
 
 Never a man have I seen as yet, 
 
 That could fill my heart with love's regret. 
 
 " All men bow in my presence the knee, 
 But he who weds me my king must me ; 
 And him will I serve each hour and day, 
 And own myself conquered by love's sweet sway.

 " For love is worth nor tittle nor jot, 
 If the husband no power to rule has got ! " 
 She sat in her palace one sweet spring day, 
 And idled the afternoon hours away. 
 
 She called to a maiden who lingered there : 
 "Go, fetch me the jester, Dagobert." 
 The jester came with his serious face, 
 And a shadow fell in the sunlit place. 
 
 Mis-shapen and stunted and crabbed was he, 
 As sorry a jester as well could be. 
 His great head fell on his pointed chest, 
 And a grievous hump on his shoulders prest. 
 
 His small eyes gleamed through his shaggy hair 
 
 Such was the jester, Dagobert. 
 
 The Princess beckoned him near her feet, 
 
 But her glance knew nothing of pity sweet. 
 
 " Thou art a man of ready wit, 
 Come, tell me the reason and meaning of it. 
 Oft I have said that no man's power 
 Hath rested on me a single hour, 
 
 " And yet, for three days past, my soul 
 Hath felt the might of a man's control." 
 What sound was that in the perfumed air ? 
 A sigh from the jester, Dagobert. 
 
 " Speak, my Princess, and tell me all, 
 Who holds thy heart at his beck and call ? " 
 " Neither his name nor his race I know, 
 Nor who is he that enthralls me so."

 "Strange, my Princess, thy story seems, 
 Is it some creature of maiden dreams ? " 
 " Nay, but for three nights past my ears 
 Have heard a voice that can move my tears." 
 
 What was it that stirred the silent air ? 
 
 A sigh from the jester, Dagobert. 
 
 " Where, my Princess, was this strange thing ? 
 
 And whence did he come for thy pleasure to sing ? ' 
 
 " Where or whence I little know ; 
 But my heart keeps saying, ' I love him so ! ' 
 Three nights past he has sung, beneath 
 My window of love that will last till death. 
 
 " His voice is the voice of a man so brave, 
 That I would follow him to his grave. 
 He sings of war and of mighty deeds ; 
 And under it all his own love pleads. 
 
 " And I I listen, and long to reply, 
 ' I love thee, I love thee until I die ! ' " 
 What was that in the heavy air ? 
 A groan from the jester, Dagobert. 
 
 " Thou art a man of ready wit, 
 Come, tell me the meaning and reason of it." 
 In the jester's eyes there lurked a flame, 
 And he bit his lip till the red blood came. 
 
 His body shivered, and underneath 
 The unkempt beard he ground his teeth ; 
 And sudden he answered : " A fool's poor wit 
 Can see no meaning or reason in it.

 " Find the meaning thyself, nor try 
 To coax love nonsense from such as I." 
 Over her face flashed the angry blood, 
 And she struck the jester where he stood. 
 
 At the touch of her fingers he shivered again ; 
 But it was not the blow that caused the pain. 
 " Go," she cried, "to thy bells and cap ! 
 What knowest thou of love's sweet hap ? 
 
 " Love is for those that are fair and free, 
 Not for mis-shapen things like thee ! " 
 He shrank away to his chattering ape, 
 A poor, ill-favoured, and fearful shape. 
 
 He leaned his head on his hands, and knew 
 That the cruel words were more than true. 
 And the only sounds in the silent air 
 Were the sighs of the jester, Dagobert. 
 
 The Princess stood at her window that night ; 
 There was no light there but the pale starlight. 
 Far below, in the evening breeze, 
 She heard the rustle of moving trees. 
 
 Sudden a voice through the silence rang ; 
 Of love that will last till death, it sang. 
 And all through the wonderful ebb and flow 
 A voice repeated : " I love you so." 
 
 She leaned through the casement and closed 
 And fancied her soul in paradise. 
 And sudden the song died out, and her ears 
 Caught the sobs of one in a passion of tears !

 The Princess sat on her father's throne, 
 And looked on the halls that were all her own. 
 Each was filled with a moving throng 
 Of courtiers threading their way along ; 
 
 Lord and Lady of high degree 
 Were there, in their pride and their bravery. 
 And the Princess was decked with jewels rare, 
 And she was the fairest woman there. 
 
 She rose from her throne and the voices hushed 
 And her dark eye gleamed and her fair face flushed, 
 And her beauty increased and grew no less, 
 Because of her maidenly bashfulness. 
 
 Then to the greybeards around she said : 
 " Oft ye have told me that I must wed ; 
 But never yet came across my way 
 A man who could hold my heart in sway. 
 
 " Yet now I would have you all to know 
 That my heart to its master must outward go. 
 Four nights now, 'neath my palace wall, 
 I have heard a voice and have felt its thrall. 
 
 " And, oh ! if the singer among you be, 
 Let him come forth and marry me ! " 
 Silence fell on the wondering crowd, 
 As they gazed at the Princess fair and proud, 
 Whose heart by the power of love was bowed. 
 
 But no voice answered from out the throng 
 
 In the tones that had chanted that witching song. 
 
 " Oh, let him speak," she cried ; " for, lo ! 
 
 He has chained my heart, and I love him so ! "

 THE JESTER 143 
 
 She stood with her hand stretched out so fair, 
 And looked for his coming to claim her there. 
 And sudden there rose a strange, fierce cry 
 From the dais behind her " It was I ! " 
 
 And out there stepped from the sheltering chair 
 The humpbacked jester, Dagobert ! 
 Then a voice arose in the wondering hall, 
 That was full of jibe in its mocking call : 
 " Sing us the song that can so enthrall ! " 
 
 And into the midst of the perfumed air, 
 
 Soared the voice of the jester, Dagobert. 
 
 It told of the years of sorrow and pain, 
 
 And the ceaseless thoughts of the scheming brain. 
 
 It told of the love that breathed and burned 
 In the shapeless body by all men spurned ; 
 It told how the heart was brave and true 
 To the love and passion that in it grew. 
 
 And because of its passionate, fierce regret, 
 The eyes of many with tears were wet. 
 It ceased, and the jester raised his face 
 And looked at the Princess of noble race. 
 
 Would she remember his pain and woe 
 
 And come to his side with " I love thee so ? " 
 
 She turned away with a glance of scorn, 
 
 And the hunchback's love died out at its dawn. 
 
 But suddenly springing he caught her hand ; 
 " I was the king that could thee command ! " 
 And for one brief moment of passionate bliss, 
 He pressed her hands with a burning kiss.

 Swords flashed out in the courtier crowd, 
 And the murmurs of hate were fierce and loud. 
 " He dies, the varlet ! Ho, draw him apart ! " 
 But he drove his dagger right through his own heart. 
 
 And ere they could reach him the life was fled 
 From the shapeless body and the shaggy head. 
 Out into the starlight, pure and fair, 
 Passed the soul of the jester, Dagobert. 
 
 AN OLD MAN'S DREAMS 
 ELIZA M. SHERMAN 
 
 IT was the twilight hour. 
 Behind the western hill the sun had sunk, 
 Leaving the evening sky aglow with crimson light. 
 The air is filled with fragance and with sound. 
 High in the tops of shadowy vine-wreathed trees, 
 Grave parent-birds were twittering good-night songs 
 To still their restless brood. 
 
 Across the way 
 
 A noisy little brook made pleasant 
 Music on the summer air, 
 And farther on, the sweet, faint sound 
 Of Whippoorwill Falls rose on the air, and fell 
 Like some sweet chant at vespers. 
 
 The air is heavy 
 
 With the scent of mignonette and rose, 
 And from the beds of flowers the tall 
 White lilies point, like angel fingers, upward, 
 Casting on the air an incense sweet, 
 That brings to mind the old, old story, 
 Of the alabaster box that loving Mary 
 Broke upon the Master's feet.

 AN OLD MAN'S DREAMS 145 
 
 Upon his vine-wreathed porch 
 An old white-headed man sits dreaming 
 Happy, happy dreams of days that are no more ; 
 And listening to the quaint old song 
 With which his daughter lulled her child to rest : 
 
 " Abide with me," she says ; 
 
 "Fast falls the eventide, 
 
 The darkness deepens, 
 
 Lord, with me abide." 
 And as he listens to the sound that fills the 
 Summer air, sweet, dreamy thoughts 
 Of his " lost Youth " come crowding thickly up ; 
 And, for a while, he seems a boy again. 
 
 With feet all bare 
 
 He wades the rippling brook, and with a boyish shout 
 Gathers the violets blue and nodding ferns, 
 That wave a welcome from the other side. 
 
 With those he wreathes 
 
 The sunny head of little Nell, a neighbour's child, 
 Companion of his sorrows and his joys. 
 Sweet, dainty Nell, whose baby life 
 Seemed early linked with his, 
 And whom he loved with all a boy's devotion. 
 
 Long years have flown. 
 
 No longer boy and girl, but man and woman grown, 
 They stand again beside the brook, that murmurs 
 Ever in its course, nor stays for time nor man, 
 And tell the old, old story, 
 And promise to be true till life for them shall end. 
 
 Again the years roll on, 
 And they are old. The frost of age 
 Has touched the once-brown hair, 
 And left it white as are the chaliced lilies. 
 Children, whose rosy lips once claimed

 A father's blessing and a mother's love, 
 Have grown to man's estate, save two 
 Whom God called early home to wait 
 For them in heaven. 
 
 And then the old man thinks 
 How on a night like this, when faint 
 And sweet as half-remembered dreams 
 Old Whippoorwill Falls did murmur soft 
 Its evening psalms, when fragrant lilies 
 Pointed up the way her Christ had gone, 
 God called the wife and mother home, 
 And bade him wait. 
 
 Oh ? why is it so hard for 
 Man to wait ? to sit with folded hands, 
 Apart, amid the busy throng, 
 And hear the buzz and hum of toil around ; 
 To see men reap and bind the golden sheaves 
 Of earthly fruits, while he looks idly on, 
 And knows he may not join, 
 But only wait till God has said " Enough ! " 
 
 And calls him home ? 
 
 And thus the old man dreams, 
 And then awakes ; awakes to hear 
 The sweet old song just dying 
 On the pulsing evening air : 
 
 " When other helpers fail, 
 
 And comforts flee, 
 
 Lord of the helpless, 
 
 Oh, abide with me ! "

 CHRISTMAS EVE IN A BELFRY 
 
 LlTCHFIELD MOSELEY 
 
 WE were a merry party at Merton Grange, Somersetshire, 
 on Christmas Eve I forget the date, but it must be twenty 
 years ago at the very least. Uncle Goodman or Uncle 
 George, as we always called him, was a thorough specimen 
 of an English gentleman of the old school, genial, warm- 
 hearted and hospitable. Indeed, the greatest pleasure of 
 his life seemed to consist in making other people happy. 
 
 I may as well say at once that my name is Willis 
 Trotman ; and at that time I was a rising young barrister, 
 vegetating in grimy chambers in the delightful locality of 
 Verulam Buildings, Gray's Inn. 
 
 Uncle George was a widower, with three daughters. 
 Polly, the youngest, a little, merry-eyed, fair-haired girl of 
 eighteen, was an especial favourite of mine, and delighted 
 in teasing me whenever an opportunity offered. 
 
 " Polly," said I, as we sat down at the end of one of the 
 dances, "how quiet some people are to-night! I'll wager 
 a dozen pairs of gloves I can guess what you're thinking 
 about." 
 
 " Some people are wonderfully clever. Pray, what am I 
 thinking about ? " 
 
 "You're wondering how many times you'll be kissed 
 under the mistletoe to-night." 
 
 " You're an impudent boy, Willis. Whatever made you 
 think of such a thing ? " 
 
 " Your own bright eyes, Polly." 
 
 " If you talk like that, I'll never forgive you." 
 
 "Whew ! how tremendously hot it is, "said Uncle George, 
 wiping his forehead with his handkerchief. "Christmas 
 Eve! Why, I declare it's hot enough for July. Willis,

 may I trouble you to throw open the lawn door a little way, 
 and let us have a breath of fresh air ? " 
 
 I did as I was told, and somehow, on sitting down again, 
 I found Polly by my side. 
 
 " What do you say to a minute or two's turn round the 
 garden, Polly ? " 
 
 " I should like it above all things." 
 
 " Very well. Throw that shawl over your shoulders, and, 
 the next move that takes place, we can slip out un- 
 observed." 
 
 In a short time the opportunity offered, and no one 
 noticed our disappearance. 
 
 " What a delightful night it is," said Polly, as we strolled 
 leisurely down the garden. Look at that lovely moon, isn't 
 it beautiful?" 
 
 " Delightful ! " I replied. " It reminds me of some lines 
 I read somewhere, some time ago, written by somebody or 
 other. Let me see, they're something like this 
 
 ' When the pale orb of Diana shines over the sea, 
 When nature's reposing, reposing, reposing ' 
 
 What an idiot I am ! I forget what comes next ; but I 
 know the line ends with thee, or he, or she, or be, or 
 something." 
 
 " Cousin, you're very poetical to-night ; but when you 
 commence a quotation you ought to be able to finish it. I 
 don't feel at all cold, do you ? " 
 
 " Not at all. Shall we stroll round the old church before 
 we return, Polly ? " 
 
 " I should like to very much. But perhaps we should 
 be missed, and whatever would people say ? " 
 
 " I don't care what anybody says," I replied. " I don't 
 care for anybody or anything but you, dear Polly ! " 
 
 The moon was taking effect. 
 
 "Willis ! don't be so absurd, or I'll go back at once !"

 CHRISTMAS EVE IN A BELFRY 149 
 
 " Don't be angry with me, Polly. It's the moon's fault. 
 The moon is to blame for it all." 
 
 "So I should imagine," she replied coolly. "Sorry that 
 I have been the means of subjecting you to its influence." 
 
 As we passed by, I noticed that the door of the church 
 tower stood ajar. So I opened it a little way and 
 peeped in. 
 
 "Polly," I said, "there's no one here. Wouldn't it be 
 capital fun to run up the belfry steps, and see how the 
 village looks from the top of the tower to-night ? " 
 
 " How delightfully romantic ! What a charming adven- 
 ture for Christmas Eve ! " she exclaimed. 
 
 "Are you sure you'll not be frightened, dear?" 
 " Frightened ? Not a bit. Come along, Willis." 
 And we began to ascend the tower. Half way up, we 
 came to an iron-bound door, which, luckily for us, was also 
 open. 
 
 " I say, Willis ! Whatever would people think of us if 
 they could see us now ? " 
 
 Flap ! flap ! flap ! Tu-whoo ! tu-whoo ! tu-whoo ! 
 And a large owl flew past us, evidently disturbed by our 
 intrusion. 
 
 "Oh, Willis, whatever was that? " she said, seizing me by 
 the arm. 
 
 "Only an owl, dear." 
 
 " Is that all ? How the horrid thing frightened me ! " 
 A few steps more and we had reached the summit, and 
 were standing just beneath the bells. 
 
 "Oh, Willis, Willis ! I had no idea that it was half so 
 beautiful. Look at the lights in the village look at the 
 Grange look at the shadows on the blinds ! I wonder if 
 they have missed us yet." 
 
 Just then there came a sudden gust of wind, followed by 
 a loud bang. 
 
 " Whatever was that, Willis ? "

 I guessed its meaning immediately, and hurried down the 
 stairs, to find that the middle door had blown to, and that 
 we were securely fastened in. There we were shut up in 
 the belfry of an old Norman church tower just before mid- 
 night on Christmas Eve. 
 
 " Oh, dear ! oh, dear ! what are we to do now ! What- 
 ever will become of us ! " 
 
 " Be calm, dearest, compose yourself. Our case is not 
 utterly hopeless after all. I have a box of fuzees in my 
 pocket. I'll light them one by one, and throw out signals 
 of distress." 
 
 " But there's nobody about to see them. Suppose we have 
 to stay here all night ! It's not twelve o'clock yet, and it 
 will be eight hours before daylight." 
 
 " Polly ! " I said quietly. 
 
 " Oh, don't waste time talking to me, if you please. Oh, 
 why did you bring me up here ? Oh, whatever will become 
 of us ? Oh, Willis, Willis, do do something ! Can't you 
 tear our pocket handkerchiefs into strips, and tie the pieces 
 together, and let yourself down ? I'm sure if I were a man 
 I would." 
 
 " Never mind, dearest, I'll not desert you ; at least, we'll 
 die together." 
 
 " A-tishyu ! a-tishyu ! I'm catching an awful cold, Willis ! 
 I can feel it coming on," she said, after a pause. 
 
 "Here's a nice warm corner," I answered. "Crouch 
 down in this recess, while I reconnoitre. Take the fuzees, 
 light them one by one, and you can warm your hands by 
 them," I added, tying my white handkerchief over her head 
 as I spoke. 
 
 " Don't let me rob you, Willis. I'm sure you want it 
 more than I do. I have my shawl." 
 
 " Never mind me, Polly. I'm more used to this sort of 
 thing than you are." 
 
 " But listen ! Don't you hear voices ? "

 CHRISTMAS EVE IN A BELFRY 151 
 
 " Of course I do. Oh, how fortunate for us ! It's the 
 bell-ringers ! Don't you know it's the custom at Merton to 
 ring the bells on Christmas Eve ? " 
 
 " Thank goodness ! then we shall soon be delivered from 
 our captivity," I said. 
 
 As I spoke, the bells began to swing slowly backwards 
 and forwards ding, dong ! ding, dong ! ding, dong ! I 
 could hear the voices of the bell-ringers beneath, so I ran 
 down the steps, and shouted loudly. 
 
 " Hallo, there ! hallo ! Giles Stubbins. Hallo, there ! " 
 "Mussy on us! wa-at be that?" I heard the old man 
 ask his companion. " Didn't ye hear zoomat ? " 
 
 "Noa, I heerd nought," was the reply; and again I 
 shouted and rattled at the door. 
 
 "Didn't ye hear nought then, Daavid?" asked Stubbins. 
 " Aye, did I ! I heard a screeching loike. Giles ! Giles ! 
 tak' my word for 'un, it be a ghoast ! Coom awaay, man, 
 coom awaay ! I've seen 'un I've seen 'un ! " 
 " Seen whaat ? " 
 
 " Why, the ghoast ! I seed 'un put 'un's head out o' 
 belfry window just now, all whoite loike ! I never seed 
 nought so horrible afore ! There be one on 'em now ! " 
 
 This was one of the fuzees ; and he had evidently seen 
 poor Polly in her white dress, with my handkerchief over 
 her head. 
 
 " Doan't run away, Daavid, wi'out me ! Doan't leave me 
 here alone, ye coward doan't ! " cried Giles ; and away 
 trotted the two old men towards the village, leaving their 
 lanterns behind them, and shouting loudly, "A ghoast! a 
 ghoast ! a ghoast ! " 
 
 "We're in a worse mess now than ever, Polly; those two 
 old idiots have taken you for a ghost, and they'll raise the 
 village." 
 
 " Oh, dear ! What will become of us ? What are we to 
 do?"

 " Face it out bravely," I said ; as, seizing a rope, I began 
 to ring one of the bells. Ding, dong ! ding, dong ! ding, 
 dong! 
 
 " Whatever are you doing, Willis ? " 
 
 "Sounding the tocsin, Polly ringing the alarm bell." 
 
 " Oh, Willis ! what a disturbance we are making ! And 
 what will papa say ? This adventure will be the talk of the 
 village for years, and I shall be ashamed to show my face 
 in it again." 
 
 "Uncle George will only laugh at the joke," I rejoined; 
 " and as to being ashamed to show your face in the village, 
 come to London with me, and be my own dear little wife ! 
 Polly ! I adore you, Polly ! I am your devoted slave. 
 One little word from you will make me the happiest of 
 men." 
 
 "Sir, I am ashamed of you! This is not the time for 
 such nonsense." 
 
 "Polly, do you consider my love nonsense? Listen to 
 me for a moment." 
 
 " Hark ! " she cried. 
 
 There was a roar of many voices beneath, and, looking 
 down, I saw a crowd of villagers armed with rakes, hoes, 
 shovels, spades and pitchforks. Presently I heard the 
 voice of Uncle George say, 
 
 " A ghost, eh ? Don't believe a word of it. A sovereign 
 to the first man who goes up the belfry." 
 
 " I doan't want your money, zquire ; and I bean't 
 vrightened o' ghoasts zo here goes," said Abraham White, 
 one of Uncle George's men. 
 
 "Come along, my lads, it's all fancy!" cried Uncle 
 George. " It's my belief there's nothing there. 
 
 So in order to convince him I gave the rope another 
 vigorous pull. 
 
 " Whew ! That's strange ! That bell didn't ring itself. 
 Follow me, lads."

 CHRISTMAS EVE IN A BELFRY 153 
 
 Then I heard him mount the steps, and rattle the wooden 
 door. 
 
 " Who's there ? " he shouted. 
 
 Something prompted me to have a joke at his expense ; 
 so, in reply, I gave a long, loud howl, something between a 
 yell and a shriek an accomplishment I had learned at 
 school. Away scudded Uncle George, five steps at a time, 
 followed by his supporters. 
 
 "By Jove! no mortal made that sound, I'll wager," I 
 heard him say ; and again I tugged at the bell. Ding, 
 dong ! ding, dong ! ding, dong ! 
 
 " Ten pounds to the man who breaks open the door ! " 
 said Uncle George. 
 
 "Gie's us hold o' your zhovel, Jacob. Ghoast or no 
 ghoast, I'll soon have 'un out." 
 
 And immediately afterwards the door was attacked with 
 heavy blows by the besiegers. 
 
 Somewhat fearful of the result, I whispered to Polly 
 " Retire upstairs a few steps, while I capitulate." Seeing 
 that she was out of danger, I shouted " Hallo there ! 
 What are you making all that noise about, eh ? " 
 
 "Why, that's Willis's voice ! " exclaimed Uncle George. 
 
 " Of course it is, Uncle ; and there's somebody else here 
 as well." 
 
 The door at this moment gave way, discovering Polly and 
 myself. 
 
 " Oh, papa, dear, don't be angry ! " she cried. 
 
 " Angry ! What have I got to be angry for, eh ? But 
 how on earth did you get up there? Come, tell me all 
 about it. Why, what's that you're wrapped up in? Ha, 
 ha, ha ! You're a beauty now, and no mistake ! " 
 
 Poor Polly certainly cut rather a queer figure, enveloped 
 in a dirty old sack that we had discovered in a corner of the 
 belfry; and her hands, face and dress were smothered 
 with thick black dust.

 but I really can't help it. Bless me, how cold you are ! 
 Come, wrap yourself up in my coat, and we'll go indoors at 
 once." 
 
 In a few minutes I had explained the whole affair to 
 Uncle George's satisfaction ; and I never heard a man laugh 
 more heartily. 
 
 I repeated my offer to Polly the very next day, and what 
 do you think was her reply ? 
 
 " I'll give you your answer, sir, the next time we are 
 locked up together on Christmas Eve in a belfry ! "

 TRITEMIUS of Herbipolis, one day, 
 While kneeling at the altar's foot to pray, 
 Alone with God, as was his pious choice, 
 Heard from without a miserable voice 
 A sound which seemed of all sad things to tell, 
 As of a lost soul crying out of hell. 
 Thereat the Abbot paused ; the chain whereby 
 His thoughts went upward broken by that cry; 
 And, looking from the casement, saw below 
 A wretched woman, with grey hair aflow, 
 And withered hands held up to him, who cried 
 For alms as one who might not be denied. 
 
 She cried, " For the dear love of Him who gave 
 His life for ours, my child from bondage save, 
 My beautiful, brave first-born, chained with slaves

 Lap the white walls of Tunis ! " " What I can 
 I give," Tritemius said, " my prayers." "O man 
 Of God ! " she cried, for grief had made her bold, 
 " Mock me not thus ; I ask not prayers but gold. 
 Words will not serve me, alms alone suffice ; 
 Even while I speak perchance my first-born dies." 
 
 " Woman," Tritemius answered, " from our door 
 
 None go unfed ; hence are we always poor, 
 
 A single soldo is our only store, 
 
 Thou hast our prayers ; what can we give thee more ? " 
 
 "Give me," she said, "the silver candlesticks 
 On either side of the great crucifix ; 
 God well may spare them on his errands sped, 
 Or he can give you golden ones instead." 
 
 Then spake Tritemius : " Even as thy word, 
 
 Woman, so be it ! (Our most gracious Lord, 
 
 Who loveth mercy more than sacrifice, 
 
 Pardon me if a human soul I prize 
 
 Above the gifts upon his altar piled !) 
 
 Take what thou asketh, and redeem thy child." 
 
 But his hand trembled as the holy alms 
 He placed within the beggar's eager palms, 
 And as she vanished down the linden shade, 
 He bowed his head and for forgiveness prayed. 
 So the day passed, and when the twilight came 
 He woke to find the chapel all aflame, 
 And, dumb with grateful wonder, to behold 
 Upon the altar, candlesticks of gold !

 Know'd what he's done for the village, toiled for us night

 Wi' fidgets an' grumbles for thanks, an' little to get for pay. 
 So stop your mutters, Jem Brown, there ; don't hark to

 Snow, snow, snow, driftin' an' deep an' white ; 
 Snow on the Battery Woods, an' all over Weston Down, 
 Right along Portbury Valley away t'ward Bristol town. 
 I were sittin' alone in the tallet, the bosses were munchin'

 Tired, like I, poor brutes, we'd been out all day in the snow.

 'Twere a sorrowful Christmas eve, in the old house there 
 
 that night, 
 
 Never a branch o' holly nor a sound o' laughter light ; 
 No one there in the hall, where all on us used to go 
 To give 'em our Christmas wishes an' hang up the mistletoe. 
 The house were all dumb an' dark, the children they 
 
 couldn't play, 
 
 For their little blue-eyed sister were dyin', you see, that day, 
 Master's bonniest darlin', down like a broken rose, 
 An' when she were taken from him, what 'ud he do, God 
 
 knows. 
 They thought she were dyin' that mornin' yet Master 
 
 were bound to go, 
 Bound to leave little Missie, though he loved her, loved 
 
 her so. 
 
 But he were the parish doctor, an' he'd got his work to do, 
 An' he know'd it an' did it, God bless him ! though it tore 
 
 his heart in two. 
 All day long through the village from house to house he 
 
 passed, 
 For that were the terrible winter, an' the folks were dyin' 
 
 fast; 
 
 Went wi' his skilful hand and his comfortin' voice and smile, 
 While at home his blue-eyed darlin' lay dyin' all the while. 
 An' I watched him when he comes in, wi' his face so stern 
 
 and white, 
 Never a word he said, for he knew 'twas her last long 
 
 night. 
 An' I prayed for our little Missie, for I thought that God, 
 
 mebbe, 
 
 Would hear for the sake o' Master, if not for the likes o' me. 
 An' I made me a bed in the taller, in a bundle o' straw 
 
 and hay, 
 For I couldn't go home that night, she might die while

 But I hadn't been dozin' or sleepin' nor more nor an hour 
 
 or so, 
 
 When I hears the Master callin', down in the yard below : 
 " Robbins ! put to the horses ! " I thought I was dreamin' 
 
 then ; 
 
 I listened " Robbins ! Robbins ! " I heard him callin' agen. 
 An' down I goes in a minit, an' there he stood in the way, 
 Wi' Norman's lad wi' a lantern, as had come from Weston 
 
 Bay. 
 We harnessed the hosses ; he helped me, but never a word 
 
 he said, 
 His hands were tremblin', I felt 'em, but his face were 
 
 like the dead. 
 " Where be you goin', sir ? " I asked him, for I couldn't 
 
 believe it still ; 
 " Why can't they wait till the mornin', wi' poor little Missie 
 
 so ill ? 
 Don't leave her, sir, don't, I tell 'ee you'll never see her 
 
 no more." 
 " Quick ! Be quick ! " he whispered, " there's a ship run 
 
 aground at the Nore ! " 
 I knew what that meant in a minit, as I heard the wind 
 
 a-blow, 
 An' I thought o' the crazy vessel driftin' through wave an' 
 
 snow, 
 Till I seemed to see her strikin' an' to hear the breakers' 
 
 roar, 
 
 As they dashed the half-dead bodies up on that open shore ; 
 An' how 'ud the fishermen help 'em ? What 'ud they 
 
 know to do 
 For the lives o' these poor creatures, drippin' an' stark an' 
 
 blue? 
 
 They wanted my Master, I knew it, wanted the Doctor's aid ; 
 But what were twenty strangers to the life o' his little 
 
 maid?

 An' I begged him not to leave her. " Mebbe she'll rally," 
 
 said I, 
 
 " You'd know what to do to save her if you was only by." 
 " Robbins," he answered hoarsely, " we're all in God's 
 
 hands to-day ; 
 There's a wreck at the Nore, I tell you ; take hold o' the 
 
 reins, I say." 
 " Master, forgi'e me," I muttered, " 'twas all o' my foolish 
 
 heart, 
 
 But let me see little Missie just once afore we start, 
 An' I'll go to the end o' the world, wherever you wants 
 
 to go, 
 For God will send an angel to watch in your place, I trow." 
 
 He left the boy wi' the hosses ; he opened the old hall door, 
 An' softly we went together across the silent floor ; 
 There were her little hat ; her spade an' her empty shoes, 
 I should never clean 'em no more for little Missie to use ; 
 There were the stick I'd cut her, and the hoop as she used 
 
 to bowl 
 
 Over the borders to plague me, sweet little saucy soul ; 
 " Never no more," I said it, as we went upstairs in the 
 
 gloom, 
 
 Past all the closed doors, and came to her quiet room ; 
 " Ntver no more," I knew it, as I saw her where she lay, 
 Wi' her pretty blue eyes closin' an' her gold hair cut away ; 
 An' Missus down on her knees wi' her arms around her 
 
 tight, 
 
 As if she could not let her go on such a bitter night. 
 An' I kissed little Missie's forehead, they didn't amind, not 
 
 they, 
 
 An' Missus gave me her hand, she hadn't no word to say, 
 But she looked in Master's eyes as if askin' him, " Must 
 
 you go ? " 
 God, I'd ha' given my life could I only ha' answered " No."

 Then as he stooped o'er the child, she opened her blue 
 
 eyes wide. 
 "Where are you goin', daddy? Why won't you stay?" 
 
 she cried. 
 But he tore himself out o' her arms wi' a groan o' anguish 
 
 wild. 
 
 An' he left the dear wife watchin' alone by their dyin' child. 
 He knew that his skill was useless, that her he couldn't save, 
 But he thought o' those poor lost creatures out in the wind 
 
 an' wave ; 
 
 He saw where his duty called him, an' went wi'out stint or stay 
 To do what he could for others 'tis allus a doctor's way ! 
 An' down through the dark we stumbled an' out o' the 
 
 open door, 
 An' I said in my heart " Little Missie will never be ours 
 
 no more." 
 
 But up to the box I sprang, an' away like mad we sped, 
 An* ever the sea kep' boomin' a song o' the wrecked an' 
 
 dead; 
 
 Over the downs we galloped, an' louder the breakers' roar 
 Seemed to be callin', callin', "A ship's run aground at the 
 
 Nore ! " 
 
 While another voice was moanin', all through our bitter ride, 
 "Where are you goin' to, daddy ? Why won't you stay?" 
 
 it cried. 
 
 There ! there's no call to tell 'ee all as we saw that night, 
 The poor stark frozen bodies, an' the fishermen dazed an' 
 
 white, 
 
 An' how he worked wi' us all, wi' his cheery voice and will, 
 Till we'd carried 'em up the gully to Norman's farm on the 
 
 hill; 
 Worked till the sweat rolled down in spite o' the keen 
 
 night air, 
 As though he hadn't a sorrow eatin' his own heart there ;

 Worked at those cold, still limbs, wi' his strong and tender 
 
 hands, 
 
 Till the life-blood stirred an' quivered out o' its icy bands ; 
 Worked till the still breasts trembled wi' deep an' strugglin' 
 
 breath, 
 An' slowly their flutterin' lives came back from the jaws o' 
 
 death. 
 Then, when the day were breakin', an' we hadn't no more 
 
 to do, 
 
 We turned the hosses home'ards wi' never a word we two. 
 I wanted to speak to him then, but I hadn't the heart to 
 
 speak, 
 For I saw the tears a-rollin' down my dear Master's 
 
 cheek. 
 
 He saw where the sun were shinin' across the valley below, 
 Right on the old house gables, makin' 'em all aglow, 
 Over the roofs and chimneys, but brightest it seemed to 
 
 play 
 
 On the east'ard corner window, where little Missie lay. 
 " Quick, Robbins, quick ! " he whispered ; an' I think the 
 
 hosses knew 
 
 How he sat wi' his heart a-breakin' as over the snow we flew; 
 Thud ! thud ! thud ! rattlin' down the hill, 
 Roun' by the old lodge corner, faster an' faster still ; 
 Faster ; like mad they galloped, an' in at the gate we spun 
 God ! what was that at the window ? Was that little 
 
 Missie gone? 
 Was it her spirit fled forth? An' could not his darlin' 
 
 wait? 
 Callin' for daddy, daddy, an' had we come back too 
 
 late? 
 In through the door he rushed wi' his tear-stained face 
 
 ascare, 
 An' then like one in a dream I followed him up the 
 
 stair.

 But I stopped for her door were open, an' there by her

 dead? 
 I crept a bit closer God bless her ! I heard her gentle

 An' I knew she were sleepin' sweetly, but not the sleep of

 They told me all as had happened they scarce could

 An' suddenly Missie looked up, and touched her mother's

 An' then it seemed she grew quiet, an' laid down her 
 
 pretty head, 
 
 Drawin' her mammy's hand into her cosy bed. 
 And thus, when the dawn was breakin', she fell to a sleep

 So calm an' still an' peaceful, they knew that the worst was

 Knew what he did an' suffered, an' all as he bravely bore ; 
 An' if ever he sends an angel down to this earth below 
 To help us to do our duty, to cheer us in want or woe,

 AUNT AGATHA ANN 
 MARY E. MANNERS 
 
 (From Aunt Agatha Ann and Other Poems (James Clarke 
 & Co.) by special permission of the Authoress) 
 
 AUNT AGATHA ANN was a little old maid, 
 
 Of mice and black-beetles extremely afraid. 
 
 She was gentle, and patient, and always polite, 
 
 She ne'er had a " mission " nor dreamed of a " right " ; 
 
 In the face of which facts it is needless to state 
 
 That Aunt Agatha Ann wasn't quite " up to date." 
 
 She hadn't the faintest desire for a vote, 
 
 She read very little but more than she wrote. 
 
 So I'm greatly surprised that no well-informed man 
 
 Ever wanted to marry Aunt Agatha Ann. 
 
 In these days of advance 
 
 When we all look askance 
 At the girl whose sole aim is to flirt and to dance, 
 
 And express our surprise 
 
 When a pair of blue eyes 
 From the azure in hose, carries off the rich prize,

 We are apt to look back 
 On our grandmother's track 
 With a glance of contempt for those times dark and 
 
 black ; 
 
 And are wont to declare 
 With superior air 
 
 That man in past ages didn't " play fair," 
 But of fun and amusement took more than his share. 
 For, should marriage fail, 
 Life henceforth was stale, 
 And tedious, and dull as an often-told tale. 
 Yet I do not believe that Aunt Agatha Ann 
 Greatly troubled or grieved for that recusant Man ! 
 
 For nieces and nephews, nearly a score, 
 
 Kept her neat little house in a state of uproar ; 
 
 They ruled o'er her house, and they ruled o'er her 
 heart ; 
 
 In her life, and her love, each one had a part ; 
 She was worshipped and teased by the whole of the clan ; 
 A sweet maiden aunt was Miss Agatha Ann ! 
 
 Did Maud catch the measles, or Clara the croup ; 
 
 Did Tom break his arm, or Harry his hoop ; 
 
 Did Jack fall in love, or Dick in disgrace ; 
 
 Did Nell lose her heart, or Percy his place ; 
 'Twas no matter what. When the trouble began 
 Mamma " dropped a line " to Aunt Agatha Ann. 
 
 In response to the call 
 
 (With no pause at all) 
 Aunt Ann came, with comfort for great and for small. 
 
 Not one was left out ; 
 
 But there isn't a doubt 
 
 That the trouble on which her best sympathies fell 
 Was the loss which had happened to darling Niece Nell.

 AUNT AGATHA ANN 165 
 
 For though Agatha Ann no lover had known, 
 In the forty odd years which had over her flown, 
 Yet a hundred young people had told her their cares ; 
 She was quite a " past-mistress " in Cupid's affairs. 
 And was never so much at her ease and her glory 
 As when right in the midst of a thrilling love story ! 
 
 If the butcher too long at her door chanced to stay, 
 Dear Auntie, benignly, would look the wrong way ; 
 " Poor Auntie," thought Nell, " she is dull, I'm afraid, 
 It's a terrible thing to become an old maid ! 
 
 There'll be weeping and wailing throughout the whole clan, 
 
 But I'm going to marry Aunt Agatha Ann." 
 
 In this state of mind Nellie went to a ball ; 
 Her partner was rosy, cherubic and small ; 
 By profession a banker, by name Peter Craik 
 (She looked 'at him closely for Auntie's dear sake) ; 
 A charming old gentleman (fifty at least), 
 And Nellie's respect for him hourly increased ; 
 As she said to herself, " He's a nice little man, 
 Why shouldn't he marry Aunt Agatha Ann ? " 
 
 'Twas a morning in May 
 And the meadows were gay, 
 The sweet little lambkins were frisking at play, 
 And dear little dicky-birds singing all day, 
 Though innocent rustics, in tatter'd array, 
 Were making strange noises to scare them away, 
 When Peter set forth, without further delay, 
 On a call which he'd long been intending to pay 
 Upon Nell, who with Auntie was making a stay ; 
 
 While the name which, to music, through all his thoughts 
 ran 
 
 Sounded much more like " Ellen " than "Agatha Ann " !

 His waistcoat was white, and his necktie was neat, 
 He'd a flow'r in his coat, patent shoes on his feet ; 
 And the neighbours all said, " He's a well-to-do man, 
 And he's surely come courting Miss Agatha Ann ! " 
 
 Now Nell at the window was standing, 'tis clear, 
 And descried the old gentleman ere he drew near ; 
 Up the stairs, in three bounds, she immediately ran, 
 And thus, without preface, all breathless, began : 
 " Mr Craik's come to call, and he's such a nice man, 
 Let's ask him to dinner, Aunt Agatha Ann ! " 
 
 " My dear," cried Auntie, in dismay, 
 " I really don't know what to say. 
 Because, you see, on washing day 
 We have no pudding. 
 
 " One suet dumpling we have got, 
 Already boiling in the pot, 
 But that, you know, my child, is not 
 A proper pudding ! " 
 
 " Nay, Auntie mine," cried laughing Nell, 
 " Your dumpling, sure, will do quite well, 
 The difference he ne'er will tell, 
 Just call it pudding." 
 
 To this Aunt Agatha agreed 
 (She always did as Nell decreed) ; 
 She likewise donned, at Nell's behest, 
 Her cap and gown of " Sunday best," 
 Then went down to receive her guest; 
 Within whose head a maxim sage, 
 Repeated oft from youth to age,

 AUNT AGATHA ANN 167 
 
 Was running like a solemn chant : 
 "To win the niece, first gain the aunt." 
 On the strength of which motto the wise little man 
 Was more than polite to Aunt Agatha Ann ! 
 
 Aunt Ann's request that he would share 
 Her own and Nellie's homely fare, 
 Accepted was, with courteous air. 
 
 Thought Nell to herself, " Hurrah for my plan ! 
 
 He's falling in love with Aunt Agatha Ann." 
 
 But all the time they were at meat 
 Aunt Ann, for worry, scarce could eat, 
 While to herself she did repeat : 
 
 " Not dumpling pudding." 
 
 But now she saw the die was cast ; 
 For Jane, to crown the neat repast, 
 Upon the board had placed, at last, 
 The dumpling-pudding. 
 
 Aunt Ann, from nervous terror freed, 
 Thought it looked very well indeed ; 
 Nor longer feared her guest would heed 
 The lack of pudding. 
 
 Then, all unconscious of mistake, 
 She, smiling, said to Peter Craik : 
 "Pray, Mr DUMPLING, will you take 
 A piece of pudding ? " 
 
 Plump little Peter looked irate ; 
 The term was too appropriate ; 
 And grave decorum scarce held out 
 Against his look of pain and doubt.

 A titter first from Nell began ; 
 Then Jane, the housemaid, turned and ran, 
 While quite aghast sat poor Aunt Ann. 
 Then Peter, feeling in the way, 
 Took up his hat, and said "Good-day." 
 And never again did that nice little man 
 Come to call on Niece Nell and Aunt Agatha Ann ! 
 
 THE WANDERER'S RETURN 
 JOHN LAWRENCE 
 
 FROM lands where the sun burns fiercely and red, 
 O'er the barren wastes of the desert sands ; 
 From climes where the bloom of his youth was shed 
 The wanderer returns to his fatherland. 
 He has entered his native village street 
 Each step of the ground's a familiar track, 
 Say ! who of his friends will be first to greet 
 And welcome the long-lost wanderer back ? 
 Though tanned by the suns of an Eastern clime 
 And changed by the shadowy hand of time ; 
 Though years have elapsed, is the wanderer forgot ? 
 Will the friends of his boyhood know him not ? 
 
 In the lowly porch of a cottage door 
 
 Stands the bosom friend of his early years, 
 
 They had sported together in days before 
 
 And parted at last in sorrow and tears. 
 
 " Good evening, friend," was the wanderer's cry, 
 
 In the cheerful tones of another day ;

 THE WANDERER'S RETURN 169 
 
 " Good evening, friend," was the cold reply, 
 And the wanderer turned unheeded away ; 
 For tanned by the suns of an Eastern clime, 
 And changed by the shadowy hand of time ; 
 Long years had elapsed and the wanderer's forgot, 
 And the friend of his boyhood knew him not. 
 
 In the evening calm, singing soft and low, 
 A maiden reclines on a flowery slope, 
 She was the betrothed one of long ago, 
 The pride of his youth and his manhood's hope. 
 " God bless thee, maiden," he lowly cried, 
 While his manly voice with emotion shook ; 
 She lifted her eyes ; and the wanderer sighed, 
 For she only returned him a stranger's look. 
 For tanned by the suns of an Eastern clime, 
 And changed by the shadowy hand of time ; 
 Though ne'er through the lapse of years forgot, 
 The betrothed of his boyhood knew him not. 
 
 He approaches his home on the garden gate, 
 Leaned she who had smoothed his infant brow, 
 She had long lost sight of the wanderer's fate, 
 Oh, say ! will his mother not know him now ? 
 He is passing on with a like salute 
 When his quivering voice through her bosom runs 
 There's a wistful gaze and a moment of doubt 
 And the joyous shout of " My son, my son ! " 
 For though tanned by the suns of an Eastern clime, 
 And changed by the shadowy hand of time, 
 What change could a long-lost child disguise 
 From the fond deep gaze of a mother's eyes ?

 LONG as the fair old city stands, the glory of the North, 
 Long as " King Arthur's Seat " o'erlooks the flashing of the 
 
 Forth ; 
 
 Long as o'er lovely Edinbro' queens high her castled hold, 
 Of Moray and his Thirty shall the gallant tale be told. 
 
 St Andrew's Cross was gleaming from many a taken wall, 
 As Highland isle and Lowland glen rose to the Bruce's 
 
 call; 
 But from Stirling and from Edinbro', in firm defiance 
 
 still, 
 The English Lion flaunted free and told her Sovereign's 
 
 will. 
 
 Cold in his noble Abbey lay he whose sun had set 
 In clouds of stormy presage the great Plantagenet ; 
 'Mid favourites and fooleries, the weakly sapling lost 
 All that the mighty oak had won won at such bitter 
 
 cost. 
 But still King Edward's standard from the Castle floated 
 
 gay, 
 
 And still the rock impregnable held Bruce's best at bay, 
 To loyal threat and loyal strength laughed frank defiance 
 
 down, 
 Where Moray's baffled legions camped about the subject 
 
 town.

 A soldier sought the warrior Earl, whose ready ear and 
 wit 
 
 Caught every rumour as it flew, and took the heart 
 from it ) 
 
 " I have scaled the rock full oft," he said, " in boyish fears 
 despite ; 
 
 Who is there, that for Bruce's sake, will try my path to-

 " O ay the road is perilous, craves wary grasp and 
 
 tread, 
 And once a sentinel look down, by Mary, we were

 But the moon is at her birth, I wot, the clouds heap in the 
 
 west ; 
 To dare and die to dare and win for Scotland which

 " Right art thou," fiery Moray said, and to his soldiers 
 
 spoke, 
 And as they heard an eager cry from every squadron 
 
 broke ; 
 Full many a stalwart trooper felt crossed hope was hard to 
 
 bear, 
 As Randolph chose his Thirty from the host of heroes 
 
 there. 
 
 The moon hung dim and haloed above the tossing 
 
 Firth, 
 The wind swept with a muffled moan across the frost-bound 
 
 earth; 
 And from the driving wrack of clouds the light gleamed 
 
 faint and far, 
 As in black robes the Thirty met round Moray's silver 
 
 star.

 High up in Edinbro' Castle, secure the English slept, 
 Their dreary rounds the sentinels in careful order stept ; 
 And creeping, struggling upwards, nerves, sinews all astrain, 
 Clomb Randolph and his Thirty, their glorious prize to 
 gain. 
 
 " Below there, ho ! I see you," a soldier cried in jest ; 
 I trow the throbbing pulses froze in every warrior breast ; 
 Yet nor stir nor cry betokened their deadly peril when 
 The loosened crag came bounding down, 'mid Moray and 
 his men. 
 
 Then rose the cry of wild surprise, of desperate darkling 
 
 fight, 
 As, like ghosts, the bold invaders sprung upon that guarded 
 
 height. 
 
 Brief was the furious struggle, as, startled from their rest, 
 Unarmed, amazed, the English met each fierce unbidden 
 
 guest. 
 
 And when the lingering morning broke upon the Castle 
 
 Rock, 
 The ruddy Lion ramped no more, the Scottish breeze to

 And when King Robert to his feast bid the captains of his 
 
 host, 
 "To Moray and his Thirty" he pledged the crowning

 To him who in the love of Nature holds 
 Communion with her visible forms, she speaks 
 A various language ; for his gayer hours 
 She has a voice of gladness, and a smile 
 And eloquence of beauty, and she glides 
 Into his darker musings, with a mild 
 And healing sympathy, that steals away 
 Their sharpness, ere he is aware. When thoughts 
 Of the last bitter hour come like a blight 
 Over thy spirit, and sad images 
 Of the stern agony, and shroud, and pall, 
 And breathless darkness, and the narrow house, 
 Make thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart ; 
 Go forth, under the open sky, and list 
 To Nature's teachings, while from all around 
 Earth and her waters, and the depths of air 
 Comes a still voice Yet a few days, and thee 
 The all-beholding sun shall see no more 
 In all his course ; nor yet in the cold ground, 
 Where thy pale form was laid, with many tears, 
 Nor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist 
 Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim 
 Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again, 
 And, lost each human trace, surrendering up 
 Thine individual being, shall thou go 
 To mix for ever with the elements, 
 To be a brother to the insensible rock 
 And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain 
 Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak 
 Shall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mould.

 Yet not to thine eternal resting-place 
 
 Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish 
 
 Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down 
 
 With patriarchs of the infant world with kings,

 Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past, 
 
 All in one mighty sepulchre. The hills 
 
 Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun, the vales 
 
 Stretching in pensive quietness between ; 
 
 The venerable woods rivers that move 
 
 In majesty, and the complaining brooks 
 
 That make the meadows green ; and, poured round all, 
 
 Old Ocean's grey and melancholy waste, 
 
 Are but the solemn decorations all 
 
 Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun, 
 
 The planets, all the infinite host of heaven, 
 
 Are shining on the sad abodes of death, 
 
 Through the still lapse of ages. All that tread 
 
 The globe are but a handful to the tribes 
 
 That slumber in its bosom. Take the wings 
 
 Of morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness, 
 
 Or lose thyself in the continuous woods 
 
 Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound, 
 
 Save his own dashings yet the dead are there : 
 
 And millions in those solitudes, since first 
 
 The flight of years began, have laid them down 
 
 In their last sleep the dead reign there alone. 
 
 So shalt thou rest, and what if thou withdraw 
 
 In silence from the living, and no friend 
 
 Take note of thy departure ? All that breathe 
 
 Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh

 The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes

 By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave 
 Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch 
 About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.

 At that time I was fresh from the country ah ! I was fresh, 
 and I was in a situation along with old Bob Perkins what 
 kep' a greengrocer's shop in 'Ampstead Road. One day 
 Perkins says to me, " Brocklebank," he says, " would you 
 like to do a little job of waiting ? " I knew as he went out 
 acting as waiter at private parties and such like, and I says, 
 " I don't mind," I says, "not that I knows anything about 
 it, if that don't make no odds." " Lor', no ! " he says ; " it's

 only the cloakroom where the gents puts their hats and 
 coats and umbrellas that you'll have to look after, and 
 you'll get half-a-crown and your grub for doin' it." " I'm 
 on," I says, " I shouldn't be surprised if I was able to keep 
 a heye upon a humbrella." 
 
 But I were wrong, as I'm going to tell yer. 
 
 In the evening I went with Perkins to a house in Camden 
 Road. I had on an old dress suit of Perkins', which wasn't no 
 sort of fit, seeing as how he was fifty-two in the waist, and I 
 was twenty-five ; but he said that, as no one would see me, 
 it would be all right. Which I hoped it would be. It 
 didn't feel all right, I tell you that. 
 
 When me and Perkins got up to the house, they put me 
 straight away into a little bandbox of a cupboard sort of 
 place, where there was some shelves, and some 'ooks and 
 some pieces of paper with numbers on, the same number on 
 two pieces of paper, and a box of pins. Perkins, he'd told 
 me what I'd have to do as we was coming along, so I wipes 
 my 'and on his breeches, and I 'opes for the best. 
 
 Well, I got on pretty well considering, so long as the 
 people didn't come too fast ; and I daresay I should have 
 got on somehow to the end if I hadn't been fresh from the 
 country. Of course I didn't know what gentleman wear, 
 and one 'at was like another 'at to me and that was where 
 I was deceived. One gent fair took me aback. He came 
 in with a 'igh top hat on 'is 'ead, and when he took it off, he 
 put one end against his chest, and he gave it a sort of a 
 shove, and squashed it as flat as my hand. I thought as 
 'ow he'd been having a drop to drink, and had busted his 
 brand new hat for a bit of a joke. But he seemed to be 
 sober enough ; and just then some more gents came up and 
 did the same to their 'ats. Then I began to see there was 
 more in the nature of a 'igh 'at than I'd supposed, and so 
 when there came a sort of a lull like, I made up my mind 
 to squash the hats of the other gents as had forgotten to do

 it for themselves, to see if I could make a bit of room. So 
 I takes up one as an old gent had just given me a beauti- 
 ful shiny one it was and I sets it against my chest, and I 
 starts a-'eavin'. I'd no idea it 'ud be so 'ard. Them other 
 gents seemed to squash theirs easy, but this 'ere one took 
 some shovin', and the rest, some forty of them, were the 
 same. I supposed there was some knack about the thing 
 as I hadn't caught, for I had to sit on them before they'd 
 lie down flat. And when I'd finished the lot, they looked 
 all so lop-sided and crumpled-like that a shiver went down 
 my back ; and I began to wish as 'ow I hadn't come. 
 
 Presently up comes the gent as had given me the 'igh 'at 
 as I had started squashin' a tall old gent, very fierce look- 
 ing, with a long white moustache, a regular toff. " Give me 
 my 'at," he says. I pulled it out from under a 'cap of others 
 I 'ad good reason to know it. He looks at it and then he 
 looks at me. " That's not my 'at," he says. "Excuse me, 
 sir," I says, " it is your 'at leastways it's the one as you 
 gave to me." 
 
 " Mine was a new 'at," he says. 
 
 "Yes, sir," I says, "so I thought, sir, when you gave it 
 to me. It didn't look as though it 'adn't never been worn. 
 If you try this 'at on, sir, you will find, sir, as it's yours." 
 
 Then he takes the 'at out of my 'and and squints inside 
 of it. 
 
 "As I'm alive," he says, "I do believe it's mine; but, 
 good 'evins," he says, " whatever 'ave you been a-doin' 
 to it?" 
 
 " I've only been a-squashing of it, sir," I says. 
 
 " Only been a-squashin' of it?" he says ; and he gives a 
 kind of gasp. "Are you drunk, man?" 
 
 "No, sir," I says, " and that I'm not. I haven't 'ad so 
 much as 'alf-a-pint since I've been inside this 'ouse." Which 
 I 'adn't, and my throat was gettin' regular parched. 
 
 "Then if you're not drunk," he says, "what the dickens

 do you mean by tellin' me that you've only been a-squashin' 
 of a brand-new 'at ? 'Ang me if it doesn't look as if you'd 
 been a-sittin' down on it." 
 
 "I had to," I says, "to make it stay down flat." 
 
 I thought he'd have 'ad a fit. 
 
 "You scoundrel," he says; "if you was my servant, I'd 
 have you sent to gaol for this. Take the 'at, you 'ound, 
 you " and I'm blessed if he didn't throw 'is 'at right in my 
 face, and dash out of the 'ouse ! 
 
 Just then three other gents came 'astening up young 
 ones, too, they was. 
 
 "'Ats, waiter," they says, " we're in a hurry." 
 
 " What is your numbers, gentlemen ? " I says. 
 
 "You never gave us none," they says. 
 
 "In that case, gentlemen," I says, "I'll have to ask you 
 for to be so good as to choose your own 'ats," and I takes 
 up in both my hands a 'cap of squashed 'igh 'ats, and I 
 'olds them out to 'em. You should have seen their faces. 
 First they looks at me, and then they looks at each other. 
 Then one of them gives a sort of a grin and says, " Ain't 
 you made some sort of mistake ? " he says. " Ours was 'igh 
 'ats." 
 
 " Well, and ain't these 'igh 'ats ? " I says. 
 
 " They looks to me as if they was low 'ats," says one, a 
 puffy-faced feller with curly 'air " uncommonly low 'ats. 
 I never saw none look lower." 
 
 All three laughs what at was more than I could say. 
 Then the third one, he has a go a stylish-looking chap, 
 very handsome, like you sees in the barber's shops. 
 
 " Waiter," he says, " are you a-'avin' a game with us ? " 
 
 " A game, sir ? " I says, " beggin' your pardon, sir, I'm 
 not 'avin' no game with no one. Do I look as if I 
 was?" 
 
 " Well," he says, " I asks you for my 'at, and you offers 
 me my choice of them leavins from a rag and bone shop ;

 so, if you ain't a-'avin' a game with me, I don't know what 
 you're a-'avin'." 
 
 " Come, waiter," says the one as had spoken first, " didn't 
 we tell you as 'ow we was in a hurry ? Let us have our 
 hats. Don't keep on playing the fool with us." 
 
 "You must excuse me, gentlemen," I says; "if anyone's 
 playing the fool, it seems to me, asking of your leave, as 
 it's you as is playing the fool with me. First you asks me 
 for to give you your 'ats, and then, when I offers you some 
 hats for to take what is your own, you starts a-larfin'. If, as 
 you says, you're in a hurry, perhaps you'll step inside and 
 cast your eyes around, and point out which is your 'ats. 
 You can take which ones you please, for all I care." 
 
 They stepped in, and when they was in and I was in, 
 there wasn't much room left for anything but breathing, 
 and hardly room enough for that. 
 
 " Where is the 'igh 'ats ? " says the stylish-looking feller. 
 
 "Where is your heyes?" I says. "Ain't they all over 
 the place? Why, you're a-steppin' on one now." 
 
 You should have seen the hop he gave. 
 
 "These 'ats," he says, "from what I can see of them 
 which isn't much looks to me as if they had all been 
 squashed." 
 
 " Of course they has," I says. " 'Ow do you suppose I 
 was going to find room for them if they wasn't ? This ain't 
 the Halbit 'All and yet it ain't the Crystal Pallis." 
 
 From the way in which they looked at each other, I felt 
 that there was something that wasn't altogether as it ought 
 to be. So I goes on, 
 
 " If them 'ats ain't been squashed eggsactlyas they ought 
 to have been squashed, that ain't my fault," I says. " You 
 ought to have squashed them for yourselves, as the other 
 gents done. I don't know nothin' about the squashin' of 
 'igh 'ats, and I never laid myself out as knowing nothing. 
 I just put them against my chest and gives them a shove,

 and then I sits on 'em to make 'em lie down flat. That's 
 all I done." 
 
 When I stopped, they burst out larfin' fit to split, and 
 staggered out into the 'all, and the curly-headed one, he 
 cries out, "Oh, Sheepshanks, do come here." 
 
 Then a cove came up as I found out afterwards was the 
 bloke as was a-givin' the party. 
 
 "Oh, Sheepshanks," says the young feller, "if he ain't 
 squashed them just eggsactly as they ought to have been 
 squashed, don't you blame him. He never laid himself 
 out as knowing nothing about the squashin' of 'igh 'ats, but 
 he's done his best ; he's sat down upon them to make them 
 lie flat. Oh ! someone put a piece of ice down my back 
 afore I die." And he kep' on larfin' so, I thought he would 
 'ave bust. 
 
 Mr Sheepshanks, he comes into the little bandbox of a 
 room, lookin' a bit pinky. He looks at some 'ats which I 
 was a-holdin' in my hands. 
 
 " Who's been destroying these 'ats ? " he says. 
 
 " No one ain't been a-destroying of them," I says. " I've 
 only been a-squashin' them and sitting on them to make 
 them lie down flat that's all." 
 
 He gives a kind of gasp like as if he were taken short of 
 breath upon a sudden. 
 
 "Oh," he says, "is that all you've been a-doin'? And 
 what sort of a drunken idiot may you be, pray ? " 
 
 "I'm not drunk," I says, "seein' as 'ow I 'aven't even 
 seen the sight of liquor since I've been inside this blessed 
 'ouse. And as for idiot, I ain't so much of an idiot, 
 perhaps, as you are ; " for I didn't care who he was. I'd 
 had about enough of being bully-ragged. 
 
 " Who brought you here ? " he says. 
 
 "No one brought me here," I says, "seeing as 'ow I 
 came along of Mr Perkins to oblige him, and now I wish I 
 hadn't, and so I tell you straight."

 "I also," he says, "am inclined to wish you hadn't. 
 Where's Perkins?" 
 
 Presently Perkins comes a-'urrying up. 
 
 " Perkins," says Mr Sheepshanks, " what scoundrel is this 
 you have brought into my 'ouse ? " 
 
 "It's only a young man from the country, sir," says 
 Perkins, " as I brought with me to help in the cloak-room. 
 I do hope he has been doing of nothing wrong." 
 
 " I don't know if you're a-thinkin'," says Mr Sheep- 
 shanks, "that I asked my friends to my 'ouse to 'ave their 
 'ats destroyed, because your young man, as you says is 
 from the country and I hope to goodness as to how he'll 
 soon go back to it has done for every one of them." 
 
 " I denies it," I says. " I tells you again as I tells you 
 afore, I've only been a-squashin' of 'em and a-sittin' on 'em 
 to make 'em lie down flat." 
 
 When I says that, the way Mr Perkins goes on at me 
 was what I never had expected. He abused me 
 scandalous. He took me by the neck and he hustled me 
 out into the hall. And there was all the people what was 
 at the party, a-crowdin' on the stairs. If you'll believe me 
 before I hardly knew what had happened, I found myself 
 a-standin'

 With folded hands and dreamy eyes, 
 Wandering out of Paradise, 
 She saw this planet, like a star, 
 
 Hung in the glistening depths of even, 
 Its bridges running to and fro, 
 O'er which the white-winged angels go, 
 
 Bearing the holy dead to heaven. 
 She touched a bridge of flowers, those feet, 
 So light they did not bend the bells 
 Of the celestial asphodels ! 
 They fell like dew upon the flowers, 
 Then all the air grew strangely sweet 
 And thus came dainty Baby Bell 
 
 Into this world of ours. 
 She came and brought delicious May, 
 
 The swallows built beneath the eaves ; 
 
 Like sunlight in and out the leaves, 
 The robins went the livelong day ; 
 The lily swung its noiseless bell, 
 
 And o'er the porch the trembling vine 
 
 Seemed bursting with its veins of wine. 
 How sweetly, softly twilight fell ! 
 O, earth was full of singing-birds 
 And opening spring-tide flowers, 
 When the dainty Baby Bell 
 
 Came to this world of ours ! 
 
 O Baby, dainty Baby Bell, 
 
 How fair she grew from day to day ! 
 
 What woman-nature filled her eyes, 
 
 What poetry within them lay ! 
 
 Those deep and tender twilight eyes, 
 So full of meaning, pure and bright, 
 As if she yet stood in the light 
 
 Of those open gates of Paradise.

 And so we loved her more and more ; 
 Ah, never in our hearts before 
 
 Was love so lovely born ; 
 We felt we had a link between 
 The real world and that unseen 
 
 The land beyond the morn. 
 And for the love of those dear eyes, 
 For love of her whom God led forth 
 (The mother's being ceased on earth 
 When Baby came from Paradise), 
 For love of Him who smote our lives, 
 
 And woke the chords of joy and pain, 
 We said, Dear Christ ! our hearts bent down 
 
 Like violets after rain. 
 
 And now the orchards, which were white 
 
 And red with blossoms when she came, 
 
 Were rich in autumn's mellow prime. 
 
 The clustered apples burnt like flame, 
 
 The soft-cheeked peaches blushed and fell, 
 
 The ivory chestnut burst its shell, 
 
 The grapes hung purpling in the grange ; 
 
 And time wrought just as rich a change 
 In little Baby Bell. 
 
 Her lissome form more perfect grew, 
 And in her features we could trace, 
 In softened curves, her mother's face ! 
 
 Her angel-nature ripened too, 
 
 We thought her lovely when she came, 
 
 But she was holy, saintly now : 
 
 Around her pale, angelic brow 
 
 We saw a slender ring of flame. 
 
 God's hand had taken away the seal 
 That held the portals of her speech

 And oft she said a few strange words 
 
 Whose meaning lay beyond our reach. 
 She never was a child to us, 
 We never held her being's key, 
 We could not teach her holy things ; 
 She was Christ's self in purity. 
 
 It came upon us by degrees : 
 
 We saw its shadow ere it fell, 
 
 The knowledge that our God had sent 
 
 His messenger for Baby Bell. 
 
 We shuddered with unlanguaged pain, 
 
 And all our hopes were changed to fears, 
 
 And all our thoughts ran into tears, 
 
 Like sunshine into rain. 
 We cried aloud in our belief, 
 " O, smite us gently, gently, God ! 
 Teach us to bend and kiss the rod, 
 And perfect grow through grief." 
 Ah, how we loved her, God can tell ; 
 Her heart was folded deep in ours. 
 
 Our hearts are broken, Baby Bell ! 
 
 At last he came, the messenger, 
 
 The messenger from unseen lands : 
 And what did dainty Baby Bell ? 
 She only crossed her little hands, 
 She only looked more meek and fair ! 
 We parted back her silken hair, 
 We wove the roses round her brow, 
 White buds, the summer's drifted snow, 
 Wrapt her from head to foot in flowers ; 
 And then went dainty Baby Bell 
 Out of this world of ours !

 AT daybreak, on the Westland moors, we met our God to 
 
 praise, 
 Gathered, despite a king's command, our morning psalm 
 
 to raise ; 
 And with the thin grey morning mists that wreathed above 
 
 the glen 
 Rose up the song, rose up the prayer, of thrice three 
 
 hundred men. 
 
 All through those early Sabbath hours no foeman's step 
 
 drew nigh ; 
 Then came, hot-foot across the heath, our scouts with 
 
 warning cry : 
 " To arms ! to arms ! the proud white plume of Claver'se 
 
 yonder shines ! " 
 And louder still, " To arms ! to arms ! " was echoed down 
 
 the lines. 
 
 "For Christ our King and Covenant" we flung the 
 
 banner wide ! 
 
 And at the sight a ringing shout the glittering troop defied. 
 The mother led her bairns apart, the strong man pressed 
 
 before, 
 And beardless lads that day drew steel that once their 
 
 grandsires wore.

 But ill it served the haughty Graeme to find us thus 
 
 prepared, 
 For, safe in Drumclog's lonely vale, he thought the game 
 
 was snared ; 
 And wrath was in that cruel face, as down the glen he 
 
 came, 
 To find the pathway set with pikes, and lit with points of 
 
 flame. 
 
 Woe to the fiend whose dainty blade with blood of martyrs 
 
 ran ! 
 To those who flout the Lord of Heaven, and have no ruth 
 
 for man ! 
 Answered shall be their piteous cry who fell on Rullion 
 
 Green, 
 Vain, vain the troopers' headlong charge God's angel 
 
 stands between. 
 
 Nearer and nearer still they drew, and as we knelt to 
 
 pray, 
 
 Wild as a winter blast the foe swept up the marshy way ; 
 Ere we could rise, with sudden flash, the levelled carbines 
 
 rang, 
 And with drawn swords, to close the strife, the horsemen 
 
 forward sprang. 
 
 Unscathed we rose, and, as their steeds came plunging 
 
 through the mire, 
 On plumed helm and bright cuirass poured down an 
 
 answering fire ; 
 A moment's space the smoke-cloud hid the glittering ranks 
 
 beneath, 
 And then through flying drifts we saw confusion, rage, and 
 
 death.

 With muttered oath the troopers turned, back-wheeling up 
 
 the hill ; 
 The wounded charger shuddering reared, with neighings 
 
 loud and shrill ; 
 Low drooped the plume, the nerveless hand let fall the 
 
 slackened rein ; 
 They sank to earth, and earth drank in the red blood of 
 
 the slain. 
 
 Then, gripping scythe and pike, we burst resistless on their 
 
 rear; 
 Rider and steed and all went down, as louder rose the 
 
 cheer 
 " Sword of the Lord and Gideon ! For God and for the 
 
 right ! 
 Strike for the Cause, and think on those who fell at Rullion 
 
 Fight ! " 
 
 And thus across the dark morass, and up the slope of green, 
 Swayed the broad stream of struggling men as never yet 
 
 was seen ; 
 And Claver'se, on his charmed steed, a storm of bullets 
 
 drew; 
 They failed I fired with silver ha ! she reeled ; my aim 
 
 was true. 
 
 Then panic fell on all, and fast with bloody spur they fled, 
 Till they had set the Avon's flood betwixt them and the

 And low we knelt in praise to Him whose arm, made bare

 Scattered the foe like mountain mist that sunrise rends

 Their flowerless crags from the green north land, 
 Her islands shake to the surge and thunder 
 
 Of white waves racing to reach the strand. 
 Lonely and bare ! but above them lightens 
 
 The memory fair of a shining deed, 
 And a spirit-presence the wild waste brightens, 
 
 Since Love went forth at the cry of Need. 
 
 Oft as the night of that drear September 
 
 Broods again over sea and shore, 
 Still shall our hearts with pride remember 
 
 How through the storm swift help she bore. 
 Still shall we see, in fancy's vision, 
 
 The brave little skiff from the lighthouse go, 
 And, clad in the strength of love's decision, 
 
 The girlish form to the oar bend low. 
 
 Still shall we see, in the dim grey dawning, 
 
 The drifting ship on the reef flung high ; 
 Round her the hungry ocean yawning, 
 
 Over her stretched the hopeless sky. 
 Rings again through the wind-spray flying 
 
 The moan of terror, the shriek of fear ; 
 Laugh the breakers, as if replying 
 
 With savage mirth to the cries they hear. 
 
 Out on the rocks they crouch and shiver, 
 The hapless few that have 'scaped the wave, 
 
 Scanning the waters with lips a-quiver, 
 Praying that God would send and save.

 Lips are loosened a cheer rings out ! 
 Plunging, tossing, a boat comes bringing 
 
 Life for perishing, joy for doubt ! 
 
 Over the white-crowned surges leaping, 
 
 Hither through blinding foam she wins 
 Still for the rock her course she's keeping, 
 
 Still the spune from the oar-blade spins. 
 Saved, they crowd to the boats' frail shelter, 
 
 Eager helpers replacing now 
 The hands that drove through the sea's wild welter 
 
 With love-born ardour the tossing prow. 
 
 How can we speak her praise, or fashion 
 
 A tribute worthy the deathless deed ? 
 Nay, that story of bold compassion 
 
 No memorial words shall need.

 Shines out in a hundred deeds the spirit

 From the river, swift and narrow, far down in the vale 
 
 below, 
 That shone like a silver arrow shot from a bended bow. 
 
 Yonder, over the poplars, lapped in the mellow haze, 
 Lay the roofs of the teeming city, red in the noonday blaze ; 
 While ever, in muffled music, the tall cathedral towers 
 Told to the panting people the story of the hours. 
 
 His was a cruel temper ; under his baneful sway, 
 Peasant and maid and matron fled from his headlong way, 
 When down from his rocky eyrie, spurring his foaming steed, 
 Galloped the haughty noble, ripe for some evil deed. 
 
 But when the surging thousands, bleeding at every pore, 
 Roused by the wrongs of ages, rose with a mighty roar 
 Ever the streets of cities rang with a voice long mute ; 
 Gibbet and tree and lanterne bearing their bleeding fruit. 
 
 Only one touch of feeling hid from the world apart, 
 Locked with the key of silence lived in that cruel heart ; 
 For one he had loved and worshipped, dead in the days of 
 
 yore, 
 Now slept in the lonely chapel, hard by the river shore. 
 
 High on a painted panel, set in a gilded shrine, 
 Shone her benignant features, lit with a smile divine ; 
 Under the high, straight forehead, eyes of the brightest blue, 
 Framed in her hair's bright masses, rivalled the sapphire's 
 hue.

 " Bid her begone ! " " But master poor child, she loves 
 
 you so ! 
 And, broken with bitter weeping, she told me a tale of woe. 
 
 " She says there is wild work yonder, there in the hated town, 
 Where the crowd of frenzied people are shooting the nobles 
 
 down ; 
 And to-night, ere the moon has risen, they come, with

 With the flame of the blazing castle to light the lurid land. 
 
 " But first you must spread the banquet host for the crew

 With flowers and fruits and viands, silver and crystal clear ; 
 Let not a touch be wanting hasten those hands of thine ! 
 Haste to the task, Breconi and I will draw the wine ! " 
 
 Slowly the sun went westward, till all the city's spires 
 Flamed in the flood of splendour a hundred flickering fires. 
 Over the peaceful landscape, clasped by the girdling stream, 
 Quivered, in mournful glory, the last expiring beam. 
 
 Then up from the rippling river sounded the tramp of feet, 
 That rose o'er the solemn stillness laden with perfume sweet ; 
 While high o'er the sleeping city, and over the garden

 192 ELOCUTION 
 
 Leaning over the casement, heark'ning the busy hum, 
 Smiling, the haughty marquis knew that his time was come : 
 And he turned to the panelled picture that answered his 
 
 look again, 
 And beamed with a sigh of welcome humming a low 
 
 refrain. 
 
 Under the echoing archway, and up o'er the stairs of stone, 
 Ever the human torrent shouted in strident tone 
 Curses and gibes and threat'nings, with snatches of ribald 
 
 jest, 
 Stirring the blood to fury in many a brutal breast. 
 
 There, under the lighted tapers set in the banquet-hall, 
 Smiling and calm and steadfast, towered the marquis tall. 
 Dressed in his richest costume, facing the gibing host, 
 He wore on his broad blue ribbon the star of " The Holy 
 Ghost." 
 
 " Welcome, fair guests be seated ! " he cried to the 
 
 motley crowd, 
 
 That drew to the loaded table with curses long and loud ; 
 Waving a graceful welcome, the gleaming lights reveal 
 The rings on his soft, white fingers, strung with their nerves 
 
 of steel. 
 
 Turned to the panelled picture, calm in his icy hate, 
 He stood, in his pride of lineage, cold as a marble Fate ; 
 Smiling in hidden meaning in his rich garments dressed 
 As cold and hard and polished as the brilliants on his 
 breast. 
 
 Pouring a brimming beaker, he cried, "Drink, friends, I 
 
 pray ! 
 Drink to the toast I give you ! Pledge me my proudest 
 
 day!

 THE LAST BANQUET 193 
 
 Here, under the hall of banquet drink, drink to the festal 
 
 news ! 
 Stand twenty casks of powder, set with a lighted fuse ! " 
 
 Frozen with sudden horror, they saw, like a fleecy mist, 
 As he quaffed the purple vintage, the ruffles at his wrist. 
 Turned to the smiling picture, clear as a silver bell 
 Echoed his last fond greeting " I drink to thee, ma belle ! " 
 
 Down crashed the crystal goblet, flung on the marble floor : 
 Back rushed the stricken revellers back to the close- 
 barred door; 
 
 Up through its yawning crater the mighty earthquake broke, 
 Dashing its spume of fire up through its waves of smoke ! 
 
 Out through the deep'ning darkness a wild, despairing cry 
 
 Rang, as the riven castle lighted the midnight sky ; 
 
 Then down o'er the lurid landscape, lit by those fires of 
 
 hell- 
 Buttress and roof and rafter the smoking ruin fell ! 
 
 Over the Norman landscape the summer sun looks down, 
 Gilding the grey cathedral, gilding the teeming town. 
 Still shines the rippling river, lapped in its banks of green ; 
 Still hangs the scent of roses over the peaceful scene ; 
 
 But high o'er the trembling poplars, blackened and burned 
 
 and riven, 
 Those blasted battlements and towers frown in the face of 
 
 heaven ; 
 
 And still in the sultry August I seem at times to feel 
 The smile of that cruel marquis, keen as his rapier's steel !

 THE LUCK OF EDENHALL 
 
 LONGFELLOW 
 
 OF Edenhall the youthful Lord 
 
 Bids sound the festal trumpet's call ; 
 
 He rises at the banquet board. 
 
 And cries, 'mid the drunken revellers all, 
 
 " Now bring me the Luck of Edenhall ! " 
 
 The butler hears the words with pain, 
 The house's oldest seneschal, 
 Takes slow from its silken cloth again 
 The drinking-glass of crystal tall : 
 They call it The Luck of Edenhall. 
 
 Then said the Lord : " This glass to praise, 
 
 Fill with red wine from Portugal ! " 
 
 The graybeard with trembling hand obeys ; 
 
 A purple light shines over all, 
 
 It beams from the Luck of Edenhall. 
 
 Then speaks the Lord, and waves it light : 
 " This glass of flashing crystal tall 
 Gave to my sires the Fountain-Sprite ; 
 She wrote in it, If this glass doth fall, 
 Farewell then, O Luck of Edenhall! 
 
 " 'Twas right a goblet the fate should be 
 Of the joyous race of Edenhall ! 
 Deep draughts drink we right willingly ; 
 And willingly ring, with merry call, 
 Kling ! klang ! to the Luck of Edenhall ! "

 THE LUCK OF EDENHALL 195 
 
 First rings it deep, and full, and mild, 
 Like to the song of a nightingale ; 
 Then like the roar of a torrent wild ; 
 Then mutters at last like the thunder's fall, 
 The glorious Luck of Edenhall. 
 
 " For its keeper takes a race of might, 
 
 The fragile goblet of crystal tall ; 
 
 It has lasted longer than is right ; 
 
 Kling ! klang ! with a harder blow than all 
 
 Will I try the Luck of Edenhall ! " 
 
 As the goblet ringing flies apart, 
 Suddenly cracks the vaulted hall ; 
 And through the rift the wild flames start ; 
 The guests in dust are scattered all, 
 With the breaking Luck of Edenhall ! 
 
 In storms the foe with fire and sword ; 
 He in the night had scaled the wall, 
 Slain by the sword lies the youthful Lord, 
 But holds in his hand the crystal tall, 
 The shattered Luck of Edenhall. 
 
 On the morrow the butler gropes alone, 
 The graybeard in the desert hall, 
 He seeks his Lord's burnt skeleton, 
 He seeks in the dismal ruin's fall 
 The shards of the Luck of Edenhall. 
 
 " The stone wall," saith he, " doth fall aside, 
 Down must the stately columns fall ; 
 Glass is this earth's Luck and Pride ; 
 In atoms shall fall this earthly ball 
 One day like the Luck of Edenhall ! "

 A TALE OF THE LIFEBOAT 
 
 ROBERT BLATCHFORD 
 (By special permission of the Author] 
 
 ONE night in January, 1881, during a tremendous storm, a 
 brig struck on the sunken reefs within the southern arm of 
 Robin Hood's Bay. The crew got out the jolly boat, 
 and made her fast with a rope to the mast of the wreck, 
 All night long they fought with the waves, the people on 
 shore being entirely ignorant of their calamity. 
 
 Early in the morning the quarter-board of the vessel, 
 driven ashore, was seen by the coastguardsman, who gave 
 the alarm, and it was then discovered that the brig had 
 foundered during the night, and that the crew were still 
 tossing about in their boat in the midst of a furious gale, a 
 blinding snowstorm, and a heavy sea. 
 
 Now, at that time, the lifeboat at Robin Hood's Bay was 
 old and unseaworthy. To put out in her was to incur swift 
 and certain death. Neither could the brig's boat possibly 
 make shore through the terrible breakers, even had her crew 
 known the lay of the reefs, through which there are but two 
 narrow channels where a boat can pass. 
 
 What was to be done? The good people of Robin 
 Hood's Bay could not let the shipwrecked sailors drown 
 before their eyes, and no ordinary boat could live in such 
 a sea. There was but one chance the telegraph. They 
 wired to Whitby, requesting that the lifeboat might be sent 
 at once. The Whitby men received this message after 
 having been out five times during the night. They held a 
 consultation. 
 
 The first suggestion was that the lifeboat should be towed 
 round to Robin Hood's Bay, about ten miles, by a steam 
 tug ; but this was impossible, as no tug could weather such 
 a storm as then was raging. 
 
 196

 A TALE OF THE LIFEBOAT 197 
 
 The next suggestion was to man the lifeboat and pull 
 round. This was put to the vote, and unanimously nega- 
 tived. With the ebb tide and the furious gale against them, 
 no boat's crew in the world could have taken the boat to 
 the wreck, even if there had been a hope of living in that 
 tremendous storm. The brave men of Whitby looked at 
 the great cauldron of the sea, where the swirling water and 
 the shrieking spray and flying snow were blent in one great 
 seething hell-broth, and shook their heads despairingly. 
 
 And all this time the crew of the foundered ship, cut off 
 from all communication from the shore, were fighting their 
 hopeless battle for life, looking to the land they could not 
 reach, and praying for the aid that could not come. And 
 then then when all hope of going to the rescue by the sea 
 had been abandoned, out spoke some hero of the Lifeboat 
 Council on the Whitby beach, and said : " We will take her 
 overland." 
 
 They would take the lifeboat overland ! Do you realise 
 the magnitude of the task? The heroic audacity of the 
 idea. Between Whitby and Robin Hood's Bay there are 
 six long miles of hilly country. A lifeboat is a huge and 
 ponderous vessel. A terrific storm was raging. There was 
 a hard frost, and the roads were deep with snow ! 
 
 On the face of it, the project looked like madness. But 
 there was a boat's crew of sailors hoping against hope 
 amongst the breakers ; and British fishermen, having made 
 up their minds to do a thing, bring desperate courage to 
 face desperate emergencies. 
 
 The men of Whitby would take their lifeboat overland ! 
 The rumour spread. The crowd increased. The en- 
 thusiasm began to blaze. Old men, women, and children 
 the fathers, mothers, wives, daughters, and sons of fisher- 
 men came out into the storm. The coxswain led the way 
 to the boathouse, which was waist-deep in water, and the 
 approach to which was swept every minute by the furious

 charges of the seas which rushed up the slip and over the 
 pier. 
 
 Oh ! it was a marvellous sight ! The boat was dragged 
 out. Ropes were made fast to it. A hundred, two hundred, 
 three hundred men, seized the ropes ; a great crowd followed, 
 pushing the carriage or turning the wheels. Through the 
 falling snow and crackling ice, the flying spume and spray, 
 the lifeboat was dragged down the street and over the bridge. 
 At the turn of the road a couple of horses were yoked on ; 
 a few yards up the hill a couple more ; a few yards further 
 a couple more ; and so as the procession went were men 
 and horses added to win the way against wind and weather. 
 One mile out a couple of travellers met the party, vowed 
 the enterprise was hopeless ; told how the roads were one 
 mass of ice and snow ; how they themselves had left their 
 traps and horses half buried in the drifts ; to get to the bay, 
 they said, was quite impossible. 
 
 Impossible ! Whitby was aroused. Whitby had got its 
 blood up, the blood of the Vikings, who feared neither 
 steel, nor storm, nor fire ! Impossible ! Whitby laughed. 
 
 What, ho ! A score of men ! Two, three score of men 
 there quickly, with axes and bars and shovels. We will 
 see about this snow, we men of Whitby ; we will go, though 
 the skies should fall. 
 
 The men were there a hundred men with spades and 
 axes; a hundred more with ropes and lanterns. They 
 hewed the ice and cut the snow from the track ; they grew 
 more fierce and resolute the greater grew the obstacles. At 
 every hamlet, at every farm and cross-road they picked up 
 volunteers. Farmers and carriers met them with their 
 cattle. Soon they had thirty horses, and of men a regi- 
 ment. They dragged the great boat by main force up the 
 steep hills, and through the ruts and puddles. They hacked 
 their way through drifts and hedges ; they pulled up gates 
 and broke down walls, and so, panting, straining, heaving

 A TALE OF THE LIFEBOAT 199 
 
 like giants, they hauled the lifeboat into the crowd at the 
 top of the winding and abrupt declivity which leads to the 
 beach of the bay. 
 
 Howl, demoniacal winds ! rage, hungry waves, around 
 the fainting seamen in their broken boat ! The Vikings 
 are upon you, the men who brought the lifeboat overland. 
 
 The steep road down on to the shore is a mass of ice ; 
 the horses cannot stand upon it; the seas break fiercely 
 over the wall. The men of Robin's Bay come forward. 
 They are Vikings, too. They lash the hind wheels of the 
 carriage. They seize the ropes, the boat, the wheels, the 
 sides, nine hundred lusty men, and they dash the thing 
 down to the water with one mighty rush. 
 
 Then no time is lost. Swiftly the men of the crew are 
 dressed, the boat is launched, and with a lurch and a plunge 
 leaps bodily into the storm. But all is not yet over. The 
 sea is something tremendous ; the coast is a mass of hidden 
 reefs; and in a few minutes the lifeboat is hurled back, 
 beaten, to the shore, with all the oars on one side broken, 
 and half the crew exhausted or disabled. 
 
 It is three hours now since the men of Whitby formed 
 their grand and daring resolution. All that time the crew 
 of the sunken vessel have been holding on in hopeless 
 desperation, knowing nothing of the efforts made on their 
 behalf; hearing nothing but the shrieks of the tempest, and 
 the thunder of the waves ; seeing nothing but the vast, dark 
 hillsides of water, the misty loom of the land, and the 
 baffling veil of eddying snowflakes, whirling, whirling. 
 
 Eight men of the lifeboat's crew are out of action ; eight 
 volunteers take their places. Eight oars are shattered ; 
 eight more are shipped from the damaged boat belonging 
 to the bay. A pilot also, a fisherman of the village, goes 
 aboard, and again the boat is rushed into the billows. 
 Rescue or death these men will win. The boat must go, 
 shall go ; the blood of the Vikings is on fire ; they would

 in their present temper fetch their comrades ashore though 
 hell itself should gape. 
 
 Out again into the mirk and fury. Out in the boat they 
 have carried overland. Out under the eyes of all the 
 gallant men and brave women of the village. Out in the 
 teeth of the tempest, into the roaring, rolling black-green 
 valleys of the shadow of death. Now rising on the crest of 
 some huge roller, now hidden from sight in some fearful 
 hissing pit, now hurled upon its beam ends by the sudden 
 impact of a heavy sea, the Whitby boat fights its way 
 towards the men who shall be rescued. 
 
 Not till the lifeboat was close upon them had those 
 desperate clinging wretches any knowledge of the succour 
 so heroically brought. Fainting with fatigue, perished with 
 cold, still they hold on, stubborn, but hopeless. They 
 cannot see the lifeboat, they cannot see the shore. 
 
 And now, now comes the glorious moment. We are 
 upon them ; we shall save them. No ; they are giving 
 way, they will be lost, and we within a hundred yards of 
 them. The Jcrisis is bitter in its intensity. The coxswain 
 of the Whitby boat, Henry Freemen, turns to his crew, 
 and in his great, deep voice cries, " Now, rny lads, give 
 them a rousing cheer ; " and over the scream of the gale, 
 and over the roar of the sea, and over the hiss of the brine, 
 goes up the Vikings' shout, the shout of victory ! 
 
 Oh, it was a glorious day ! A strife of giants ! a triumph 
 of heroes ! Imagine the delighted enthusiasm, the frantic 
 excitement of the crowd when the shipwrecked crew were 
 landed on that dangerous rocky shore, snatched from the 
 very jaws of death saved, saved to a man ! saved by the 
 dauntless courage and magnificently heroic devotion of the 
 fishermen of Whitby, who brought their lifeboat overland.

 IT was in eighteen hundred yes and nine, 
 That we took Saragossa. What a day 
 Of untold horrors ! I was sergeant then. 
 The city carried, we laid siege to houses, 
 All shut up close, and with a treacherous look, 
 Raining down shots upon us from the windows. 
 " 'Tis the priests' doing ! " was the word passed round ; 
 So that, although since daybreak under arms, 
 Our eyes with powder smarting, and our mouths 
 Bitter with kissing cartridge-ends, piff ! paff! 
 Rattled the musketry with ready aim, 
 If shovel hat and long black coat were seen 
 Flying in the distance. Up a narrow street 
 My company worked on. I kept an eye 
 On every house-top, right and left, and saw 
 From many a roof flames suddenly burst forth, 
 Colouring the sky, as from the chimney-tops 
 Among the forges. Low our fellows stooped, 
 Entering the low-pitched dens. When they came out, 
 With bayonets dripping red, their bloody fingers 
 Signed crosses on the wall ; for we were bound, 
 In such a dangerous defile, not to leave 
 Foes lurking in our rear. There was no drum-beat, 
 No ordered march. Our officers looked grave ; 
 The rank and file uneasy, jogging elbows 
 As do recruits when flinching.

 All at once, 
 
 Rounding a corner, we are hailed in French 
 With cries for help. At double-quick we join 
 Our hard-pressed comrades. They were grenadiers, 
 A gallant company, but beaten back 
 Inglorious from the raised and flag-paved square, 
 Fronting a convent. Twenty stalwart monks 
 Defended it, black demons with shaved crowns, 
 The cross in white embroidered on their frocks, 
 Barefoot, their sleeves tucked up, their only weapons 
 Enormous crucifixes, so well brandished 
 Our men went down before them. By platoons 
 Firing we swept the place ; in fact, we slaughtered 
 This terrible group of heroes, no more soul 
 Being in us than in executioners. 
 
 The foul deed done deliberately done 
 And the thick smoke rolling away, we noted 
 Under the huddled masses of the dead, 
 Rivulets of blood run trickling down the steps ; 
 While in the background solemnly the church 
 Loomed up, its doors wide open. We went in. 
 It was a desert. Lighted tapers starred 
 The inner gloom with points of gold. The incense 
 Gave out its perfume. At the upper end, 
 Turned to the altar, as though unconcerned 
 In the fierce battle that had raged, a priest, 
 White-haired and tall of stature, to a close 
 Was bringing tranquilly the mass. So stamped 
 Upon my memory is that thrilling scene, 
 That, as I speak, it comes before me now, 
 The convent built in old time by the Moors ; 
 The huge brown corpses of the monks ; the sun 
 Making the red blood on the pavement steam ; 
 And there, framed in by the low porch, the priest,

 And there the altar brilliant as a shrine ; 
 And here ourselves, all halting, hesitating, 
 Almost afraid. 
 
 I, certes, in those days 
 
 Was a confirmed blasphemer. 'Tis on record 
 That once, by way of sacrilegious joke, 
 A chapel being sacked, I lit my pipe 
 At a wax candle burning on the altar. 
 This time, however, I was awed, so blanched 
 Was that old man ! 
 
 " Shoot him ! " our captain cried. 
 Not a soul budged. The priest beyond all doubt 
 Heard ; but, as though he heard not, turning round, 
 He faced us with the elevated Host, 
 Having that period of the service reached 
 When on the faithful benediction falls. 
 His lifted arms seemed as the spread of wings ; 
 And as he raised the pyx, and in the air 
 With it described the cross, each man of us 
 Fell back, aware the priest no more was trembling 
 Than if before him the devout were ranged. 
 But when, intoned with clear and mellow voice, 
 The words came to us 
 
 Vos Benedicat 
 
 Deus Omnipotens ! 
 
 The captain's order 
 
 Rang out again and sharply, " Shoot him down, 
 Or I shall swear ! " Then one of ours, a dastard, 
 Levelled his gun and fired. Upstanding still, 
 The priest changed colour, though with steadfast look 
 Set upwards, and indomitably stern.

 Held himself up ; and strenuous to complete

 But in the general hush distinctly heard,

 On the white winter hills. Each brought, in turn, 
 Some truth, some lesson on the life of man, 
 Or recognition of the Eternal Mind 
 Who veils His glory with the elements. 
 
 One such I knew long since, a white-haired man, 
 Pithy of speech, and merry when he would ; 
 A genial optimist, who daily drew 
 From what he saw his quaint moralities. 
 Kindly he held communion, though so old, 
 With me a dreaming boy, and taught me much 
 That books tell not, and I shall ne'er forget. 
 
 The sun of May was bright in middle heaven, 
 And steeped the sprouting forests, the green hills, 
 And emerald wheat-field, in his yellow light. 
 Upon the apple-tree, where rosy buds 
 Stood clustered, ready to burst forth in bloom, 
 The robin warbled forth his full clear note 
 For hours, and wearied not. Within the woods, 
 Whose young and half-transparent leaves scarce cast 
 A shade, gay circles of anemones 
 
 Danced on their stalks ; the shad-bush, white with flowers, 
 Brightened the glens ; the new-leaved butternut 
 And quivering poplar to the roving breeze 
 Gave a balsamic fragrance. In the fields 
 I saw the pulses of the gentle wind 
 On the young grass. My heart was touched with joy 
 At so much beauty, flushing every hour 
 Into a fuller beauty ; but my friend, 
 The thoughtful ancient, standing at my side, 
 Gazed on it mildly sad. I asked him why. 
 
 " Well mayst thou join in gladness," he replied, 
 ' With the glad earth, her springing plants and flowers, 
 And this soft wind, the herald of the green

 Luxuriant summer. Thou art young like them, 
 And well mayst thou rejoice. But while the flight 
 Of seasons fills and knits thy spreading frame, 
 It withers mine, and thins my hair, and dims 
 These eyes, whose fading light shall soon be quenched 
 In utter darkness. Hearest-thou that bird?" 
 
 I listened, and from midst the depth of woods 
 Heard the love-signal of the grouse, that wears 
 A sable ruff around his mottled neck ; 
 Partridge they call him by our northern streams, 
 And pheasant by the Delaware. He beat 
 His barred sides with his speckled wings, and made 
 A sound like distant thunder ; slow the strokes 
 At first, then fast and faster, till at length 
 They passed into a murmur and were still. 
 
 " There hast thou," said my friend, " a fitting type 
 Of human life. 'Tis an old truth, I know, 
 But images like these revive the power 
 Of long familiar truths. Slow pass our days 
 In childhood, and the hours of light are long 
 Betwixt the morn and eve ; with swifter lapse 
 They glide in manhood, and in age they fly ; 
 Till days and seasons flit before the mind 
 As flit the snowflakes in a winter storm, 
 Seen rather than distinguished. Ah ! I seem 
 As if I sat within a helpless bark, 
 By swiftly-running waters hurried on 
 To shoot some mighty cliff. Along the banks 
 Grove after grove, rock after frowning rock, 
 Bare sands and pleasant homes, and flowery nooks, 
 And isles and whirlpools in the stream, appear 
 Each after each, but the devoted skiff 
 Darts by so swiftly that their images

 But he clasp'd her like a lover, 
 
 And he cheer'd her soul with love. 
 
 So she strove against her weakness, 
 
 Tho' at times her spirits sank ; 
 Shaped her heart with woman's meekness 
 
 To all duties of her rank ; 
 And a gentle consort made he, 
 
 And her gentle mind was such 
 That she grew a noble lady, 
 
 And the people loved her much.

 But a trouble weigh'd upon her, 
 And perplex'd her, night and morn, 
 
 With the burden of an honour 
 Unto which she was not born. 
 
 Faint she grew, and ever fainter, 
 
 As she murmur'd " Oh, that he 
 Were once more that landscape-painter 
 
 Which did win my heart from me ! " 
 So she droop'd and droop'd before him, 
 
 Fading slowly from his side ; 
 Three fair children first she bore him, 
 
 Then before her time she died. 
 
 Weeping, weeping late and early, 
 
 Walking up and pacing down, 
 Deeply mourn'd the Lord of Burleigh, 
 
 Burleigh-house by Stamford-town. 
 And he came to look upon her, 
 
 And he look'd at her and said, 
 " Bring the dress and put it on her, 
 
 That she wore when she was wed." 
 
 Then her people, softly treading, 
 Bore to earth her body, drest 
 
 In the dress that she was wed in, 
 That her spirit might have rest.

 And often thought " I'll make them man and wife." 
 Now Dora felt her uncle's will in all, 
 And yearn'd towards William ; but the youth, because 
 He had been always with her in the house, 
 Thought not of Dora. 
 
 Then there came a day 
 
 When Allan call'd his son, and said, " My son, 
 I married late, but I would wish to see 
 My grandchild on my knees before I die : 
 And I have set my heart upon a match. 
 Now therefore look to Dora ; she is well 
 To look to ; thrifty too beyond her age. 
 She is my brother's daughter : he and I 
 Had once hard words, and parted, and he died 
 In foreign lands ; but for his sake I bred 
 His daughter Dora : take her for your wife ; 
 For I have wished this marriage, night and day, 
 For many years." But William answered short : 
 " I cannot marry Dora ; by my life, 
 I will not marry Dora." Then the old man 
 Was wroth, and doubled up his hands, and said : 
 "You will not, boy ! you dare to answer thus ! 
 But in my time a father's word was law, 
 And so it shall be now for me. Look to it ; 
 Consider, William : take a month to think, 
 And let me have an answer to my wish ; 
 Or, by the Lord that made me, you shall pack 
 And never more darken my doors again." 
 But William answer'd madly ; bit his lips, 
 And broke away. The more he looked at her 
 The less he liked her ; and his ways were harsh ; 
 But Dora bore them meekly. Then before 
 The month was out he left his father's house, 
 And hired himself to work within the fields ;

 And half in love, half spite, he woo'd and wed 
 A labourer's daughter, Mary Morrison. 
 
 Then, when the bells were ringing, Allan call'd 
 His niece and said : " My girl, I love you well ; 
 But if you speak with him that was my son, 
 Or change a word with her he calls his wife, 
 My home is none of yours. My will is law." 
 And Dora promised, being meek. She thought, 
 " It cannot be : my uncle's mind will change ! " 
 And days went on, and there was born a boy 
 To William ; then distresses came on him ; 
 And day by day he passed his father's gate, 
 Heart-broken, and his father helped him not. 
 But Dora stored what little she could save, 
 And sent it them by stealth, nor did they know 
 Who sent it ; till at last a fever seized 
 On William, and in harvest time he died. 
 
 Then Dora went to Mary. Mary sat 
 And look'd with tears upon her boy, and thought 
 Hard things of Dora. Dora came and said : 
 
 " I have obey'd my uncle until now, 
 And I have sinn'd, for it was all thro' me 
 This evil came on William at the first. 
 But, Mary, for the sake of him that's gone, 
 And for your sake, the woman that he chose, 
 And for this orphan, I am come to you : 
 You know there has not been for these five years 
 So full a harvest : let me take the boy, 
 And I will set him in my uncle's eye 
 Among the wheat ; that when his heart is glad 
 Of the full harvest, he may see the boy, 
 And bless him for the sake of him that's gone."

 And Dora took the child, and went her way 
 Across the wheat, and sat upon a mound 
 That was unsown, where many poppies grew. 
 Far off the farmer came into the field 
 And spied her not ; for none of all his men 
 Dare tell him Dora waited with the child ; 
 And Dora would have risen and gone to him, 
 But her heart fail'd her ; and the reapers reap'd, 
 And the sun fell, and the land was dark. 
 
 But when the morrow came she rose and took 
 The child once more, and sat upon the mound ; 
 And made a little wreath of all the flowers 
 That grew about, and tied it round his hat 
 To make him pleasing in her uncle's eye. 
 Then when the farmer pass'd into the field 
 He spied her, and he left his men at work, 
 And came and said : " Where were you yesterday ? 
 Whose child is that ? What are you doing here ? " 
 So Dora cast her eyes upon the ground, 
 And answer'd softly, "This is William's child ! " 
 "And did I not," said Allan, " did I not 
 Forbid you, Dora ? " Dora said again : 
 " Do with me as you will, but take the child 
 And bless him for the sake of him that's gone ! " 
 And Allan said, " I see it is a trick 
 Got up betwixt you and the woman there. 
 I must be taught my duty, and by you ! 
 You knew my word was law, and yet you dared 
 To slight it. Well for I will take the boy ; 
 But go you hence, and never see me more." 
 
 So saying, he took the boy, that cried aloud 
 And struggled hard. The wreath of flowers fell

 At Dora's feet. She bow'd upon her hands, 
 And the boy's cry came to her from the field 
 More and more distant. She bow'd down her head, 
 Remembering the day when first she came, 
 And all the things that had been. She bow'd down 
 And wept in secret ; and the reapers reap'd, 
 And the sun fell, and all the land was dark. 
 
 Then Dora went to Mary's house, and stood 
 Upon the threshold. Mary saw the boy 
 Was not with Dora. She broke out in praise 
 To God, that help'd her in her widowhood. 
 And Dora said, " My uncle took the boy ; 
 But, Mary, let me live and work with you : 
 He says that he will never see me more." 
 Then answer'd Mary, " This shall never be, 
 That thou shouldst take my trouble on thyself : 
 And, now I think, he shall not have the boy, 
 For he will teach him hardness, and to slight 
 His mother ; therefore thou and I will go, 
 And I will have my boy, and bring him home, 
 And I will beg of him to take thee back ; 
 But if he will not take thee back again, 
 Then thou and I will live within one house, 
 And work for William's child, until he grows 
 Of age to help us." 
 
 So the women kiss'd 
 
 Each other, and set out, and reach'd the farm. 
 The door was off the latch : they peep'd and saw 
 The boy set up betwixt his grandsire's knees, 
 Who thrust him in the hollows of his arm, 
 And clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks, 
 Like one that loved him : and the lad stretched out 
 And babbled for the golden seal that hung

 From Allan's watch, and sparkled by the fire. 
 Then they came in ; but when the boy beheld 
 His mother he cried out to come to her : 
 And Allan set him down, and Mary said : 
 
 " O Father ! if you let me call you so 
 I never came a-begging for myself, 
 Or William, or this child ; but now I come 
 For Dora : take her back ; she loves you well. 
 
 sir, when William died, he died at peace 
 With all men ; for I ask'd him, and he said, 
 He could not ever rue his marrying me 
 
 1 had been a patient wife ; but, sir, he said 
 That he was wrong to cross his father thus : 
 
 ' God bless him ! ' he said, ' and may he never know 
 The troubles I have gone thro' ! ' Then he turn'd 
 His face and pass'd unhappy that I am ! 
 But now, sir, let me have my boy, for you 
 Will make him hard, and he will learn to slight 
 His father's memory ; and take Dora back, 
 And let all this be as it was before." 
 
 So Mary said, and Dora hid her face 
 By Mary. There was silence in the room ; 
 And all at once the old man burst in sobs : 
 
 " I have been to blame to blame. I have kill'd 
 
 my son. 
 
 I have kill'd him but I loved him my dear son. 
 May God forgive me ! I have been to blame. 
 Kiss me, my children." 
 
 Then they clung about 
 
 The old man's neck, and kiss'd him many times, 
 And all the man was broken with remorse ;

 And all his love came back a hundredfold ; 
 
 And for three hours he sobb'd o'er William's child, 
 
 Thinking of William. 
 
 So those four abode 
 
 Within one house together ; and as years 
 Went forward, Mary took another mate ; 
 But Dora lived unmarried till her death. 
 
 THE ART OF ANGLING 
 JEROME K. JEROME 
 
 (From Three Men in a oat t by special permission of 
 the Author) 
 
 I AM not a good fisherman myself. I devoted a consider- 
 able amount of attention to the subject at one time, and 
 was getting on, as I thought, fairly well ; but the old hands 
 told me that I should never be any real good at it, and 
 advised me to give it up. They said that I was an ex- 
 tremely neat thrower, and that I seemed to have plenty of 
 gumption for the thing, and quite enough constitutional 
 laziness. But I had not got sufficient imagination. 
 
 Some people are under the impression that all that is 
 required to make a good fisherman is the ability to tell lies 
 easily and without blushing ; but this is a mistake. Mere 
 bald fabrication is useless; the veriest tyro can manage 
 that. It is in the circumstantial detail, the embellishing 
 touches of probability, the general air of scrupulous 
 almost of pedantic veracity, that the experienced angler 
 is seen. 
 
 Anybody can come in and say, "Oh, I caught fifteen 
 dozen perch yesterday evening ; " or " Last Monday I

 landed a gudgeon, weighing eighteen pounds, and measur- 
 ing three feet from the tip to the tail." 
 
 There is no art, no skill, required for that sort of thing. 
 It shows pluck, but that is all. 
 
 No ; your accomplished angler would scorn to tell a lie, 
 that way. His method is a study in itself. 
 
 He comes in quietly with his hat on, appropriates the 
 most comfortable chair, lights his pipe, and commences to 
 puff in silence. He lets the youngsters brag away for a 
 while, and then, during a momentary lull, he removes the 
 pipe from his mouth, and remarks, as he knocks the ashes 
 out against the bars, 
 
 "Well, I had a haul on Tuesday evening that it's not 
 much good my telling anybody about." 
 
 " Oh ! how's that ? " they ask. 
 
 " Because I don't expect anybody would believe me if I 
 did," replies the old fellow calmly, and without even a 
 tinge of bitterness in his tone, as he refills his pipe. 
 
 " No," he continues thoughtfully ; " I shouldn't believe 
 it myself if anybody told it to me, but it's a fact, for all 
 that. I had been sitting there all the afternoon and had 
 caught literally nothing except a few dozen small 'uns; 
 and I was just about giving it up as a bad job, when I 
 suddenly felt a rather smart pull at the line. I thought it 
 was another little one, and I went to jerk it up. Hang me, 
 if I could move the rod ! It took me half an hour half 
 an hour, sir! to land that fish; and every moment I 
 thought the line was going to snap ! I reached him at last, 
 and what do you think it was ? A sturgeon ! a forty- 
 pound sturgeon ! taken on line, sir ! Yes, you may well 
 look surprised I'll have another three of Scotch, landlord, 
 please." 
 
 And then he goes on to tell of the astonishment of 
 everybody who saw it ; and what his wife said, when he 
 got home, and of what Joe Buggies thought about it.

 218 ELOCUTION 
 
 I asked the landlord of an inn up the river once, if it 
 did not injure him, sometimes, listening to the tales that 
 the fishermen about there told him ; and he said, 
 
 " Oh, no ; not now, sir. It did used to knock me over 
 a bit at first, but, lor' love you ! me and the missus we 
 listens to 'em all day now. It's what you're used to, you 
 know. It's what you're used to." 
 
 I knew a young man once he was a most conscientious 
 fellow and when he took to fly-fishing, he determined 
 never to exaggerate his hauls by more than twenty-five per 
 cent. 
 
 "When I have caught forty fish," said he, "then I will 
 tell people that I have caught fifty, and so on. But I will 
 not lie any more than that, because it is sinful to lie." 
 
 But the twenty-five-per-cent. plan did not work well at 
 all. He never was able to use it. The greatest number of 
 fish he ever caught in one day was three, and you can't add 
 twenty-five per cent, to three at least, not in fish. 
 
 So, he made one final arrangement with himself, which 
 he has held to ever since, and that was to count each fish 
 that he caught as ten, and to assume ten to begin with. For 
 example, if he did not catch any fish at all, then he said 
 he had caught ten fish you could never catch less than 
 ten fish by his system ; that was the foundation of it. 
 Then if by any chance he really did catch one fish, he 
 called it twenty; while two fish would count thirty, three 
 forty, and so on. 
 
 It is a simple and easily worked plan, and there has been 
 some talk lately of its being made use of by the angling 
 fraternity in general. Indeed, the Anglers' Association did 
 recommend its adoption about two years ago, but some of 
 the older members opposed it. They said they would 
 consider the idea if the number were doubled, and each 
 fish counted as twenty.

 should advise you to drop into one of the little village inns 
 and take a seat in the tap-room. You will be nearly sure 
 to meet one or two old rod-men, sipping their toddy there, 
 and they will tell you enough fishy stories, in half an hour, 
 to give you indigestion for a month. 
 
 George and I went for a walk to Wallingford on the 
 second evening, and, coming home, we called in at a little 
 river-side inn, for a rest, and other things. 
 
 We went into the parlour and sat down. There was an 
 old fellow there, smoking a long clay pipe, and we naturally 
 began chatting. 
 
 He told us that it had been a fine day to-day, and we told 
 him that it had been a fine day yesterday, and then we all told 
 each other that we thought it would be a fine day to-morrow. 
 
 After that it came out, somehow or other, that we were 
 strangers in the neighbourhood, and that we were going 
 away the next morning. 
 
 Then a pause ensued in the conversation, during which 
 our eyes wandered round the room. They finally rested 
 upon a dusty old glass case, fixed very high up above the 
 chimney-piece, and containing a trout. It rather fascinated 
 me, that trout; it was such a monstrous fish. In fact, at 
 first glance, I thought it was a cod. 
 
 " Ah ! " said the old gentleman, following the direction 
 of my gaze, " fine fellow that, ain't he ? " 
 
 "Quite uncommon," I murmured; and George asked 
 the old man how much he thought it weighed. 
 
 "Eighteen pounds six ounces," said our friend, rising 
 and taking down his coat. " Yes," he continued, " it wur 
 sixteen year ago, come the third o' next month, that I 
 landed him. I caught him just below the bridge with a 
 minnow. They told me he wur in the river, and I said I'd 
 have him out, and so I did. You don't see many fish 
 that size about here now, I'm thinking. Good-night, 
 gentlemen, good-night."

 And out he went, and left us alone. 
 
 We could not take our eyes off the fish after that. It 
 really was a remarkably fine fish. We were still looking 
 at it, when the local carrier, who had just stopped at the 
 inn, came to the door of the room with a pot of beer in 
 his hand, and he also looked at the fish. 
 
 " Good-sized trout, that," said George, turning round to 
 him. 
 
 "Ah ! you may well say that, sir," replied the man : and 
 then, after a pull at his beer, he added, " Maybe you wasn't 
 here, sir, when that fish was caught ? " 
 
 " No," we told him. We were strangers in the neigh- 
 bourhood. 
 
 "Ah!" said the carrier, "then, of course, how should 
 you ? It was nearly five years ago that I caught that 
 trout." 
 
 " Oh ! was it you who caught it, then ? " said I. 
 
 " Yes, sir," replied the genial old fellow. " I caught 
 him just below the lock leastways, what was the lock 
 then one Friday afternoon ; and the remarkable thing 
 about it is that I caught him with a fly. I'd gone out 
 pike-fishing, bless you, never thinking of a trout, and when 
 I saw that whopper on the end of my line, blest if it didn't 
 quite take me aback. Well, you see, he weighed twenty-six 
 pound. Good-night, gentlemen, good-night." 
 
 Five minutes afterwards, a third man came in, and de- 
 scribed how he had caught it early one morning, with 
 bleak ; and then he left, and a stolid, solemn-looking, 
 middle-aged individual came in, and sat down over by the 
 window. 
 
 None of us spoke for a while; but, at length, George 
 turned to the new-comer and said, 
 
 " I beg your pardon, I hope you will forgive the liberty 
 that we perfect strangers in the neighbourhood are 
 taking, but my friend here and myself would be so much

 obliged if you would tell us how you caught that trout up 
 there." 
 
 " Why, who told you I caught that trout ? " was the 
 surprised query. 
 
 We said that nobody had told us so, but somehow or 
 other we felt instinctively that it was he who had done it. 
 
 " Well, it's a most remarkable thing most remarkable," 
 answered the stolid stranger, laughing ; " because, as a 
 matter of fact, you are quite right. I did catch it. But 
 fancy your guessing it like that ! Dear me, it's really 
 a most remarkable thing." 
 
 And then he went on, and told us how it had taken 
 him half an hour to land it, and how it had broken his rod. 
 He said he had weighed it carefully when he reached 
 home, and it had turned the scale at thirty-four pounds. 
 
 He went in his turn, and when he was gone the landlord 
 came in to us. We told him the various histories we had 
 heard about his trout, and he was immensely amused, 
 and we all laughed very heartily. 
 
 " Fancy Jim Bates and Joe Muggles and Mr Jones and 
 old Billy Maunders all telling you that they had caught it. 
 Ha ! ha ! ha ! Well, that is good," said the honest old 
 fellow, laughing heartily. " Yes, they are the sort to give 
 it me^ to put up in my parlour, if they had caught it, they 
 are ! Ha ! ha ! ha ! " 
 
 And then he told us the real history of the fish. It 
 seemed that he had caught it himself, years ago, when he 
 was quite a lad ; not by any art or skill, but by that un- 
 accountable luck that appears to always wait upon a boy 
 when he plays the wag from school, and goes out fishing 
 on a sunny afternoon, with a bit of string tied on to the 
 end of a tree. 
 
 He said that bringing home that trout had saved him 
 from a whacking, and that even his schoolmaster had said 
 it was worth the rule-of-three and practice put together.

 He was called out of the room at this point, and George 
 and I again turned our gaze upon the fish. 
 
 It really was a most astonishing trout. The more we 
 looked at it, the more we marvelled at it. 
 
 It excited George so much that he climbed up on the 
 back of a chair to get a better view of it. 
 
 And then the chair slipped, and George clutched wildly 
 at the trout-case to save himself, and down it came with 
 a crash, George and the chair on top of it. 
 
 "You haven't injured the fish, have you?" I cried in 
 alarm, rushing up. 
 
 "I hope not," said George, rising cautiously and looking 
 about. 
 
 But he had. That trout lay shattered into a thousand 
 fragments I say a thousand, but they may have only been 
 nine hundred. I did not count them. 
 
 We thought it strange and unaccountable that a stuffed 
 trout should break up into little pieces like that. 
 
 And so it would have been strange and unaccountable, 
 if it had been a stuffed trout, but it was not. 
 
 That trout was plaster-of-Paris.

 SCREAMING TARN 223 
 
 Sunk on the table of the ridge 
 From its deep shores is nought to see : 
 The unresting wind lashes and chills 
 Its shivering ripples ceaselessly. 
 
 Three sides 'tis banked with stones aslant, 
 And down the fourth the rushes grow, 
 And yellow sedge fringing the edge 
 With lengthen'd image all arow. 
 
 'Tis square and black, and on its face 
 When noon is still, the mirrow'd sky 
 Looks dark and further from the earth 
 Than when you gaze at it on high. 
 
 At mid of night, if one be there, 
 
 So say the people of the hill 
 
 A fearful shriek of death is heard, 
 
 One sudden scream both loud and shrill. 
 
 And some have seen on stilly nights, 
 And when the moon was clear and round, 
 Bubbles which to the surface swam 
 And burst as if they held the sound. 
 
 'Twas in the days when hapless Charles 
 Losing his crown had lost his head, 
 This tale is told of him who kept 
 The inn upon the watershed : 
 
 He was a low-bred ruin'd man 
 Whom lawless times set free from fear : 
 One evening to his house there rode 
 A young and gentle cavalier.

 With curling hair and linen fair 
 And jewel-hilted sword he went ; 
 The horse he rode he had ridden far 
 And he was with his journey spent. 
 
 He asked a lodging for the night, 
 His valise from his steed unbound, 
 He let none bear it but himself 
 And set it by him on the ground. 
 
 " Here's gold or jewels," thought the host, 
 "That's carrying south to find the king." 
 He chattered many a loyal word, 
 And scraps of royal airs 'gan sing. 
 
 His guest thereat grew more at ease, 
 And o'er his wine he gave a toast, 
 But little ate, and to his room 
 Carried his sack behind the host. 
 
 " Now rest you well," the host he said, 
 But of his wish the word fell wide ; 
 Nor did he now forget his son 
 Who fell in fight by Cromwell's side. 
 
 Revenge and poverty have brought 
 Full gentler heart than his to crime ; 
 And he was one by nature rude, 
 Born to foul deeds at any time. 
 
 With unshod feet at dead of night 
 In stealth he to the guest-room crept, 
 Lantern and dagger in his hand, 
 And stabbed his victim while he slept.

 But as he struck a scream there came 
 A fearful scream so loud and shrill ; 
 He whelm'd the face with pillows o'er, 
 And lean'd till all had long been still. 
 
 Then to the face the flame he held 
 To see there should no life remain : 
 When lo ! his brutal heart was quell'd : 
 'Twas a fair woman he had slain. 
 
 The tan upon her face was paint, 
 The manly hair was torn away, 
 Soft was the breast that he had pierced ; 
 Beautiful in death she lay. 
 
 His was no heart to faint at crime, 
 Tho' half he wished the deed undone, 
 He pulled the valise from the bed 
 To find what booty he had won. 
 
 He cut the straps, and pushed within 
 His murderous fingers to the theft. 
 A deadly sweat came o'er his brow, 
 He had no sense or meaning left. 
 
 He touched not gold, it was not cold, 
 
 It was not hard, it felt like flesh. 
 
 He drew out by the curling hair 
 
 A young man's head and murder'd fresh ; 
 
 A young man's head, cut by the neck. 
 But what was dreader still to see, 
 Her whom he had slain he saw again, 
 The twain were like, as like can be.

 Brother and sister if they were, 
 
 Both in one shroud they now were wound, 
 
 Across his back and down the stair, 
 
 Out of the house without a sound. 
 
 He made his way unto the Tarn, 
 The night was dark and still and dank ; 
 The ripple chuckling 'neath the boat 
 Laughed as he drew it to the bank. 
 
 Upon the bottom of the boat 
 He laid his burden flat and low, 
 And on them laid the square sandstones 
 That round about the margin go. 
 
 Stone upon stone he weight'd them down, 
 Until the boat would hold no more ; 
 The free board now was scarce an inch : 
 He stripped his clothes and pushed from shore. 
 
 All naked to the middle pool 
 He swam behind in the dark night ; 
 And there he let the water in 
 And sank his terror out of sight. 
 
 He swam ashore, and donn'd his dress, 
 And scraped his bloody fingers clean ; 
 Ran home and on his victim's steed 
 Mounted, and never more was seen. 
 
 But to a comrade e'er he died 
 He told his story guess'd of none : 
 So from his lips the crime returned 
 To haunt the spot where it was done.

 THE REVEILLE 
 BRET HARTE 
 
 HARK ! I hear the tramp of thousands, 
 And of armed men the hum ; 
 Lo ! a nation's hosts have gathered 
 Round the quick alarming drum, 
 
 Saying, "Come, 
 
 Freemen, come: 
 
 Ere your heritage be worsted," said the quick 
 alarming drum. 
 
 " Let me of my heart take counsel : 
 War is not of life the sum ; 
 Who will stay and reap the harvest 
 When the autumn days will come ? " 
 
 But the drum 
 
 Echoed, " Come : 
 
 Death shall reap the braver harvest," said the 
 solemn-sounding drum. 
 
 " But when won the coming battle, 
 What of profit springs therefrom ? 
 What if conquest, subjugation, 
 Even greater ills become ? " 
 
 But the drum 
 
 Answered "Come: 
 
 You must do the sum to prove it," said the 
 Yankee-answering drum. 
 
 What if, " mid the cannon's thunder, 
 Whistling shot and bursting bomb, 
 When my brothers fall around me, 
 
 Should my heart grow cold and dumb ? "

 But the drum 
 Answered, " Come : 
 
 Better there in death united, than in life a 
 recreant, Come : " 
 
 Thus they answered, hoping, fearing, 
 Some in faith, and doubting some, 
 Till a trumpet voice proclaiming, 
 Said, " My chosen people, Come: " 
 
 Then the drum, 
 
 Lo ! was dumb. 
 
 For the great heart of the nation, throbbing, answered, 
 " Lord, we come ! "

 THE Autumn mists upon the land 
 
 Were greyly sad, low-lying ; 
 And down the vale the people's moan, 
 
 Like wind through reeds, was sighing, 
 For in his marble palace hall 
 
 Their great king lay a-dying. 
 
 Wise had he been and long of reign ; 
 
 Beneath his worthy sway 
 The country which he ruled was blest, 
 
 More prosperous day by day ; 
 The very slaves grew glad but now 
 
 The king a-dying lay.

 THE KING'S LAST VIGIL 229 
 
 About his silken canopy 
 
 The courtiers closely press'd, 
 And grizzled comrades, who, full oft, 
 
 Had met the foe at breast 
 Led on by him, now sobbed unshamed 
 
 As weakly as the rest. 
 Yet spake he nought. He turned his face 
 
 Toward the darkening wall. 
 Pain lulled, but one sharp-bladed thought 
 
 Held heart and soul in thrall ; 
 His quivering senses sank, and fear 
 
 Closed o'er him like a pall. 
 
 What ! had he met grim Death in field, 
 
 Times countless, undismayed, 
 And thrown the gauntlet of hot youth, 
 
 Now for old age, afraid, 
 To shrink back shuddering like a child 
 
 That's frightened of a shade ? 
 
 At length he bade all leave him. Ne'er 
 
 Could he a rebel brook ; 
 Dead was he scarce ; this was his will 
 
 To be by all forsook. 
 Each sadly went, but, as he pass'd, 
 
 Gazed back with loving look. 
 
 Then did the lone king, as a sword, 
 
 Take up in failing hand 
 The strength that once was his, which now 
 
 Dropt from his grasp like sand ; 
 Alone he wrestled with gaunt fear, 
 
 By that fear still unmann'd. 
 He sank back on his agate couch, 
 
 His brows cold, wan, and wet. 
 No help was nigh, and he, by Death 
 
 More cruelly beset,

 For quarter cried no more, but lay 
 Quite still, and fainter yet. 
 
 Silent the room was, drear, and chill, 
 
 With twilight filling fast, 
 But on a sudden that great fear 
 
 From the king's soul quick pass'd ; 
 'Twas as a garment which his soul 
 
 From its nude form had cast. 
 
 A presence stood beside his bed, 
 
 A presence of sweet birth : 
 Our Lord the Christ in robes of white, 
 
 As when He walked the earth 
 Whose smile divine holds Life and Death, 
 
 Alike, of transient worth. 
 
 Then mildly Christ spake : " Follow Me," 
 
 And silent rose the king, 
 And, without fear, left bed and hall. 
 
 And passed out marvelling 
 The busy streets were crowded full 
 
 It seemed a wondrous thing. 
 
 Beyond the palace, down the hill, 
 
 And out the city gate ; 
 (Strange that no man should bar the way 
 
 With speech importunate !) 
 The church-bells softly tolled the while. 
 
 The Lord for naught did wait. 
 
 On went the shining figure, on 
 
 By sentries unobserved ; 
 So eke the king, with hasting step 
 
 And strength that never swerved. 
 Familiar lay the road straight marked, 
 
 And line of forest curved.

 Behind them paled the frowning walls, 
 
 The very town grew dim ; 
 Still He that led the way kept on, 
 
 The other followed Him ; 
 At length they reached an unknown space, 
 
 A broad green meadow's rim. 
 
 There in the mead among the grass 
 
 Most lovely flowers grew, 
 Beauteous in shape, in perfume steep'd, 
 
 Transcendent fair of hue ; 
 There amaranth and asphodel 
 
 In deathless garland blew. 
 
 There stayed the Lord, and said and smiled : 
 
 " These flow'rs that thou dost see, 
 Each is an action good or kind, 
 
 My servant, done for Me, 
 While thou for a short space on earth 
 
 Wast chosen king to be." 
 
 But, as the king looked, bursting tears 
 
 From his worn eyes down ran, 
 And deep emotion shook his heart. 
 
 Alas ! in mortal span, 
 How less had he achieved of good 
 
 Than any other man ! 
 
 Yet bent the Lord, and gently pluck'd 
 
 From mossy green retreat 
 One tiny blossom hid by leaves, 
 
 One blossom at His feet, 
 And in His bosom placed He it 
 
 That blossom pure and sweet. 
 
 Whilst, one by one, the meek king knew 
 His deeds of bygone days ;

 Some, now least fair, which earned of yore 
 
 Loud songs of fulsome praise, 
 Some which no paeans graced, unshrined, 
 
 Bright now as sunlight rays ; 
 
 And, most of all divinely blest 
 
 The Christ's touch to have won, 
 Yon flower, a puny secret act, 
 
 Guessed, chronicled by none ! 
 Well he recalled how hard the fight, 
 
 For right's sake, had been done ! 
 
 So great a fight, so small a thing ! 
 
 He cast him on his knees, 
 Shamed that it were such sacrifice 
 
 The dear Lord Christ to please, 
 And grievous tears which blurred his sight 
 
 Hid the sweet flowers and leas. 
 
 The figure of his Lord grew dim : 
 
 He would have clasped it fain. 
 He stretched his hands, and groped, and sought, 
 
 But stretched them all in vain : 
 The fields were empty, and he cried 
 
 With an exceeding pain. 
 
 But lo ! a mystic voice uprose 
 
 Out from the windless west : 
 " My son, if one poor act of thine 
 
 Before thy God be blest, 
 Surely this trembling faith thou own'st 
 
 On His great strength may rest." 
 
 So stood the king, glad-browed. All fear 
 
 Lost in new joy, he gazed 
 Above, for dawn was breaking clear, 
 
 And blinding mists were raised.

 The Lord's high name he praised. 
 
 And, turning, saw where far behind

 In glory of pearl and gold.

 So the soldier spoke, and, staggering, fell amid the snow : 
 While ever on the dreary Heights, down came the snow ! 
 
 " Men, it must be as he asks : duty must be done : 
 Far too few for half our tasks, we can spare not one !

 Look, a little growing heap, snow above the snow 
 
 Where heavy, on his heavy sleep, down fell the snow ! 
 
 Strong hands raised him voices strong spoke within his

 But his dreams had softer tongue : neither now he hears ! 
 One more gone, for England's sake, where so many go 
 Lying down without complaint dying in the snow ! 
 Starving, striving for her sake dying in the snow ! 
 
 Daily toil untended pain danger ever by :

 Till reason and thought begin to wane, 
 
 And only the dull, blind sense of pain, 
 
 And the instinct of Duty till Death, remains. 
 
 On in the snow on in the snow 
 
 The cruel, drifting, deadly snow, 
 
 They march in silence, with muffled tread : 
 
 Till one of them stumbles, and drops behind, dead ! 
 
 And the others shudder, and glance around 
 
 For they hear, growing nearer, an ominous sound 
 
 In the woods the dismal howl 
 
 Of the wolves that after them stealthily prowl. 
 
 By open waste by dreary wood 
 
 By rivers black and frozen flood 
 
 On in the snow on in the snow 
 
 Ever, with thinning ranks, they go. 
 
 The Prince Emilius looked on his band, 
 And his heart seemed like to break. 
 These were the men, who, for his sake, 
 Had left their Fatherland, 
 A thousand men in all, 
 To follow his bugle-call, 
 Three months before ! a thousand men 
 And of that thousand now he counted ten ! 
 
 " Halt ! " cried the Prince. The spectral band 
 
 Stood still awaiting his command. 
 
 " My men it is best we face the truth. 
 
 We shall not leave this place. 
 
 The end has come God knoweth best,

 You well have borne your part in life : 
 
 Bear it in death as well. On high 
 
 Perchance I'll rise to testify 
 
 To your unflinching loyalty. 
 
 My brothers ! Though we lay us down 
 
 Defeated, and without renown, 
 
 There we shall wear the Victor's crown." 
 
 Silent they stood, and silently they heard, 
 
 They could not answer : none could speak a word. 
 
 But when, " Is it agreed ? " Emilius said, 
 
 Each man looked up at him, and bowed the head. 
 
 The Prince Emilius went to every man, 
 
 Slim youth, or stern-browed veteran, 
 
 And kissed him, holding fast his hand: 
 
 He dare not speak lest he should be unmanned. 
 
 So, moving toward the hut, he pushed the door 
 
 Open ; then, looking on them all once more, 
 
 He flung himself upon the cold earth floor. 
 
 He heard the soldiers pause outside the hut, 
 
 They came in slowly, then the door was shut 
 
 And all grew still and dark as death. 
 
 Soon as they heard the deep drawn breath 
 
 Which told them Prince Emilius slept 
 
 (For they a wakeful watch had kept), 
 
 They all rose up, and softly crept 
 
 Up towards the sleeping man. 
 
 Each began to strip off coat and cloak : this done, 
 
 They placed them lightly, one by one, 
 
 Upon the young Prince lying there. 
 
 Till of their own warm clothes they made 
 
 A covering that might frost defy. 
 
 Then they crept out, all silently : 
 
 And, in the snow, beneath that freezing sky, 
 
 Some, hand in hand, all clustered near the door 
 
 They laid them down, and slept to wake no more.

 The long still hours of sleep, 
 
 Silence, and darkness deep, 
 
 Seemed frozen into endless night. 
 
 Over the sky a cold sad light 
 
 Had turned the world to death-like gray, 
 
 When the Prince woke. Another day ! 
 
 Is it a dream ? He looks around. 
 
 Alone ! He calls no answer not a sound ! 
 
 How has he lived through all the night ? 
 
 And how withstood the deadly blight 
 
 Of frost as he lay there asleep. 
 
 What's this ? He lies beneath a heap 
 
 Of cloaks and coats ! In heart and limb 
 
 He feels new life. His senses swim, 
 
 A sudden light breaks in on him ; 
 
 He struggles up from off the floor ; 
 
 He staggers quickly toward the door 
 
 He bursts it open rushes out and lo ! 
 
 The men, half naked, in the shroud-like snow. 
 
 In one swift glance he reads the truth, and then 
 
 The cry goes up, " My men ! my faithful men ! " 
 
 Faithful, and not in vain. 
 
 French soldiers, ere the hour was gone, 
 
 Came past, and with them he went on. 
 
 For him thus saved the years to come 
 
 Brought light and honour without stain ; 
 
 And shouts of welcome brought him home 
 
 In triumph to his own again. 
 
 Yet oft, in golden summer-time, 
 In his own Rhineland, when his ears 
 Would catch the well-remembered chime 
 Of bells he knew in boyhood's years ; 
 His eyes would fill with sudden tears, 
 And he would see that hut that stood

 "ONE MORE" 
 AN OLD SKIPPER'S STORY 
 
 ROBERT OVERTON 
 
 (From Character Sketches (Dean & Son) by special 
 permission of the Author) 
 
 I KNOWED puffectly well all along that he were after some- 
 thing of the sort. It began by him a-seeing of her home 
 one night from a concert. ( What there is in these here 
 new-fangled concerts I can't see ; none of yer squalling, 
 screechy haltoes and tenners and falsetterses for me. 
 Give me a good roaring old chorus, with everybody a- 
 clinking their glasses, and where it don't signify_what toone 
 you likes to work in the more the merrier. But^ as I 
 said, it began along of one of these concerts. Katie 
 that's my daughter ; and a pretty, well-fitted, trim-built little 
 craft as ever I see, tho' I says it had been to sing one 
 of her songs the " Old Gray Robin " I think they call 
 it no ; " Old Robin Gray," that's it and just on account 
 of it a-coming on to rain a bit, he must conwoy her into 
 harbour. I 'eerd the knock, and I went to the door 
 myself. 
 
 " Oh, thank you, papa dear," says Katie, giving me a 
 kiss and a hug, " this is Mr Charlie Hall, who has been 
 so kind as to see me home." 
 
 "Good evening, Captain Quarters," he says, a-'ailing me. 
 
 "Good evernin', Mr 'All," I says, a-'ailin' him back.

 "ONE MORE" 239 
 
 " I daresay my daughter," I says, " could have fetched port 
 all right without none of your conwoy," I says ; " but as 
 you are here," I says, very polite, "cast anchor for a spell," 
 I says. 
 
 " Do you mean come in?" he asks, laughing. 
 
 I'd been having a glass of grog, or maybe five or six, 
 whilst I was waiting for Katie to come in ; and I see Katie 
 up with the tray and put everything in the cupboard soon 
 as we got in the room. 
 
 That was always the one weak point in that girl's 
 character. Soon as ever I give up the sea and settled 
 ashore to watch over her, which was when her mother went 
 on the last cruise of all, poor lass ! that wench began 
 a-limitin' my grog. She wasn't nasty about it; but, when 
 she thought I'd had enough, off went the tray ; and, if I 
 said I wanted some more, she used to come and kiss me, 
 and say " I don't think you do, papa dear, do you ? " and 
 somehow I never did want no more then. 
 
 Well, just as we all three got settled round the fire that 
 evernin' Katie by the table and me and young 'All, one 
 to port and t'other to starb'd of the coals I fills up my 
 pipe and hands over another long clay to him, along of 
 some nice black tobaccy. He fills his pipe, but, as to 
 smokin' it well, he puffed and gasped and coughed, and 
 grew black and green and blue in the face ; and at last he 
 said he remembered he had promised his widdered mother 
 never to smoke cavendish. 
 
 " He's a milksop," I says to myself. Not that he were a 
 bad-looking sort of lubber. He stood somewhere about 
 six feet, and had a fine navy-blue sort of a heye, and a 
 figurehead as was neat and smart. 
 
 Soon I wanted another glass of grog wanted it bad. Of 
 course if young 'All had a glass, I should be forced to 
 drink one with him, so, when Katie wasn't looking, I says 
 in a 'usky voice, " Awast ! " I says.

 " What's the matter, Captain ? " he says. 
 
 I jerks my thumb to Katie, and winks very deep and 
 artful, thinking he'd understand what I was driving at. 
 Then I says, " Katie, my dear, I think Mr 'All would like a 
 drop of grog ! " But I fancy that artful girl must have 
 give him a look, for I'm blowed if he did'nt say, " No, 
 Captain, thanks I'm a sort of teetotaler ! " 
 
 " He's a lubberly, chicken-hearted milksop," I says ; and 
 I set my face agin him from that very first evernin'. 
 
 The excuses that young man made for a-coming to rm 
 house after that was something awful; and by-and-bye I 
 noticed Katie and him was a outrageous long time in sayin' 
 " good-bye " at the front door. I says so to her e 
 
 and she says, " I'm afraid there is a swelling in the wood in 
 that front door, papa it doesn't shut at all easy ! " 
 
 I must say that when young 'All put the matter to me it 
 were done shipshape and proper. 
 
 "Captain," he says, "I love her; I'm a-getting on 
 very well, and have you any objection to our being 
 engaged ? " 
 
 " What are yer ? " I says. 
 
 " I'm something in the City," he answers. 
 
 " Werry good," I says ; "I must have a court-martial on 
 this here matter," I says ; " ring that bell." 
 
 He rings the bell, and in comes our little servant girl. 
 
 "I want Miss Katie," I says, "and some rum and hot 
 water. "_^ 
 
 "When Katie come in, looking so sweet and timid and 
 bashful, I thought of her mother the poor dead lass I 
 loved so deep and tender and I only says to 'em as they 
 stood afore me, " I sha'n't have no engagement," I says ; 
 " I can't spare my little girl till I've seen more of the man 
 who wants to take her from me, but you can come here, 
 mate, occasional," I says to young 'All, "only I sha'n't 
 have no engagement just yet."

 But I'm afraid they didn't quite catch hold of my mean- 
 ing, for that night I stepped into the passage to look after 
 that swelling of the wood, and I 'eerd what young 'All 
 said. He says to her, says he, " One More ! " he says. 
 
 And after that, he come in occasional every night, and 
 the swelling of the wood in the front door got worse and 
 worsen 
 
 One morning at breakfast I made a remark that the 
 postman was very late in passing. " He's got caught in a 
 squall, I expect," says I, "or got throwed on his beam ends 
 by the ice." 
 
 "Why, don't you know, papa," says Katie, "this is 
 Valentine's Day, and of course the poor postman has such 
 a lot of letters to deliver, he's sure to be a little late. I 
 expect a letter myself this morning," she says. 
 
 "Who from?" I asks. 
 
 "Have another egg, papa dear," she answers. 
 
 Sure enough there come a valentine for Katie from the 
 young man she were not engaged to. It was a hijeous 
 thing a lot of flowers and verses; and a lubber with a 
 torch, as Katie said were a hymen, standing by ready to set 
 fire to the whole lot ; and at the top was a Cupid, in the 
 most undelicatest clothes I ever see. He wore nothing but 
 a bow and harrer. 
 
 "Isn't it lovely?" says Katie. "Oh! pa, isn't it 
 lovely?" 
 
 " No," I says. " I don't see no sense in sending a thing 
 like that ; and that Cupid," I says, " ought to be ashamed of 
 hisself. Now, there'd a-been some sense," I says, " if he'd 
 sent you say the picture of a ship, with you and him a- 
 steppingon board, saloon passengers, passage paid; and 
 a picture of me at the top as a gardening hangel, a-super- 
 intending everything. But understand me," I says, "in 
 proper clothes, not to catch my death of cold like that 
 undelicate Cupid."

 I remember that day well, because that was the time I 
 had a row with Charlie 'All, and forbid him the house. 
 
 We was sitting together in the parlour that night, Katie 
 away getting supper ready. All of a sudden he says, 
 "Captain, what made you so awfully bald?" 
 
 Now, I never liked his laughing, ridiculing ways ; and I 
 answers very short, 
 
 " Booty." 
 
 " How do you mean ? " he says. 
 
 " We was in the China seas, one time when I was on 
 board the Morton Bay" 
 
 " Yes," he says ; " go on." 
 
 "We was attacked by pirates," I says; "and the 
 Captain ordered me to stand forrard, and never to leave a 
 certain spot on deck till he gave me leave. They carried 
 cannon, them pirates did, and they opened fire at me." 
 
 " You didn't move ? " he says. 
 
 " Not a inch," I answers ; " but a cannon ball hit me on 
 the port side of the head." 
 
 " You never stirred ? " 
 
 " Not a inch," I says again ; " only the cannon ball 
 carried off all the hair that side. I think them pirates got 
 the range after that shot," I says. 
 
 " Why ? " asks young 'All. 
 
 " Because there come a second ball and hit me on the 
 starb'd side of the head and carried off all the hair that 
 side." 
 
 We didn't talk no more for a spell, and then he says, 
 very serious, " And how did you lose the top ? " 
 
 "I was afraid there'd cornea third ball," I says, "and 
 the top came off in the fright." 
 
 I got up to leave soon after that : and just as I got in 
 the passage, when he thought I'd closed the door, I 'eerd 
 him say, " The bald-headed old impostor ! " laughing to 
 himself as he said it.

 Now to be called a impostor would have been bad 
 enough ; to be called a old impostor was worse ; and to be 
 called by such a epitaph as a bald-headed old impostor was 
 unbearable. 
 
 I turned round into the room again, and there was a 
 awful row. One word led to another ; and at last I told 
 him never to come aboard my house no more. And I says, 
 " Don't send no more of your valentines here," I says, 
 "with undelicate Cupids, to my daughter, as have been

 but it was no use. 
 
 " May I see Katie before I go ? " he says. 
 
 "No." 
 
 Then he turned to the door, flung it open, and walked 
 away with never a word. 
 
 I never knew properly how it happened ; but I did find 
 out afterwards that he met Katie and asked her to marry 
 him right off. She wouldn't leave me like that, stupid and 
 cruel as I was; and then young 'All threatened to go 
 away and enlist for a soldier. She clung to him and 
 begged him to stand by till the storm went down ; but he 
 was mad with love, I suppose, for he swore she didn't care 
 for him ; and in his love and anger, he kept his word, and 
 he left her and enlisted. 
 
 Almost before we knowed what he'd done, his regiment 
 was ordered off ordered to the Crimea, and away he 
 went. 
 
 It was bad weather in our little home after that. I 
 wouldn't own to being wrong ; but in my heart I knowed I 
 was ; and I used to sit lonely, night after night, smokin' 
 an' thinkin' thinkin' about young 'All, with his neat, 
 shapely figurehead, and bright eyes and fair hair, and 
 straight body thinkin' of him away in the dreadful trenches, 
 with the bitter snow falling on the livin', and the dyin', 
 and the dead.

 The weeks passed slowly away and we got no news from 
 Charlie or of him, till one night Katie come into the room 
 with an open letter in her hand ; and all the light had gone 
 from her winsome eyes and her pretty face as she sank 
 with a low cry at my feet, and hid her head upon my knees. 
 I took the paper from her poor little fluttering trembling 
 hand. It was a letter from the Captain of Charlie's 
 company, dated " Before Sebastopql." 
 
 This is a part of it : "A fierce attack was made by the ^ 
 Russians last night upon our trenches. The night was 
 bitterly cold and very dark, and snow was falling thickly 
 when the attack was commenced. The enemy crept on us 
 through the darkness and the snow, so silently, that we had 
 very short notice. The fighting was very desperate, and 
 we were almost driven out. Suddenly the Russians made 
 a steady stand, and renqwed the attack. One of the enemy 
 disarmed me ; my sword was lying broken at my feet ; he 
 had seized me by the throat. I was powerless in his grasp, 
 and his sword was raised high for my death-stroke, when 
 suddenly a soldier of my company, already sorely wounded, 
 staggered up to us, and deliberately threw himself between 
 my bared head and the Russian blade, and the stroke 
 intended for me fell upbn his own noble and gallant head. 
 We fell together ; I staggered to my feet, and help arriving, 
 the Russian fled. . . . The dawn was just breaking when I 
 knelt beside the man whose heroic devotion had saved my life. 
 He was lying in the snow, holy with his own brave blood, a 
 ray of the rising sun shining round his head like a halo of 
 glory. He spoke only once as I raised him into the litter 
 which bore him to the hospital, and the few words that my 
 gallant comrade, Charles Hall, uttered bade me write to J 
 you . . . . " -^j 
 
 An awful mist was in my eyes, and I could read no more. 
 Then Katie put her hand into her bosom and drew out a 
 paper, and she pointed, still without a word, but with still

 an awful look upon her face, to a list of soldiers' deaths, 
 and the first name I see was Charles Hall. 
 
 Days and weeks passed by I can't bear to think of that 
 time, much less to speak about it and one night (I 
 remember it same as though 'twas five minutes ago) I 'eerd 
 a step. Katie 'eerd it too, and for a moment a bright 
 colour leaped into her face, and a light into her eye, but 
 only for a moment, to leave her paler than before. P'r'aps 
 you'll guess what's coming, the old tale of a mistake, and 
 miscarried letters, for our brave boy had recovered from 
 that awful blow. Katie goes to the door I hears the click 
 of the lock, and then one long, loud scream. 
 "Charlie!" 
 
 I burst into the passage, and there, fainting, was Katie, 
 clasped tight and close in the arms of young 'All. 
 
 I've always believed as that sight sent me for a few 
 minutes clean out of my mind. I tore back into the parlour 
 like a raving luniac, mistook the cat for a lump o' coal and 
 jammed her on top of the fire, and couldn't make out 
 what she was yowling about, till our little servant come 
 flying into the room like a Yankee schooner before the 
 wind. I took hold of her, and give her a roaring kiss, not 
 knowing what I was doing, and shouted " Fire ! " 
 
 I needn't tell you what the end was. When, looking 
 so grand in his serjeant-major's uniform, with the medals 
 on his great big chest, Charlie took my little Katie to 
 church, her looking so fair and beautiful in her white bride's 
 dress, with the orange blossoms round her head, my heart 
 was near to burstin' with joy and pride and thankfulness. 
 
 When it come to my part in the service to give a answer 
 out loud, my feelings overcome me, though they'd been 
 laying it into me for weeks past as I must be very careful 
 to say nothing except the few words in the parson's log- 
 book, and Katie had locked up all the grog since the night 
 afore. The parson asked very solemn who give her away ?

 " I do, mate," I says ; " and I'll be scuttled if I could 
 give her to a better man ! " 
 
 When Charlie left the army, and Katie and him settled 
 down here, I come to end my days along of 'em, and along 
 of the dear little children, the little Katies and the little 
 serjeant-majors who keep on a-comin' to town. God bless 
 'em ! Bless the little voices that is such sweet music to my 
 old ears ! the little hands that stroke my face, and the little 
 soft lips that kiss my rough cheeks. I say God bless my 
 children's little children ! "

 care. Whence then the anxious eye, the altered tone, the 
 dull presentiment no heart would own ? It is not that they 
 know the spoiler waits, harnessed for battle, at the brazen 
 gates; it is not that they hear the watchman's call mark 
 the slow minutes on the leaguered wall : the clash of 
 quivers and the ring of spears make pleasant music in a 
 soldier's ears; and not a scabbard hideth sword to-night, 
 that hath not glimmered in the front of fight. May not 
 the blood in every beating vein have quick foreknowledge 
 of some coming pain? even as the prisoned silver, dead 
 and dumb, shrinks at cold Winter's footfall ere he come. 
 
 The King is troubled, and his heart's unrest heaves the 
 broad purple of his belted breast : sudden he speaks 
 " What ! doth the beaded juice savour like hyssop, that 
 ye scorn its use? wear ye so pitiful and sad a soul that 
 tramp of foeman scares ye from the bowl ? Think ye the 
 gods, on yonder starry floor, tremble for terror when the 
 thunders roar? Are we not gods? have we not fought 
 with God ? and shall we shiver at a robber's nod ? No ! 
 let them batter till the brazen bars ring merry mocking of 
 their idle wars ; their fall is fated for to-morrow's sun ; the 
 lion rouses when his feast is done : crown me a cup and 
 fill the bowls we brought from Judah's temple when the 
 fight was fought : drink, till the merry madness fills the 
 soul, to Salem's conqueror, in Salem's bowl ! " 
 
 His eager lips are on the jewelled brink hath the cup 
 poison that he doubts to drink ? is there a spell upon the 
 sparkling gold, that so his fevered fingers quit their hold ? 
 Whom sees he where he gazes? What is there freezing 
 his vision into fearful stare ? . . . 
 
 There cometh forth a Hand ! upon the stone graving 
 the symbols of a speech unknown ; fingers like mortal 
 fingers ! leaving there on the blank wall flashing characters 
 of fear ; and still it glideth silently and slow, and still 
 beneath the spectral letters grow ! now, the scroll endeth

 now, the seal is set the Hand is gone ! the record 
 tarries yet. 
 
 With wand of ebony and sable stole, Chaldaea's wisest 
 scan the spectral scroll : strong in the lessons of a lying 
 art, each comes to gaze, but gazes to depart ; and still, for 
 mystic sign and muttered spell, the graven letters guard 
 their secret well ; gleam they for warning ? glare they to 
 condemn? God speaketh, but He speaketh not for 
 them. 
 
 Oh ! ever ; when the happy laugh is dumb, all the joy 
 gone, and all the anguish come; when strong adversity 
 and subtle pain wring the sad soul and rack the throbbing 
 brain ; when friends once faithful, hearts once all our own, 
 leave us to weep, to bleed, and die alone; when fears 
 and cares the lonely thought employ, and clouds of sorrow 
 hide the sun of joy ; when weary life, breathing reluctant 
 breath, hath no hope sweeter than the hope of death; 
 then, the best counsel and the best relief to cheer the 
 spirit or to cheat the grief, the only calm, the only com- 
 fort heard, comes in the music of a Woman's word : like 
 beacon-bell, on some wild island-shore, silvery ringing in 
 the tempest's roar, whose sound, borne shipward through 
 the midnight gloom, tells of the path, and turns her from 
 her doom. 
 
 So, in the silence of that awful hour, when baffled magic 
 mourned its parted power when Kings were pale and 
 Satraps shook for fear a Woman speaketh and the wisest 
 hear. She the high daughter of a thousand thrones, 
 telling, with trembling lip and timid tones, of him the 
 Captive, in the feast forgot, who readeth visions him, 
 whose wondrous lot sends him to lighten doubt and lessen 
 gloom, and gaze undazzled on the days to come Daniel

 Calmly and silent as the fair full moon comes sailing

 passed along, so from before him fell the festal throng. 
 His lip was steady and his accent clear, " The King hath

 "Art thou the Prophet? read me yonder scroll whose 
 undeciphered horror daunts my soul : there shall be 
 guerdon for the grateful task, fitted for me to give, for

 rulers still, and setting up as sovereign whom He will. 
 Oh ! hadst thou treasured, in repentant breast, thy father's 
 pride, fall, penitence and rest, and bowed submissive to 
 Jehovah's will, then had thy sceptre been a sceptre still. But 
 thou hast mocked the majesty of Heaven, and shamed the 
 vessels to its service given ; and thou hast fashioned idols of 
 thine own idols of gold, of silver and of stone : to them hast 
 bowed the knee, and breathed the breath, and they must 
 help thee in the hour of death. Woe for the sign unseen, 
 the sin forgot ! God was among ye, and ye knew it not ! 
 Hear what He writeth there : ' Thy race is run ; thy years

 fateful hour 
 That checked the tyrant's mad pursuit of conquest and of 
 
 power : 
 To "holy" Moscow's empty walls the baffled conqueror 
 
 came 
 
 To face no foe of flesh and blood, but one of ice and flame. 
 Now, when from Moscow's burning walls the Russians all 
 
 have fled, 
 
 Why lingers still Ivanowitch among those scenes so dread ? 
 A soldier, handsome, young, and brave, and faithful to the 
 
 Czar, 
 
 Michael Ivanowitch had fought with honour in the war ; 
 His country and his king he loved, but even than these 
 
 more dear 
 Was one whose sweet and gracious voice was ever in his 
 
 ear, 
 Whose eyes were his lodestars, whose heart to him in love 
 
 was given, 
 Who seemed to his all-partial eyes the fairest under 
 
 Heaven. 
 
 But now this loved one dying lay, torn by a bursting shell, 
 And Michael's hatred of the foe burned like the fire of 
 
 hell.

 Sitting in anguish by her side, what cared he to go free ; 
 Dear were his life and liberty, but dearer far was she. 
 Thus lonely, in the midst of foes, while all around had fled, 
 He sat amid those awful scenes beside her dying bed. 
 " Michael," she whispered, lovingly, in accents weak and 
 
 faint, 
 
 " Go, fetch me from the village priest the picture of a saint, 
 A holy picture, love, and hold it to my lips, that I 
 May kiss it, be absolved from sin, and so in peace may 
 
 die." 
 He placed a kiss upon her brow, then stole out on his 
 
 quest. 
 While grief, despair, and hatred made a turmoil in his 
 
 breast. 
 Through buried and deserted streets, in the cold and silent 
 
 night, 
 His rapid footsteps bore him till the priest's house came in 
 
 sight. 
 The priest had fled, driven from his home by the invading 
 
 foe; 
 
 And Michael, through the casement saw, lit by the fire- 
 light's glow, 
 Recumbent forms of armed men, who wrapped in slumber 
 
 lay 
 Upon the matted floor : one prayer for help did Michael 
 
 pray, 
 Then with tense nerves and beating heart, he entered 
 
 silently, 
 And through the sleeping figures thrid his way, until his 
 
 eye 
 
 Fell on the picture of a saint that hung upon the wall ; 
 He seized it, hid it 'neath his cloak when suddenly the fall 
 Of some embers from the fire awoke a sleeper from his rest, 
 And ere Ivanowitch could flee, French swords were at his 
 
 breast,

 And fierce-faced men around him stood, who shouted 
 
 " Traitor ! " " Spy ! " 
 "Move not a step : lift not a hand: or, by the gods, you 
 
 die ! " 
 But Michael, quailing not, replied, "No traitor here you 
 
 see, 
 Nor spy : on peaceful errand bent, I pray you set me 
 
 free." 
 " What's that beneath your cloak ? " they sneered. Then 
 
 speaking low and faint, 
 
 As slowly from its folds he took the picture of the saint, 
 He said, "The woman whom I love is dying : cruel fate ! 
 And her dying lips would kiss it ; let me pass ere 'tis too 
 
 late." 
 "A likely tale!" they laughed; and "Shoot the Russian 
 
 dog ! " some cried, 
 But " Stay ! " their captain said. " He may be useful as our 
 
 guide," 
 
 Then turning to Ivanowitch, " Your life is ours, you know, 
 But France has need of soldiers : come, no longer be our 
 
 foe, 
 Swear allegiance to Napoleon, save your life, and take this 
 
 gold ! " 
 But proudly Michael answered them, " My honour is not 
 
 sold! 
 Deal with my life as ye have power, my faith's a sacred 
 
 thing, 
 
 Ye cannot make me traitor to my country and my king ! " 
 Nor bribes nor threats could move him. Then the French- 
 man, with a sneer, 
 Replied, "So staunch; but we shall find a way yet, never 
 
 fear! 
 
 Bring me the branding-iron ! " so they made the iron hot, 
 And brought it to their captain. On either cheek a bright

 Burned on the Russian's face, yet no sign of fear he 
 
 gave, 
 But looked upon those cruel men with visage stern and 
 
 grave. 
 They seized his arm, and on the quivering flesh of his left 
 
 hand, 
 The letter "N," Napoleon's sign, burned with the fiery 
 
 brand, 
 Then flung him free, and while he wiped the anguish from 
 
 his brow, 
 Laughed in his face " No more the Czar's : you are 
 
 Napoleon's now ! " 
 
 One moment only did he show the rage and pain he felt. 
 Then seized the sharp and gleaming axe suspended from 
 
 his belt, 
 And with the lightning's swiftness, ere they guessed of his 
 
 design, 
 Had severed from the wrist the hand that bore the hateful 
 
 sign, 
 
 And flung the bleeding fragment at the captain of hussars 
 " There ! take what is your Emperor's ; I am heart and 
 
 soul the Czar's ! " 
 
 Silent a space the Frenchman stood, confounded and 
 
 abashed, 
 Then, from his eyes, unused to tears, the falling moisture 
 
 dashed, 
 And said, " Forgive me ! let me bind your bleeding wrist 
 
 for you : 
 Our Emperor himself were proud of hearts so brave and 
 
 true; 
 Farewell, my brother ! May we meet in better cheer some

 IT was a dull October morning and heavy rolling fog 
 wreaths lay low over the wet, grey roofs of the Woolwich 
 houses. There were few folks in the streets, as a comely 
 girl of about twenty with honest grey eyes touched Mrs 
 Simpson, Gregory Brewster's housekeeper, timidly on the 
 arm and said, " I think this is No. 56. Can you tell me 
 if Mr Brewster lives here ? " 
 
 "You're Norah Brewster, I s'pose," said the house-

 "Yes. I've come to look after my grand-uncle

 folk took a turn at it, for I've had enough. There you 
 are, young woman, in you go, and make yourself at 
 home." 
 
 Thus left to her own devices, the country girl walked 
 into the front room and took off her hat and jacket. It 
 was a low-roofed apartment with a spluttering fire, upon 
 which a small brass kettle was singing cheerily. Norah 
 Brewster looked rapidly about her, and in an instant took 
 over her new duties. Ere five minutes had passed the tea 
 was made, two slices of bacon were frizzling on the pan, the 
 table was rearranged, and the whole room had taken a 
 new air of comfort and neatness. This done, she looked 
 round curiously at the prints upon the wall. Over the fire- 
 place, in a small, square case, a brown medal caught her 
 eye, hanging from a strip of purple ribbon. Beneath was a 
 slip of newspaper-cutting yellow with age, which ran thus : 
 
 " On Tuesday an interesting ceremony was performed at 
 the barracks of the 3rd Regiment of Guards, when, in the 
 presence of the Prince Regent, Lord Hill, Lord Saltoun, 
 and an assemblage which comprised beauty as well as 
 valour, a special medal was presented to Corporal 
 Gregory Brewster, of Captain Haldane's Flank Company, 
 in recognition of his gallantry in the recent great battle in 
 the Lowlands. It appears that on the ever-memorable i8th 
 of June, four Companies of the 3rd Guards, under the com- 
 mand of Colonels Maitland and Byng, held the important 
 farm-house of Hougomont at the right of the British 
 position. At a critical point of the action these troops 
 found themselves short of powder. Col. Byng despatched 
 Corporal Brewster to the rear to hasten up the reserve 
 ammunition. Brewster came upon two powder tumbrils of 
 the Nassau division, and succeeded, after menacing the 
 drivers with his musket, in inducing them to convey their 
 powder to Hougomont. In his absence, however, the

 hedges surrounding the position had been set on fire by a 
 howitzer battery of the French, and the passage of the carts 
 full of powder became a most hazardous matter. The first 
 tumbril exploded, blowing the driver to fragments. Daunted 
 by the fate of his comrade, the second driver turned his 
 horses, but Corporal Brewster, springing upon his seat, 
 hurled the man down, and urging the powder cart through 
 the flames, succeeded in forcing a way to his companions. 
 To this gallant deed may be directly attributed the success 
 of the British arms. Long may the heroic Brewster live to 
 treasure the medal which he has so bravely won, and to 
 look back with pride to the day when, in the presence of 
 his comrades, he received this tribute to his valour from 
 the august hands of the first Gentleman of the realm." 
 
 Norah was still gazing at the brown medal, when there 
 came a sudden tapping and shuffling upon the stair, and 
 there at the door was standing the very man who had been 
 so often in her thoughts. 
 
 But could this indeed be he ? Where was the martial 
 air, the flashing eye, the warrior face which she had 
 pictured? There, framed in the doorway, was a huge, 
 twisted old man. A cloud of fluffy white hair, and a pair of 
 watery blue eyes these were what met her gaze. He 
 leaned forward upon a stick, while his shoulders rose and 
 fell with his crackling, rasping breathing. 
 
 " I want my morning rations," he crooned, as he 
 stumped forward to his chair. "The cold nips me without 
 'em. See to my fingers.' 1 He held out his distorted hands, 
 all blue at the tips, wrinkled and gnarled, with huge, pro- 
 jecting knuckles. 
 
 " It's nigh ready," answered the girl, gazing at him with 
 wonder in her eyes. 
 
 " Don't, you know who I am, grand-uncle ? I am Norah 
 Brewster from Witham."

 battle o' Waterloo ? "

 " Yes, surely, if you'll step in. Uncle, here's a gentleman

 The old man blinked up at his visitor, and shook his 
 head slowly. 
 
 " Sit ye down, sergeant. 
 
 "You're full young for the stripes. Lardy, lardy, it's 
 easier to get three now than one in my day. Gunners were 
 old soldiers then, and the grey hairs came quicker than 
 the three stripes." 
 
 " I am eight years' service, sir. M'Donald is my name 
 Sergeant M'Donald, of H Battery, Southern Artillery 
 Division. I have called as the spokesman of my mates at 
 the gunners' barracks to say that we are proud to have you 
 in the town, sir." 
 
 " That were what the Regent said. ' The ridgment is 
 proud of ye,' says he. 'And I am proud of the ridgment,' 
 says I. ' And a deucid good answer too,' says he." 
 
 "The non-commissioned mess would be proud and 
 honoured to see you, sir, and if you could step as far you'll 
 always find a pipe o' baccy and a glass o' grog awaitin' 
 you." 
 
 " Like to see me, would they ? The dogs ! Well, well, 
 when the warm weather comes again I'll maybe drop in. 
 Too grand for a canteen, eh ? Got your mess just the 
 same as the orficers. What's the world a-coming to at

 "You was in the line, sir, was you not?" 
 
 "The line?" cried the old man with shrill scorn. 
 " Never wore a shako in my life. I am a guardsman, I am. 
 Served in the 3rd Guards the same they call now the 
 Scots Guards. Lardy, but they have all marched away, 
 every man of them, from old Col. Byng down to the 
 drummer boys, and here am I a straggler that's what I

 there. But it ain't my fault neither, for I'm ready to fall in

 Old Brewster drew a blackened clay pipe from his pocket 
 and began to stuff the tobacco into the bowl. In an 
 instant it slipped through his fingers, and lay broken to 
 pieces on the floor. His lip quivered, and he began cry- 
 ing like a child. 
 
 " I've broke my pipe." 
 
 "Don't you fret yourself, sir. 'Ere's a wooden pipe 
 with an amber mouth, if you'll do me the honour to accept 
 it from me." 
 
 " Jimini." Smiles from the old man broke in an instant 
 through his tears. " It's a fine pipe. See to my new pipe, 
 Norah. I lay that Jarge never had a pipe like that. 
 You've got your firelock there, sergeant." 
 
 " Yes, sir, I was on my way back from the butts when I 
 looked in." 
 
 " Let me have the feel of it. Lardy, but it seems like 
 old times to have one's hand on a musket. What's the

 "That's all right, sir," said the gunner. "You pressed

 we load 'em, you know." 
 
 "Load 'em at the wrong end. Well, well, to think o'

 he would even drag himself as far as the door to bask in 
 the life-giving sunshine. 
 
 " It do hearten me up so. 
 
 " Eh, but it's fine. This sunshine makes me think of the

 I find it wonderful soothing." 
 
 " What part would you like, uncle ? " 
 
 " Oh, them wars." 
 
 "The wars?" 
 
 " Ay, keep to the wars. Give me the Old Testament for

 for him. "Hullo, are you Gregory Brewster?" 
 
 " My name, sir," answered the veteran. 
 
 " You are the same Brewster, as I understand, who is on 
 the roll of the Scots Guards as having been present at the

 Old Gregory Brewster was on his feet in an instant, with

 "Why, we are very proud of .you, in London ; and so you

 Could this indeed be the last of that band of heroes'!

 " And the battle you remember it? " 
 
 "Why, I sees it all afore me every time I shuts my

 " And what was it that struck you most, now, in connec-

 "I lost three half-crowns over it, I did. I shouldn't 
 wonder if I was never to get that money now. I lent 'em 
 to Jabez Smith, my rear rank man, in Brussels. 'Only

 a lancer at Quarter Bras, and me with not so much as a 
 slip o' paper to prove the debt. Them three half-crowns is 
 as good as lost to me." 
 
 The Colonel took up the old man's tobacco pouch and 
 slipped a crisp bank note inside. 
 
 "The officers of the Guards want you to buy yourself 
 some little trifle which may add to your comfort." 
 
 " Thank ye kindly, sir. But there's one favour I would

 The very next day the old Hero took a sudden change 
 for the worse. The doctor came and shook his head in 
 silence. All day he lay with only his puffing blue lips and 
 the twitching of his scraggy neck to show that he still held 
 the breath of life. 
 
 Norah and Sergeant M 'Donald sat by him in the after- 
 noon, but he had shown no consciousness of their presence. 
 He lay peacefully, his eyes half closed, his hands under his 
 cheek, as one who is very weary. 
 
 They had left him for an instant, and were sitting in the 
 front room, when of a sudden they heard a shout that rang 
 through the house. Loud, and clear, and swelling, a voice 
 full of strength and energy, and fiery passion. 
 
 " The Guards need powder ! the Guards need powder ! " 
 
 The sergeant sprang from his chair and rushed in, 
 followed by the trembling Norah. 
 
 There was the old man standing up, his blue eyes spark- 
 ling, his whole figure towering and expanding, with eagle 
 head and glance of fire. 
 
 " The Guards need powder," he thundered once again, 
 "and by Heaven they shall have it ! " 
 
 He threw up his long arms and sank back with a groan 
 into his chair. 
 
 " Oh, Archie, Archie," sobbed the frightened girl, " what

 DEATH AND BURIAL OF GENERAL WAUCHOPE 
 A. G. HALES 
 
 (From Campaign Pictures (Cassell & Co. Limited), by 
 permission of the Publishers] 
 
 THE Highlanders reeled before the shock like trees before 
 the tempest. Their best, their bravest, fell in that wild 
 hail of lead. General Wauchope was down riddled with 
 bullets, yet gasping, dying, bleeding from every vein, the 
 Highland chieftain raised himself on his hands and knees 
 and cheered his men forward. Men and officers fell in 
 heaps together. 
 
 The Black Watch charged, and the Gordons and Sea- 
 forths, with a yell that stirred the British camp below, 
 rushed onward, onward to death or disaster. 
 
 The accursed wires caught them round the legs until 
 they foundered like trapped wolves, and all the time the 
 rifles of the foe sang the song of death in their ears. Then 
 they fell back, broken and beaten, leaving nearly thirteen 
 hundred dead and wounded just where the broad breast of 
 the grassy veldt melts into the embrace of the rugged 
 African hills, and an hour later the dawning came of the 
 dreariest day that Scotland has known for a generation past. 
 
 Of her officers, the flower of her chivalry, the pride of her 
 breeding, but few remained to tell the tale a sad tale, truly, 
 but one untainted with dishonour or smirched with dis- 
 grace, for up those heights under similar circumstances 
 even a brigade of devils could scarce hope to pass. 
 
 All that mortal men could do the Scots did. They tried, 
 they failed, they fell, and there is nothing left us now but 
 to mourn for them and avenge them, and I am no prophet 
 if the day is distant when the Highland bayonet will write 
 the name of Wauchope large and deep in the best blood of 
 
 the Boers.

 BURIAL OF GENERAL WAUCHOPE 265 
 
 Three hundred yards to the rear of the little township of 
 Modder River, just as the sun was sinking in a blaze of 
 African splendour, on the evening of Tuesday the i3th of 
 December a long, shallow grave lay exposed in the breast 
 of the veldt. 
 
 To the westward the broad river, fringed with trees, ran 
 murmuringly. To the eastward the heights still held by 
 the enemy scowled menacingly ; north and south the veldt 
 undulated peacefully. A few paces to the northward of 
 that grave fifty dead Highlanders lay, dressed as they had 
 fallen on the field of battle. They had followed their chief 
 to the field, and they were to follow him to the grave. 
 
 How grim and stern those dead men looked as they lay 
 face upward to the sky with great hands clenched in the 
 last death agony, and brows still knitted with the stern lust 
 of the strife in which they had fallen. 
 
 The plaids dear to every Highlander were represented 
 there, and as I looked out of the distance came the sound 
 of the pipes. It was the General coming to join his men. 
 There, right under the eyes of the enemy, moved with slow 
 and solemn tread all that remained of the Highland 
 Brigade. 
 
 In front of them walked the chaplain, with bared head, 
 dressed in his robes of office, then came the pipers with 
 their pipes, sixteen in all, and behind them, with arms 
 reversed, moved the Highlanders, dressed in all the regalia 
 of their regiments, and in the midst the dead General, 
 borne by four of his comrades. 
 
 Out swelled the pipes to the strains of " The Flowers 
 of the Forest," now ringing proud and high, until the 
 soldier's head went back in haughty defiance and eyes 
 flashed through tears like sunlight on steel, now sinking 
 to a moaning wail like a woman mourning for her first-born, 
 until the proud heads drooped forward till they rested on 
 heaving chests, and tears rolled down the wan and scarred

 faces, and the choking sobs broke through the solemn 
 rhythm of the march of death. 
 
 Right up to the grave they marched, then broke away 
 in companies until the General lay in the shallow grave 
 with a Scottish square of armed men around him. 
 
 Only the dead man's son and a small remnant of his 
 officers stood with the chaplain and the pipers whilst the 
 solemn service of the Church was spoken. 
 
 Then once again the pipes pealed out, and " Lochaber 
 no more " cut through the stillness like a cry of pain, until 
 one could almost hear the widow in her Highland home 
 moaning for the soldier she would welcome back no 
 more. 
 
 Then, as if touched by the magic of one thought, the 
 soldiers turned their tear-damp eyes from the still form in 
 the shallow grave towards the heights where Cronje, " Lion 
 of Africa," and his soldiers stood. Then every cheek 
 flushed crimson and the strong jaws set like steel, and the 
 veins on the hands that clasped the rifle handles swelled 
 almost to bursting with fervour of the grip, and that look 
 from those silent armed men spoke more eloquently than 
 ever spoke the tongues of orators. For on each frowning 
 face the spirit of vengeance sat, and each sparkling eye 
 asked silently for blood. 
 
 God help the Boers when next the Highland pibroch 
 sounds ! God rest the Boers' souls when the Highland 
 bayonets charge, for neither death nor hell nor things 
 above nor things below will hold the Scots back from their 
 blood feud ! 
 
 At the head of the grave, at the point nearest the enemy, 
 the General was laid to sleep. His officers grouped around 
 him, whilst in line behind him his soldiers were laid in a 
 double row, wrapped in their blankets. No shots were 
 fired over the dead men resting so peacefully, only a royal 
 salute was given, and then the men marched campwards

 as the darkness of an African night rolled over the far- 
 stretching breadth of the veldt. 
 
 To the gentlewoman who bears their General's name, 
 the Highland Brigade sends its deepest sympathy. To the 
 mothers and the wives, the sisters and the sweethearts in 
 cottage home, by hillside, and glen, they send their love 
 and good wishes sad will their Christmas be, sadder the 
 New Year. 
 
 Yet, enshrined in every womanly heart, from Queen 
 Empress to cottage girl, let their memory lie, the memory 
 of the men of the Highland Brigade who died at Magers-

 depends on the pitch, which is the ground where yer puts 
 up the cokernuts. 
 
 Now this 'ere is a model pitch. It's a good level bit of 
 grass as looks easy shying, and a nice, lumpy, awk'ard bit 
 o' ground for the gents to stand on when they shy. I'm 
 a-lettin' yer into some of the perfessional secrets, becos I 
 know yer won't go back on a feller. 
 
 It looks nice and private, this 'ere model pitch does, the 
 'igh palin's there shuttin' off the grounds of the Colonel's 
 manshing; and there's the 'igh road where all the wans 
 runs to Hepping Forest. 
 
 It's about five years ago, now, that me and 'Aarry first 
 went into partnership together. We was a-doin' the Punch 
 and Judy lay, and me and 'im and the dawg was passing 
 along 'ere one day. 'Aarry says, " 'alt " he says, wery 
 short. 
 
 "What's up? "I asks. 
 
 " See that pitch ? " 'Any says, pointing along 'ere. 
 
 " Yes," I answers ; " what's yer lay ? " 
 
 "Cokernuts," he says. 
 
 "Good," I says, "but we ain't got no sticks, and no nuts 
 and no bags, and no nothing." 
 
 He jerks 'is thumb towards the Punch and Judy box, 
 and the dawg, and he says, "Is this 'ere lay a-payin' 
 us?" 
 
 "No," says I; "the Hingerlish people 'as forsook the 
 legit'met Drammy. Our Punch and Judy ain't a-doing us 
 no good. But we've got em, and I guess we'll have 
 to keep 'em. What else can we do with 'em ? " I says. 
 
 "Sell 'em," says 'Any. 
 
 Sure enough, soon after that we got a chance of dis- 
 poging of the legit'met drammy, in the shape of Punch, 
 Judy, and the dawg, and then we started in the Cokernut 
 line. Our first pitch was this wery spot, and we done a 
 good trade. Customers was plentiful and bad shots.

 The manshing belonged then to a old lady as was wery 
 kind to us. She never interfered with us, but let us make 
 this plot a reg'lar pitch at all 'oliday times, and sich like. 
 Many a mornin' she come out and give me and 'Arry a 
 nice little bundle of pipe-lights tracks, yer know, sir, 
 and she were always pleasant and sociable like. One 
 mornin' she come out to us with the tracks, and as I was 
 a-bowin' to 'er wery polite, and 'Arry drawin' 'isself up 
 like a brick wall, a-salutin' of the lady, the old girl says, 
 "I believe," she says, "I have some sort of right over 
 this plot of ground, as the owner of the manshing and 
 the park ; but so long as you behave yerselves, and reads 
 the tracks, I shall never disturb you," she says. 
 
 " Thank yer, yer ladyship," I replies. " Three shies 
 a penny, marm," I says, ; ' is our reg'lar price, which 
 'Arry will tell yer the same ; but any time, marm, as 
 yer ladyship would like a nut, come and have a shy for 
 nothink, marm ! " 
 
 But the next time we come round after that, bad noose 
 was told us. The old lady 'ad gone where they don't 
 never want no tracks, and where I scarcely thinks they 
 carry on the cokernut perfession. The old lady were 
 dead, sir, and the manshing and park 'ad been took by 
 a peppery, yeller-faced, fiery-tempered hold Hangerlow 
 Hinjin Colonel, as was frightening everybody about the 
 place. He'd frightened the parson till he could scarcely 
 preach, and 'ad almost forgot one day to make a collec- 
 tion ; the tradespeople trembled as they see 'is yeller 
 face a-colourin' the shop winders, and the servants in the 
 manshing 'ad quite give up the ridikalous idea of callin' 
 their lives their own. 
 
 " The place ain't the same," says the chap as was 
 telling us, "since he come into it. Cayenne pepper is 
 mild alongside of the Colonel, and ginger ain't in it with 
 'im. His language," he says, "is strong enough to draw

 years before no time. He's death, he says 'isself, on all 
 wagabones, tramps and wermins." 
 
 " What's 'is name ? " I says. 
 
 " Colonel Rufus Pepperton." 
 
 I see a rum look come in 'Arry's face, and I says, " Do 
 yer know 'im, 'Any ? " 
 
 "Yes," he answers, and I knowed it was no use askin' 
 'im any more just then, becos 'Arry wery seldom says 
 more than one word a hour at the outside. 
 
 The next mornin' was Saturday, and me and 'Arry got 
 the cokernuts up in good time. We 'ad several young 
 gents a-throwin' wery early that mornin', and after they 
 'ad gone away 'Arry run up to the cokernut end of the 
 pitch for to throw me up the sticks at the other end to 
 hadd to the 'cap so as to be all ready and 'andy for the 
 next customer, when we sees for the first time the 
 Hangerlow Hinjin. He comes rushing out of the park 
 gates like a wild bull, shakin' 'is fist, 'is eyes flashin' in 'is 
 yeller old face, and swearin' somethink horful ! 
 
 Soon as ever he come on the ground, I see 'Arry draw 
 'isself up and begin salutin' ; but the Colonel didn't see 
 'im, for he was coming straight on towards me at the 
 other end. Soon he reached me, and then he made a 
 few remarks. "You thieves, scamps, wagabones, tramps, 
 rascals, knaves, blackguards." 
 
 " I begs yer pardon, sir," I says, " but are yer alludin' 
 to me, or to 'Arry ? " I says. 
 
 " To both of you," he hollers, swearing frightful. <l Clear 
 out of it ! Clear out sharp, or I'll shoot the two of you 
 like dogs. This is my ground, and off you go ! " 
 
 Now 'Arry 'ad 'eerd all he said, and I see 'is face 
 gettin' blacker and blacker. Just as the Colonel paused,

 'Any stood straight up with a nice knobbly stick in 'is 
 'and, and a look in 'is face I'd never see'd there afore, all 
 the time I'd knowed 'im. 
 
 "Colonel," he shouts out in a clear, loud, ringin' sort 
 of voice, " Colonel, I'm going to throw these sticks 
 up to my mate. Please march out of the line of fire. 
 Once ! " 
 
 " How dare you," began the Colonel, not stirrin'. 
 
 "Twice," sings 'Arry. 
 
 " You audacious villain ! " 
 
 " Three times ! " and swift and straight come the nice 
 knobbly stick. 
 
 'Arry 'ad said true : the Colonel was in the line of fire, 
 and the nice knobbly stick 'it 'im on the cokernut. Off 
 rolled 'is 'at, and down fell Colonel Rufus Pepperton. 
 
 That evernin' me and 'Arry was in jail, and the last 
 words of the perleeceman as he locked the door was these, 
 with a pleasin' smile, " This is six months' 'ard ; that's

 corner through all the fight. They've been roughly handled 
 by the rebels, and a last charge, though they hold the 
 ground still, has almost scattered them. An officer has 
 fainted, and lies white and 'elpless on the earth, with the 
 colours of the Regiment clutched close and tight in both 
 hands. He lies apart from the torn and battered ranks he's 
 been tryin' to hold together. A few full-armed rebels, 
 mounted on captured English chargers, make a wild rush 
 at the flag. The flag the flag is wrenched from the 
 senseless fingers, and they ride away in triumph. Then 
 the officer comes to, and he groans, with an agony only a 
 soldier can understand, ' The Colours ! The Colours ! For 
 God's sake, bring me back the Colours ! ' 
 
 "He tries to stagger on foot but falls back again, too 
 sorely wounded to rise ; and again he sobs out, ' For God's 
 sake, bring me back the Colours ! ' 
 
 " A stragglin' soldier of another British Regiment, cut 
 off from the rest, hurries by. Look ! he hears the cry, 
 gives one look at the officer, and one at the flying rebels 
 who carry the captured flag. He springs on a riderless 
 charger, gives rein, and goes for the flag or death ! 
 
 " The burnin' minutes pass on, and at last the soldier 
 rides back, with the Colours wrapped round his 'eart, and as 
 he puts them once more into the officer's white fingers, 
 they are dyed a deeper red by the blood which is flowin' 
 from a wound in the soldier's breast. 
 
 " Colonel, where is the scar I gave you because you 
 treated me and my mate like thieves, and refused a fair 
 warning ? " 
 
 Like a man in a dream, the Colonel 'eld 'is finger to 
 the scar on 'is fore-'ead. Off 'Any flings 'is coat, tears 
 open 'is shirt, and 'olds ' finger to a big, jagged scar near 
 'is noble 'eart. 
 
 "And 'ere," he says, "is the scar of the wound which 
 that common soldier bore for you ! "

 I never knowed properly what 'appened after that. But

 I were again chucked out. I remember the Colonel

 YES, it is just one year ago to-night, 
 
 And through my brain there tingles into life 
 
 The self-same forms the faces and the sound 
 
 Of voices that I knew in those glad days. 
 
 That seemed no longer than do minutes now, 
 
 They were so full of joy, those old dead hours. 
 
 But I let a trifle leap into a thought, 
 
 And grow and grow till it was past reclaim, 
 
 I slipped it then as sportsmen slip their dogs 
 
 And coupled with it madness for its mate. 
 
 They ran abreast as jealousy and pique 
 
 Set on to chase my love down to its death. 
 
 I steeped my brain in wretched jealous dreams 
 
 When I awoke I called myself a cur ! 
 
 But she had gone this woman that I loved 
 
 I see that poor face now, drawn at the brows ; 
 
 Pain, like a vice, had crushed her to the quick. 
 
 And yet amid that world of quivering woe, 
 
 Two steady stars shone out those calm grey eyes, 
 
 Two planets, pure and passionless, that mocked 
 
 The lurid fierceness of mine own mad heat. 
 
 And thus we parted Heaven ! when I think 
 
 That in a month I would have called her wife ! 
 
 How hard it seems a man's whole life should be 
 
 O'ershadowed by a Song /

 THE SHADOW OF A SONG 277 
 
 Aye, it had been 
 
 A love-dirge that her wondrous voice had sent 
 
 From out the silver portals of her throat, 
 
 As though 't had been a prayer so glorified 
 
 'Twould pierce its way on through the gates of heaven. 
 
 I slew my peace by bringing into life 
 
 Some dearer rival in her love to me ; 
 
 I conjured up the ghost of someone gone 
 
 Some dead love that she held communion with, 
 
 Through the sweet channel of a trembling song. 
 
 I'd often come and sit to hear her sing, but once 
 
 I stole with silent step to where she played. 
 
 Dazzled by the radiance of the light 
 
 The strong young moon had flung across her face, 
 
 She did not see me. 
 
 And while each pulse throbbed out its troublous tale, 
 
 I stood and watched, and while I watched I wronged ! 
 
 I crept so near in my intent to find 
 
 Her deepest secret mirrored in her face. 
 
 That her soft breath disturbed the straying threads 
 
 My nervous hands had singled from my hair. 
 
 I listened while the voice climbed to the clouds, 
 
 On melody that seemed to float through tears, 
 
 In -words that fell amid a sea of sobs 
 
 I heard, I saw the upturned, straining eyes, 
 
 The dreamy sorrow dwelling on the lips. 
 
 "She sings," I said, "to some dead love of yore ! 
 
 She has been fooling me who gave her all 
 
 My life ! my soul ! and while she smiled on me, 
 
 Has worshipped at the shrine of some dead past." 
 
 I strode from out the shadows to her side ; 
 
 I wrenched the slender fingers from the keys ; 
 
 And drowned her tones that, as they sudden stopped, 
 
 Must e'en have made the spell-bound angels weep. 
 
 She did not speak but rose serene and grand,

 And listened. 
 
 Aye ! Though I left behind each word a wound 
 
 That tore into her womanhood all dumb 
 
 She stood, while wonder wandered through her eyes. 
 
 And then she turned and left me in the night. 
 
 Then in my heart hope heaved its dying sigh, 
 
 And with its death my love leaped back to life. 
 
 I put my hands in pleading out to her ; 
 
 I called her by the sweetest names I knew ; 
 
 On bended knee I asked her to forgive ! 
 
 And bit my lips till I had brought the blood, 
 
 Because they'd shaped the words I'd said to her. 
 
 She heard me ; and she came back once again, 
 
 She spoke to me, quite calmly, not to chide, 
 
 But sadly, as a bird whose mate is dead 
 
 Will tell its tale of sorrow to the wind ; 
 
 She gazed at me as one she did not know, 
 
 And talked of me as someone far away. 
 
 Then looking upward with a cry of pain : 
 
 " That song I may not sing you now," she said ; 
 
 "Ah ! my poor brother, you must wait for me, 
 
 And when I'm coming so that you may know 
 
 Once more I'll sing it just before I die." 
 
 " Brother ! " A sudden mem'ry like a blow 
 Struck on my senses as though in reproof. 
 It all came back to me, the tale I'd heard ; 
 The pathos of it ; her twin brother, blind, 
 And she had tended him with a marvellous love 
 He'd leaned alone on her until he died. 
 I prayed to her for pity's sake to hear ! 
 I raised my eyes to hers I met her gaze 
 That look ! it held the history of two hopes 
 The wreck and ruin of two loves, two lives ! 
 I wept as men weep once. It was too late !

 Have you read it, the marvellous story 
 Of Sandalphon, the Angel of Glory, 
 Sandalphon, the Angel of Prayer ? 
 
 How, erect, at the outermost gates 
 Of the City Celestial he waits, 
 
 With his feet on the ladder of light, 
 That, crowded with angels unnumbered, 
 By Jacob was seen as he slumbered 
 
 Alone in the desert at night ? 
 
 The Angels of Wind and of Fire 
 Chant only one hymn, and expire 
 
 With the song's irresistible stress ; 
 Expire in their rapture and wonder, 
 As harp-strings are broken asunder 
 
 By music they throb to express. 
 
 But serene in the rapturous throng, 
 Unmoved by the rush of the song, 
 
 With eyes unimpassioned and slow, 
 Among the dead angels, the deathless 
 Sandalphon stands listening breathless 
 
 To sounds that ascend from below ; 
 
 From the spirits on earth that adore, 
 From the souls that entreat and implore 
 
 In the fervour and passion of prayer ; 
 From the hearts that are broken with losses, 
 And weary with dragging the crosses 
 
 Too heavy for mortals to bear. 
 
 And he gathers the prayers as he stands, 
 And they change into flowers in his hands, 
 Into garlands of purple and red ;

 And beneath the great arch of the portal 
 Through the streets of the City Immortal 
 Is wafted the fragrance they shed. 
 
 It is but a legend, I know, 
 A fable, a phantom, a show, 
 
 Of the ancient Rabbinical lore ; 
 Yet the old mediaeval tradition, 
 The beautiful, strange superstition, 
 
 But haunts me and holds me the more. 
 
 When I look from my window at night, 
 And the welkin above is all white, 
 
 All throbbing and panting with stars, 
 Among them majestic is standing 
 Sandalphon the angel expanding 
 
 His pinions in nebulous bars. 
 
 And the legend, I feel, is a part 
 
 Of the hunger and thirst of the heart, 
 
 The frenzy and fire of the brain, 
 That grasps at the fruitage forbidden, 
 The golden pomegranates of Eden, 
 
 To quiet its fever and pain.

 IN the west of Ireland the feelings of the young women 
 are seldom consulted in matters matrimonial. Her 
 father being the best judge of what is for his daughter's 
 advantage, opposition is of rare occurrence except where

 she has taken the precaution of providing herself with a 
 husband. Still more exceptional is any objection on the 
 part of the young man to the wife selected for him, by his 
 father, as he feels quite satisfied that experience enables 
 his parent to judge of the temper and qualifications of 
 women much better than he could. Interest and inclina- 
 tion alike lead him to make the best selection, but when 
 the choice is made it is unalterable. 
 
 The mother has little to say on either side; she 
 never goes matchmaking and is not in any way con- 
 sulted. Marriage is a matter of business, and it is like 
 any other bargain, made with the shrewd, humorous, 
 calculating caution which characterises the Connaught 
 man. Marriage gifts such as pigs, poultry, a cow, etc., play 
 an important part in the arrangements, and the girl's father 
 has been known to refuse to give her a single penny of 
 fortune until the bridegroom's parent had conceded to her 
 a favourite hatching goose. 
 
 The following is a specimen of the way in which matri- 
 monial affairs are managed west of the Shannon. 
 
 " Get out my Sunday clothes, Judy. I'm going over to 
 Peter Linskey's to-night," said old Corney O'Brien one 
 evening when he returned from his work. 
 
 " Musha, Corney, an' what are ye goin' for ? " Judy asked 
 as she unlocked a large deal chest and carefully took out 
 a blue frieze tail coat with bright metal buttons, a pair of 
 bright coloured cord knee breeches, ribbed worsted stock- 
 ings, a pair of strong shoes, and a billy-goat hat, which 
 with a stout blackthorn shillelah constituted Corney's 
 Sunday suit. 
 
 " Sure, I'm goin' to make a match between Katie Linsky 
 and our Dermot; she is a purty colleen an' the boy is 
 moity plazed wid her entirely." 
 
 "So she is, Corney, a fine girl, an' sh'll have a snug 
 fortune maybe. Peter is a decent, honest man."

 MATCHMAKING IN ROSCOMMON 283 
 
 "Faith, Judy, an' he is that same or it isn't Corney 
 O'Brien that would cut, shuffle or dale wid him or his, an' 
 Dermot tells me Kate likes him." 
 
 "An" why wouldn't she, Corney? Sure there isn't a 
 purtier boy in the parish, nor a betther." 
 
 " Thrue for you, asthore; give us out the ould stockin' 
 and we'll make a match of it this Shovetide wid the blessin' 
 of St Patrick." 
 
 From the furtherest corner of the chest Judy drew out 
 an old worsted stocking and handed it to her husband, who 
 with a sly wink buttoned it into one of his pockets and was 
 gone. 
 
 Peter Linsky was a small farmer living about a quarter of 
 a mile from Corney's cabin. He had several sons, and one 
 daughter Katie, who was considered the beauty of the 
 village of Ballinmoyne. Her eldest brother was about to 
 be married and bring his wife home, and her father con- 
 sidered it would be very advisable to get Katie married and 
 settled before the arrival of her sister-in-law, and Dermot 
 O'Brien, a fine strapping young fellow, very steady and 
 good-natured, old Peter thought would make an excellent 
 husband, especially as he was an only child. 
 
 When Corney O'Brien reached Peter Linsky's cabin he 
 put his head over the half door and said, in Irish, " God 
 save all here," the customary form of greeting in that and 
 other parts of Ireland. 
 
 " God save ye, kindly come _in an' tak' a sate," Peter 
 replied. 
 
 Corney entered and took his seat on a three-legged 
 stool that Peter pushed forward to him. 
 
 " Fine weather for the crops, Corney." The two old men 
 then filled their pipes and smoked in silence for some 
 time. 
 
 " That's a purty colleen o' yours, Peter." 
 
 " Thrue for you, Corney, an' a good, sensible little girl

 to the bargain, an' it's happy's the man'll be that gets 
 her." 
 
 "That's what I said myself, Peter, an' I come to see 
 if we can't make a match between my Dermot an' 
 herself." 
 
 "Oh, he's a likely bhoy." 
 
 " Ye may well say that, Peter, an' he'll make a good 
 husband, for he's a good son. What do you say to it? " 
 
 " Oh, I'm plazed." 
 
 " God save all here," said a harsh grating voice, and a 
 head appeared in the doorway. " Good evenin' to ye, 
 Pether." 
 
 "Good evenin', kindly come in an' tak' a sate, Tom." 
 
 The newcomer entered, took a stool, and casting a glance 
 at Corney proceeded to light his pipe. He was a stout, 
 harsh-featured man, not much of a favourite in the village, 
 and especially disliked by Corney O'Brien, who never lost 
 an opportunity of annoying Tom Dillon. He was a com- 
 fortable farmer in the district, and one of his sons had been 
 " making up " to Katie Linsky for some time before. 
 
 After a silence, during which the three old men smoked 
 energetically, Dillon cleared his throat and said, 
 
 "Pether, I want to make a match between your little 
 girl an' my Martin. Have ye anything to say agin it ? " 
 
 " Sorra a word, Tom ; only my neighbour Corney O'Brien 
 an' myself wor just spakin' ov the same thing whin ye came 
 in." 
 
 " First come, first sarved, Pether, mind that." 
 
 "To be sure, to be sure, Corney." 
 
 "An' we may as well clinch the bargain at onst." 
 
 "Oh, to be sure, to be sure." 
 
 "Ye have nothin' agin my Martin, have ye, Pether 
 Linsky ? " 
 
 "Agin him ! no, he's a fine decent bhoy, an' I have a 
 great regard for him."

 "An' he has a great regard for your little girl, an' sorra 
 a day's good he'll do till he's married ; he's set his mind 
 on it, an' I'll back him out." 
 
 " Turf an' thunder, Tom Dillon, didn't Pether Linsky 
 tell ye I come matchmaking for my Dermot ? " 
 
 " Thunder an' turf, Corney O'Brien, an' don't I tell ye I 
 come to do the same thing for my Martin, an' I suppose 
 a Dillon can ask a Linsky in marriage any day, an' can 
 afford it too, do ye moind that ? " 
 
 " An' let me tell ye an O'Brien can put pound an' pound 
 wid a Linsky any day, or for that ^ matter wid a Dillon. 
 Pether, ye know what I came for; what fortune are ye 
 goin' to give Katie ? " 
 
 "Fortune, Corney; sure Katie's a fortune in herself. 
 I'm a poor man, an' beyont a new gown, a couple o' fleeces 
 o' wool, wid a hank or so of yarn, I can't give her any 
 fortune." 
 
 Corney looked astonished and pushed back his stool, 
 as much as to say the negotiations were useless, when Tom 
 Dillon said, 
 
 " Niver moind, Pether, there's them as'll be willin' to 
 tak' her without any fortune, an' can afford it too." 
 
 "Thrue for you, Tom Dillon, an' one o' them is Dermot 
 O'Brien; we're not dependin' on a few bare pounds, not 
 but what it's well to have somethin' to put by for the childer, 
 Pether." 
 
 "To be sure, to be sure, Corney." 
 
 "Well, Pether, is it to be me or Corney? Is a Dillon 
 to be put behind the door for an O'Brien ? Isn't my Martin 
 as likely a bhoy as there is in the barony ? He'll take your 
 colleen widout a brass penny an' do well for her. What do 
 you say to that ? " 
 
 "Bedad, then, Tom, I'm in a fix intirely; here's Corney,

 parish on a Sunday. I'm bothered intirely, an' what can 
 I say ? But settle it between ye ; whichever of ye can do 
 the best for her, take her in the name of St Patrick." 
 
 The two old men eyed one another silently for a few 
 minutes, then Dillon took out a little bag from one of his 
 pockets, pulled out a sovereign, and laying it on the table, 
 said, 
 
 "Show Peter Linsky what ye can do, Corney O'Brien." 
 
 Corney smiled, produced his old stocking, and taking 
 from thence a five-pound note, nodded defiantly. Tom 
 drew forth four more sovereigns, and counted them slowly 
 on the table ; Corney waited for a minute and then said, 
 
 " Is that all yer goin' to do, Mr Dillon ? " 
 
 Tom threw down another sovereign, Corney followed his 
 example, till they had each laid on the table twenty pounds. 
 
 "Is that all ye're goin' to do, Mr Dillon ? " 
 
 " In ready money, it is, Mr O'Brien." 
 
 "Then I bate ye at that," Corney cried, throwing down 
 another sovereign. 
 
 " I'll take the girl in an' share the best we have wid her, 
 and give Martin two acres of land, an' a couple o' pigs," 
 announced Tom Dillon. 
 
 " Dermot'll have my land when I'm gone, every rood," 
 cried Corney. 
 
 " I'll give a heifer in, twenty pounds, share of a house, 
 two acres of land, an' a heifer. What do you say to that ? 
 Not bad for a colleen without a penny." 
 
 " Thrue for you, Tom ; what'll you do, Corney ? " 
 
 "Twenty-one pounds down the day they're married, a 
 house an' home, a fether bed, an' the finest mule in the 
 parish ; that's what I'll do." 
 
 "But the land, Corney. Tom is givin' two acres o'

 " An' plenty to do it wid, an' I'll make it three acres of

 " Very dacent of you, Corney." 
 
 " I'll throw in a calf," exclaimed Dillon ; " twenty pounds,

 " I think ye spoke of two pigs, Tom." 
 
 " No, no, only one ; it's all I can spare, an' I think it's

 " I'm done," said Dillon. Then suddenly starting up he 
 cried, " Wait a minute," and ran out of the house, returning 
 in a quarter of an hour staggering under a great sackful of 
 seed potatoes. " There, Corney O'Brien, put that in yer 
 pipe an' smoke it." 
 
 Corney at first sight of the sack started to his feet and 
 put on his hat. " Wait a minute, Pether, I'll not be long," 
 and running all the way was soon home.

 " Arra be aisy, Corney, sure an' the meal's in it." 
 
 " Betther and betther." 
 
 And without saying a word to the astonished Judy, he 
 shouldered the sack, and trotted off as fast as he could ; 
 completely out of breath he reached Peter's bathed in per- 
 spiration, but on entering he unluckily tripped over the 
 doorstep and fell with the sack full length into the kitchen. 
 The string round the neck of the sack gave way, and 
 covered with the meal he groaned and stammered breath- 
 lessly, " Th-there, Pe-pe-ther L-L-in-sky, when the par-a-ties 
 wor grow-in' shure the me-al would keep them alive. 
 What do you say to that, Pether?" 
 
 " Begorra, Corney, I just say what I often said before, 
 that you're a dacent ould man an' yer bhoy is moity welcome

 At that moment a merry laugh caused the three old men 
 to look around, and Corney scrambled to his feet. In the 
 doorway stood Katie Linsky, her hands pressed to her 
 sides and tears of mirth coursing down her pretty face. 
 
 " I'm sorry for your trouble, Corney, but I couldn't help 
 laughing, you looked so quare."

 THE CONVERSION OF COLONEL QUAGG 
 
 GEORGE AUGUSTUS SALA 
 (Adapted) 
 
 COLONEL GOLIAH QUAGG was commander of a body of 
 volunteers called the Rapparoarer Tigers. He followed 
 the occupation of a blacksmith, and his shop was along a 
 country road. He was a man of great strength, and was 
 always drinking, blustering and fighting. Where he was 
 raised was not certain. What he did on Sundays (for he 
 never went to church) was not known. There were but 
 two things about him on which argument about him could 
 be with tolerable certainty held that he liked rum rum 
 which he drank in vast quantities without winking, and 
 that he hated the Grace-walking Brethren. 
 
 What these or any other brethren had ever done to incur 
 his dislike was not stated ; but it was clear and certain that 
 he hated them fiercely and implacably. He declaimed 
 against them in drinking bars ; he called them opprobrious 
 names in the street ; and what was particularly disagreeable 
 to the brethren themselves, he made a point of giving 
 every minister who passed his smithy on horse or on foot, 
 on business or pleasure a sound and particularly humiliat- 
 ing beating. 
 
 The Punkington Circuit began to lack ministers. Clergy- 
 men were not forthcoming. The congregation began to cry 
 out. So there was a meeting held to decide the question 
 of Colonel Quagg. Not one clergyman could be found 
 to offer to administer to the spiritual necessities of the 
 Rapparoarer brethren. Brother M'Tear had a bad cold ; 
 Brother Brownjohn would rather not; and Brother Nash 
 had a powerful call down Weepingwail way. At last a 
 brother, who, up to that time, had said nothing a long

 thin, loose-limbed brother, who seemed to possess no 
 peculiar accomplishment save that he stuttered when he 
 spoke and the questionable one of shutting one eye when 
 he expectorated this brother, by name Zephaniah Sock- 
 dolloger, here rose and said, " I, Zephaniah Sockdolloger, 
 will go to Rapparoarer location, and if Brother Brownjohn 
 will loan me his hoss I will confront the man even Goliah 
 Quagg." 
 
 The fire roared, the sparks flew up the chimney one 
 afternoon, when suddenly Zeek, the bellows-blower, ceased 
 a moment in his occupation and exclaimed, " One o' 'em, 
 Colonel, top o' the hill." 
 
 The Colonel grasped a huge strap in his mighty hand 
 and passed out of the smithy door. 
 
 He saw coming towards him, down the hill, a long-legged, 
 yellow-faced man in black, with a white neckcloth and 
 broad-brimmed hat, who bestrode a solemn-looking white 
 horse with a long white tail, and as he rode he sung quite 
 softly a little hymn that rang something like unto the 
 following : 
 
 " We are marching through the gracious ground, 
 We soon shall hear the trumpet sound ; 
 And then we shall in glory reign, 
 And never, never, part again." 
 
 Colonel Quagg waited till the verse of the hymn was 
 quite finished and the horse had got to within a couple of 
 yards of his door, when he called out, in a terrible voice : 
 
 " Hold hard ! " 
 
 " Brother," said the man on the horse, " good evening 
 and peace." 
 
 "For the matter of that," responded Colonel Quagg, 
 "rot ! Hold hard, and git out of that hoss." 
 
 " Brother ?" the other interrogated, as if not quite under- 
 standing the command. 
 
 " Git out, I tell you," cried the blacksmith. " Legs and

 feet. Git out, you long-tailed blackbird. Git out, for I'm 
 riz, and snakes will wake ! I want to talk to you." 
 
 The long man slid rather than got off his horse. It was 
 indeed Brother Zephaniah Sockdolloger, for his face was 
 quincier than ever, and, as he descended from his steed, 
 he shut one eye and expectorated. 
 
 "Now," said the blacksmith, seating himself on the horse 
 block in front of his dwelling, and giving a blow on the 
 ground with his strap that made the pebbles dance. " Where 
 do you hail from ? " 
 
 "From Punkington city, brother," answered the reverend 
 Zephaniah. 
 
 " And whar are you goin' tu ? " 
 
 "To Rapparoarer city." 
 
 "And what may you be goin' for to du in that location ? " 
 
 " Goin' on circuit." 
 
 " What ? " 
 
 " Lord's business, brother." 
 
 Colonel Quagg shook out the strap to its full length, and 
 passed it through his horny hand. 
 
 " There was a brother of yours," he said sententiously, 
 "that went to Rapparoarer city on Lord's business last fall. 
 He passed this edifice, he did. He met this strap close by 
 here. And this strap made him see comets, and dance 
 like a shaking quaker, and feel uncommon like a bobtailed 
 bull in fly-time." 
 
 There was something so dreadfully suggestive in the 
 position of a bob-tailed bull in fly-time (the insects 
 frequently kill cattle with their stings) that Brother 
 Sockdolloger wriggled uneasily. 
 
 "And I du hcpe," the Colonel continued, "that you, 
 brother, aren't of the same religion as this babe of grace 
 was as met the strap as he was riding. That religion was 
 the Grace-walking religion, and that religion I always lick." 
 
 "Lick, brother?"

 292 ELOCUTION 
 
 " Lick. With the strap. Dreadful." 
 
 "Colonel Goliah Quagg," said the minister, "for such 
 I know is your name in the flesh, I am a preacher of the 
 Grace-walking connection. Humble, but faithful, I hope." 
 
 "Then," returned Colonel Quagg, making an ironical 
 bow, " this is the strap with which I am going to lick you 
 into sarse." 
 
 "Brother, brother," the other cried, shaking his head, 
 " cast that cruel strap from out of thine hand. Close thine 
 hand, if thou wilt, upon the hammer of thy trade, the 
 coulter of thy plough, upon a pen, the rudder of a ship, the 
 handle of a lantern to light men to peace and love and 
 goodwill ; but close it not upon sword of iron, or bludgeon 
 of wood, or strap of leathern hide." 
 
 " Now look you here," the blacksmith cried, impatiently. 
 " Talk as long as you like ; but talk while I am a-licking of 
 you. For time is precious, and must not be thrown away 
 nohow. Lick you I must, and lick you I will. Hard." 
 
 " But, brother but, Colonel " 
 
 " Rot ! Straps is waiting. Stubs and fences ! I'll 
 knock you into horseshoes and then into horsenails, if you 
 keep me waiting." 
 
 "Have you no merciful feelings ?" asked Zephaniah, as 
 if sorely troubled. 
 
 " Not a cent of 'em. Air you ready ? Will you take it 
 righting, or will you take it lying down ? Some takes it 
 fighting ; some takes it like lambs, lying down. Only make 
 haste." 
 
 " Goliah Quagg," the minister responded, " I am a man 
 of peace, and I would rather not take it at all." 
 
 " You must," the Colonel roared, now fairly infuriated. 
 " Pickled alligators ! you must. Hold hard, you coon ! 
 Hold hard ! for I'm a-goin' to begin. Now, once more ; is 
 it fighting, or is it quiet, you mean for to take it ? " 
 
 "Well," said Brother Zephaniah, "you are hard upon

 me, Colonel, and that's true. It's fighting or lying down 
 isn't it?" 
 
 " Aye," returned the Colonel. 
 
 " Then I'll take it fighting" the man of peace said 
 quietly. 
 
 Colonel Quagg halted for a moment, as if amazed at the 
 audacity of the Grace-walker. Then, with a wild halloo, 
 he rushed upon him. His hand was upon the minister's 
 collar ; the strap that had done so much execution in its 
 time was swinging high in the air, when 
 
 Stay. Can you imagine the rage, the astonishment and 
 despair of a schoolmaster caned by his pupil; of the 
 Emperor of China sentenced to be bambooed by a Hong 
 Kong coolie ! of a Southern planter cowhided by one of 
 his own niggers ; of a policeman ordered to move on by an 
 apple-woman; of the Commander-in-chief of the army desired 
 to stand at ease by a drummer. If you can imagine anything 
 of that sort but only if you can you may be able to form 
 some idea of how Colonel Quagg felt when a storm of blows, 
 hard, well-directed and incessant, began to fall on his head, 
 on his breast, on his face, on his shoulders, on his arms, on 
 his legs all over his body, so rapidly that he felt as if he 
 were being hit everywhere at once, when he found his strap 
 would hit nowhere on the body of his opponent, but that 
 he himself was hit everywhere. 
 
 Sledgehammers ! Sledgehammers were nothing to the 
 fists of the Grace-walking brother. A bob-tailed bull in 
 fly-time was an animal to be envied in comparison to 
 the Colonel. He danced with all the vigour of a nigger 
 toeing and heeling a hornpipe. He felt that he was all 
 nose, and that a horribly swollen one. Then that he had 
 swallowed all his teeth. Then that he had five hundred 
 eyes, and then none at all. Then his legs failed under 
 him, and he fell down all of a heap. The tall brother 
 went down atop of him, and continued pounding away

 at his body singing all the while the little hymn 
 beginning 
 
 "We are marching through the gracious ground," 
 
 quite softly to himself. 
 
 " Hold hard ! " gasped the Colonel at last, faintly. 
 "You don't mean murder, do you? You won't hit a man 
 when he's down much more, will you, brother ? " 
 
 " By no means," answered Zephaniah, bringing down his 
 fist nevertheless with a tremendous " bash " upon the 
 Colonel's nose, as if there were a fly there and he wanted 
 to kill it. " But you've took it fighting, Colonel, and you 
 may as well now take it like a lamb, lying down." 
 
 "But I'm broke, I tell you," groaned the vanquished 
 blacksmith. "I can't do no more. You air so mighty 
 hard, you are" 
 
 " Oh ! you give in, then ? " 
 
 "Aye," murmured Colonel Quagg, " I cave in." 
 
 " Speak louder, I'm hard of hearing." 
 
 "Yes ! " repeated the Colonel, with a groan, " I du cave 
 in. For I'm beat ; whittled clean away to the small end o' 
 nothing chawed up cornered." 
 
 " You must promise me one little thing, Colonel Goliah 
 Quagg," said the Reverend Sockdolloger, without, however, 
 removing his knees from the Colonel's chest. " You must 
 promise, before I leave off hammering of your body, never 
 for to ill-treat by word or deed any of our people ministers, 
 elders, deacons or brethren." 
 
 " I'll promise," replied the Colonel ; " only let me up. 
 You're choking me." 
 
 " Not to rile, lick, or molest any other peaceable critters 
 as are coming or going past your way upon Lord's busi- 
 ness." 
 
 " I promise." 
 
 "Likewise," concluded Zephaniah, playfully knocking

 away one of his adversary's loose teeth so as to make his 
 mouth neat and tidy, "you must promise to give up drink- 
 ing rum, which is a delusion and a snare, and bad for the 
 innards, besides being on the trunk-line to perdition 
 And, finally, you must promise to come to our next camp 
 meeting, clean shaved, and with a contrite heart." 
 
 " No," cried the almost-expiring Colonel, " I won't, not 
 for all the tobacco in Virginny ! " 
 
 " You won't, brother ? " asked Zephaniah, persuasively 
 raising his fist. 
 
 " No, I'm darned if I do." 
 
 " Then," said the Grace-walker, meekly, " I must sing 
 you another little hymn." 
 
 Immediately afterwards Colonel Quagg's tortures recom- 
 menced. He struggled, he roared, he entreated, but in 
 vain. All he could see were the long man's arms whirling 
 about like the sails of windmills. All he could feel was the 
 deadly pain of the blows on his already hideously bruised 
 face and body. All he could hear was the snuffling voice 
 of his tormentor singing, with an occasional stammer, a 
 verse of a little hymn, commencing 
 
 ' ' I'm going home to bliss above 
 
 Will you go, will you go? 
 
 To live in mercy, peace and love 
 
 Will you go, will you go ? 
 
 My old companions fare you well, 
 A brighter fate has me befell, 
 I mean up in the skies to dwell, 
 
 Will you go, will you go ? " 
 
 He could stand it no longer. He threw out his arms, and 
 groaned, " Spare my life and I'll promise anything." 
 
 " Happy to hear it, Colonel," answered Brother Sock- 
 dolloger, helping his adversary to rise, and then coolly 
 settling his own white neckcloth and broad-brimmed hat.

 " Perhaps you'll be good enough to look after my hoss a 
 bit. He cast a shoe just after I left Punkington." 
 
 Colonel Quagg, humiliated and crestfallen, proceeded to 
 shoe the horse, which had been quietly cropping the 
 stunted herbage while the Colonel was being licked. The 
 operation finished, as well as Quagg's bruised arms would 
 permit, the Grace-walker gravely handed him a coin, which 
 the blacksmith as gravely took ; then mounted his steed 
 and rode away. 
 
 Colonel Quagg has kept his promise. He left off rum 
 and parson licking, and is now one of the burning and 
 shining lights among the Grace-walking Brethren. 
 
 "SHUT OUT" 
 
 F. ANSTEY 
 (Adapted for Recital) 
 
 (From The Talking Horse (Smith, Elder & Co.) by special 
 permission of the Author) 
 
 IT is towards the end of an afternoon in December, and 
 Wilfred Rolleston is walking along a crowded London 
 street with his face turned westward. A few moments ago 
 and he was scarcely conscious of where he was or where he 
 meant to go : he was walking on mechanically in a heavy 
 stupor, through which there stole a haunting sense of 
 degradation and despair that tortured him dully. And 
 suddenly, as if by magic, this has vanished : he seems to 
 himself to have waked from a miserable day dream to the 
 sweet consciousness of youth and hope. 
 
 He is a boy again, to-day has been the last day of the 
 term, and the thought that his school troubles are over for 
 a time fills him with a sense of joy. Uncouth in manners 
 and dull of brain, he is not a favourite at school. There

 had been friendly good-byes for others, but none for him. 
 He had gone out alone, and the blankness had come over 
 him from which he has only just recovered. The dusk is 
 falling, and the shops he passes are brilliant with lights and 
 decorations, but he does not stop to look at any of them ; 
 his mind is busy with settling how he shall employ himself 
 on this the first evening of his liberty. Quite lately 
 yesterday or the day before his mother had spoken to 
 him, gently but very seriously, about what she called the 
 morose and savage fits which would bring misery upon him 
 if he did not set himself earnestly to overcome them. 
 
 He feels softened now somehow, and has a new longing 
 for the love he has so often harshly repulsed. He will 
 overcome this sulkiness of his ; he will begin this very 
 evening ; as soon as he gets home he will tell his mother 
 that he is sorry, that he does love her really, only that when 
 these fits come on him he hardly knows what he says or 
 does. 
 
 And she will forgive him, only too gladly ; and his mind 
 will be quite at ease again. No, not quite ; there is still 
 something he must do before that : he has a vague recollec- 
 tion of a long-standing coolness between himself and his 
 younger brother, Lionel. They never have got on very 
 well together; Lionel is so different much cleverer even 
 already, for one thing; better-looking too, and better- 
 tempered. Whatever they quarrelled about Wilfred is very 
 sure that he was the offender ; Lionel never begins that 
 kind of thing. But he will put himself in the right at once, 
 and ask Lionel to make friends again; he will consent 
 readily enough he always does. 
 
 And then he has a bright idea : he will take his brother 
 some little present to prove that he really wishes to behave 
 decently for the future. 
 
 He finds himself near a large toy shop at the time, and 
 in the window are displayed several regiments of brightly-

 coloured tin warriors the very thing ! Lionel is still 
 young enough to delight in them. 
 
 Feeling in his pockets, Rolleston discovers more loose 
 silver than he thought he possessed, and so he goes into 
 the shop and asks for one of the boxes of soldiers. He is 
 served by one of two neatly-dressed female assistants, who 
 stare and giggle at one another at his first words, finding it 
 odd, perhaps, that a fellow of his age should buy toys as 
 if, he thinks indignantly, they couldn't see that it was not 
 for himself he wanted the things. 
 
 But he goes on, feeling happier after his purchase. They 
 will see now that he is not so bad after all. It is long since 
 he has felt such a craving to be thought well of by some 
 body. 
 
 He hears someone singing a Christmas hymn and the 
 words remind him of that Christmas party at the Gordons', 
 next door. Did not Ethel Gordon ask him particularly to 
 come, and did he not refuse her sullenly ? What a brute 
 he was to treat her like that ! Not every girl as pretty as 
 Ethel is would care to notice him, and persist in it in spite 
 of everything. She never seems to think him good-for- 
 nothing as most people do, yet he has sulked with her of 
 late. Was it because she had favoured Lionel ? He is 
 ashamed to think that this may have been the reason. 
 
 Never mind, that is all over now ; he will start clear with 
 everybody. He will ask Ethel, too, to forgive him. 
 
 He is so occupied with his own thoughts that he is quite 
 surprised to find that he is very near the square where he 
 lives. This is his home, this little dingy, old-fashioned, red- 
 brick house at an angle of the square, with a small paved 
 space railed in before it. He pushes open the old gate 
 with the iron arch above, where an oil-lamp used to hang, 
 and hurries up to the door with the heavy, shell-shaped 
 porch, impatient to get to the warmth and light which 
 await him within.

 "SHUT OUT" 299 
 
 The bell was out of order, for only a faint jangle comes 
 below as he rings; he waits a little and then pulls the 
 handle again, more sharply this time, and still no one 
 comes. 
 
 Losing all patience, he gropes for the knocker, and, 
 groping in vain, begins to hammer with bare fists on the 
 door, louder and louder, until he is interrupted by a rough 
 voice from the railings behind him. 
 
 "Now then, what are you up to there, eh?" says the 
 voice, which belongs to a burly policeman who has stopped 
 suspiciously on the pavement. 
 
 " Why," says Rolleston, " I want to get in, and I can't 
 make them hear me. I wish you'd try what you can do, 
 will you ? " 
 
 The policeman comes slowly in to the gate. "I 
 dessay," he says jocularly. "Is there anythink else? 
 Come, suppose you move on." 
 
 A curious kind of dread of he knows not what begins to 
 creep over Wilfred at this. 
 
 " Move on?" he cries, "why should I move on? This 
 is my house ; don't you see ? I live here." 
 
 " Now look 'ere, my joker, I don't want a job over this," 
 says the constable, stolidly. " You'll bring a crowd round 
 in another minute if you keep on that 'ammering." 
 
 " Mind your own business," says the other with growing 
 excitement. 
 
 "That's what you'll make me do if you don't look out. 
 Will you move on before I make you ? " 
 
 "But, I say," protests Rolleston, "I'm not joking; I 
 give you my word I'm not. I do live here. Why, I've 
 just come back from school, and I can't get in." 
 
 " Pretty school you come from ! " growls the police- 
 man ; " 'andles on your lesson books, if I knows anything. 
 'Ere, out you go ! " 
 
 Rolleston's fear increases. " I won't ! I won't ! " he

 cries frantically, and rushing back to the door beats upon 
 it wildly. On the other side of it are love and shelter, and 
 it will not open to him. He is cold and hungry and tired 
 after his walk why do they keep him out like this ? 
 
 "Mother!" he calls hoarsely. "Can't you hear me, 
 mother ? It's Wilfred ; let me in ! " 
 
 The other takes him, not roughly, by the shoulder. 
 
 "Now, you take my advice," he says. "You ain't quite 
 yourself; you're making a mistake. I don't want to get 
 you in trouble if you don't force me to it. Drop this 'ere 
 tomfool game and go home quiet to wherever it is you do 
 live." 
 
 " I tell you I live here, you fool ! " shrieks Wilfred, in 
 deadly terror lest he should be forced away before the door 
 is opened. 
 
 " And I tell you you don't do nothing of the sort," says 
 the policeman, beginning to lose his temper. " No one 
 don't live 'ere, nor ain't done since I've bin on the beat. 
 Use your eyes if you're not too far gone." 
 
 For the first time Rolleston seems to see things plainly 
 as they are. The house is all shuttered and dark ; some 
 of the window panes are broken ; and there is a pale grey 
 patch in one that looks like a dingy bill. Can anything 
 any frightful disaster have come since he left that morn- 
 ing ? No, he will not let himself be terrified all for nothing. 
 
 " Now, are you goin' ? " says the policeman. 
 
 Rolleston puts his back against the door and clings to 
 the sides. " No ! " he shouts. " I don't care what you 
 say ; I don't believe you : they are all in there they are, 
 I tell you, they are they are ! " 
 
 In a second he is in the constable's strong grasp and 
 being dragged, struggling violently, to the gate, when a soft 
 voice, a woman's, intercedes for him. 
 
 "What is the matter? Oh, don't don't be so rough 
 with him, poor creature ! " she cries pitifully.

 "SHUT OUT" 301 
 
 " I'm only exercisin' my duty, mum," says the officer ; 
 " he wants to create a disturbance 'ere." 
 
 " No," cries Wilfred, "he lies ! I only want to get into 
 my own house, and no one seems to hear me. You don't 
 think anything is the matter, do you?" 
 
 It is a lady who has been pleading for him ; as he wrests 
 himself from his captor and comes forward she sees his 
 face, and her own grows white and startled. 
 
 " Wilfred ! " she exclaims. 
 
 " Why, you know my name ! " he says. " Then you can 
 tell him it's all right. Do I know you ? You speak like 
 is it Ethel?" 
 
 " Yes," says she, and her voice is low and trembling, " I 
 am Ethel." 
 
 He is silent for an instant ; then he says slowly, " You 
 are not the same nothing is the same ; it is all changed 
 changed and oh, my God, what am I ? " 
 
 Slowly the truth is borne in upon his brain, muddled and 
 disordered by long excess, and the last shred of the illusion 
 which had possessed him drifts away. 
 
 He knows now that his boyhood, with such possibilities 
 of happiness as it had ever held, has gone for ever. 
 He has been knocking at a door which will open for 
 him never again, and the mother by whose side his 
 evening was to have been passed died long, long years 
 ago. 
 
 The past, blotted out completely for an hour by some 
 freak of the memory, comes back to him, and he sees his 
 sullen, morbid boyhood changing into something worse 
 still, until by slow degrees he became what he is now 
 dissipated, degraded, lost. 
 
 At first the shock, the awful loneliness he awakes to, and 
 the shame of being found thus by the woman for whom he 
 had felt the only pure love he had known, overwhelm him 
 utterly. He leans his head upon his arms as he clutches

 the railings, and sobs with a grief that is terrible in its utter 
 abandonment. 
 
 The very policeman is awed into silence. 
 
 " You can go now," says the lady to him, putting money 
 in his hand. " You see I know this this gentleman. 
 Leave him to me ; he will give you no trouble now." 
 
 When he has gone, Rolleston raises his head with a 
 husky laugh : his manner has changed now ; he is no 
 longer the boy in thought and expression that he was a 
 short time before, and speaks as might be expected from 
 his appearance. 
 
 "I remember it all now," he says. "You are Ethel 
 Gordon, of course you are, and you wouldn't have anything 
 to do with me and quite right too and then you married 
 my brother Lionel. You see I'm as clear as a bell again 
 now. So you came up and found me battering at the old 
 door, eh? Do you know, I got the fancy I was a boy 
 again and coming home to bah, what does all that 
 matter ? Odd sort of fancy though, wasn't it ? Drink is 
 always playing me some cursed trick now. A pretty fool 
 I must have made of myself ! " 
 
 She says nothing, and he thrusts his hands deep in his 
 ragged pockets. " Hallo ! what's this I've got ? " he says, 
 as he feels something at the bottom of one of them, and, 
 bringing out the box of soldiers he had bought half an 
 hour before, he holds it up with a harsh laugh which has 
 a ring of despair in it. 
 
 " Do you see this ? " he says to her. " You'll laugh 
 when I tell you it's a toy I bought just now for guess 
 whom for your dear husband ! Must have been pretty 
 bad, mustn't I ? Shall I give it to you to take to him 
 no ? Well, perhaps he has outgrown such things now, so 
 here goes ! " and he pitches the box over the railings, and 
 it falls with a shiver of broken glass as the pieces of painted 
 tin rattle out upon the flagstones.

 " And now I'll wish you good evening," he says, sweeping 
 off" his battered hat with mock courtesy. 
 
 She tries to keep him back. "No, Wilfred, no; you 
 must not go like that. We live here still, Lionel and I, in 
 the same old house," and she indicates the house next door ; 
 " he will be home very soon. Tell me is there nothing 
 we can do no help we can give you ? " 
 
 " Nothing," he answers fiercely ; " I don't want your pity. 
 It's too late to snivel over me now, and I'm well enough as 
 I am. You leave me alone to go to the devil my own way ; 
 it's all I ask of you. Good-bye." 
 
 He turns on his heel at the last words and slouches off 
 down the narrow lane by which he had come. Ethel 
 Rolleston stands for a while, looking after his receding form 
 till the fog closes round it and she can see it no more. She 
 feels as if she had seen a ghost ; and for her at least the 
 enclosure before the deserted house next door will be 
 haunted evermore haunted by a forlorn and homeless 
 figure sobbing there by the railings.

 304 ELOCUTION 
 
 "Oh no, Martin. Do go," I cried; for this constant 
 reference to my helplessness was a sore trial to me, and as 
 the old fellow went off I shut my eyes with a sigh. 
 
 It was a lovely spring morning, and the garden was one 
 vast bewildering sweetness of colour and of scent. The 
 daffodils were nodding by my side as though marking the 
 rhythm of the melody that came from a poplar yonder, 
 where a thrush had lodged its nest ; and the soft fresh green 
 of the trees seemed to touch a sky that Dor6 would have 
 loved for its intensity of blue. Far as the eye could reach, 
 the land was mine ; of that stately old house by the farther 
 lawn, with its pictures, its carvings, and its historical 
 associations, I was the sole and undisputed master ; lastly, 
 I was young. Tolerably strong qualifications for a happy 
 life, you will say, you who are reading these pages ; but as 
 I lay there in the April sunshine I do not think there was 
 a more wretched man on God's wide world than I. Future 
 forests lie in an acorn, and saddest truths in a couple of 
 words : I was paralysed. Eighteen months ago I had been 
 in the army, engaged to you know the young lover's 
 liturgy the " queen of girls," the " loveliest of her sex." 
 The men dubbed me Adonis ; and backed by my good 
 looks, good birth, and above all, by a heavy purse, I had 
 been feted and caressed, fooled to the top of my bent. 
 And then? A fall in the hunting field, a sharp three 
 months of ceaseless pain, and the doctor's verdict was 
 given. I should only retain the use of my head and my 
 arms ; the rest of my body was already dead. And as for 
 the torn crushed face, the scars would doubtless heal in 
 time. A few light condolences, a few heavy cheques, and 
 the worthy gentlemen took their departure. Eighteen 
 months ago ! And all that time, with the exception of my 
 own servants, I had not seen a single face. Martin told me 
 that the good folk in the village were sorely troubled at my 
 seclusion. All sorts of tales, he averred, were rife, the

 most universally accepted theory being that I was mad. 
 What mattered it to me ? I could at least protect myself 
 from their staring eyes, from their wonderment, perhaps 
 from most galling of all ! their pity, by keeping to my 
 own grounds. From the one woman from whom I had a 
 right to expect sympathy had come the hardest blow (for 
 the " extreme nerve-sensitiveness " of my " queen of girls " 
 had forbidden her even to look on me when newly crippled, 
 but it had not prevented a subsequent wealthy match), and 
 so, why should I widen my appeal ? No, I would live and 
 die alone in my desolate home ! 
 
 " What a very ugly man ! " 
 
 My thoughts always the same weary thoughts which, 
 when Martin left me, had dragged back to the same well- 
 beaten round, took flight suddenly as the words reached 
 me; and opening my eyes in terror for my hermit-like 
 existence had rendered me as timid as a woman I saw a 
 little child standing at some paces from me. 
 
 "What are you doing here? How did you get here? 
 Go away." 
 
 My voice, rendered angry by surprise and distrust for 
 I dreaded that the child should be followed by others did 
 not in the least seem to frighten the little intruder. She 
 did not answer, but she stood looking steadily at me, and 
 I, in return, looked steadily back at her. Such a pretty 
 little girl ! The wind had crept under the big sun-bonnet, 
 and the soft fair hair was blowing about her temples. A 
 straight little nose, the prettiest of baby mouths, and eyes 
 that were a perfect revelation to me in their absolute inno- 
 cence and trust ? Trust ? Ay, that was it. This child 
 was looking at me, at my twisted and scarred face, at my 
 poor helpless limbs, and yet she was neither afraid nor piti- 
 ful. Small wonder that my heart went out to her in a rush 
 of love and gratitude, as, with a dim remembrance of my

 small nursery friends in the Mayfair of other days, I 
 stretched out a hand. 
 
 " Come here, little one. So I am very ugly, am I ? 
 Well, now, do you know who I am?" 
 
 She nodded wisely, answering me in the soft, deliberate 
 voice I was soon to love so dearly. 
 
 " Yes, I know : you're the Beast." 
 
 " The what V 
 
 She was clasping a tattered picture-book in both her 
 chubby hands, and she now held it out straight before her, 
 peeping over the top with solemn blue eyes. " Beauty and 
 the Beast" I read the title, and then took her treasure 
 from her, wondering what on earth she could mean. 
 
 And the house and the gardens were always shut up quite 
 tight. No one ever saw the poor Beast, because he was so 
 ugly he ivould not come out. But he was very lonely and 
 miserable, and all the time he was hoping that Beauty would 
 come. 
 
 "That's it," cried the child, delightedly. "Does Beauty 
 ever come ? " 
 
 " No, Beauty never came. It hurt her to look on me. 
 She was so 'sensitive,' you know." 
 
 I spoke very bitterly, but my new friend only smiled in 
 reply. 
 
 "That's all right," she said comfortably. "We don't 
 want her, you and me. And now I suppose it is time to 
 have some cake, isn't it ? " 
 
 This was practical, with a vengeance. I blew the whistle 
 for Martin, and enjoyed his utter amazement at the sight 
 of my little visitor. 
 
 " It is little Miss Trent, one of the Vicar's daughters," 
 he told me, " and I am thinking that her pa will be in a 
 pretty way about her. He'll think she is lost." 
 
 " Oh ! of course he will. Send down to the village at 
 once. Sir Charles Lloyd's compliments, and the little girl

 is quite safe. If he will allow me to keep her for an hour, 
 I will send her home in the carriage." 
 
 Martin only stared in reply. He evidently feared I had 
 taken leave of my senses. 
 
 "You will keep her?" he stammered. "And yet you 
 won't see " 
 
 " Here, go and send someone," I interrupted. " I mean 
 what I say. And bring some cake or something from the 
 house." 
 
 The child called after him to be sure and tell papa that 
 he was not to be angry, and that she had crept through a 
 hole in the hedge ; and then she proposed clambering up 
 on to my couch, which was accordingly done. 
 
 " Now, will you hold me so I can't fall ? " she said, per- 
 suasively : " Hold my frock like that," and with a sudden 
 glow of intense satisfaction I took hold of the piece of pink 
 cambric with which she presented me. It was the first time 
 since the accident that I had been asked to do anything, 
 to be of use in the slightest way ; and my self-respect, which 
 in this weary year of self-loathing and contempt had well- 
 nigh died within me, sprang into life at the baby's request. 
 This seems but a trivial thing to write down, but though I 
 am an old man now, and they tell me that my books have 
 prevented my life being altogether a useless one, no kindly 
 letter of thanks or encouragement I may receive has ever 
 wrought me one tithe of the good that came with her 
 words, " Hold me so I can't fall." It was the first little 
 seed of hope, and I blessed the tiny sower. 
 
 Meanwhile she chattered on. Her name was Winifred ; 
 she was six years old ; and the house was so full at home. 
 There was Miss Rose and papa, and Jessie and Floss, and 
 the boys, and the twins, and the baby. " And wasn't I 
 glad the daffies were out ? And Jack had tied a bunch to 
 the kitty's tail, and Miss Rose said he was a bad boy. Did 
 I think it was so very bad?" And so on and on, telling

 308 ELOCUTION 
 
 me of all the merry, tempestuous life led in the rambling 
 old vicarage. I revelled in her talk. That such life, such 
 jollity, should be at a stone's throw from my own door 
 seemed to bring me once again within the pale of humanity ; 
 and when the soft voice broke into little shrieks of laughter, 
 as she told how Jacky had blacked the baby, and how Miss 
 Rose had thought he was a nigger, her merriment grew so 
 contagious that I too joined in the fun, and Martin, return- 
 ing, stood aghast at the sound of my laughter. 
 
 " The Vicar's compliments, and he hoped I should allow 
 him to call on the morrow." 
 
 " Not for worlds ! " My nervous dread of my solitude 
 being invaded returned with redoubled vigour, and I told 
 Martin that he must deny me as best he could, but that I 
 would see neither cleric nor layman. If Mr Trent would 
 let his little daughter come to me I should be very grate- 
 ful, but with her it must end ; I would have no visitors. 
 But our happy morn had been disturbed by the very 
 thought. I felt restless and ill at ease, and when Winifred 
 remarked she thought she had better go, I promptly agreed 
 with her. Martin lifted her off the couch, and then, with- 
 out the slightest warning, she stood on tiptoe and kissed 
 me good-bye. 
 
 " Now the hands." She kissed me on each palm, and 
 then pressed my hands together, holding them close in her 
 own velvety fingers. "When you say your prayers to- 
 night, you'll hold my kisses quite tightly," she said quaintly. 
 "Good-bye, dear Beast." 
 
 " Good-bye, dear Beauty ; " and Winifred was gone. 
 
 " Seems to me, Sir Charles," said Martin, as he laid me 
 in bed that night, "that the parson thinks we are all 
 heathens here ! " and the old fellow gave a broad grin. He 
 had lived with my father before my birth, and often 
 favoured me with unasked opinions. " He has been 
 precious anxious to get in here for a long time past, but

 BEAUTY AND THE BEAST 309 
 
 I told him to-day that seeing you was you little missy 
 was the better parson." 
 
 The Rev. Arthur Trent was even more correct than old 
 Martin knew. I was very nearly a heathen in those days, 
 but still, for that night " You'll hold my kisses when you 
 say your prayers," Winifred had said and for that night, 
 at least, I did say my prayers. 
 
 And the days went on. Spring had changed to 
 summer, and the roses were in full bloom. Little 
 Winifred Trent, or " Beauty," as I always called her, 
 cherishing the pretty fancy that had first led her to 
 me, came to me day by day throughout those summer 
 months. As far as I could gather, she was one of those 
 lonely, rather neglected children of whom there is at least 
 one in every large family ; and being a quiet, old-fashioned 
 little thing into the bargain, she was well content to escape 
 the rough games of her noisier brothers and sisters to trot 
 after my couch as Martin pushed me about the garden, or 
 to sit by my side in the old panelled library. What long, 
 delicious hours we passed, we two ! Beauty had a 
 fund of .quaint, unlearned wisdom, and used to tell me 
 wonderful tales of all that the roses were whispering when 
 their crimson heads were nodding in the breeze. The 
 simplest phases of every-day life were full of unknown 
 marvels to this six-year-old child. She would hide the 
 shadow on the sun-dial under a bed of moss, and then 
 gaze in round-eyed astonishment when the long grey escaped 
 its green prison, in staid defiance of the busy fingers. A 
 favourite bud would be kissed good-night, and then trick her 
 in the morning by being " quite grown-up." She never woke 
 from her dreams to find herself a woman ; and who was it 
 taught the rosebud ? And then, when, tired of the sun- 
 shine, we crept into the cool dim library, what happy hours 
 we spent, what baby confidences were whispered ! Old- 
 world historians made the strongest of thrones, and Ovid

 served as a footstool. I have a Froissart now, where her 
 favourite picture is stained by the poppies she pressed 
 there ; and in a cherished Homer lies a shining curl she 
 cut off for a freak one day, and vowed I must keep it for 
 " ever and ever." 
 
 I feel I am lingering too much. A helpless cripple and 
 a sunny-haired child are not the dramatis persona of which 
 to make a readable story. Only /can tell what that inno- 
 cent little life was to mine. Only / can know how that 
 wee bright ray from another world, as it seemed, opened to 
 me a knowledge of the sunshine that was still existing in 
 our own. The touch of the soft baby fingers, as she traced 
 the scars on my face, healed them in a way that no surgeon's 
 skill had done ; and when Beauty, her blue eyes brimming 
 with tears, told me of the village baby who had died that 
 morning, of the tiny waxen face, and the poor mother's red 
 eyes, I entered into my first communication with the outer 
 world by sending help to the sad, poverty-stricken woman. 
 Bit by bit Beauty won me back, if not to my old pursuits, 
 at least to others that might take their place. The news 
 that there were such a funny hole in her nursery ceiling, 
 woke me to the consciousness that it was my business as 
 landlord to keep the Vicar's house in repair ; and a grateful 
 note from Mr Trent induced a further supervision of the 
 cottages round about. Little wonder that the poor blessed 
 that April morning when Beauty first forced her way into 
 the Beast's castle ! 
 
 " Only a bit of childhood thrown away / " How per- 
 sistently that line of old Beaumont's went running in my 
 head. My couch had been wheeled into the garden, now 
 in the full blaze of its August glory, and Beauty was near 
 me digging in her own little plot of ground, where she 
 sowed shoe-buttons, and where geraniums blossomed in 
 their stead, and where various other marvels took place. 
 I had been lying there idly watching the child. How

 BEAUTY AND THE BEAST 311 
 
 strong she looked, the very embodiment of health and 
 beauty, with the fair cheeks tanned by the constant sun- 
 shine, and her blue eyes dancing with fun and mischief- 
 A sudden wise remark in speaking of the baby-brother at 
 home had led me for the first time to wonder as to what 
 sort of woman my little friend would grow up. Tall, slender, 
 and beautiful exceedingly; sympathetic, sweet, and most 
 gracious. I had spent the morning in such dreamings as 
 these, and now this afternoon all my pleasant fancies and 
 wonderings were put to flight by the ceaseless persistence 
 with which the poet's words rang in my head " Only a 
 bit of childhood thrown away" 
 
 " Beauty, come here, darling, and show me the flowers." 
 I called to the child, anxious to rid myself of the thought, 
 but the industrious little gardener did not hear me. She 
 had wandered farther down the path, and was now nearly 
 out of sight. In the distance I could hear the contented 
 little voice singing a nursery ditty ; and satisfied as to my 
 Beauty's well-being, I was soon lost in my book. 
 
 Suddenly my couch began to move ! 
 
 You who are able to protect yourselves, who have full 
 control of your limbs, and who can guard off any danger 
 that menaces you you will not understand me when I say 
 that my heart literally stood still with terror. I felt for the 
 whistle : it had fallen to the ground ; and at the same 
 moment a joyous bark in the rear told me that Beauty's 
 latest plaything, a blundering Newfoundland puppy, must 
 have broken loose from the stable-yard, and rushing wildly 
 along the garden paths in search of its little mistress, had 
 come full tilt against the couch, which the impetus of the 
 blow had been sufficient to set in motion. The guiding 
 wheel had been turned sharp round with a view to making 
 at safer, but alas ! for old Martin's care, that guiding wheel 
 pointed in the direction of a slanting side-path ; and, after 
 a horrible moment of suspense, while the blue sky swung

 312 ELOCUTION 
 
 around me and the bark of the puppy shut all other sounds 
 from my ears, the couch started down-hill, rolling somewhat 
 slowly at first, but gaining speed with every turn of the 
 wheels. 
 
 " Don't be 'fraid. I'll stop you ; I'll stop you ! " 
 The voice, Beauty's voice, rang out clear and shrill. The 
 child had seen what had happened, and now came flying 
 up the path with both tiny arms extended. Terror must 
 have rendered me stupid ; for a moment I did not under- 
 stand the baby's meaning. Then, " Go away, darling ! go 
 away ! " I screamed, as the space between us rapidly 
 lessened. " Don't touch me ! Oh God, save the child ! " 
 
 The agony in my voice arrested her steps, and for one 
 moment she stood upright and motionless, beautiful as a 
 guardian angel who wards the path of danger; and the next 
 ah ! how can I write it ? She was knocked down, the 
 couch stopped with a jerk as the wheel ground into the 
 little soft body, and then, as it turned slowly over, I was 
 flung out on to the path. 
 
 When I awoke to consciousness I was in my own room. 
 " It was only a long fainting fit. He is all right," I heard 
 someone say ; and then another voice replied, " I wish the 
 poor girl was as well as he is " " She is seriously injured, 
 sir ? " It was Martin who asked the question, and it 
 seemed to me a long time before the answer came: "She 
 is dying." 
 
 I lay and listened to them as a man in a dream. Beauty 
 was dying ! The words did not convey anything to me. I 
 looked at the brass knob of the bedstead : it would make a 
 capital ball, I thought, and Beauty and I would roll it 
 about in the sunshine. How she would laugh when it 
 glittered ! But I forgot. Of course she would not play 
 now, for they said that Beauty was dying. I raised my 
 eyes from the brasses, and fixed them on the wall, where,

 BEAUTY AND THE BEAST 313 
 
 with busy, mischievous fingers, she had pencilled the 
 papered rosebuds. The pencil was still on the mantelshelf, 
 and we meant to finish them on the morrow. But surely 
 there was some reason why we might not finish them on 
 the morrow ? What was it ? Did Martin know ? Where 
 was Martin ? Ah ! my groping hands had at last lighted 
 upon the poor fellow, who was bending over me, and at 
 the touch of the rough, gnarled hands at last I understood. 
 I understood ! 
 
 " Martin, take me to her." 
 
 " Mr Charlie, my poor lad ! You mustn't go. You 
 mustn't go." It was the old boyish name he gave me as 
 he hung over the bed, with the hot tears coursing down his 
 furrowed old cheeks. " Mr Charlie, her father is with her, 
 and the doctor, and the two big physicians down from 
 town. You can do nothing for her, my poor lad, and your 
 heart will break to see her there." 
 
 " Martin, I must go." I put both arms round his neck, 
 and dragged myself close to him. " I know you can't get 
 the couch, but I'm small and slight. Look, Martin, you 
 can carry me well enough ! " 
 
 " Carry you ? I'd die for you, Mr Charlie ! " and thus 
 carried in the same kind arms which had first held me as a 
 white-robed child, I went to kiss my Beauty good-bye. 
 
 She was lying in the library. 
 
 At one end stood a pile of books, of which we had built 
 a castle only that morning : a headless doll lay on the mat ; 
 a half-finished daisy-chain was on the table. They tell me 
 that the room was full of people, but of them I saw nothing. 
 It did not strike me until long, long afterwards that this 
 was the first time for nearly two years I had looked on my 
 fellow-man. As Martin carried me down the long room I 
 only saw these evidences of the sweet child-life. Of Mr 
 Trent, of his sister, of the doctors, I have no recollection, 
 but a gaily-painted ball that lay on our path is still in my

 possession : I remember the doll, and the daisies, and then 
 I remember being propped up on chairs by the side of the 
 cushions where Beauty lay. 
 
 The child was apparently asleep, and there I waited by 
 her. Someone moved the lamp, and the soft, rosy light fell 
 full upon her. All the pretty hair had been shorn from her 
 temples, and her lips were bloodless, but otherwise there was 
 but little change. The warm light falling on the tanned 
 cheeks gave her a semblance of colour, and the lips were 
 parted in a smile. And yet. Beauty was dying ! Tick ! 
 tick ! went the clock on the mantelpiece, and I could almost 
 hear the baby voice counting the bell-like strokes. There 
 was a long-standing jest between us about the big hand 
 doing all the work, and the little hand being such a lazy 
 fellow; and now, as the old clock ticked solemnly on, it 
 seemed to be repeating over and over again the words that 
 had haunted me when we were in the garden : " On-ly-a- 
 bit-of-child-hood-thrown-a-way" Someone (I suppose the 
 doctor) was whispering to me. I could not catch the 
 words, but he seemed to be telling me that my darling was 
 free from pain, and that very likely she would leave us in 
 her sleep. 
 
 " Without one word ! " 
 
 As I spoke I stretched a hand towards her, and true to 
 the last to the comfort she had ever brought me, Beauty 
 opened her eyes and looked full at me. 
 
 "Read Beauty and the Beast" she whispered. "It is 
 almost time to go home, isn't it ? " 
 
 " Not to-night, my darling ! I can't read to-night ! " My 
 voice choked as I strove to answer her, but the weak 
 whisper was repeated. 
 
 " But you always read it before I go. Do read it to- 
 night." 
 
 Tears stood in the sweet blue eyes as she reiterated her 
 request ; and then I felt the book was put into my hands,

## p. 315 (#331) ############################################


 
 BEAUTY AND THE BEAST 315 
 
 and I was told to read. "The child must go in peace." 
 Was it the glorious sheen from the wings of the angels who 
 stood waiting to bear her homeward that made the room so 
 bright ? Was it the strange new radiance on the baby face 
 that calmed my sobs and made the printed words grow 
 clear before my eyes ? 
 
 "Yes, I will read it, Beauty." 
 
 " Thank you, dear Beast." 
 
 " And the house and the gardens were always shut up quite 
 tight. No one ever saw the poor Beast, because he was so ugly 
 he would not come out. But he was very lonely and miser- 
 able, and all the time he was hoping that Beauty would 
 come" 
 
 For a moment my eyes grew dim. That very sentence 
 
 had first brought her to me, and now ? Ah ! Beauty, 
 
 Beauty ! 
 
 " And the Beauty and the Beast were very happy together. 
 They loved each other very much? 
 
 A tiny sigh broke from the child's lips, and I stopped in 
 sudden fear. 
 
 "It is almost time to go home, isn't it, Beast?" 
 
 "Yes, my darling. Very, very soon." 
 
 " I'm so glad. Finish it quick." 
 
 " Till at last they wanted Beauty to go back to herfatlier's 
 home. And they sent for her, and the poor Beast had to let 
 her go." 
 
 With faltering voice and bowed head I had read on, but 
 now 
 
 "You needn't finish it, "whispered old Martin, and at the 
 touch of the trembling hand on my shoulder the room grew 
 suddenly dark. The angels had flown back to Paradise, 
 and the little child could no longer hear me. 
 
 Beauty had gone to her Father's Home !
