NOTE TO THE TEACHER
Although the matter of this book,—the Prin-
ciples, Drills, and Exercises as well as the Selections,
—is arranged for three graded courses,—the Be-
ginners', the Intermediate, and the Advanced,—it
will not be necessary to adhere strictly to this plan
in the use of the book for class-work. However,
should the three-course plan be adopted, the follow-
ing distribution of the matter is suggested as prac-
ticable:
(1) The Beginners' Course:
(a) Chapters on Voice Culture, Articula-
tion and Pronunciation, complete;
(b) Chapters on Pause, Stress, Pitch,-
from the beginning to the point where
INTERMEDIATE COURSE is inserted near
the left margin.
(2) The Intermediate Course:
(a) Chapters on Pause, Stress, Pitch,—
from the insertion of INTERMEDIATE
COURSE (near left margin) to end;
(b) Chapters on Force, Movement, Form,
complete;
(c) Chapters on Inflexion, Quality, Body
Movements,-from beginning to the in-
sert, ADVANCED COURSE (near left mar-
gin).
(3) The Advanced Course:
(a) Chapters on Inflexion, Quality, Body

Movements, from the insert, ADVANCED
COURSE (near left margin), to end.
It will, no doubt, be found profitable for the class
to review some of the drills and exercises of one or
the other of the previous courses, particularly those
of Voice Culture, Articulation, Pitch, Force, Move-
ment, Inflexion, Quality.
The distribution of the Selections is indicated at
the beginning of each of the three parts.


## p. 3 (#23) ###############################################

Introduction
Elocution is the art of expressing effectively in
public speech one's thoughts and feelings. This is
done by voice and action. The hearers are thus
doubly informed and impressed, viz: through the
ear and through the eye.
To be an effective elocutionist one must aim, in
both voice and action, at clearness, beauty and
strength: at clearness, in order to be intelligible; at
beauty, in order to please; at strength, in order to
convince and persuade. Now both voice and action
may be cultivated and perfected to this threefold
end by proper elocutionary training.
It is essential, however, that elocutionary train-
ing should help the student to be natural, and should
discover and develop whatever is best in his nature.
If it makes his delivery artificial, it defeats its pur-
pose, which is none other than “to hold the mirror
up to nature, to show virtue her own feature, scorn
her own image, and the very age and body of the
time his form and pressure.” It is wrong, therefore,
for an instructor in Elocution to expect his pupils
to imitate his manner; for no two persons will por-
tray the same emotion alike in every instance. Nor
is it correct to insist on detailed theorizing about
rules and principles, or to give minute directions by
marks how words and passages are to be rendered.
Where natures differ so widely, only principles of a
universal order may be inculcated. It seems, there-
fore, that the aim of a system of elocutionary train-
ing should be:


## p. 4 (#24) ###############################################

STUDENT’S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
1
(1) to rid the student of mannerisms;
(2) to supply an abundance of voice and action
drills;
(3) to lay down some general principles, illus-
trated by examples for practice;
(4) to encourage and facilitate much practice in
interpretation of thought and feeling by a copious
variety of standard models, graduated according to
the proficiency of the student.
Elocution is at once an attractive study, and as a prac-
tice, a very wholesome bodily and mental exercise. The lung
and voice drills increase vocal compass, power and flexibility,
and improve the general health; while the practice in gestures
and positions adds grace and effectiveness to bodily move-
ments. Nor does any pursuit score happier results from a
literary viewpoint. The student is not merely introduced to
some of the finest models of the language, but likewise be-
comes thoroughly conversant with them. For to interpret
them to an audience, as he is required to do, he must first
familiarize and identify himself with every detail of their
thought and feeling. And the more frequently he ponders
these, the keener will be his mental delight, as shade after
shade of meaning is unfolded to his inquiring mind. As a
result of the critical study needed for elocutionary inter-
pretation, the student will develop the habit not only of
thinking with an author in private reading, but, what is
far superior, of feeling with him. His love for reading
sound literature will grow apace. His mental grasp will be
quickened and strengthened. Accuracy in the expression
of thought in composition writing will increase, and his
literary style will improve.

How to Prepare a Selection
(1) Read the selection
the selection - slowly, carefully,
thoughtfully. Be sure to grasp the precise meaning
of each sentence before passing on to the next one.
Read a sentence, then pause,—think,—reflect. If
possible, analyze each paragraph.
A faithful compliance with the foregoing directions and
those following under Nos. 2, 3, 4, will, beside insuring
other happy results, aid the student in the task of memo-
rizing his selection.
(2) Ascertain the dominant thought of the se-
lection, i.e. the particular truth it chiefly seeks to
explain or prove; be sincerely convinced of this
truth, and resolve to convince your hearers of it.
(3) Determine the dominant feeling or emotion
which the selection is intended to arouse in the hear-
ers; enter deeply into it, so that you may commu-
nicate it to your hearers. Feel the emotion yourself.
(4) Note the subordinate thoughts and feelings,
and ascertain their relative prominence. Repeated
reflection on passages to be spoken or read will per-
fect one's interpretation, and bring to light deeper
shades of meaning.
(5) Then and not before then learn the selection
by heart, and do this perfectly. Be sure to do this.
You may recite the lines to yourself without a hitch,
when you can attend to them alone; but in the pres-
ence of an audience, other things, such as distur-
bances, the consciousness of the presence of others,
your own emotions, will engross or divide your at-
tention, and leave your memory a blank. To give

full attention to the expression of feeling and this
you should do,—you must have memorized your
lines so well, that they may come spontaneously.
(6) Resolve to speak from deep conviction and
with all the feeling due both in kind and intensity.
(7) Rehearse the selection in the presence of a
competent critic or coach and profit by his sugges-
tions.
Begin to speak with the firm resolve to be sincere
throughout, determining that your voice and action
shall be a portrayal of what you think and feel, care-
fully shunning indifference on the one hand and vain
display on the other.
How to Appear
Before an Audience
(1) Walk to your place at a moderate gait, with
modest demeanor, eyes and chin down, hands hang-
ing freely at side of body. Do not raise your eyes to
look at the audience until you have halted at the
place of speaking or reading, which should be well
to the front of the platform.
(2) Survey audience only for an instant; then
proceed at once to make the bow, as follows: With
eyes on audience, slowly bend lower part of back,
allowing the flexion gradually to move to the upper
part of back and neck, until, last of all, the head
slightly inclines downward. There must be no halt
in the flexions; they must be rounded gracefully
and easily from one into another so as to form one
continuous movement. Be sure to feel the respect
that the bow is intended to signify.


## p. 7 (#27) ###############################################

MANNERISMS
[7]
(3) The bow finished, face the audience, with
chin down, arms and hands limp at side of body,
fingers as in walking, and announce the title of the
selection.
(4) This done, shift into the attitude required
at the beginning of the selection.
(5) When reading from a book, hold it in the
left hand, slightly to one side so as not to hide the
face, and high enough to allow sufficient elevation
of chin and freedom of throat.
(6) Throughout the selection maintain the air
and attitude of an elocutionist. There must be action
always,-not necessarily gesticulation, even when
there are pauses for transition, for emphasis, etc.
Mannerisms
The first endeavor of the student of elocution
should be to rid himself of mannerisms. These are
certain excessive peculiarities in voice or action as-
sumed from mere force of habit. Not harmonizing
with the rest of the action, they detract from and
mar instead of adding to expression.
There are mannerisms of gesture, of head, trunk
and limb positions, of facial expressions, of gait,
and of vocal inflections. Have a competent critic to
point out to you your mannerisms,—if you have
any,—and proceed at once to break yourself of
them. Vigilance and will-power will be of service
to you.
Persistent practice, with attention fixed
upon avoiding them, will eradicate them, as habit
yields to habit.

Mention is made here incidentally that the students
should be called on to criticize publicly the elocutionary ef-
forts of their classmates, pointing out both defects and ex-
cellences. This will not only tend to keep up the interest
and attention of the class, but it will enlarge the students'
powers of observation and judgment.
Voice Culture
*
A fundamental prerequisite for clear and effec-
tive reading and speaking is a sound and healthful
condition of the vocal organs together with the
proper use of them. Hence the importance of
strengthening, developing, and training them.*
The vocal organs are:
(1) The lungs and lung muscles, (the motor ele-
ment);
2) The wind-pipe or trachea;
(3) The larynx with the vocal ligaments or
cords, (the vibrating element);
(4) The pharynx (i. e. the upper part of
throat), the mouth (including tongue, teeth, and
lips), and nasal passages, (the resonating element).
The student should study the structure and functions
of the vocal organs,—diaphragm, lungs, larynx, mouth,
tongue, lips,--by consulting a text-book on Anatomy and
Physiology or a cyclopedia on the subject.
*The ancient Greeks regarded voice-training a part of
the proper education of every student. Classes among them
were graded, so that beginners were exercised in strengthen-
ing the voice and enlarging its compass; the intermediates,
in acquiring a resonant quality; the advanced in training
the voice to graceful and forceful inflexion.

VOICE CULTURE
[9]
The lungs, right and left, supply the breath,
which, passing thence through the bronchial tubes
into the trachea where it is shaped into a solid air-
column, strikes the vocal cords, causing them to
vibrate, and producing tones. These tones assume
characteristic qualities in the resonance chamber,
composed of the pharynx, the mouth, and nasal
passages.
As two of the vocal organs,—the lungs with their
muscles, and the mouth and nasal passages,—are mainly re-
sponsible for voice improvement, special instructions and
exercises will be devoted to them in this chapter.
(I) The Lungs and Lung Muscles
Breathing is caused by the expansion and con-
traction of the lungs. There are three modes of
breathing: the clavicular or collar-bone, the costal
or rib, and the diaphragmatic, respectively so called
from the muscles used in the process of inhaling
and exhaling air. The lungs are cone-shaped, with
the apex in the upper part of the chest, and the base
or broad portion in the lower.
Collar-bone breathing and rib breathing are not
the correct modes, as they engage and inflate only
the upper and middle—the narrower—portions of
the lungs. Hence actors use collar-bone breathing
to express great physical exhaustion. It is charac-
terized by the shoulders alternately rising and fall-
ing during speech.
The diaphragm is the large, broad muscular
body that is attached to the waist all around, and
forms a partition or floor separating the chest from

[10]

the abdomen. It is dome-shaped. When it sinks in
the center to inflate the lungs, its edges extend,
causing the waist to bulge out.
(1) Place one hand on the waist, and with the
other lift a heavy weight. Notice how the waist
bulges out and becomes rigid. That is directly due
to the action of the diaphragm.
(2) With one hand on the waist, cause the waist
to repeat the action, without lifting the weight. If
you can do this, you have control over the dia-
phragm.
(3) Now with hand on waist repeat the fore-
going action once more, and while holding waist out
and firm, utter sharply pap, tap, cap. That exem-
plifies the action of the diaphragm in singing and
speaking.
From its position, whence it distends and opens
up the lower part of the lungs, from its naturally
powerful structure, and from its dome-like shape, it
is plain that it is intended by nature as the great
breathing muscle. The intercostal muscles should
also be used in singing and speaking, but the lion's
share of the work should be done by the diaphragm.
Therefore the public reader and speaker should see
that the breathing tension and movement for tone
enunciation are felt at the waist, not at the collar-
bone or shoulders, and that the latter remain pas-
sive and motionless during utterance.
Hence in order that the action of the diaphragm may
be perfectly free and easy, the waist should not be cramped
by clothing. For this reason the practice of wearing belts
instead of suspenders is harmful.

Exercises for Lungs and Lung Muscles
Preliminary Instructions*
In all vocal exercises observe the following
rules:
(1) Stand erect. With heels nearly together,
and forming a slight angle, throw weight on balls
of feet; let heels barely touch floor.
This will cause chest to rise; it will energize the whole
body, and give you a graceful, manly position. Avoid forcing
back the shoulders: they will fall into position of themselves.
(2) With arms akimbo, place palms of hands on
side of waist, with fingers in front, thumbs in rear.
(3) Inhale through nostrils.
(4) The diaphragm must act and move,—not
the shoulders nor the upper chest.
(5) No strain or tension at the throat or neck.
No nervous lifting of the shoulders. No painful
forcing of the tone forward. Remember that energy
increases as the waist swells.
(6) Keep waist out and firm.
*Not all of the conventional vocal exercises are equally
useful for both speakers and singers. Indeed, there are some
that are quite serviceable for singers that are not at all so
for speakers, while there are some others that are worth the
attention of speakers only. This is traceable to the natural
difference between the speaking and the singing voice,-a
difference that is so marked that, according to the Century
Dictionary (v. Speaking Voice) "many persons who have
a good voice for one use have a very poor voice for the
other.” Alexander J. Ellis points out no less than four phases
of variance in the two voices, viz: "Singing and speaking
differ in compass; singing is at a sustained, speaking at a
gliding pitch; singing requires a clear, speaking at times an
įmpeded passage for the breath . that is sometimes even
destructive of any musical tone whatever; singing has to be

(7) Economize breath, that is, exhale not more
breath than is needed for vocalization when speak-
ing. This will give you clear tones.
Speak aloud into the flame of a lighted candle. The
more it flickers, the greater is the waste and the less the
economy of breath. To facilitate breath economy, avoid
initial “h” in all voice exercises of this chapter.
(a) For Erect Attitude and Chest Development
(1) Stand on tiptoe. Then stretch the heels
downward till they touch the floor, but in so doing,
be sure not to let the body sway backward. Notice
how the chest rises spontaneously.
This and the following exercises will aid one to walk in
an erect position.
(2) Without relaxing from the foregoing posi-
tion rise on tiptoe again, and repeat the whole
exercise.
(3) Continue repeating.
Notice the tendency of the chest to rise more and more
the oftener the movement of the heels from and to the floor
is repeated, provided the body is not permitted to sway back-
ward.
This exercise is invaluable, moreover, for energizing the
body and expelling lassitude. Besides, it develops a number
of muscles from the shoulders to the feet.
rapid and slurred, where speaking can not be so." Since
the two voices differ so widely in certain ones of their essen-
tial uses, it stands to reason that the training of them in
respect of these very uses should not be identical. Hence
some of the vocal exercises required for the cultivation of
the singing voice need not be recommended for students of
elocution.

(b) For Correct Breathing
Never inhale through the mouth: always
through the nostrils.
The nasal passages are designed by nature to filtrate,
warm, and moisten the air on its way to the larynx. Mouth-
breathing causes dry, sore, and inflamed throats, and does
incalculable injury to the voice.*
Breathing exercises not only develop the lungs and train
the lung muscles, but they invigorate the whole physical sys-
fem. Nothing so well strengthens and clears the voice just
before speaking or singing. They should be taken in the
open air whenever that is possible. Do not fear if the air
be cold: no one will catch a cold, however low the tempera-
ture or stiff the breeze, so long as he breathes deeply. In-
deed, there is no better way of preventing a cold while
standing or sitting exposed to the inclement weather.
(1) Stand according to directions on pages [11]
and [12]. Inhale through nostrils, expanding first
the waist, then the upper chest region. Hold breath
a few seconds, then exhale slowly through nostrils.
Waist out and firm. Repeat a few times.
(2) Inhale as in 1. Then with lungs filled, beat
chest lightly with tips of fingers, and try to inhale
still more air. Then exhale quickly through nostrils.
Repeat a few times, but discontinue if you observe
dizziness.
These two exercises are excellent for moistening the
membrane of nostrils when dry.
(3) Inhale as before. Then exhale very slowly
*Mouth-breathing occurs chiefly during sleep, and
while snoring is usually a sign of it, not all mouth
breathing is accompanied by snoring. There are various
mechanical devices for the cure of mouth-breathing during
sleep, that have sometimes proved successful as remedies.
A mouth-breather should not delay securing one of them.

through mouth with a prolonged "oohm" (not
"hoohm"), scarcely audible.
A good exercise to master breath economy.
(4) Inhale as in 1. Count from one to ten. As
soon as you utter ten, suddenly grasp breath, and
count as before. Repeat this twice. Then increase
to fifteen, then to twenty, and so on till you can
count in one breath from one to sixty, eighty, and
more. Chest out and firm throughout. Be sure, in
each case, as soon as breath is exhausted, instantly
to grasp breath afresh, and directly to resume
counting from one on.
This exercise will help you to grasp breath promptly in
rapid utterance.
(c) For Diaphragm
(1) Inhale slowly, take deep breath at dia-
phragm, hold breath a moment, waist firm, then
cough out "uh" four times. Note action of dia-
phragm.
(2) Repeat 1, laughing out "uh" (not “huh”)
six times. Note diaphragm.
(3) Repeat first 1, then 2, in whisper.
(4) Repeat 1, sighing a prolonged "uh."
(5) Repeat 1, exhaling slowly a long, drawn-out
"ooh.” This is the action of diaphragm in effusive
form. See chapter on "Form," page [69].
(6) Repeat 5, exhaling four distinct "oohs" in
one breath. This is action of diaphragm in expulsive
form.
(7) Repeat 5, exhale in sharp shouts eight
“oohs" in one breath. This is action of diaphragm
in explosive form.


## p. 15 (#35) ##############################################

[15]
(8) Repeat 5, 6, 7, successively, but count from
one to six while exhaling,—diaphragm as in 5, 6, 7.
(9) Repeat 8 in whisper, same action of dia-
phragm.
(10) Repeat 5, exhale, uttering effusively:
"The air is stirred as by a mourner's sigh."
(11) Repeat 10, whispering:
“Gentle knave, good night!
I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee."
(12) Repeat 6, exhale, uttering expulsively:
"On, still on, he presses and forever.”
(13) Repeat 12, whispering : “How came she by
that light?"
(14) Repeat 7, exhale, uttering explosively:
"Hence, horrible shadow! Unreal mockery, hence!"
(15) Repeat 14, whispering: "The foe! The
foe! They come! They come !"
(II) Mouth and Nasal Passages
As the breath leaves the lungs and bronchial
tubes, it proceeds to form in the trachea the solid
breath column, whose function it is to sweep over
the vocal cords and set them in vibration. This
vibration produces tones. The greater the tense-
ness of the cords, the more rapid will be the vibra-
tions, and the higher the pitch of the tone.
The tones thus produced strike into the reso-
nance chamber,—the pharynx and the mouth and
nasal cavities,—where most of the tone-quality is
imparted to them. Thus tone-pitch is effected by the
cords,—tone-quality mainly by the mouth and nasal
cavities, the resonating element. (See chapters on
“Pitch,” page [58], and on “Quality,” page [83.]


## p. 16 (#36) ##############################################

[16]
STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
Tones, to be ringing, resonant, and metallic,
must be placed forward partly into the hard-palate
cavity just above the upper row of teeth, and partly
into the nasal cavities. To effect this, the following
must be observed:
(1) The space from the throat to the lips must
be wide open to allow full and unobstructed sound
passage. The tongue must be depressed at the cen-
tre and towards the root. If it is arched, it acts as
an obstruction, causing the vocal quality to be void
of resonance,-“throaty," "woolly," and lifeless.
The jaws should be well separated at the rear.
However, the lower jaw must not be protruded be-
yond the upper, else the consonant "s" will sound
like "sh."
(2) The soft-palate must be so adjusted as to
allow the proper proportion of sound to pass into
the nasal cavities. If the soft-palate is too low, the
tone-quality will be disagreeably nasal; if too high,
the quality will be "wooden," dead.
(3) The tones must be directed forward into the
hard-palate and the nasal cavities, else the tone-
quality will be hollow, or “mushy," or cracked or
throaty.
Your tones may sound thin and even hard and nasal to
you. No matter. They may not sound that way to your
hearers.
(4) ECONOMIZE BREATH,—that is, use only as
much breath as is necessary for vocalization. This
is obtained partly by breath-control at the dia-
phragm (see Exercises for "Breathing") and partly
by not attempting, while directing the tones into

[17]
the cavities stated above, to force them beyond that.
The tendency should be to hold them there, to let
them rest there, as it were. Indeed, when feeling
sure that the forward mouth and nasal cavities are
producing the ringing quality, it is advisable even
to imagine that you are gently drawing the sound
downward and inward from them. If you do not
economize breath, your tone-quality will not be
clear: it will be "breathy," or "screamy."
Hence in the humming and other vocal exercises given
in connection with this subject, carefully avoid using initial
"h" before vowel sounds
(5) Even the position of the lips, which, when-
ever changed, alters the shape of the resonance
chamber, decidedly affects the vocal quality. Hence
(a) Avoid excessive lip movement, such as
rounding of lips on "o" or puckering them out on
"u.” It causes dead, “wooden” tones.
(b) Do not speak from side of mouth, or push
mouth to one side.
(c) Assume a smiling position of the lips while
speaking. It adds resonance to the voice.
This latter should not be observed in case one's emotions
require other lip positions for facial expression.
Do not readily trust your own ear as to the quality of
your voice.
It may deceive you into believing your voice
full and round when it is lamentably “wooden” and hollow;
or nasal and thin, when it is agreeably resonant.
Have a
competent critic to listen to you during your vocal exercises
and inform you which tones are agreeable, metallic and ring-
ing, and which are disagreeably "wooden”, nasal, “woolly”,
throaty, hollow, etc. Carefully note the tones approved
of by him, tune your ear to them until it can detect them

Exercises
The object of the following vocal exercises is:
(a) To secure control over the tongue;
(b) To strengthen and toughen the soft-
palate;
(c) To direct tones into the forward mouth
and nasal cavities, and to hold them there.
(a) To Flatten and Hollow Tongue
(1) Stand with back to the light and by means
of a mirror reflect light down into your throat.
Yawn. Notice, by the mirror, how at once the
tongue is hollowed. Yawn again, and inhale through
the mouth. Notice how the uvula (the grape-like
pendant in front of throat) rises and all but dis-
appears. (Do not mind if tongue rises in front. The
important requisite is for the tongue to drop well
at the center and towards the root.)
(2) Repeat 1, then go through act as of swal-
lowing the tip of tongue. Use mirror.
(3) Yawn, and notice how far apart the teeth
are at the rear. (That and the hollowed tongue in-
sure the wide-open mouth required in speaking. The
*Cultivate a sound, healthy condition of the nervous
system. The slightest derangement in the nervous system
immediately tells on the voice. Even worry makes itself felt
there. Hence, do not neglect outdoor physical exercise. Keep
your room well aired day and night. Be cheerful.
Avoid cold drinks and iced dishes shortly after using
the voice: they produce an inflammatory condition of the
throat. Before speaking the throat may be cleared by drink-
ing hot water made mucilagenous with honey or sugar.

[19]
mouth need not be wide open in front for resonant
speech.)
(b) To Raise and Lower Soft Palate
(1) Use mirror as before. Yawn and inhale
through mouth, then suddenly inhale through nose.
Notice how the soft-palate drops and the tongue
rises. Exhale through nose, and they retain that
position.
(2) Yawn, and inhale through mouth. Then
inhale through nose, keeping the tongue flat. Use
tongue-depressor or spoon, if necessary. This will
cause the soft-palate to drop lower and more
forcibly. Now exhale through mouth, and the soft-
palate will rise again.
This alternating exercise of raising and lowering the
soft-palate will strengthen its muscles. It will also harden
the soft-palate itself, and thus insure greater vocal reso-
nance.
(c) For Jaw
(Note that only the lower jaw is movable.)
(1) Drop jaw lazily and move it from side to
side.
(2) Yawn, and notice rear position of jaws, and
how far apart the two are at the back teeth.
In the following jaw exercises, while keeping
jaws well apart at rear as in yawning, you must still
throw sound forward to teeth in ringing tones.
(3) Utter four times each, "e-yah"; then
"e-yie"; then “e-yaw” (opening jaws in
yawning).
(4) Repeat 3, in whisper; then each vocable
once with mouth movement only.
as

(5) Utter as in 3, O my, O-fly, blah, klah, flaw,
braw.
(6) Repeat 5, in whisper; then each vocable
once with mouth movement only.
Try to acquire facility in this open rear jaw-
position. It will aid you to the full resonant tone of
the orotund quality (see "Quality," page [83]), to
a heavier vocal volume, and to a round, low pitch.
However, avoid tendency to throat-sounds, by aim-
ing to direct all vocalization forward to teeth.
as
(d) To Direct Tones Forward
The following exercises are valuable in that they
place the tones forward where they belong, and at
the same time develop that distinctive sympathetic
quality so noticeable in the cello. Besides, humming
when done here directed helps to correct
throatiness.
(1) Hum on “oohm” (avoid initial “h”). Be
sure in this and the following exercises that the hum
buzzes like the sound produced by resonance emitted
through thin paper held by means of the teeth of a
comb against the lips.
(2) Repeat 1. Keep lips tightly closed.
Now
close nostrils by grasping the nose with the fingers.
The result proves that the nasal passages are part
of the vocal resonance chamber.
(3) Repeat 1. Lips slightly apart. Again close
nostrils. The humming to be correct must now
come from the mouth. (This illustrates how that
vocal tones should resound in both mouth and nasal
cavities.)


## p. 21 (#41) ##############################################

VOICE CULTURE
[21]
(4) Repeat 1. See that tones resound forward
in both mouth and nasal cavities. Now open lips
slowly and gradually, and while continuing the hum
on “oohm" let it gradually slide over into “oh my”,
"oh my”, thence into "Oh my son, never do this
again, fling away ambition, poison not your soul.”
(Go through all this in monotone, and in the same
pitch as that of the original “oohm”, and be sure
that you retain the same buzzing quality throughout
as in the initial hum.)
(e) To Correct Deficiency in Nasal Quality
(1) Sing "ee-yang" several times on high pitch,
trying to make it quite nasal,however, not a dull
but a ringing nasal. Practice on this even if it
sounds disagreeable.
This tends to cure "woodenness”, and to develop metallic
resonance as well as the carrying qualities of the voice. In
all resonant voices there is and must be some nasality
(though it is not called by that name), but it occurs in such
due proportions and blends so harmoniously with the rest of
the vocal quality, that the effect is pleasing instead of of-
fensive.
(2) Repeat 1, then sing down on scale three
notes, then four, then five, and so on through the
whole octave, being careful to retain nasal reso-
nance. Keep waist out and firm all the while.
(3) Repeat 2 on "ee-yong” (“o” in oh), con-
tinuing nasality. (Remember for clear, ringing,
loud tones a wide open mouth in front is not re-
quired. Keep jaws well separated at rear.)
(4) Repeat 3, going through "ee-yahng” (“a”
in ah), "ee-ying", "ee-yoong", "ee-yeng”, ee-yieng”

"i" in lie). Waist out and firm. Do not vary the
position of the lips more than is necessary when
changing from one vowel sound to another.
(f) To Cure Throatiness
Do not confound the throaty with the gutteral
quality of voice.
Throatiness may be caused by arching the
tongue, or by forcing the root of the tongue back
into or towards the throat, thus checking the voice.
During the following drill,
(a) Do not pucker out lips when sounding
the "00";
(b) Change position of lips as little as possible
in passing from one vowel sound to another;
(c) Sing all in monotone;
(d) Sing "ooh" on scale, then "oohn";
(e) Start off each vowel by singing "ooh",
thence passing on without changing lip-position to
other vowel sounds, and all the while thinking that
you are singing “ooh”. (The reason for this is that
"ooh" is the most forward tone, and the easiest to
keep away from the throat).
Drill
(1) Sing "ooh" gliding into a (eh).
Sing "ooh" gliding into ee.
Sing “ooh” gliding into ah.
Sing "ooh" gliding into i (eye).
Sing "ooh" gliding into aw.
Sing "ooh" gliding into oh.
(2) Repeat each, prefixing the letter "m" and
suffixing the letter "n".

Pronunciation and Articulation
"And they read in the book of the law of God distinctly
and plainly to be understood: and they understood when it
was read." II Esdras, VIII, 8.
Pronunciation and articulation are allied yet
diverse subjects in Elocution. Pronunciation deals
with the correct utterance of vowels and consonants,
and the proper accentuation of syllables; articula-
tion requires, besides accuracy of pronunciation,
clearness and distinctness of enunciation. Both are
important subjects. No matter how faultless in
other respects a speaker's delivery may be, it will,
on the one hand, be marred by mispronunciations,
and, on the other, become ineffective and useless by
indistinct articulation.
To acquire accuracy of pronunciation, the stu-
dent must invoke the aid of his dictionary. He
should
(1) familiarize himself with the explanations

nunciations at such times, particularly if there has
been sufficient occasion for preparation, should not
only not be excused but commensurately censured;

(5) finally, on all occasions, whether in public
speech or conversation, avoid all slovenly and in-
correct pronunciations, in order to acquire the
habit of accuracy of utterance. To facilitate this
habit, no word and particularly no vowel sound
should receive any pronunciation other than that
taught and practiced in the elocution class.
A uniform dictionary should be used by the class.
Articulation, however, should command the
attention of the student more than anything else in
Elocution. Of what avail the speech or the action
of a public speaker, if his utterances are not
understood ?
Loud, thundering voices have often failed to make them-
selves intelligible where far less powerful ones, by distinct-
ness of enunciation, have made syllable after syllable easily
understood even by the most distant portion of the audience.
Besides insuring intelligibility, precise articula-
tion injects freshness and force into speech, and
materially aids one to become an agreeable, attrac-
tive speaker. Finally, it lends an air of manliness
and sincerity to the speaker's manner and coun-
tenance, which not only invites respectful attention
but, of itself, carries conviction and compels per-
suasion. Therefore, when you have acquired the
habit of clear and precise articulation in public
speaking you are far advanced in the art of
Elocution.
You should aim to speak with such clearness
and distinctness, that your hearers not only may,
but that they must understand you, whether they
will or no. Every vocable, every syllable should be
formed with the well-defined, clear-cut impression

.
of a newly minted coin, and as such be sounded from
the lips, striking the air with sharp and precise
intonation and ringing with life and energy in every
part of the assembly. Fix your attention upon the
hearers farthest from you. Send forth your mes-
sage to them. Be determined that they shall with
ease hear and understand every syllable, even when
you speak in low tones or in a whisper. Let not
even physical defects discourage you. Some of these
may be removed by medical treatment; others will
yield to your own judicious efforts, such as word-
drills, exercises, and the practice of public reading
and speaking.* Much, very much, therefore, de-
pends upon your ambition: without it, all the efforts
of your instructor will be bootless; with it, you will
soon be a master of effective articulation.
AVOID HASTE. The chief cause of indistinct
articulation is the trend to read and speak rapidly,
to hurry over syllables and words. This may do in
conversation, but in public reading and speaking
far more care must be exercised.
PAUSE FREQUENTLY. To give each syllable its
due value, the vocal organs must adjust themselves
for precise, clear-cut enunciation, and, as these
organs cannot thus adjust themselves instantly,
while sound follows sound in current reading and
speaking, pauses more or less long become neces-
sary. The length of such pauses must depend, of
course, upon the agility of one's vocal organs and
the nature of the sounds to be uttered.
*The struggle of Demosthenes against his own imper-
fect articulation, and his final victory, ought to stimulate
any one to labor untiringly for the same happy results.

Articulate several times in rapid succession the
word “whim”. Notice how you must pause to let
the vocal organs adjust themselves for each repeti-
tion of the word. Now articulate "whimper” sey-
eral times. You can actually repeat it as frequently
in a given time as "whim”, because the short syl-
lable "per" is pronounced during the time needed
for lip and mouth adjustment. The following class
drill will illustrate this:
Drill
Articulate each of the following words four
times in rapid succession: Warm, warmer; wrap,
wrapping; dark, darkle; throw, throw it; wind,
window; whist, whistle.
Keeping this in mind, the organs of speech
themselves will suggest to the individual student
where and how long the pauses must be, and this,
in turn, will determine how slowly and measuredly
he should speak and read.
It is a common fault to increase speed (move-
ment) as one increases loudness and vice versa.
When admonished to recite slowly, one will almost
invariably begin by dropping the pitch and dimin-
ishing the loudness.
Against this particular fault the student should be
warned and trained. To this end, let him read or recite his
selection, slowly and measuredly, articulating distinctly. Let
him then repeat the exercise several times, each time higher
and louder than the foregoing, but articulating equally as
well and never increasing the speed. It may be advisable to
time him by the watch.
In addition to proper pausing and the avoidance
of haste, for effective articulation the diaphragm

and the muscles of the tongue, lips, and jaw must be
active, alert and responsive to the will of the
speaker. *
Exercises
(Besides the exercises and drills that follow
here, those given in the chapter on “Voice Culture"
for breathing and for the diaphragm are intended
to improve articulation.)
(a) FOR TONGUE.
(1) Stretch the tongue out as far as you can,
then draw back suddenly into mouth as far as
you can.
(2) Groove tongue.
(3) Ripple out as rapidly as possible some
twenty times "nen", followed immediately by "tut",
then by "thah” (th in thin), “doo”, “though”. Re-
peat in whisper, then with mouth organs only.
(4) Same as in 3 on "gay", then "koh”, then
“ing”; repeat same in whisper, then with mouth
organs only.
(5) Same as 3 on “lo”; repeat in whisper, then
with mouth organs only.
(6) Repeat in rapid succession, "lay, lee, lie,
low, loo”; then “thay, thee, thie, tho, thoo" (each th
as in thin). Repeat same in whisper, then with
mouth organs only.
(7) Roll the “R”, then repeat same in whisper.
(8) Roll the "R" uttering row, rah, raw, rue,
*If defective articulation is due to enlarged tonsils,
toothless gums, harelip, cleft palate, catarrh or nasal ob-
struction, recourse must be had to a physician.

pray, pry, crew, crow, true, try, tree, dray, draw,
grow, gray, grew, bray, brew, fray, free, fry, threw,
throw. The rare red rover roamed thrice through
the rooky, roomy grove. Then repeat same in
whisper.
(b) FOR LIPS.
(1) Place three fingers, one above the other,
between teeth and move lips back and forth as far
as you can ten times.
(2) Ripple out as rapidly as possible some
twenty times, energizing lips, "mem", then similarly
"bah”, then "puh", "foh", "vee", "kwee", "woo",
“whee".
(3) Repeat 2 in whisper; then each vocable
thrice with mouth organs only.
(4) Purse lips, as in whistling, then utter
"wow" six times, opening mouth laterally as far as
possible with a decided movement of the cheeks.
Then similarly once each, "quick”, "quack”,
"quawk", "quahk", "quike", "whick", "whack",
"whawk”, “whahk”, “whike”.
(5) Same as 4 in whisper; then with mouth
organs only.
(6) Puff out cheeks and lips (notice outward
pressure of diaphragm), hold breath a moment,
then blurt out "pen”, “plen”, “pren", "pahn",
“pine”, “pawn”, “ply", "pry”.
Drills on Final Consonants
(a) Aspirate (breath) consonants are: P, T, K,
C (hard), F, SC (sibilant), Ch, Th (in thin, bath).
(b) Subvocal consonants are: B, D, G (hard),
V, Z, J, G (soft), Th (in this, bathe).

Caution: During this and succeeding articula-
tion drills, be determined to aim in every syllable or
sound at distinctness and clearness of utterance.
Avoid mere recitation, or half-hearted enunciation.
Energize. Rouse your interest. Stand erect, hold
chin well up, and waist out. Use diaphragm vigor-
ously. Strike the air with the sounds. A few drills
well executed will be of infinitely more value than
many carelessly done.
Note: Drill on the column of aspirates first, line by
line, then on the column of subvocals, line by line, then alter-
nate by enunciating, line by line, the whole width of page.
Rule 1. Attack the final aspirates sharply.
Rule 2. Vowels preceding final subvocals should
be prolonged.
Let each line of final consonants be preceded by a num-
ber of vocables ending in that particular consonant and each
having a different initial vowel as is instanced below in the
case of the consonant “p".

Sounds
Note 1. A short, low gentle murmur of "uh" im-
mediately precedes initial subvocals and the liquids,
1, m, n, and r. The murmur, though momentary,
continues until it is cut off by the consonant, or
rather it glides over into the consonant, forming its
base. Repeat this "uh" murmur ten times before
taking up the following exercises of initial subvocals
and liquids.
Note 2. The following vowel sounds are diph-
thongal, that is, they have an initial sound and a
"vanish":
A (in pay), initial sound of e (bed) and vanish of ee
I (in pie), initial sound of a (car) and vanish of ee
O (in no), initial sound of o (no) and vanish of oo

Slovenly Pronunciation and Articulation
Every observer must admit that slovenly pronunciation
is growing common even among the better educated classes
of English speaking people. “Nacher” for nature, “neva”,
"nevor”, “nevur" for never, are a few of such defects heard
on all sides.

ELOCUTIONARY INTERPRETATION
[45]
Articulate well: Take up; make haste; note what
you utter; his arm; we are; you are; thou art; it is;
how ill they serve; some ore; an ice house; small
eyes; small lies; all of us; all love us.
(13) It may be added here that whenever a
preposition directly following a verb modifies its
meaning, the two are pronounced as one word with
the accent on the preposition. If they are separated,
their sense is destroyed or altered.
Articulate well: Call up; fall in with the others;
muster up all your strength; let us gird on our
swords; send in a cab; he turned over the seat;
"Lay on, Macduff.”
(14) Miscellaneous. Do not say woosh for
wish, jist for just, kaint for can't, ketch for catch,
ast for asked, kep' for kept, las' for last, tuck for
took, sitch for such, hesh for hush, purty for pretty,
an' for and, sence for since, groun' for ground, fiel's
for fields, helum for helm, cap'n for captain.
Elocutionary Interpretation
Public reading and speaking require not only
correct pronunciation and distinct articulation, but
also a true interpretation of the matter, an accurate
rendering of its every thought and feeling. To suc-
ceed in this, attention must be paid to pauses, em-
phasis, vocal pitch, force, movement, inflexion, form,
quality, gestures, attitude, and facial expression.


## p. 46 (#66) ##############################################

Pauses
Pause is a marked cessation of speech between
words in order to make the sense clear or to inten-
sify emotion. There are pauses of sense, of deliber-
ation, and of emphasis.
(A) Pauses of Sense
The object of sense pauses is to separate from
each other words that are not directly related, and,
consequently, to divide series of words into groups,
"Grouping”, so-called, is required to make the sense
of what is read aloud or spoken intelligible to the
hearer. Hence the elocutionary pause is to the art
of expression what the grammatical pause indicated
by punctuation marks is to composition. However,
as shall be shown below, the two kinds of pauses
are not always coincident, and so the elocutionist
does not indiscriminately regulate either the num-
ber or length or place of his pauses by the punctua-
tion marks.
Fundamental Law. The closer or more direct
the relation of adjoining "groups", the shorter the
pause; the more distant and indirect the relation,
the longer the pause.
Generally, the relation between sentences is more in-
direct and distant than that between clauses, and still more
so than that between phrases. The length of the pause is
to be determined accordingly.
Thus, “A good tree ! cannot bring forth evil
fruit, | | neither can an evil tree | bring forth good
fruit. Every tree | that bringeth not forth good
fruit || shall be cut down || and shall be cast into
the fire.”


## p. 47 (#67) ##############################################

PAUSES
[47]
(Throughout this chapter, the number of vertical lines
indicates the comparative length of pauses).
Rule 1. Pauses are usually made at punctuation
marks,—the short and medium pause at commas;
the medium at semicolons, colons, and dashes; the
long, at interrogation points, exclamation points,
and periods.
Exceptions. Do not pause at punctuation marks:
(a) At a comma occurring between a demon-
strative and a relative pronoun, particularly if the
relative clause be short, as: They, that sow, || shall
reap.-Not everyone || adınires him, that toils.
The student should select five instances illustrative of
this and each of the following rules from the pieces contained
in this Class-book, and read them aloud in the class-room.
(b) At a comma standing before certain ad-
verbs, phrases and short clauses, as: True elo-
quence, indeed, || does not consist in speech.-
Away, I say, || and bring him hither.
(c) At a comma before the nominative case ab-
solute, as: “There is no terror, Cassius, | in your
threats.”
(d) At a comma between conjunctions or pro-
nouns, and certain phrases and clauses, as: “O
limed soul, | that, struggling to be free, i | art more
engaged."
Rule 2. A short pause occurs whether a punc-
tuation mark is used or not:
(a) Between the logical subject (i. e. the sub-
ject taken. together with its modifiers) and the
predicate, as: "He that hideth his sins || shall not
prosper.”—“The mind of the just | studieth
obedience.”


## p. 48 (#68) ##############################################

[48] STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
(b) Between the object and the rest of the sen-
tence, when the object precedes, as: Not even the
weak || could he overcome.
(c) Between prepositional and other phrases,
that express a cause or important circumstance, and
the rest of the sentence, as: “By the fear of the
Lord || men depart from evil.”—“Of making many
books || there is no end."-"Gently but firmly | he
demanded his rights.”
(d) Often before the infinitive mood, as: He
desired to rule by love.
(e) In case of an ellipsis, as:
"This was the bravest warrior |
That ever buckled sword; ||
This | the most gifted poet |
That ever breathed a word.”
Several selections of the Beginners' Course should be
read in the class-room for illustration of the foregoing.
(B) Pauses of Deliberation
These pauses, which are of
Intermediate
greater frequency and length
than those of sense, aim to give
Course
time to the hearers for delibera-
tion, or to indicate thoughtful-
ness and weightiness. The speech becomes meas-
ured and slow. Drawling, however, should be
avoided.
This kind of pausing is required:
(1) When the minds of the hearers are not pre-
pared to attend to the utterance of a speaker, as, for
instance, at the opening of an address, or at a de-


## p. 49 (#69) ##############################################

PAUSES
[49]
cided turn from one point to another. This rule
applies only rarely to the opening passages of an
elocutionary selection.
This law of inertia in the human mind is quite perceptible
when one is absorbed in some serious occupation and is un-
expectedly addressed on a foreign matter. The speaker will
find it necessary either to bridge his hearer over to his sub-
ject by means of conventionalities, or to intersperse his
speech with many and lengthy pauses until the hearer's mind
has adjusted itself to the new situation.
(2) In passages that are particularly difficult
of comprehension or belief, or unusually important,
such as
(a) Epigrams, apothegms, sententious state-
ments, thoughtful speech, e. g.-"He that conceal-
eth || a transgression, || seeketh | friendships: ||!
he that repeateth it again i | separateth friends.”.
"Shun delays, || they breed remorse."
“It must be so 111.–Plato, I thou reasonest | well ll,
Else | whence this pleasing hope,|| this fond desire,||
This longing | after immortality ?”
(b) Bold assertions, apparent contradictions,
and paradoxes.—Long pauses occur after these,
e. g.—“To be prepared || for war || is one of the
most effectual means | of preserving peace. !!!
A free people || ought not only | to be armed || but
disciplined."
(c) Serious but unimpassioned admonitions and
warnings, or when an air of pompousness must be
assumed, e. g.–Polonius' fatherly advice to his son,
Laertes (see page 528).-"The Pharisee standing,
prayed thus with himself: || 0 God, || I give Thee
thanks || that I am not | as the rest | of men, | | |
5

[50] STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
extortioners, || unjust, || adulterers, || as also | is!
this publican."
(d) When the speaker himself finds it neces-
sary to deliberate before deciding what to say, or
hesitates for fear, amazement, etc., e. g.
“To be | or ||| not to be, || | that is | the question.”
“The falcon crest | and plumage gone,- ||
Can this be haughty Marmion ?"
(C) Pauses of Emphasis
No matter what element of expression is used to
emphasize a word or phrase, it is often the pause
that secures the telling effect desired by
speaker. It occurs either after the emphasized pas-
sage (and this is done commonly), or before it, or
on it.
The pause that precedes has the peculiar merit of prepar-
ing the hearers during the suspense, engaging their atten-
tion, arousing their curiosity, and thus compelling their
conviction as to the importance of what is to follow. The
pause that falls on a passage is really not a pause; it is
rather a marked prolongation of syllables and words, usually
accompanied by decided vocal inflexionis.
The pupil should read the following passages
and several of his own choice from the selections of
the Intermediate Course first without, then with the
pause, and note how the pause makes the emphasis
more effective. (Note the articulation.)
(1) The pause following the emphatic word:
“The intent || and not the deed || is in our power.”
“Should I not say: ||
Hath a dog || | money? | i Is it possible ||
A cur || | can lend | three thousand ducats?”'


## p. 51 (#71) ##############################################

PAUSES
[51]
(2) The pause preceding the emphatic word:
"Ye know too well,
The story of our thraldom:|| | we are|| slaves."
"But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar; |!
I found it | in his closet; | | 'tis ||| his will.”
(3) The pause coincident with the emphatic
word.
(a) Amazement:
"You come to me and you say, ||
Shylock, / we would have monies.—|| You say so!"
(b) Contempt: “I hate him, | for he is a
Christian."
(c) Sarcasm: "I would not wrong such honor-
able men.”
Read for illustration : "Rienzi's Address" (page
331); Shylock's Aside (page 568); Shylock to
Antonio (page 570).
(D) The Pause in Poetry Reading
In reading poetry two extremes should be
avoided: pausing according to the rhythm only; and
pausing according to the sense only.
Rhythm adds essentially to the beauty of diction. Besides,
it is best adapted to the organs of speech, which render a
regular succession of long and short syllables—ictus and
arsis—with the greatest possible ease and fluency. For that
reason Horace recommends the use of the iambic (the short-
long) foot for the drama; and the greatest dramatists of
our language have adopted it in their plays.
The reader must not bind himself to the rhythm
so slavishly as to sacrifice or obscure the sense.
Careful exercising in the reading of verse of various
kinds will give him the skill to combine the sense of

STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
the poetry with the musical beat of the verse. The
following selections will furnish excellent practice
in this: "Warren's Address" (page 135); “The
Light Brigade” (page 183); “Exile of Erin” (page
236); "Marco Bozarris" (page 316); "The Sem-
inole's Defiance" (page 320); "The Baron's Last
Banquet” (page 329); “Bernardo del Carpio”
(page 364).
Emphasis
The function of emphasis is:
(1) To give to certain words or phrases a de-
cided prominence over others and thus to distin-
guish for the hearer the important from the sub-
sidiary;
(2) To point out the relationship of a word or
phrase to other parts of the sentence, in order to
make the sense and feeling clear;
(3) To secure variety in utterance, since monot-
ony is tiresome to both the speaker and the hearer.
There are three ways of producing emphasis.
For ordinary utterance, they are: (1) Increased
force; (2) Rising inflexion; (3) Slight pause (after
prominent word). These three are usually com-
bined.
However, as shall be shown further on, in cases of
peculiar emotion, or where a striking effect is intended, these
ways of producing emphasis are frequently deviated from.
One of the faults of beginners is that their em-
phasis is not sufficiently marked. Hence the student
should resolve to make the emphasis quite decided
and pointed in all drills and exercises on this
subject.


## p. 53 (#73) ##############################################

EMPHASIS
[53]
Drills
Emphasize pointedly italicized words:
(1) Did you recite John's speech? No, I recited
his poem.
(2) Did you recite John's speech? No, I recited
William's.
(3) Did you recite John's speech? No, I
sang it.
(4) Did you recite John's speech? No, my
brother recited it.
The student should write out a few exercises
like the foregoing, and read them aloud in the class-
room, shifting the emphasis as above.
Exercises
To be read aloud by one of the class. Emphasis to be
placed on italicized words.
(1) “Why stand we here idle? What is it that
gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life
so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the
price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty
God! I know not what course others may take; but
as for me, give me liberty, or give me death."
(2) Let the same passage be re-read, emphasiz-
ing a few of the unitalicized words, but none of
those that are italicized. Notice how the sense is
perverted.
(3) Let the same be re-read without any em-
phasis whatever. The reading has now sunken to a
dull, lifeless monotony, which not only makes the
sense unclear, but soon tires the hearer and fatigues
the reader.


## p. 54 (#74) ##############################################

[54] STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
General Rules for Emphasis
Emphasize the italicized words.
(1) Emphasis is used to mark a contrast, either
expressed or implied.
(a) Expressed contrast, thus: “It was said of
old: Hate your enemies, but I say to you: Love
your enemies."
The student should select from the pieces in this book a
few examples illustrative of this and the following rules of
emphasis.
(b) Implied contrast: "I come not here to
talk.” (Implying "but to act.")
(2) Emphasize words and phrases that bear a
logical relation to each other, such as cause and
effect, antecedent and consequent, comparison,
genus and species, etc.
(a) Cause and effect: "As Caesar loved me,
I weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it;
as he was valiant, I honor him; but as he was ambi-
tious, I slew him.”
(b) Antecedent and consequent: "As you live,
so shall you die.”
(c) Comparison: “What a ship is without a
rudder, such is the soul without a guide.”
(d) Genus and species: All men shall die, the
rich as well as the poor, the good as well as the bad.
(3) Emphasis is placed on pronouns when used
as antecedents of relative pronouns. This is fre-
quently overlooked by young readers. Thus: “So
should he look, that seems to speak things strange."
Young readers not infrequently fall into a habit of em-
phasizing unexceptionally all personal and possessive pro-
In "Logan, an Indian Chief's Address" (page 40)
such pronouns occur frequently, yet the only one to receive
nouns.


## p. 55 (#75) ##############################################

EMPHASIS
[55]
emphasis in the whole selection is "mine" in the last line
but three.
(4) Emphasize in enumeration the objects enu-
merated: "He hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, an-
other to the Indies. I understand moreover upon
the Rialto, he hath a third to Mexico, a fourth for
England: and other ventures he hath, squandered
abroad."
(5) Words when repeated are sometimes em-
phasized, sometimes not.
(a) Do not emphasize repeated words when a
modification is added: The emphasis is shifted to
the modifying word or phrase, e. g. "Farewell, a
long farewell!”—“Let us fight for our country, our
whole country, and nothing but our country.”
(b) Emphasize repeated words, however, when
no modification is added, e. g. “Cease, fond nature,
cease thy strife."-"I would never lay down my
arms,never, NEVER, NEVER!"
(6) Words in apposition to emphasized words
are themselves emphasized, e. g. "True liberty can
only exist when justice is equally administered to
all,—to the king and to the beggar.”
(7) Words otherwise insignificant, such as,
whatever, notwithstanding, though, and, the, etc.,
are sometimes emphasized, e. g. "Whatever your
career, a knowledge of history will always be a
source of profit and delight.”—“You are men, but
though you are men, you are weak and cowardly.”—
"I did not say an army, but the army."
(8) Sometimes even the accent of a word is
changed because of a peculiar emphasis required,
e. g. "I shall decrease, but He shall increase."


## p. 56 (#76) ##############################################

[56]
STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
(9) Whenever a phrase or clause is emphatic as
a unit, the emphasis usually falls on the last word,
e. g. “We have assembled not to respond to shouts of
TRIUMPH, but to answer the cry of want and
SUFFERING.”
(10) In climaxes emphasis must increase, e. g.
“I solemnly adjure you, I WARN you, I IMPLORE
you, yea, on my bended knee, I SUPPLICATE you,
reject not this bill.”
If in doubt upon which word to place emphasis,
make a test of one word, and then another, reading
the passage aloud until you hit upon the one that
the sense obviously requires.*
It is interesting to note that in Shakespeare's plays em-
phasis usually is coincident with the accent of the rhythm,
that is, words are so arranged metrically, that the emphasis
falls on the ictus of the metre.
Selections for Beginners
Let the emphasis be decided and pointed.

Duke of Grafton's Address" (page 74); "Warren's
Address” (page 135); “Sempronius' Speech” (page

stress. Not a little skill is re-
quired to read them effectively.
*This, by the way, is a helpful exercise for learning how
to interpret for oneself literary productions, and thus acquire
a fuller and more accurate knowledge of them.

EMPHASIS
[57]
"The curfew tolls the knell of parting day,
The lowing herds wind slowly o'er the lea,
The plowman homeward plods his weary way,
And leaves the world to darkness and to me."
(12) In passages of peculiar emotion the sense
determines what words are to be stressed, but it is
the feeling that regulates the character and degree
of stress. Thus if you say, "Shylock hated Antonio
because he was a Christian," you would stress
“Christian” according to the laws of emphasis laid
down above; however, if you impersonated the
spiteful, rancorous Shylock in the line, "I hate him,
for he is a Christian," "Christian" would again be
emphasized, but with a vastly different inflexion,
quality, etc. Hence after deciding what words or
phrases are to be stressed according to the sense,
let the character of the emphasis be governed by, as
it must be identified with, the particular inflexion,
quality, form, movement, pause, etc., required by the
feeling.
It would take up too much space to specify all the rules
for emphasis. Nor would it be wise to bind the student to
much theory in the matter. The fixing of the place and
character of emphasis depends, of course, upon what the
reader assumes to be the sense and feeling of a passage in
general, and of each word in its relation to the rest of the
passage in particular. And since even the best of public
readers and actors disagree as to what sense and feeling is
to be read into certain passages, it seems to be rather harm-
ful than beneficial to confine the student to more than the
general rules of emphasis, or—what seems to be worse to
mark every word that is to be emphasized in a selection.

Pitch
Pitch means the key to which the voice is tuned.
The range of pitch in speaking is quite large: good
speakers shift the voice through a whole octave or
more. Pitch variation not only diversifies and en-
livens expression, but also points out the relative
importance of one passage over another. It may be
abrupt and brief, in which case it is called inflexion
(see chapter on Inflexion, page [71]);
or less sustained, as in modulation, the sense in
which it is treated of in this chapter.
For practical purposes pitch may be distin-
guished as very high, high, medium, low, very low
and sepulchral.

inflexion to each note, and utter it rather sharply,
as in counting aloud.
(3) Repeat 1, but instead of counting sing do,
re, mi, fa, sol, la, si, do.
(4) Repeat 3, speaking instead of singing (note
direction under 2).
(5) Repeat numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, scale down in-
stead of up. Begin on high key (not very high).
(6) Begin on low (not very low) key, speak, as
in 2, (do not sing) the lines:
“Tell me not in mournful numbers
Life is but an empty dream.”
Then repeat both lines on each note of the scale
till you reach the octave (speaking as in 2).
(7) Same as 6, descending on scale.
Rules for Pitch
Rules for very high, very low, and sepulchral pitch will
be found farther on.
(1) High pitch is used for expressions of joy,
excitement, loud commands, anxiety, e. g.
"On with the dance! Let joy be unconfined !
No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet
To chase the glowing hours with flying feet.”
"And there was mounting in hot haste: the steed,
The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,
Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,
And swiftly forming in the ranks of war.”
Read Warren's Address (page 135).
(2) Medium pitch is used in description, narra-
tion, or ordinary statement. Example: The Cath-
olic Church (page 3).


## p. 60 (#80) ##############################################

[60]
STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
(3) Low pitch expresses solemnity, virility, and
serious statement. Examples: "The Gettysburg
Address” (page 41); “Logan, an Indian Chief's
Address" (page 40).
(4) Very high pitch is em-
ployed for great astonishment,
Intermediate loud exclamations, intense excite-
Course ment, etc.
No matter how high the pitch, avoid
shouting. Remember that musical tones
are heard farther than others.
"Are all content?
A nation's rights betrayed, and all content?
What! will ye all combine to tie a stone,
Each to each other's neck, and drown like dogs!"
“To arms! They come! the Greek! the Greek !”
‘Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend !
I shrieked, upstarting-
'Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's
Plutonian shore !'”
(5) Very low pitch, for sad, serious, sombre
pensiveness. Examples: "Thanatopsis” (page 196);
“The Closing Year" (page 189); “Time's Midnight
Voice" (page 479).
(6) Sepulchral pitch conveys an uncanny feel-
ing of mysteriousness and weirdness. Example:
The Ghost in Hamlet:
“I am thy father's spirit,
Doomed for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away."

PITCH
[61]
The Development of Low Tones
In order to acquire something of the orator's
and actor's voice, the student should cultivate and
strengthen lower tones and deepen his pitch in sus-
tained utterance, combining therewith the orotund
quality (q. v. page [85]). It is remarkable what
success may be achieved in this respect with a little
painstaking practice.
There should be no concert drills or concert
practice for this. Let the student select an unim-
passioned piece, for instance, "The Closing Year"
(page 189), or “Thanatopsis” (page. 194), or
“Time's Midnight Voice" (page 479)-peruse it
privately to acquire fluency, and then read it before
the class in as low a pitch as he can command but
with enough loudness to be understood by the whole
class. As this is an exercise mainly for the strength-
ening of low tones, absence of inflexion and modula-
tion will not matter.
In addition, one must practice the orator's habit
of dropping the voice melodiously to a lower key
during the course of a statement.
This latter must not be confounded with the falling in-
flexion, from which it differs widely both in execution and
effect; nor does it interfere with or hamper vocal inflexion,
which must follow its own laws. The effects of the practice
of dropping the voice referred to here are that it lends an
air of positiveness and firmness to the speaker's manner; it
invests his statements with the appearance of gravity, thus
causing them to engage the hearer's attention; it counter-
acts the evil tendency of rising higher and higher,-a
tendency that results not only in the voice giving offense to
the hearer by its stridency, and doing injury to itself by the
long-continued strain, but also in leaving the impression

STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
that the speaker lacks self-possession and confidence in
his cause.
Exercise for the Cultivation of Lower Tones
Any oratorical selection of the Intermediate
Course, which the student should carefully fa-
miliarize himself with, however, before reading it
aloud.
Force or Loudness
Force or loudness is due to the impulsion with
which the solid air-column in the trachea sweeps
over the vocal cords, and, consequently, it varies ac-
cording to the amount of energy exercised by the
breathing muscles.
We may distinguish five different degrees of
force: Very loud, loud, medium, soft, very soft.
Class Drills
During these drills caution must be taken not to
raise the pitch or accelerate movement as force in-
creases, nor to lower pitch or retard movement as
force decreases. Avoid screaming or shouting dur-
ing the drills: loud and forceful speech never
offends, shouting does. Articulate well.
(1) Count from one to ten with medium force,
then repeat several times, each time increasing the
force slightly until very loud tones are reached.
(2) Repeat 1, but instead of counting recite the
lines:
“Tell me not in mournful numbers,
Life is but an empty dream."
Do not change the force until both lines are finished.


## p. 63 (#83) ##############################################

FORCE OR LOUDNESS
[63]
(3) Repeat 1, starting at medium and ending at
very soft, including the whisper.
(4) Repeat 3, substituting the lines: "Tell me
not" etc. (as above).
These drills should be executed by the students of the
class first individually and then collectively.
Rules for Force or Loudness
MEDIUM FORCE, used in positive statements with
ordinary emotion. Example: “True Eloquence”
(page 185).
The pupil should be required to find a few other instances
in this book requiring this and other degrees of force.
STRONG FORCE—Loud commands, violent anger,
gaiety. Examples: “If ye are beasts, then stand
here like fat oxen,” etc. to the end of piece (page
338, near bottom); “The Luck of Edenhall” (page
198).
VERY STRONG FORCE-Exaltation, intense ex-
citement, fright. Examples:
“ "Hurrah! Hurrah! A single field hath turned the
chance of war!
Hurrah! Hurrah! for Ivry and King Henry of
Navarre!"
"The Death of Marmion" (page 477).
WEAK FORCE-Sadness, tenderness, love, sym-
pathy. Examples: "'I wait, I wait, he said," etc.
to the end (page 301, near middle); “The Exile of
Erin" (page 236); "The Orphan Boy's Tale" (page
238).
VERY WEAK FORCE-Physical weakness, marked
sadness and pity, confidential manner. Example:


## p. 64 (#84) ##############################################

[64] STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
"Dark is the night! How dark! no light: no fire!
Cold on the hearth the last faint sparks expire!
Shivering, she watches by the cradle side,
For him, who pledged her love,-last year a bride.
'Hark! 'Tis his footstep! No!—'Tis past!—'Tis
gone!'
Tick!—Tick!-How wearily the time crawls on!
Why should he leave me thus? He once was kind !
And I believed 'twould last! How mad! How
blind!'"
Increasing Force or Loudness
This is analagous to the crescendo in music. It
is employed in all climaxes, and when the speaker's
emotions grow in intensity. Accomplished speakers
frequently make use of this oratorical climax, clos-
ing it with a triumphant burst of enthusiasm.
Drill
(1) Count five times, each time "crescendo",
from one to ten.
In these lessons the student should do his best to arouse
himself to higher and higher pitches of emotion and anima-
tion. Otherwise the "crescendo", being only outward, would
have no meaning.
(2) Same as 1 but substitute:
"Tell me not in mournful numbers
Life is but an empty dream.”
Exercises
In the following exercises, observe "crescendo” in feeling.
Articulate well.
(1) "Is Sparta dead? Is the old Grecian" etc.
to "in noble, honorable battle" (page 339);-


## p. 65 (#85) ##############################################

MOVEMENT OR TIME
[65]
"Let their last feeble" etc. to end (page 117);-
"Read this declaration at the head of the army" etc.
to "walls will cry out in its support” (page 98);
“But whatever may be our fate” etc. to “and of joy”.
(page 99).
Movement or Time
Movement or time is the sustained relative speed
of utterance. It is in expression what "tempo" is
in music.
Much attention should be given to the control of
one's movement. It is a common fault of young
speakers to speak too rapidly. They should be re-
quired to practice slow movement.
For slow movement stretch or distend the vowel-
sounds, and, at the same time, let the pauses be
lengthy and frequent; for fast movement, the con-
trary should, of course, prevail.
However, it must not be thought that long pauses are in-
compatible with fast movement.
The varying rates of movement may be classi-
fied from the very slow to the very fast. Besides
this classification we may distinguish movement
that is sustained for a long time, and movement that
is gradually accelerated or retarded (the "acceler-
ando" and "ritardando" of music).
The general principle is that slow movement is
adapted to whatever moves slowly, and to whatever
is relatively important, majestic, pitiful, instructive,
difficult to understand; while fast movement ex-
presses whatever moves rapidly, whatever is rela-
tively valueless, frivolous, fantastic, well-known.

## p. 66 (#86) ##############################################

[66] STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
The old, feeble, and dying speak slowly; the young,
hilarious, and sprightly speak rapidly.
Rules for Movement
(1) Movement adapts itself to the speed of
actions described, whether these be material or men-
tal, thus:
(a) Slow movement to slow, laborious motion.
Examples:
“Slow, slow, toll it low,
As the sea-waves break and flow.”
“The curfew tolls the knell of parting day;
The lowing herds wind slowly o'er the lea;
The plowman homeward plods his weary way,
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.”
The pupil should be asked to add one or more passages
from the pieces of this book to exemplify this and the fol-
lowing rules of movement.
(b) Fast movement to rapid, nervous motions.
Examples:
“Ah then and there was hurrying to and fro"
etc. to "which ne'er might be repeated" (page
304); “And there was mounting in hot haste” etc.
to “the foe! they come! they come!” (page 304,
near bottom).
(2) Slow movement expresses awe, reverence,
pity, tranquility, deliberation.
(a) Awe and reverence: “Holy, Holy, Holy
Lord God of Sabaoth! The heavens and the earth
are full of thy glory!"


## p. 67 (#87) ##############################################

MOVEMENT
[67]
(b) Pity: "Tread softly—bow the head-
In reverent silence bow;
No passing bell doth toll-
Yet an immortal soul
Is passing now."
(c) Tranquility: “Absalom” (page 376).
(d) Deliberation: "Hamlet on Immortality"
page 532): "Brutus' Soliloquy" (page 550).
(3) Fast movement is used to interpret energy,
vitality, the trivial, the fantastic.
(a) Energy and vitality:
“ 'Forward, the Light Brigade!
Charge for the guns !' he said."
“On the Frontier" (page 427).
(b) The trivial and fantastic: “How they
Brought the Good News from Ghent to Aix" (page
279).
Accelerated Movement
This movement, equivalent to the “accelerando"
in music, is used in climaxes of animated description
and narration.—Examples:
“They tug, they strain! down, down they go,
The Gael above, Fitz-James below."
“While pacing to and fro" etc. to "too late! too
late! forever too late” (page 455, near middle).
Relation of Movement, Force, and Pitch
When there is a gradual swelling of excited emo-
tion it sometimes happens that as the movement
grows faster, the force (loudness) increases and the
pitch rises. However, movement, force, and pitch


## p. 68 (#88) ##############################################

[68] STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
are quite independent of each other. Indeed, it not
infrequently happens that strong force is associated
with slow movement and medium pitch, and vice
versa. It is a common fault not to observe this dis-
tinction. Hence observe CAUTION: Do not read with
less force (loudness) or drop your voice BECAUSE
you happen to read more slowly.
The following drill is intended to aid the student
to observe this.
Combination Drills on Force, Pitch,
and Movement
(1) Count from one to ten five times, each time
louder and in a higher key but not faster.
(2) Repeat 1, each time softer and in a lower
key, but not slower.
(3) Repeat first 1, then 2, substituting:
“Tell me not in mournful numbers,
Life is but an empty dream.”
(4) Count from one to ten five times, each time
slower, in a higher key and louder.
(5) Repeat 4, each time faster, in a lower key
and softer.
(6) Repeat 4 and 5 five times, substituting:
“Tell me not in mournful numbers,
Life is but an empty dream.”
(7) Read first paragraph of “The Catholic
Church" (page 3), three times, each time louder, in
a higher pitch, but not faster.—Articulate well
throughout these drills.


## p. 69 (#89) ##############################################

FORM
[69]
(8) Read a paragraph of any other piece three
times, each time louder, in a higher pitch, and
slower.
This last exercise should be repeated often, with
untried pieces in Part I, to overcome the tendency of
reading faster as one reads louder, and in a higher
pitch, or of reading softer and in a lower pitch as
one reads slower. The student should so master the
three elements of force, movement, and pitch as to
find it easy to read and speak loud, in a high pitch,
but at the same time with slow movement.
(9) Read first paragraph of “No Choice but
War" (page 152) loud and in a high pitch but
changing gradually, as you read, from fast to slow.
(10) Repeat 9 slowly, but changing from soft
force and low pitch to loud force and high pitch.
(11) Repeat 9 reading fast, soft and in a low
pitch at the beginning, then gradually slower, be-
coming quite slow when nearing the end, at the
same time reading louder and in a higher pitch.-
This is an excellent exercise.
Other paragraphs should be selected by the teacher for
drill No. 11.
For practice on Varied Movement, read “The
Bells" (page 467).
Form
Form is the degree of percussion or stroke given
to vocal utterance.
Form is distinct from force or loudness, and so true is
this, that a sharp stroke of the voice is compatible with soft
force, and a smooth stroke with loud force. However, it
often happens that the sharper the percussion, the louder
the force is.


## p. 70 (#90) ##############################################

[70]
STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
It is customary to distinguish three kinds of
form: the effusive, which is smooth-flowing; the
expulsive, which is characterized by a medium
sharpness of percussion, more or less like that used
in ordinary conversation; and the explosive, which
comes in smart blows or strokes. Of course, there
are modifications or shades from one kind to an-
other.
The explosive form is akin to the "staccato" of music;
the effusive, to the “legato", or slurred movement. The
explosive form is exemplified in nature by the barking of
dogs, gusts of wind, claps of thunder, etc.; the effusive, by
the sighing of the wind, the cooing of doves, etc.
The difference in sound-stroke observed in the
various kinds of form is produced by the muscles
of breath-control, particularly by the diaphragm,-
the greatest energy being required for the explosive,
the least for the effusive.
Examples for Practice
(1) Effusive: Parts of “The Closing Year"
(page 189); parts of “A Hebrew Tale” (page 359);
parts of "Thanatopsis" (page 194).
(2) Expulsive.
This form, unlike the other two, has a wide
range, and admits of many degrees of impetus or
stroke. Consequently, while it occurs in all selec-
tions of this book, in some it must be more marked
than in others. The following selections are espe-
cially recommended for practice in this form:
"Sheridan's Ride" (page 177) ; “The Light Brigade”
(page 183); “Damon to the Syracusans" (page
283); "Caesar's Passage of the Rubicon” (page

305); "The Seminole's Defiance” (page 320);
"Belshazzar's Feast" (page 362); "Bernardo del
Carpio" (page 364); "Catiline to His Friends”
(page 413); “Catiline to the Conspirators” (page
415); “Marullus to the Roman Populace” (page
417); “Tell Among the Mountains" (page 499);
"Catiline's Defiance" (page 501); "Hotspur's De-
fence" (page 599); "Mercutio on Dreams" (page
647).
(3) Explosive: Parts of "Marco Bozzaris"
(page 316); parts of “Rienzi to the Romans" (page
331); parts of “On the Frontier” (page 427); parts
of "Henry V. to His Soldiers at Harfleur" (page
615); part of "Marcius to His Soldiers" (page
653).
Inflexion or Slide
Inflexion (Latin inflectere, to bend) is a bending
or sliding of the voice from one pitch to another. It
is either upward, or downward, or a combination of
both. Hence there are four inflexions: Rising, fall-
ing, rising-falling circumflex, and falling-rising cir-
cumflex.
(1) Ask the question: "Would you sell your
honor? Would you betray your country?”—Notice
the rising inflexion at the close of each question.
(2) Now assert positively: "No, I would not
sell my honor. I would not betray my country.”—
Notice the falling inflexion.
(3) Now repeat 2, combining positiveness with
surprise that such a question should be asked.-
Notice the falling-rising circumflex.


## p. 72 (#92) ##############################################

[72]
STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
The student should devote considerable attention to the
study and practice of inflexions. They are needed not only
for the expression of sense and feeling, but for that diversity
of utterance without which no speech can be pleasing.
Monotone, lack of inflexions, is fatiguing not only to the
ear of the hearer, but also to the vocal organs of the speaker.
Nature secures rest for a muscle by moving it, changing its
tension. Persistent tension tires it. And as a lack of in-
flexions means a lack of variation in tension of vocal muscles,
it follows that it results in fatigue and even pain. The beset-
ting fault of young speakers is that their inflexions are too
infrequent and their tone-intervals not large enough. As a
result their elocutionary productions are marred by monot-
ony, if not altogether spoiled by a veritable singsong.
General Principles
(1) The vocal slide upward is used to hold the
reader in suspense for what is to follow; the slide
downward indicates to the hearer the close of a
statement. The upward slide points forward to,
anticipates, leaves incomplete that which the down-
ward slide points backward to, fulfills, and com-
pletes. Hence, ordinarily, the voice rises on ques-
tions, negative statements, subordinate clauses; and
falls on assertions, affirmative statements, principal
clauses.
(2) Just before an inflexion, it is natural for the
human voice to prepare for it with a recoil,—a bend
or stroke in the opposite direction. That is, the voice
suddenly and sharply falls directly before a rising
inflexion, and, similarly, rises before a falling in-
flexion. This stroke is called the "accent" of in-
flexion.
(3) The greater the emphasis and the more in-
tense the emotion, the larger the interval of tone re-


## p. 73 (#93) ##############################################

INFLEXION OR SLIDE
[73]
quired for both the inflexion and the “accent” of in-
flexion.
Just as punctuation marks may not decide the location
and the length of pauses in Elocution, so they are not safe
guides for inflexion. The following rules will clearly show
that the voice does not always fall at periods, or rise at in-
terrogations, or remain sustained at commas, etc.
Special Rules
(1) Inflexions of Sense
(a) Questions and Assertions. Questions point
forward to an answer, to an assertion, expressed or
implied, that is to follow. Hence, commonly, upward
slides for questions ; downward, for the answer, if it
asserts categorically.
(1) In questions that require the simple an-
swer, "yes" or "no", the slide is more decided and
rises higher than in other questions, thus: "O Cati-
line, wilt thou abuse our patience ?” and “How long,
O Catiline, wilt thou abuse our patience ?" require
different inflexions.
Let the student select from the pieces of the Beginners'
Course, or, better still, improvise a few passages illustrative
of this and each of the following rules on "inflexion”.
(2) Exclamations of surprise and amazement
are of the nature of emphatic questions, and conse-
quently require the upward slide, thus: “What!
John here!" "I an itching palm !” Selections:
“Damon to the Syracusans” (page 283).
(3) Declarative answers and assertions, when
they really impart information, require the falling
inflexion, as: "Your friends are without, waiting
for you."


## p. 74 (#94) ##############################################

[74]
STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
(4) If an assertion does not really convey in-
formation, but implies that the hearer already
knows, (as much as to say: "You know that. Is it
not so ?"), the rising inflexion is used as: “It is easy
to love our friends."
(b) Subordinate Clauses. In subordinate clauses
and in phrases standing for such clauses the upward
slide is used, as they hold the hearer in suspense for
the main statement that is to follow. Hence, the
following clauses and phrases close with a rising in-
flexion:
(1) Conditional: "If I were an American, as I
am an Englishman (rise), I would never lay down
my arms."
(2) Conjunctional: “As Caesar loved me, I
weep for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it."
(3) Relative: “Who steals my purse, steals
trash.”
(4) Participial phrase: "Hated and despised.
you shall be opposed.”
(5) Imperative mood: "Do this, and thou shalt
live."
(c) Negative Statements. Negative statements,
as such, unless they are mandatory or express deter-
mination of will, receive the upward slide. They
seem to anticipate a correction in the affirmative,
thus: “I do not ask for favors: I demand my rights."
-"I do not rise to fawn or cringe to this house."
(d) Antithesis.
(1) In antithesis, whenever both members are
affirmative, the upward slide occurs on the first, the
downward slide on the latter, whether it be a ques-


## p. 75 (#95) ##############################################

INFLEXION OR SLIDE
[75]
tion or an assertion, thus: "Sink or swim, live or
!
die, survive or perish, I give my hand and my heart
.
to this motion."__"Did he ride or walk?”.
(2) But if one of the members of an antithesis
is negative, the other affirmative, the negative has
the upward slide, the affirmative, the downward, no
matter which precedes, thus: “He did not ride, he
/
walked.”_"We must rejoice, not mourn."
(e) Series.
(1) In an interrogative series, the upward slide
is applied to each member of the series, as “Hath
not a jew eyes? hath not a jew hands, organs.
/
dimensions, senses, affections, passions ?"
(2) Even in assertions the upward slide is
given to each member of a series, except the last,
whenever the series is considered jointly, as "The
soul possesses three faculties: memory, intellect,
and will.
(3) But when every member of a series in an
assertion is to be severally emphasized. each re-
ceives its own inflexion, as “Christ is the way, the
truth, and the life.”
life

## p. 76 (#96) ##############################################

[76]
STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
Placing of Inflexions
The accented syllable of a word, and the stressed
word of a sentence, receive the slide, while the syl-
lables or unimportant words that follow continue
the pitch to which the slide has risen or fallen, thus:
Did you say, ALL were lost in the storm ?” “Yes; ]
said, ALL were lost in the storm." "Lost inevitably?"
"Yes, inevitably."
Peculiar Oratorical Style of Inflexion
It is the practice of public speakers to close em-
phatic statements with a peculiar falling-rising cir-
cumflex, thus joining to a tone of positiveness one of
strong appeal. This style of inflexion possesses a
further advantage over the downward slide that it
makes the last word of a sentence more audible. It
should be employed only when the speaker's manner
is forceful and emphatic. Any oratorical selection
in the Beginners' or Intermediate Course may be
used for practice in this style of inflexion.
(II) Inflexion of Emotion and Passion
The student should be required to re-
view the preceding parts of this chapter.
Advanced (a) The falling inflexion por-
Course
trays the speaker's determinate-
ness just as does the downward
stroke of the clenched fist and of
the foot. Hence it is the inflexion for
(1) the positive, the mandatory;


## p. 77 (#97) ##############################################

INFLEXION OR SLIDE
[77]
(2) repulsive sentiments: reproach, contempt,
hatred, revenge and the like.
(1) The positive.
(a) In conviction, as: "You are wrong: I can
prove it by your own actions."
The student should select examples from pieces in this
book for this and the following rules.
(B) In determinateness, as:
“Blaze with your serried columns !
I will not bend the knee!"
Selection: "Shylock's Victory Turned to Defeat"
(page 574).
(2) The mandatory, as: “Begone! Run to your
houses, fall upon your knees!” Selections: "Henry
V. to his Soldiers at Harfleur" (page 615); “The
Prince of Verona Breaks up a Feud” (page 646).
But when a command is followed by an expressed
or implied threat, the rising inflexion occurs, as:
“Move not, or I shall move! I charge you, keep your
seat!” (Implied threat). Example: "St. Pierre to
Ferrardo” (page 509).
(3) Reproach, hatred, contempt, revenge.
(a) Reproach,-invective:
"You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless
things!
O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome!"
Selections: "Marullus to the Roman Populace"
(page 417): "York to the Queen" (page 630).
(B) Hatred, as: “I battle for the joy I have
to see the white man fall.” Selections: “The Sem-
inole's Defiance” (page 320); Shylock's Aside (page
568).


## p. 78 (#98) ##############################################

[78]
STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
(y) Contempt, as: "I spurn your gilded bait."
“What is she now? Degenerate, gross, defiled.” Se-
lections: “The Incorruptible Patriot" (page 226);
Catiline to His Friends” (page 413).
(8) Revenge:
“I'll wreak my vengeance on your son,
On him, and you, and all your race."
Selections: “Maclaine's Child” (page 393); “The
Moor's Revenge” (page 371).
The falling inflexion is used even where the
sense requires the rising inflexion, whenever an
emotion that requires a falling inflexion is made
prominent. Thus, questions, expressions of sur-
prise, negative statements, etc., receive the falling
inflexion, whenever contempt, hatred, positiveness,
etc., are emphasized, as: "Did he dare to betray his
friend?" "Did I deny his statement?" "I will not
bend the knee." Selection: Marullus to the Roman
Populace” (page 417).
(b) The rising inflexion indicates indecision.
Hence it is used generally for-
(1) The dubious, the appellatory, the trivial;
and sometimes for-
(2) Sentiments of gentleness: grief, pity, ten-
derness, love, reverence. (See Semitones).
The rising inflexion is deferential; hence it is employed
by the lowly, the humble, the submissive, the beggar.
(1) The dubious, indecisive, as:
"I am right loath to go.
There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest."
(2) The appellatory;
(a) Pointing forward to a statement of the

[79]
hearer's will, as : "What, is Antonio here?" "Ready,
so please your grace.”
(B) Pointing forward to a favor, as:
"I pledge thee faith, my liege, my lord!
O break my father's chains!"
() Pointing forward to a reply of acqui-
escence, as :
“You know I would not wrong you. I am always
giving you proofs of my love."
(3) The trivial, as:
“'Tis but the wind, or the car rattling over the
stony street."
Selection: "The Ghost” (page 418).
(c) Semi-tones.-Grief, distress, pity, tender-
ness, love, reverence, confession of weakness, expos-
tulation, are expressed in semi-tones, that is, over
an interval of either a half-tone (when unemphatic)
or a tone and a half (when emphatic). The in-
flexion is upward, when an appeal is joined to the
emotion; otherwise, it is downward.
(1) Profound grief, as:
“O father, is it vain,—this late remorse and deep?
Speak to me, father, once again! I weep,-behold,
I weep!”
(Rising inflexion). (See page 383).
“Come my poor little one, rest thee here!" (Fall-
ing inflexion). Selections for practice on semi-tone
intervals are here appended.

over Caesar's Body” (page 553); “Richard III. is
Conscience-stricken" (page 638).
(4) Tenderness, pity, love, confession of weak-
ness, expostulation: "Murillo's Trance” (page 299,
near end); “Ode to My Little Son” (page 521);
“Cardinal Wolsey's Soliloquy" (page 641); “Tamora
Pleads for Her Vanquished Sons” (page 646); “The
Dying Alchemist” (page 434).
(d) Circumflex Inflexions.
There are two circumflex inflexions, the rising-
falling and the falling-rising. The circumflex is used
when two mental attitudes are combined that re-
quire opposite inflexions, as, for instance, when
doubting or entreating is associated with assertive-
ness or command.
(1) The falling-rising circumflex expresses as-
sertion or command followed directly by an appeal
or an anticipation of the hearer's opinion. Thus,
/
"Go there, please."
(2) The rising-falling circumflex first questions
or appeals, then asserts. Thus: "Who can be wise,
A
A A
A
amazed, temperate, and furious, loyal and neutral in
a moment?”
(3) The rising-falling circumflex is used in
irony, mockery, scorn, retort. Thus, Irony: "Oh
A
A
yes! He's a fine fellow! A perfect gentleman, he!"

-Mocking retort: "Madam, you have my father
much offended."
Selections to exemplify the rising-falling in-
flexion in irony and mocking retort may be found in
"Caesar's Passage of the Rubicon" (page 305);
"Peace with France" (page 323); "The Antagonism
of Vices" (page 325); "Catiline's Defiance" (page
501) ; "Shylock to Antonio" (page 570); "Hotspur's
Defense” (page 599).
No attempt has been made in this chapter to cover the
whole ground of vocal inflexions. They occur in human speech
with such frequency, and the tone-intervals embraced by
them exhibit such a variety of halves and wholes, minors and
majors, that an exhaustive treatise would not only be tedious
but perplexing.
Drills
(1) Let the student speak the following sentence
changing the mental attitude and emotions in the
succession given below, and noticing the inflexions
on the word "die”: “If you do this, you shall die."
To do this well, one must feel deeply.
(a) Intervals of whole tones:
Simple assertion: "If you do this, you shall die"
(drop of voice).
Command or threat: (deeper drop).
Inquiry: (slight rise).
Amazement and inquiry: (higher rise).
Friendly warning: (slight rise-fall).
Amazement and incredulity (combined): (higher
rise-fall).

Friendly warning and appeal (combined): fall-
rise).
(b) Intervals of semi-tones:
Grief: (slight drop).
Despair: (deeper drop).
Anxiety: (slight rise).
Fright: (higher rise).
An instance of how the question of inflecting a single
phrase may arouse keen interest is seen in the passage of
Lady Macbeth's quick response to Macbeth's anxious ques-
tion, “But if we fail?” Her reply is, “We fail.” Actors and
critics differ widely as to what mental attitude she spoke this
in,-amazement, mockery, or simple assertion.
(2) The student should demonstrate all the
varieties of inflexion of which the following are
capable, and after each utterance state what par-
ticular mental attitude or emotion his inflexion por-
trays: “We fail.”—“He will strike you.”—“Oh!"
Shaftesbury maintains that eleven thousand different in-
flexions may be given to the single word “oh”.
III Monotone
The monotone (do not confound this with the
fault, called monotony) is a studied avoidance of
inflexions, except at the very beginning and very
close of a passage. It is used whenever a very im-
pressive, a solemn, or a weird effect is to be pro-
duced. Hence it is rarely employed; indeed, a too
frequent use would destroy its effect. Thus,
(a) In solemn declaration: Holy, Holy, Holy
Lord God of Sabaoth; the earth is full of Thy
glory!"


## p. 83 (#103) #############################################

QUALITY
[83]
(b) For weird effect:
"High on a throne of royal state, which far
Outshone the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,
Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand
Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,
Satan exalted sat."
(c) High-pitched monotone is used to imitate
cries or calls of multitudes. The high tone must be
continued to the very close. A drop on the final
word or syllable must be carefully avoided. The
vowel sounds are considerably distended, the effect
being heightened by a vocal quaver or tremolo.
The high-pitched monotone is the nearest approach to
the singing voice practiced by elocutionists.
“They cried, 'Make way for liberty!'” Selection:
"Sardanapalus to the Battle" (page 407).
(d) Low-pitched monotone is employed when
excessive grief or agony is united with deep
thought; also in impersonation of ghosts.
“It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood;
Stones have been known to move, and trees to speak;
Augurs and understood relations have,
By maggot-pies and choughs, and rooks, brought
forth
The secret'st man of blood.”
"I am thy father's spirit;
Doomed for a certain term to walk the night.”
Quality
By quality (tone-color or timbre) is meant that
characteristic of tone which distinguishes one voice
from another, as the sound of the violin is distin-
guished from that of the flute or of the cornet.


## p. 84 (#104) #############################################

[84] STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
Quality and pitch are not inter-related; for a voice may
have a full, round quality, even though high-keyed; it may
be thin and penetrating, and yet low-pitched.
The quality of some voices is full, round, reso-
nant; of others, thin, piping, penetrating; of others,
"wooden”, dull, thud-like; of others, raspy, snarling,
shattering; of others cracked; of others nasal; of
others, hollow.
Diversity of quality is due chiefly to the differ-
ence in mouth-formation, tongue-position, voice-
direction, soft-palate-elevation. By changing or
shifting one or more of these, a speaker can cause
his voice to assume a variety of qualities.
The pitch of the voice is governed by the rate of vocal-
cord vibrations,—the more rapid the vibration, the higher
the pitch. Each tone, however, is the resultant not of a
single vibration, but of a combination of vibrations,-a main
one, called the "prime", or "fundamental”, which determines
the pitch, and which extends the full length of the vibrating
body, and others that are superposed upon the “prime" at
division points (one-half, one-third, one-fourth, etc.) of its
length. These latter are called "partials”, “overtones” or
"harmonics”, and it is they,-more particularly, their num-
ber, their relative position, and their relative degree of loud-
ness, that determine the quality of the tone.
Kinds of Quality
Vocal quality is classified by elocutionists as:
Pure, Orotund, Guttural, Falsetto, Asthenic, As-
pirate, Pectoral, Nasal, Oral.
(1) PURE QUALITY of tone is produced when
the mouth organs are in the same relative position
as in ordinary, unemotional conversation.
The term "pure tone”, as here employed, does not imply
a tone necessarily free from defects, but one that is unaf-


## p. 85 (#105) #############################################

QUALITY
[85]
fected by such relative positions of the mouth organs as are
required for emotional and passionate utterance.
Pure quality is used in all dispassionate nar-
ratives and descriptions, as well as in all simple and
calm expositions of theories and proofs. To practice
this quality the following selections will be service-
able: “The Catholic Church" (except last paragraph
-page 3); "Abou Ben Adhem" (page 176); "True
Eloquence" (page 185); "The Two Roads” (para-
graphs 1, 2, 5-page 192); "The Ghost" (page 418).
All titles and explanations introductory to elocu-
tionary pieces are spoken in pure quality.
(2) OROTUND QUALITY is a highly cultivated
state of the pure, than which it is, as its derivative
implies (os and rotundum, the Latin for round
mouth), rounder, fuller, more massive, more sonor-
ous. To produce it, the mouth is wide open, not
necessarily at the lips, but at the rear of the jaws;
the tongue is flattened down well; the soft-palate
is raised; the tones are directed upward against the
forepart of the hard-palate rather than forward to
the lips.
The orotund is the quality the student should by all
means try to acquire and perfect, the one to which he should
so habituate himself, that his voice may lapse easily and
even spontaneously into it from the pure quality whenever
his emotions require it.
Drill
The following drill will aid the student to acquire
and fix tones of orotund quality.
(1) Beginning on pure quality, repeat several
times, each time with a fuller, rounder tone than


## p. 86 (#106) #############################################

[86]
STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
the one preceding (by opening mouth wider at rear,
etc., as explained above) the following:
"Roll on, thou dark and deep, blue ocean, roll!
Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain.”
This should be done in low pitch. Avoid opening
the mouth too wide at rear and placing the voice
back too far, lest the tone become unpleasantly hol-
low.
From the pure quality to the orotund there is an in-
definite number of graduations, and, as the foregoing drill
will show, it is difficult to tell at which particular graduation
the one quality begins to predominate over the other. In
actual practice, the voice should be so graduated as to these
two qualities, that the more solemn and impressive the feel-
ing, the more orotund should the tone-color be.
The orotund quality is used whenever a more or
less sustained force of utterance is required, hence
nearly always in speeches and very frequently in
dramatic readings. It is the orator's and, usually,
the actor's characteristic voice.
To practice the orotund quality, almost all the
oratorical and dramatic selections and many parts
of the ballads contained in this book would be ap-
propriate, but the following are particularly sug-
gested for a combination of orotund quality and low
pitch: "The Closing Year" (page 189); “To a Skele-
ton" (page 197); “Death and the Warrior" (page
274); "Fall of Warsaw” (page 318); “The Destruc-
tion of Sennacherib” (page 335); “Time's Midnight
Voice” (page 479).
Selections to practice gradations from pure
quality to orotund and vice versa: “Murillo's
Trance" (page 299); "The Battle of Waterloo"

(page 303); “A Hebrew Tale” (page 359); "The
Seventh Plague of Egypt” (page 385); “Ninety-
eight” (page 402); "The Leper" (page 440); "Cam-
byses and the Macrobian Bow" (page 457); “The
Bells" (page 467).
(3) GUTTURAL QUALITY is a harsh, rasping, al-
most snarling quality of voice, suggesting, as the
name implies (guttur, the Latin for throat) a throat
effect. It is obtained by drawing back the tongue
and contracting the throat.
It must, however, not be confounded with a throaty tone,
which is produced by checking the voice in the throat, and
has a dull, lifeless effect.
The guttural quality is employed to express re-
venge, hatred, scorn, etc.
The following pieces contain passages suitable
for practicing the guttural quality: “The Seminole's
Defiance" (page 320); "Rienzi to the Romans"
(page 331); "The Moor's Revenge" (page 371);
"Catiline's Defiance” (page 501); Shylock's Aside
(page 568); “York to the Queen" (page 630).
(4) ASPIRATE QUALITY is the
quality in which more breath is ex-
Advanced
pended than is needed to produce a
Course
tone, thus rendering the tone un-
clear. This quality aptly portrays
awe, fear, caution, surprise, alarm, and other sup-
pressed emotions, and the nearer it approaches a
whisper, the more telling is its effect.
It may be mentioned here parenthetically that an other-
wise hard and unsympathetic voice may be softened by a
touch of "breathiness”, though it will lose in clearness.

Selections for practice: Certain passages in “The
Battle of Waterloo ” (page 303); “The Death of
Marmion” (page 477);
Lady Macbeth (after the murder of Duncan):
“I hear a knocking
At the south entry; retire we to our chamber;
A little water clears us of this deed:
How easy is it then! Your constancy
Hath left you unattended. Hark! more knocking !"
(5) FALSETTO QUALITY, sometimes called head-
tone, is pitched above the scale of the chest-tone. It
is used to reproduce female voices and those of chil-
dren.
Selections for practice: Certain passages of
"After Blenheim" (page 258); "The Robber" (page
297); “Murillo's Trance” (page 299).
With the "Falsetto" may be classed the high
"cracked" voice used in impersonation of old age.
"His big manly voice,
Turning again towards childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound."
Shakespeare, As You Like it, II, 7.
Selection, “To the Raging Elements” (page 589).
(6) ASTHENIC QUALITY is a feeble, thin quality
commonly heard in the voices of the dying, the ex-
hausted, the very timid.
Selections for practice:
"She was dying the beloved,
She, the dying Minihaha,
‘Hark'! she said, 'I hear a rushing,
Hear a roaring and a rushing,
Hear the falls of Minihaha,
Calling to me from a distance'."

(7) PECTORAL QUALITY is a hollow, sepulchral
quality, deeper than the orotund. It is employed for
expressions of awe, mysteriousness, profound rev-
erence. Hence it is appropriated for ghost-char-
acters.
Selections: Parts of Soliloquy of Macbeth (page
541); “Clarence's Dream" (page 635).
Ghost in Hamlet: “I am thy father's spirit,
Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
And for the day confined to fast in fires,
Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
Are burnt and purged away.”
(8) NASAL QUALITY is an ill-sounding quality
produced by dropping the soft-palate too low, thus
allowing an excess of breath to pass through the
noise. It is made use of only in character sketches
of the "Yankee" type.
Selection for practice: Parts of “The Ghost"
(page 418).
(9) ORAL QUALITY is a quality in which the ef-
fort to speak seems to be wholly centered in the
mouth. The lip and cheek muscles are used to a
marked excess. It is employed only in affecting the
manner of a coquette.
Body Movements
All that has been dwelt on hitherto concerns the
vocal organs or speech. What follows shall treat of
the elocutionary functions of various parts of the
body, viz: action.
Action, as here taken, embraces those movements
of any part of the body, which cooperate with utter-


## p. 90 (#110) #############################################

[90] STUDENTS CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
ance to interpret or impress thought and feeling.
Hence body movements, when properly made, are
important factors in the art of expression. Indeed,
such is their peculiar virtue that, as is instanced in
pantomime, they may, without the aid of speech,
render thought and feeling even down to minute
details.
Elocution recognizes movements
(1) Of the arm, forearm, hand, and fingers
(specifically called "gestures");
(2) Of the head;
(3) Of the face (mouth and eyes);
(4) Of the shoulders;
(5) Of the lower limbs and feet (more particu-
larly called "positions”).
The whole body should give expression to one's feelings.
One should be a speaker from the crown of his head to the
soles of his feet. The eyes, the lips, the hands, and arms,
the shoulders, the back, the knees, the feet, must all act in
harmony to interpret one and the same emotion,—the par-
ticular emotion in the speaker's soul.
(A) Gesture (arm, forearm, hand, fingers).
(I)—General Principles
(a) In gesticulating, the arm and hand, from
the shoulder to the finger-tips, should be in a curved
line,—the line of beauty. Carefully note, however,
that this line should describe a compound curve;
i. e. the curve at the wrist should be in a different
direction from the one at the elbow, the one at the
thumb in a diſſerent direction from that at the
fingers. Hence avoid two extremes: a straight line,
and a simple or continuous curve.


## p. 91 (#111) #############################################

BODY MOVEMENTS
[91]
The curve is more perceptible in some gestures than in
others.
(b) The fingers and thumb, except in certain
peculiar emotions, are held in an easy, unrestrained
position, with a slight bend in the forefinger and a
gradually increasing bend in the others down to
the little finger, the thumb curving slightly in an-
other direction.
. Avoid turning the thumb toward the palm, as that would
produce a simple instead of a compound curve.
(c) As the arm rises for a gesture, the hand,
fingers, and thumb should usually hang "dead" or
limp on wrist until just before the emphatic word,
on which the stroke or "ictus" of the movement is
to be made, when the hand rises from or turns at
the wrist, and at once proceeds to the stroke or beat
(ictus). In all gestures, even the emphatic ones, the
action must be begun in sufficient time to allow the
stroke to fall on the emphatic word.—Much of the
grace of a gesture depends upon the action at the
wrist; hence the importance of wrist-exercises.
Wrist Exercises
(1) Stand erect, arms straight out in front of
you in parallel lines, palms down. Hand and fingers
dead on wrist, shake them (not arms) as rapidly
and violently as possible up and down.
(2) Bend elbows, hold hands in front of waist,
palms towards you. Shake hands, dead on wrist, in
lateral motion as rapidly and violently as possible.
(II) Kinds of Gestures.
Gestures are distinguished:


## p. 92 (#112) #############################################

[92] STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
(a) According to shape assumed by the hand
and fingers, as follows:
(1) Palm down, palm up, palm out, (facing
audience), palm in (facing speaker);
(2) Clenched fist;
(3) Pointing, (forefinger alone extended, the
others and the thumb bent);
(4) Fingers and thumb apart, extended and
rigid, as in fright;
(5) Hands clasped as in supplication;
(6) Palm of hand resting on bosom, on head,
on side, with arms akimbo; forefingers and thumb
resting on chin.
(b) According to lateral position ( i. e. on a plane
from one side of the body to the other). We may
specify five lateral positions: (1) Arm across body
to opposite side; (2) Front of body; (3) Front
oblique; (4) Side; (5) Rear oblique.
The first and fifth cannot be taken for gestures
made with both hands.
To take the fifth position, the whole body must
be turned in the direction of the gesture.
(c) According to plane or height:-(1) Very
low; (2) Low; (3) Medium; (4) High (level of
shoulders); (5) Very high (above head).
Of course, not all the planes or heights can be taken for
every position of the palm
(d) According to range:-(1) Full length of
arm; (2) Partial length of arm.
(e) According to motion :-(1) Those that re-
quire movement; (2) Those that are more or less
stationary.

Drills
The subjoined drills are intended to habituate
the student to gesticulate according to the general
principles laid down above.
Note, that when a gesture is to be discontinued,
the arm and hand should drop gently (hand dead on
wrist) to the side of the body. Avoid allowing the
arm to fall against the side with a thud.
(1) Speak the sentence: "The point we must
come to is this" (stroke of gesture on “this"), mak-
ing a whole gesture each time, (from arm at rest
at side to the "stroke" of the gesture), in each
lateral position from the cross-body to the rear-
oblique, right hand only, as follows:
(a) Palm up, whole range, medium plane;
(b) Same as a, on low plane;
(c) Same as a, half range;
(d) Repeat a, b, c, palm down;
(e) Repeat a, palm out, high plane (level of
shoulder);
(f) Same as e, very high plane (slightly above
level of head);
(g) Same as f, palm in;
(h) Repeat all of foregoing with left hand;
(i) Repeath, both hands simultaneously
(wherever practicable);
(j) "Pointing" gesture, on sentence: "All eyes
were turned to that spot.” Raise hand, thumb and
fingers dead, to the point where the "stroke" is to
be made. Then suddenly put life into them, palm
down, forefinger extended, thumb and other fingers

bent, wrist slightly arched,-medium plane, front
oblique position, right hand;
(k) Repeat j, successively in all positions, first
on low plane, then medium plane, then high plane,
then very high plane, (starting each gesture from
rest-position at side) ;
(1) Repeat k, with left hand.
(III) Classifications of Gestures as to their
Functions.
(a) Gestures of Description,
such as portray an object.
Advanced
(1) in its movements, as rising,
Course
falling, circling, waving, etc.
(2) in its dimensions, as high,
deep, wide, etc.
(3) in its size, as bulky, tiny, etc.
(4) in its shape, as round, angular, pointed, etc.
(5) in other peculiarities, as open, closed, di-
vided, connected, depressing, crushing, uplifting,
light in weight, volatile, etc.
Gestures of description must imitate what they
aim to depict. They should be indulged sparingly.
Exercises for Gestures of Description: "We saw
the aeroplane ascend from the ground gracefully,
like a monster bird, and then circle round and round
as it rose higher and higher into the clouds far
above our heads."-
“Mercutio on Dreams” (page 647) requires
gestures descriptive of tiny objects (e. g. thumb
touching tip of little finger of the same hand).-
“With cruel hands the bonds of humanity were
torn asunder.”—


## p. 95 (#115) #############################################

BODY MOVEMENTS
[95]
"Open here I flung the shutter, when with many
a flirt and flutter
In there stepped a stately raven.”—Open hand,
palm up).
(b) Gestures of Explanation, such as indicate
what impression an utterance: (1) is to make on
the hearer- (Suited to oratorical selections) ; (2)
makes on the speaker-(Adapted to dramatic se-
lections).
Gestures of explanation depict mental and moral
attitudes as analogous to the movements and ap-
pearances of bodies. Accordingly, they are to these
attitudes what the descriptive gestures are to bodies.
Hence following principles:
(1) Open-hand gesture, palm up.—Used in
presenting an argument, offering aid, etc. (analog-
ous to offering a gift); also in appealing for aid, co-
operation, information analogous to receiving a
gift). Examples: “What can be a clearer admis-
sion of guilt than such a statement !"_"Welcome to
our home!" (Both hands),-"Go on: we shall help
you through this venture.”-“Will you not help us?
All we ask is your cheerful co-operation."
The student should be expected to find among the selec-
tions of this book similar examples for the foregoing and
all the following principles and rules of body movements.
(2) Palm down,-at rest.–Used in subduing;
frequently employed in exposing fallacies, refuting,
neglecting, prohibiting (analogous to a condition of
power over another). Examples: "He spake to the
troubled waters: 'Peace, be still!' "_"He cannot
prove his statements. They are all false. Do not

believe them."-"No! You may not leave here. I
will not permit it.”
(3) Palm out, medium plane.-Expresses scorn,
aversion,—(analogous to thrusting a disagreeable
object from one). Examples: “Away with that! I
cannot bear the sight of it!”—“I scorn your prof-
fered treaty."_"Bah! such flattery! I'll none of it."
(4) Palm in.-Used in beckoning. Example:
"Come, follow me!"
Palm in, gazing at palm (action of examining or
studying an object). Example: “Let us weigh every
word of the law calmly and carefully. It says:
'Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thy heart, but
reprove him openly!
(5) Pointing.–Employed to designate direc-
tion, also in peremptory commands. Examples:
“But look! the morn in russet mantle clad,
Walks o'er the dew of yon high Eastern hill.”
"Go! Do as I bid you !" (Lateral position).-
“Down on your knees, and crawl for pardon!" (Low,
front).
(6) Forefinger pointing upward, half-arm.-
Calls for attention, gives warning. Examples: "Hear
me, for my cause, and be silent that you may hear.”
-“Beware! Beware! There is poison in the cup of
pleasure!"
(7) Forefinger, on almost all planes, half or
full arm length.—Demonstrates, explains, indicates
a point; used also in forceful reasoning. Example:
"Brutus's Harangue" (page 556).
(8) Clenched Fist. - Portrays determination,
defiance, hatred, revenge. Examples:

“The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
Is dearly bought: 'Tis mine, and I will have it."
"If I can catch him once upon the hip,
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.”
“I defy him to his worst !”
The foregoing examples in medium to high plane.
(9) Clasped Hands, on upper chest; or at half-
arm length, any plane. (Avoid concealing face).-
Effective in prayer, supplication. Example:
“Oh, spare my child, my joy, my pride!
Oh, give me back my child.”
(10) Hand at brow, shading eyes.—Used when
descrying and gazing intently. Example: “But, see
yonder over the distant hill! Who is he that steals
upon us?"
(11) Hand behind the ear.—Employed when
hearing is difficult. Example: “Hark! I hear the
sound of feet approaching. We shall be detected.”
(12) Hand at chin, with forefinger resting on
chin, thumb on lower jaw.-Indicates pensiveness,
reflection, study. Example: (Thoughtfully) "Let
me see! If this plan is followed, what shall we do
next?”
(13) Forefinger on brow.—Expresses use of
memory. Example: "How many were there? By the
nearest guess of my memory, there were twelve-
no! there were just thirteen in all.”
(14) Forefinger on lips.—Conveys command
not to speak. Examples: Silence! Do not speak.”
“I am Sir Oracle,
And when I ope my lips, let no dog bark.”

(15) Forefinger in palm of other hand (as
though deciphering or reading). See Example under
No. 4.
(16) Palm of hand covering eyes.-Expresses
shame, grief. Examples:
"Fie! Fie! They are
Not to be named, my lord, not to be spoke of!
There is not chastity enough in language
Without offense to utter them.”
“Friend! I owe more tears
To this dead man, than thou shalt see me pay.”
(17) Striking with open hand or fist on palm of
other hand.—Occurs in determinateness, emphasis,
positiveness. Examples: “We must win this fight.”
_“Your statement is false, false, I say.”
Sometimes the stroke is repeated on successive
words, emphasizing each one. Example: No! You
shall not do that!”
(IV) Gesture Movement.
Hitherto, we have considered the kinds of
gestures according to the shape, position, range,
and plane of the arm and hand. There is, however,
another classification of gestures: The more or less
stationary (the arm and hand being held at the
point where the gesture is first made); and the
mobile (the limbs moving, for the effect intended).
There are eight such movements: Vertical, either
upward or downward; lateral, either right to left
or left to right; diagonal, either upward or down-
ward, and either right to left or left to right.
Of course, each of these movements may be carried to
everyone of the ranges, positions and planes of gesture.

BODY MOVEMENTS
[99]
(a) Movement downward. (Analogous to strik-
ing downward, crushing and opposing objects),-
Used to express determinateness of will, mental and
moral assertiveness and positiveness, impatience,
and (arms limp) failure, dismay, etc. Examples:
"I would never lay own my arms.”—“You must
admit this truth.”—“A plague upon both your
houses.”_"We labored manfully to defend our
rights, but alas! 'twas all in vain!"
(b) Movement upward. (Analogous to lifting
up, aiding).—Employed in elation, enthusiasm,
cheerfulness, gaiety. Examples: “Onward! Ever
onward! A heavenly prize awaits you.”-
“Let us then be up and doing,
Still achieving, still pursuing.”
"Charge, Chester, charge! On, Stanley, on!"
(c) Movement lateral. (Analogous to gathering,
sweeping.)—Employed in generalizing statements.
Examples: "A nation's rights betrayed, and all con-
tent?"_"No matter in which light you regard him,
he never deserved such honor."
(d) Rapid lateral movement, with short nervous
stroke, palm down.-Indicates negation, denial,
(similarly as when head is shaken). Examples:
"No! No! You have not proven that!”—“Speak
not to me of mercy."
(e) Repeated vertical movement (short stroke)
with all kinds of gestures.—Emphasizes a whole
statement. (Stroke is not on each word, however).
See No. 17 (page [98]).
A speaker must often proceed directly from one
gesture to another, without dropping the hand

to the side. In such cases, the one action must
merge gracefully into the other with rounded wrist
movements. There should be drills in this in all
possible combinations and varieties.
Gestures with both hands whenever permissible
express the same as those with one hand, except that
they portray deeper feeling.
A peculiarly dramatic and telling effect is ob-
tained by observing the dictum: “Action before the
word.” The speaker pauses in his utterance from
the beginning to the completion of the gesture, and
even longer; and the longer he pauses the greater
the emphasis.
Whenever any action of the face, eyes, head,
etc., accompanies the gesture, it must begin with
and often precede the gesture. To acquire practice
in this matter, some of the passages selected above
for the use of the gesture may be employed.
Should the eyes follow the gesture? Not in the
oratorical style of speaking, in which the eyes should
be on the audience. The direction of the eyes should
be identical with that of the mind, that is, towards
what is the most important object of attention, and
this is generally the audience. But when the char-
acter of expression is dramatic, the eyes follow the
gesture; for then it is more important either to
draw the attention of the audience to the object, or
to show that the speaker's attention is drawn
thither. This happens in descriptive, pointing, in-
dicating gestures. Sometimes the eyes continue to
follow the gesture; sometimes they follow only
momentarily, and that at the start, reverting imme-

BODY MOVEMENTS
[101]
diately to the audience; sometimes they repeatedly
turn from the gesture to the audience and vice
versa.
Gestures should not be chosen indiscriminately,
but with the view of expressing precisely what one
intends to express. "Suit the action to the word, the
word to the action."
Gestures, like all action, must be natural, spon-
taneous. Conscious art must as far as possible be
eliminated here as in whatever else pertains to ex-
pression.
(B) Other Body Movements
(I) The Head.
(a) The head nods in affirmation, approval,
positive assertion of knowledge, volition, etc.
The student should be required to improvise or select
from the pieces of this book exercises to practice this and all
following body movements.
(b) The head is shaken in negation, disapproval.
(c) The head droops in dejection, shame, hu-
mility, etc.
(d) The head is tossed back in elation, haugh-
tiness, etc.
(e) The head leans to one side in feebleness,
childish simplicity, mawkish affection.
(II) The Shoulders are shrugged in doubt,
hesitation, ignorance. Example:
“But what they fought each other for,
I could not well make out."

(III) The Lower Limbs and Feet.—Positions.
Mark an X on the floor, either with chalk or a
string, each line of which is about three feet long
from its end to the intersection.
(a) Drill Position.-Stand a-straddle the inter-
section, the feet about eight inches apart. Resting
on balls of feet, swing heels inward till they almost
meet.
(b) First Position,-Right-Forward. Without
moving left foot, shift the right foot forward a few
inches along the right line of X, resting weight on
rear foot, and slightly bending right knee. This is
the position for calm, unimpassioned speech.
(c) Second Position, -Right-Forward. Same
as first position, except that weight is on forward
foot.
This and the following "forward” positions are
taken in all emphatic utterances of exultation, ap-
peal, exhortation, aggressiveness; sometimes, too,
in pointing.
(d) Third Position, -Right-Forward. -Right
foot a few inches forward of second position along
right line of X, weight on right foot, ball of left
foot slightly touching floor at intersection.
(e) Fourth Position,-Right-Forward.—Thrust
right foot a few inches forward of third position,
kneel on left knee, left foot still at intersection. To
be graceful in this, the body must lean forward.
The same positions occur with left foot forward.
(f) First Position, Right-Backward. — Left
foot is placed at intersection, the right foot is shifted
backward a few inches along or on right line of X,

right knee bent, weight on right foot. The "back-
ward” positions are adopted in fright, aversion, re-
pulsion, bashfulness.
(g) Second and Third Position,-Right-Back-
ward.—Same as the first, except that the right foot
is placed a few inches further back.
(h) Broad Position.—The feet right and left of
intersection, from twenty to thirty inches apart.
This position occurs in imitations of very young
children, coarse characters, and sometimes in low
comedy.
Drills
In the following drills, the student should in
each instance revert to the "Drill position", before
shifting from one position to another.
(Explanation of marks: R-right; left; F-
forward; B—backward. Numerals stands for first,
second, etc).
(1) Take following positions: 1 RF; 2 RF;
3 RF; 4 RF;1 RB; 2 RB; 3 R B.
(2) Same with left foot movements.
(3) 2 RF; 1 R B; 3 R F; 2 R B; 4 RF; 3 R B.
(4) 2 LF;1 LB; 3 LF; 2 L B; 4 LF; 3 L B.
(5) 1RF;1 LF; 3 RB; 3 L F;4 RF;3 L B.
Gestures and Positions Combined.
(1) Right hand gesture, palm up, hand and head
higher the more forward the position. Combined
with following positions: 1 RF; 2 RF; 3 RF;
4 R F. Utter in each position: “Do, I beseech you."
(2) Same as 2, left hand and foot.
(3) Left hand, repelling gesture, palm out,
head averted from hand. Combined with following


## p. 104 (#124) ############################################

[104] STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
positions: 1 R B; 2 R B; 3 R B. Exclaim in each
position: “Away from me!"
(4) Same as 3 with right hand and left foot.
The foot stamps the ground in vehement expres-
sions of positiveness, of command, of impatience.
Example: “You must do as I bid.” “Go to! you are
not a better soldier than I.”
(IV) Facial Expressions.
The face often reflects the emotions of the soul.
Hence the elocutionist values it as a ready and re-
sourceful instrument of expression. The mouth, the
eyes, the forehead, and even the nose may be made
to portray feeling severally, but, as a rule, they do so
conjointly and harmoniously.
It may be found advisable to use the mirror to determine
the movements of facial muscles and to accustom oneself to
them.
(a) The Mouth.
(1) The mouth is closed and the lower jaw
thrust forward in determinateness, anger, malice,
resistance to pain.
The student should improvise sentences illustrative of this
and all the following instructions on the mouth, eyes, fore-
head, and nostrils.
(2) The mouth is open in surprise, bewilder-
ment.
(3) The middle of the lips is lifted, the chin re-
cedes, the sides of mouth are drawn down, in fear
and grief.
(4) The lips and mouth are relaxed in weak-
ness, irresolution.
(5) The upper lip is curled and the chin is pro-
jected in disgust, contempt.


## p. 105 (#125) ############################################

BODY MOVEMENTS
[105]
(6) The mouth is drawn to the side rigidly, and
the lips are parallel, in laughing and crying, the
mouth corners being up in the former, and down in
the latter.
(7) The lips are pursed in apprehension.
(8) The corners of the mouth are drawn down
in sadness, discontent.
(b) The Eyes.
(1) The eyes are opened wide in surprise, fear,
exultation.
(2) They are turned upward in prayer.
(3) They are turned downward in dejection,
shame, contrition, sullenness.
(4) They are turned to one side in thoughtful-
ness.
How the eyes dance with glee, burn with anger,
stare in fright, and what they look like in laughter
and weeping is too well known to need description.
(c) The Forehead.
(1) The forehead is raised and wrinkled in sur-
prise;
(2) It is knitted in dissatisfaction, close study,
worry.
(d) The Nostrils.
(1) The nostrils are dilated in exultation, hope,
surprise, pride, haughtiness;
(2) They contract in grief, indignation.
(V) Silent Expression
An excellent exercise to suggest and develop
body movements is to express feeling silently or by
pantomime, i. e. by the sole use of gestures, posi-
tions, and facial expressions.

SELECTIONS FOR PRACTICE
"Herein lies the secret of elocution: one must seize the soul of
the author whose thoughts he would reproduce; he must embody
that soul in himself, making it a part of his own being, and then
he will speak with that forcible eloquence which alone deserves
the name of elocution."—N. H. Gillespie
"If feeling does not prompt, in vain you strive.
If from the soul the language does not come,
By its own impulse, to impel the hearts
Of hearers with communicated power,
In vain you strive. ...
.... Never hope to stir the hearts of men,
And mould the souls of many into one,
By words which come not native from the heart."

We are called upon to act. There is no time for

the majesty of their might, stretch forth their
strong arm and silence the angry waves of tumult.
It is time the people should command peace. It is a

question between union and anarchy-between law
and disorder. All politics for the time being are
and should be committed to the resurrection of the
grave.
The question should be, "Our country, our
whole country, and nothing but our country.”
“ 'Tis not the whole of life to live,
Nor all of death to die.”
We should go forward in a manner becoming a
great people. But six months since, the material
elements of our country were never greater. To-
day, by the fiat of madness, we are plunged in dis-
tress and threatened with political ruin, anarchy
and annihilation. It becomes us to stay the hand of
this spirit of disunion. While I would prosecute this
war in a manner becoming a civilized and a Chris-
tian people, I would do so in no vindictive spirit. I
would do it as Brutus set the signet to the death-
warrant of his son—“Justice is satisfied, and Rome
is free.” I love my country; I love this Union. It
was the first vision of my early years; it is the last
ambition of my public life. Upon its altar I have
surrendered my choicest hopes. I had fondly hoped
that in approaching age it was to beguile my solitary
hours, and I will stand by it as long as there is a
Union to stand by; and when the ship of the Union
shall crack and groan, when the skies lower and
threaten, when the lightnings flash, the thunders
roar, the storms beat and the waves run mountain-
high, if the ship of state goes down, and the Union
perishes, I would rather perish with it than survive
its destruction.

THE CATHOLIC CHURCH_MACAULAY.
There is not, and there never was, on this earth,
a work of human policy so well deserving of exam-
ination as the Roman Catholic Church. The history
of that Church joins together the two great ages of
human civilization. No other institution is left
standing which carries the mind back to the times
when the smoke of sacrifice rose from the Pantheon,
and when camelopards and tigers bounded in the
Flavian amphitheatre.
The proudest royal houses are but of yesterday
when compared with the line of the Supreme Pon-
tiffs. That line we trace back in an unbroken series
from the Pope who crowned Napoleon, in the nine-
teenth century, to the Pope who crowned Pepin in
the eighth; and far beyond the time of Pepin the
august dynasty extends, till it is lost in the twilight
of fable. The republic of Venice came next in an-
tiquity. But the republic of Venice was modern
when compared with the Papacy; and the republic
of Venice is gone, and the Papacy remains. The
Papacy remains not in decay, not a mere antique,
but full of life and youthful vigor.
The Catholic Church is still sending forth to the
farthest ends of the world missionaries as zealous as
those who landed in Kent with Augustine; and still
confronting hostile kings with the same spirit with
which she confronted Attila. The number of her
children is greater than in any former age.
Her
acquisitions in the New World have more than com-
pensated her for what she has lost in the Old. Her
spiritual ascendency extends over the vast countries

which lie between the plains of Missouri and Cape
Horn; countries which, a century hence, may not
improbably contain a population as large as that
which now inhabits Europe.
The members of her community are certainly
not fewer than one hundred and fifty millions; and
it will be difficult to show that all the other Christian
sects united amount to a hundred and twenty mil-
lions. Nor do we see any sign which indicates that
the term of her long dominion is approaching.
She saw the commencement of all the govern-
ments and of all the ecclesiastical establishments
that now exist in the world; and we feel no assur-
ance that she is not destined to see the end of them
all. She was great and respected before the Saxon
had set foot on Britain-before the Frank had
passed the Rhine—when Grecian eloquence still
flourished at Antioch—when idols were still wor-
shipped in the temple of Mecca. And she may still
exist in undiminished vigor when some traveller
from New Zealand shall, in the midst of a vast soli-
tude, take his stand on the broken arch of London
Bridge to sketch the ruins of St. Paul's.
THE MEXICAN WAR-CORWIN
I ask, Mr. President, what has Mexico got from
you for parting with two-thirds of her domain ?
She has given you ample redress for every injury of
which you have complained. She has submitted to
the award of your commissioners, and up to the
time of the rupture with Texas, faithfully paid it.

And for all that she has lost (not through or by you,
but which loss has been your gain) what requital do
we, her strong, rich, robust neighbor, make?
Do we send our missionaries there, “to point the
way to heaven? Or do we send the schoolmasters
to pour daylight into her dark places, to aid her
infant strength to conquer freedom, and reap the
fruit of the independence herself alone had won?
No, no, none of this do we. But we send regi-
ments, storm towns, and our colonels prate of lib-
erty in the midst of the solitudes their ravages have
made. They proclaim the empty forms of social com-
pact to a people bleeding and maimed with wounds
received in defending their hearth-stones against
the invasion of these very men who shoot them
down, and then exhort them to be free.
Your chaplain of the navy throws aside the New
Testament and seizes a bill of rights. He takes
military possession of some town in California, and
instead of teaching the plan of the atonement and
the way of salvation to the poor, ignorant Celt, he

take “trial by jury and Habeas Corpus," or nine
bullets in his head. Oh! Mr. President, are you not
the lights of the earth, if not its salt?
What is the territory, Mr. President, which you
propose to wrest from Mexico? It is consecrated to
the heart of the Mexican by many a well-fought
battle with his old Castilian master. His Bunker
Hills, and Saratogas, and Yorktowns are there!
The Mexican can say, "There I bled for liberty!

have possessed themselves of the Territory between
the Nueces and the Rio Grande. What else do they
want? To what shall I point my children as memo-
rials of that independence which I bequeath to them,
when those battle-fields shall have passed from my
possession ?"
Sir, had one come and demanded Bunker Hill of
the people of Massachusetts—had England's lion
ever showed himself there, is there a man over thir-
teen and under ninety who would not have been
ready to meet him? Is there a river on this con-
tinent that would not have run red with blood? Is
there a field but would have been piled high with
the unburied bones of slaughtered Americans, be-
fore these consecrated battle-fields of liberty should
have been wrested from us?
TECUMSEH TO GOVERNOR HARRISON

It is true I am a Shawnee. My forefathers were

ing. I am the maker of my own fortune; and oh!
that I could make that of my red people, and of my
country, as great as the conceptions of my mind,
when I think of the Spirit that rules the universe.
I would not then come to Governor Harrison to ask
him to tear the treaty and to obliterate the land-
mark; but I would say to him: "Sir, you have liberty
to return to your own country.”

The being within, communing with past ages,
tells me that once, nor until lately, there was no
white man on this continent; that it then all be-
longed to red men, children of the same parents,
placed on it by the Great Spirit that made them, to
keep it, to traverse it, to enjoy its productions, and
to fill it with the same race, once a happy race, since
made miserable by the white people, who are never
contented but always encroaching. The way, and
the only way, to check and to stop this evil, is for
all the red men to unite in claiming a common and
equal right in the land, as it was at first, and should
be yet; for it never was divided, but belongs to all
for the use of each. For no part has a right to sell,
even to each other, much less to strangers—those
who want all, and will not do with less.
DUTY OF AMERICAN CITIZENS-DOUGLAS
But this is no time for a detail of causes. The
conspiracy is now known. Armies have been raised,
war is levied to accomplish it. There are only two
sides to the question. Every man must be for the
United States or against it. There can be no neu-
trals in this war, only patriots or traitors.
We cannot close our eyes to the sad and solemn
fact that war does exist. The Government must be
maintained, its enemies overthrown; and the more
stupendous our preparations, the less the bloodshed
and the shorter the struggle will be. But we must
remember certain restraints on our action even in
time of war.
We are a Christian people, and the

war must be prosecuted in a manner recognized by
Christian nations.
We must not invade constitutional rights. The
innocent must not suffer, nor women and children
be the victims. Savages must not be let loose. But
while I sanction no war on the rights of others, I
will implore my countrymen not to lay down their
arms until our own rights are recognized.
The Constitution and its guarantees are our
birthright, and I am ready to enforce that inalien-
able right to the last extent. We cannot recognize
secession. Recognize it once, and you have not only
dissolved government, but you have destroyed social
order and upturned the foundations of society. You
have inaugurated anarchy in its worst form and will
shortly experience all the horrors of the French
Revolution.
Then we have a solemn duty,—to maintain the
Government. The greater our unanimity, the
speedier the day of peace. We have prejudices to
overcome from a fierce party contest waged a few
short months since. Yet these must be allayed. Let
us lay aside all criminations and recriminations as
to the origin of these difficulties. When we shall
have again a country, with the United States flag
floating over it, and respected on every inch of
American soil,—it will then be time enough to ask
who and what brought all this upon us.
I have said more than I intended to say. It is a
sad task to discuss questions so fearful as civil war:
but sad as it is, bloody and disastrous as I expect
the war will be, I express it as my conviction, before

TO THE ARMY BEFORE QUEBEC-WOLFE.
I congratulate you, my brave countrymen and
fellow-soldiers, on the spirit of success with which
you have executed this important part of our enter-
prise. The formidable Heights of Abraham are now
surmounted; and the city of Quebec, the object of
all our toils, now stands in full view before us. A
perfidious enemy, who have dared to exasperate you
by their cruelties, but not to oppose you on equal
ground, are now constrained to face you on the open
plain, without ramparts or intrenchments to shelter
them.
You know too well the forces which compose
their army to dread their superior numbers. A few
regular troops from old France, weakened by hun-
ger and sickness, who, when fresh, were unable to
withstand the British soldiers, are their General's
chief dependence. Those numerous companies of
Canadians, insolent, mutinous, unsteady, and ill-
disciplined, have exercised his utmost skill to keep
them together to this time; and, as soon as their
irregular ardor is damped by one firm fire, they will
instantly turn their backs and give you no further
trouble but in the pursuit. As for those savage
tribes of Indians, whose horrid yells in the forests
have struck many a bold heart with affright, terrible
as they are with a tomahawk and scalping-knife to
a flying and prostrate foe, you have experienced how
little their ferocity is to be dreaded by resolute men

courage and patience. Possessed with a full confi-
dence of the certain success which British valor
must gain over such enemies, I have led you up these

WITHDRAWAL OF TROOPS FROM BOSTON
LORD CHATHAM.
America, my Lords, cannot be reconciled to this
country, she ought not to be reconciled, till the
troops of Britain are withdrawn. How can America
trust you with the bayonet at her breast? How can
she suppose that you mean less than bondage or
death? I, therefore, move that an address be pre-
sented to his Majesty, advising that immediate
orders be despatched to General Gage for removing
his Majesty's forces from the town of Boston. The
way must be immediately opened for reconciliation.
It will soon be too late. An hour now lost in allay-
ing ferments in America may produce years of
calamity. Never will I desert, for a moment, the
conduct of this weighty business. Unless nailed to
my bed by the extremity of sickness, I will pursue
it to the end. I will knock at the door of this
sleeping and confounded Ministry, and will, if it be
possible, rouse them to a sense of their danger.
I contend not for indulgence, but for justice, to
America. What is our right to persist in such cruel
and vindictive acts against a loyal, respectable
people? They say you have no right to tax them
without their consent. They say truly. Representa-
tion and taxation must go together; they are insep-
arable. I, therefore, urge and conjure your
Lordships immediately to adopt this conciliating
measure. If illegal violences have been, as it is said,
committed in America, prepare the way—open the
door of possibility—for acknowledgment and satis-
faction; but proceed not to such coercion, such pro-
scription: cease your indiscriminate inflictions;

town, from province to province? What though you
enforce a temporary and local submission, how shall
you secure the obedience of the country you leave
behind you in your progress? How grasp the
dominion of eighteen hundred miles of continent,
populous in numbers, strong in valor, liberty, and
the means of resistance ?
The spirit which now resists your taxation in
America is the same which formerly opposed loans,
benevolences and ship-money in England;—the
same spirit which called all England on its legs, and,
by the Bill of Rights, vindicated the English Con-
stitution ;-the same spirit which established the
great fundamental essential maxim of your liberties,
that no subject of England shall be taxed but by his
own consent. This glorious Whig spirit animates
three millions in America, who prefer poverty with
liberty to gilded chains and sordid affluence, as free
men. What shall oppose this spirit, aided by the
congenial flame glowing in the breast of every Whig
in England? “'Tis liberty to liberty engaged,” that
they will defend themselves, their families, and their
country. In this great cause they are immovably
allied: it is the alliance of God and nature, immu-
table, eternal, fixed as the firmament of Heaven.

THE AMERICAN WAR-LORD CHATHAM
You cannot conciliate America by your present
measures; you cannot subdue her by your present,
or by any measures. What, then, can you do? You
cannot conquer, you cannot gain, but you can ad-
dress. In a just and necessary war, to maintain
the rights or honor of my country, I would strip the
shirt from my back in its behalf. But, in such a
war as this, unjust in its principle, impracticable in
its means, and ruinous in its consequences, I would
not contribute a single effort nor a single shilling.
My Lords, I have submitted to you with the free-
dom and truth which I think my duty, my senti-
ments on your present awful situation. I have laid
before you the ruin of your power, the disgrace of
your reputation, the pollution of your discipline, the
contamination of your morals, the complication of
calamities, foreign and domestic, that overwhelm
your sinking country. Your dearest interests, your
own liberties, the Constitution itself, totter to the
foundation. All this disgraceful danger, this mul-
titude of misery, is the monstrous offspring of this
unnatural war. We have been deceived and deluded
too long. Let us now stop short. This is the crisis,-
it may be the only crisis,—of time and situation, to
give us a possibility of escape from the fatal effects
of our delusions. But if, in an obstinate and in-
fatuated perseverance in folly, we meanly echo back
the peremptory words this day presented to us,-
words expressing an unalterable determination to
persist in the measures against America,—nothing
can save this devoted country from complete and

final ruin. We madly rush into multiplied miseries,
and plunge into “confusion worse confounded.”
RAISING REVENUE-EDMUND BURKE.
A revenue from America, transmitted hither?
Do not delude yourselves! You never can receive it;
no, not a shilling! Let the Colonies always keep the
idea of their civil rights associated with your
Government, and they will cling and grapple to you.
These are ties which, though light as air, are strong
as links of iron. But let it once be understood that
your Government may be one thing and their privi-
leges another, the cement is gone, the cohesion is
loosened. Do not entertain so weak an imagination
as that your registers and your bonds, your affi-
davits and your sufferances, your cockets and your
clearances, are what form the great securities of
your commerce. These things do not make your
Government. Dead instruments, passive tools, as
they are, it is the spirit of the English communion
that gives all their life and efficacy to them. It is
the spirit of the English Constitution, which, in-
fused through the mighty mass, pervades, feeds,
unites, invigorates, vivifies, every part of the
Empire, even down to the minutest member.
Do you imagine that it is the land tax which
raises your revenue? that it is the annual vote in
the committee of supply which gives you your
army? or that it is the mutiny bill which inspires it
with bravery and discipline? No! Surely no! It
is the love of the People; it is their attachment to
their Government from the sense of the deep stake

they have in such a glorious institution, which gives
you your army and your navy, and infuses into both
that liberal obedience, without which your army
would be a base rabble and your navy nothing but
rotten timber.
All this, I know well enough, will sound wild and
chimerical to the profane herd of those vulgar and
mechanical politicians, who have no place among
us; a sort of people who think that nothing exists
but what is gross and material; and who, therefore,
far from being qualified to be directors of the great
movement of Empire, are not fit to turn a wheel in
the machine. But, to men truly initiated and rightly
taught, these ruling and master principles, which, in
the opinion of such men as I have mentioned, have
no substantial existence, are, in truth, everything
and all in all. Magnanimity in politics is not seldom
the truest wisdom; and a great Empire and little
minds go ill together. Let us get an American
revenue, as we have got an American Empire.
English privileges have made it all that it is;

REPLY TO MR. FLOOD-GRATTAN.
It is not the slander of an evil tongue that can
defame me. I maintain my reputation in public and
in private life. No man, who has not a bad char-
acter, can ever say that I deceived. No country can
call me a cheat. But I will suppose such a public
character. I will suppose such a man to have
existence. I will begin with his character in his
political cradle, and I will follow him to the last

stage of political dissolution. I will suppose him, in
the first stage of his life, to have been intemperate;
in the second, to have been corrupt; and in the last,
seditious ;—that after an evenomed attack on the
persons and measures of a succession of viceroys,
and after much declamation against their illegalities
and their profusion, he took office, and became a
supporter of Government, when the profusion of
ministers had greatly increased and their crimes
multiplied beyond example. With regard to the lib-
erties of America, which were inseparable from
ours, I will suppose this gentleman to have been an
enemy decided and unreserved; that he voted
against her liberty, and voted, moreover, for an
address to send four thousand Irish troops to cut
the throats of the Americans; that he called these
butchers "armed negotiators," and stood with a
metaphor in his mouth and a bribe in his pocket, a
champion against the rights of America,—of Amer-
ica, the only hope of Ireland, and the only refuge of
the liberties of mankind. Thus defective in every
relationship, to constitution, commerce, and tolera-
tion, I will suppose this man to have added much
private improbity to public crimes; that his probity
was like his patriotism, and his honor on a level
with his oath. He loves to deliver panegyrics on
himself. I will interrupt him, and say:
Sir, you are much mistaken if you think that
your talents have been as great as your life has been
reprehensible. You began your parliamentary
career with an acrimony and personality which
could have been justified only by a supposition of
virtue; after a rank and clamorous opposition, you

became on a sudden silent; you were silent for seven
years; you were silent on the greatest questions, and
you were silent for money! You supported the
unparalleled profusion and jobbing of Lord Har-
court's scandalous ministry. You, Sir, who manu-
faciure stage thunder against Mr. Eden for his anti-
American principles,—you, Sir, whom it pleases to
chant a hymn to the immortal Hampden-you, Sir,
approved of the tyranny exercised against Amer-
ica,--and you, Sir, voted four thousand Irish troops
to cut the throats of the Americans fighting for their
freedom, fighting for your freedom, fighting for the
great principle, liberty! But you found, at last, that
the Court had bought, but would not trust you.
Mortified at the discovery, you try the sorry game
of a sinner in your progress to the acts of an
incendiary; and observing, with regard to prince
and people, the most impartial treachery and deser-
tion, you justify the suspicion of your Sovereign by
betraying the government as you had sold the
people. Such has been your conduct, and at such
conduct every order of your fellow-subjects have a
right to exclaim. The merchant may say to you, the
constitutionalist may say to you, the American may
say to you,—and I, I now say, and say to your beard,
Sir, you are not an honest man!

distraction admonishes them of two truths: the one,
that there is a God; the other, that there is a People!
Never was it permitted to any Nation,—they may
perplex their understandings with various apolo-
gies,—but never was it long permitted to exclude
from essential,—from what they themselves have
pronounced essential blessings,-a great portion of
themselves for a period of time; and for no reason,
or, what is worse, for such reasons as you have
advanced.
Conquerors, or tyrants proceeding from con-
querors, have scarcely ever for any length of time
governed by those partial disabilities; but a people
so to govern itself, or, rather, under the name of
government so to exclude itself,—the industrious,
the opulent, the useful,—that part that feeds you
with its industry, and supplies you with its taxes,
weaves that you may wear, and ploughs that you
may eat,—to exclude a body so useful, so numerous,
and that forever!-and, in the mean time, to tax
them ad libitum, and occasionally to pledge their
lives and fortunes!—for what?-for their disfran-
chisement!-it cannot be done! Continue it, and
you expect from your laws what it were blasphemy
to ask of your Maker. Such a policy always turns
on the inventor, and bruises him under the stroke
of the sceptre or the sword, or sinks him under
accumulations of debt and loss of dominion. Need
I go to instances ? What was the case of Ireland,
enslaved for a century, and withered and blasted
with her Protestant ascendency, like a shattered oak
scathed on its hill by the fires of its own intolerance?
What lost England America, but such a policy? An

Has your pity traversed leagues of sea to sit down

RELIGION AND MORALITY
-FROM WASHINGTON'S FAREWELL ADDRESS.
Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to
political prosperity, religion and morality are indis-
pensable supports. In vain would that man claim
the tribute of patriotism who should labor to sub-
vert these great pillars of human happiness, these
firmest props of the duties of men and citizens. The
mere politician, equally with the pious man, ought
to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not
trace all their connections with private and public
felicity. Let it simply be asked, where is the security
for property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of
religious obligation desert the oaths, which are the
instruments of investigation in courts of justice?
And let us with caution indulge the supposition that
morality can be maintained without religion. What-
ever may be conceded to the influence of refined
education on minds of peculiar structure, reason and
experience both forbid us to expect that national
morality can prevail in exclusion of religious
principle.
It is substantially true that virtue or morality is
a necessary spring of popular government. The rule,

indeed, extends with more or less force to every
species of free government. Who that is a sincere
friend to it can look with indifference upon attempts
to shake the foundation of the fabric?
REFUSAL TO RESIGN-PITT.
Can anything that I have said, Mr. Speaker, sub-
ject me to be branded with the imputation of pre-
ferring my personal situation to the public happi-
ness? Sir, I have declared, again and again. Only
prove to me that there is any reasonable hope, show
me but the most distant prospect, that my resigna-
tion will at all contribute to restore peace and happi-
ness to the country, and I will instantly resign. But,
Sir, I declare, at the same time, I will not be induced
to resign as a preliminary to negotiation. I will not
abandon this situation in order to throw myself
upon the mercy of that right honorable gentleman.
He calls me now a mere nominal minister, the mere
puppet of secret influence. Sir, it is because I will
not become a mere nominal minister of his crea-
tion,-it is because I disdain to become the puppet
of that right honorable gentleman,—that I will not
resign; neither shall his contemptuous expressions
provoke me to resignation; my own honor and repu-
tation I never will resign.
Let this House beware of suffering any indi-
vidual to involve his own cause and to interweave
his own interests in the resolutions of the House of
Commons. The dignity of the House is forever
appealed to. Let us beware that it is not the dignity
of any set of men. Let us beware that personal

prejudices have no share in deciding these great
constitutional questions. The right honorable
gentleman is possessed of those enchanting arts
whereby he can give grace to deformity. He holds
before your eyes a beautiful and delusive image; he
pushes it forward to your observation; but, as sure
as you embrace it, the pleasing vision will vanish,
and this fair phantom of liberty will be succeeded
by anarchy, confusion, and ruin to the Constitution.
For, in truth, Sir, if the constitutional independence
of the Crown is thus reduced to the very verge of
annihilation, where is the boasted equipoise of the
Constitution? Dreadful, therefore, as the conflict
is, my conscience, my duty, my fixed regard for the
Constitution of our ancestors maintain me still in
this arduous situation. It is not any proud con-
tempt or defiance of the constitutional resolutions
of this House, it is no personal point of honor, much
less is it any lust of power, that makes me still cling
to office. The situation of the times requires of me,
and, I will add, the country calls aloud to me, that I
should defend this castle; and I am determined,
therefore: I will defend it!
LIBERTY OF IRELAND-Fox.
Opinions become dangerous to a State only when
persecution makes it necessary for the people to
communicate their ideas under the bond of secrecy.
Publicity makes it impossible for artifice to succeed,
and designs of a hostile nature lose their danger by
the certainty of exposure. But it is said that these
bills will expire in a few years; that they will expire

when we shall have peace and tranquility restored
to us. What a sentiment to inculcate! You tell the
people that, when everything goes well,—when they
are happy and comfortable,—then they may meet
freely, to recognize their happiness, and pass eulo-
giums on their government; but that, in a moment
of war and calamity, of distrust and misconduct, it
is not permited to meet together; because then, in-
stead of eulogizing, they might think proper to con-
demn Ministers. What a mockery is this! What
an insult, to say that this is preserving to the people
the right of petition, to tell them that they shall
have a right to applaud, a right to rejoice, a right to
meet when they are happy; but not a right to con-
demn, not a right to deplore their misfortunes, not
a right to suggest a remedy.
Liberty is order. Liberty is strength. Look
round the world, and admire, as you must, the
instructive spectacle. You will see that liberty not
only is power and order, but that it is power and
order predominant and invincible; that it derides all
other sources of strength. And shall the prepos-
terous imagination be fostered, that men bred in
liberty, the first of human kind who asserted the
glorious distinction of forming for themselves their
social compact, can be condemned to silence upon
their rights? Is it to be conceived that men, who
have enjoyed for such a length of days the light and
happiness of freedom, can be restrained and shut
up again in the gloom of ignorance and degradation ?
As well, Sir, might you try by a miserable dam to
shut up the flowing of a rapid river. The rolling and
impetuous tide would burst through every impedi-

ment that man might throw in its way; and the only
consequence of the impotent attempt would be, that,
having collected new force by its temporary sus-
pension, enforcing itself through new channels, it
would spread devastation and ruin on every side.
The progress of liberty is like the progress of the
stream. Kept within its bounds, it is sure to fer-
tilize the country through which it runs; but no
power can arrest it in its passage. And short-
sighted, as well as wicked, must be the heart of the
projector that would strive to divert its course.
NECESSARY INNOVATIONS-HUSKISSON.
I have been charged with being the author in
some instances, and the promoter in others, of inno-
vations of a rash and dangerous nature. I deny the
charge. I dare the authors of it to the proof.
Gentlemen, when they talk of innovation, ought to
remember, with Lord Bacon, that “Time has been
and is the great innovator." Upon that innovator I
have felt it my duty cautiously to wait at a becom-
ing distance and with proper circumspection; but
not arrogantly and presumptuously to go before
him and endeavor to outstrip his course. Time has
raised these great interests, and it is the business of
a statesman to move onwards with the new combina-
tions which have grown around him. This, sir, is
the principle by which my feelings have been con-
stantly regulated during a long public life, and by
which I shall continue to be governed, so long as I
take any part in the public affairs of this country.

It is well said by the most poetical genius, perhaps,
of our own times,
"A thousand years scarce serve to form a State,
An hour may lay it in the dust."
This is the feeling which has regulated, which will
continue to regulate, my conduct. I am no advocate
for changes upon mere abstract theory. I know not,
indeed, which is the greater folly, that of resisting
all improvement because improvement implies inno-
vation, or that of referring everything to first prin-
ciples and to abstract doctrines. The business of the
practical man is to make himself acquainted with
facts, to watch events, to understand the actual
situation of affairs and the course of time and cir-
cumstances, as bearing upon the present state of
his own country and the world. These are the
grounds by a reference to which his reason and
judgment must be formed; according to which,
without losing sight of first principles, he must
know how to apply them and to temper their inflexi-
bility. This is the task of practical legislation.
THE ESTABLISHED CHURCH OF IRELAND
-MACAULAY.
Of all the institutions now existing in the civ-
ilized world, the Established Church of Ireland
seems to me the most absurd. Is there anything
else like it? Was there ever anything else like it?
The world is full of ecclesiastical establishments.
But such a portent as this Church of Ireland is no-
where to be found. Look round the continent of
Europe. Ecclesiastical establishments from the

White Sea to the Mediterranean; ecclesiastical
establishments from the Volga to the Atlantic; but
nowhere the church of a small minority enjoying
exclusive establishment. Look at America. There
you have all forms of Christianity, from Mormon-
ism-if you call Mormonism Christianity—to
Romanism. In some places you have the voluntary
system. In some you have several religions con-
nected with the State. In some you have the soli-
tary ascendency of a single church. But nowhere,
from the Arctic Circle to Cape Horn, do you find the
Church of a small minority exclusively established.
In one country alone—in Ireland alone—is to be
seen the spectacle of a community of eight millions
of human beings with a Church which is the Church
of only eight hundred thousand.
Two hundred and eighty-five years has this
Church been at work. What could have been done
for it in the way of authority, privileges, endow-
ments, which has not been done? Did any other set
of bishops and priests in the world ever receive so
much for doing so little? Nay, did any other set of
bishops and priests in the world ever receive half as
much for doing twice as much? And what have we
to show for all this lavish expenditure? What, but
the most zealous Roman Catholic population on the
face of the earth? On the great, solid mass of the
Roman Catholic population you have made no im-
pression whatever. There they are, as they were
ages ago, ten to one against the members of your
Established Church. Explain this to me. I speak
to you, the zealous Protestants on the other side of
the House. Explain this to me on Protestant prin-

ciples. If I were a Roman Catholic, I could easily
account for the phenomenon. If I were a Roman
Catholic, I should content myself with saying that
the mighty hand and the outstretched arm had been
put forth according to the promise, in defence of the
unchangeable Church; that He, who, in the old time,
turned into blessings the curses of Balaam, and
smote the host of Sennacherib, had signally con-
founded the arts and the power of heretic states-
men. But what is the Protestant to say? Is this a
miracle, that we should stand aghast at it? Not at
all. It is a result which human prudence ought to
have long ago foreseen and long ago averted. It is
the natural succession of effect to cause. A Church
exists for moral ends. A Church exists to be loved,
to be reverenced, to be heard with docility, to reign
in the understandings and hearts of men. A Church
which is abhorred is useless, or worse than useless,
and to quarter a hostile Church on a conquered
People, as you would quarter a soldiery, is, there.

FREEDOM ITS OWN DEFENDER

There is only one cure for the evils which newly-
acquired freedom produces,—and that cure is free-
dom. When a prisoner leaves his cell, he cannot
bear the light of day; he is unable to discriminate
colors, or recognize faces; but the remedy is not to
remand him into his dungeon, but to accustom him
to the rays of the sun. The blaze of truth and
liberty may at first dazzle and bewilder nations

which have become half blind in the house of bond-
age; but let them gaze on and they will soon be able
to bear it. In a few years men learn to reason; the
extreme violence of opinion subsides; hostile the-
ories correct each other; the scattered elements of
truth cease to conflict and begin to coalesce; and, at
length, a system of justice and order is educed out of
the chaos. Many politicians of our time are in the
habit of laying it down as a self-evident proposition,
that no people ought to be free till they are fit to
use their freedom. The maxim is worthy of the fool
in the old story, who resolved not to go into the
water till he had learned to swim. If men are to
wait for liberty till they become wise and good in
slavery they may, indeed, wait forever.
THE AMERICAN NAVY-COBDEN.
I sometimes quote the United States of America,
and, I think, in this matter of national defence they
set us a very good example. Does anybody dare to
attack that Nation? There is not a more formidable
Power in every sense of the word,—although you
may talk of France and Russia,—than the United
States of America; and there is not a statesman
with a head on his shoulders who does not know it;
and yet the policy of the United States has been to
keep a very small amount of armed force in exist-
ence. At the present moment they have not a line-
of-battle ship afloat, notwithstanding the vast exten-
sion of their commercial marine. Last year she re-
called the last ship-of-war from the Pacific; and I

shall be very much astonished if you see another.
The people are well employed, and her taxation is
light, which countries cannot have if they burden
themselves with the expense of these enormous
armaments.
Now, many persons appeal to the English nation
under the impression that they are a very pugna-
cious people. I am not quite sure that we are not.
I am quite sure that my opponents do not sometimes
have the advantage over me in appealing to the
ready-primed pugnacity of our fellow-countrymen.
I believe I am pugnacious myself; but what I want
is to persuade my countrymen to preserve their pug-
naciousness until somebody comes to attack them.
Be assured, if you want to be prepared for future
war, you will be better prepared in the way that the
United States is prepared: by the enormous number
of merchant ships of large tonnage constantly build-
ing; in the vast number of steamers turning out of
the building-yards at New York,—those enormous
steamers, finer than any to be found in the royal
navies of any country on the continent of Europe,
commonly extending from fifteen hundred to sixteen
hundred tons. If the spirit of America were once
aroused and her resentment excited, her mercantile
marine alone,—the growth of commerce, the result
of a low taxation, and a prosperous people,-her
mercantile marine alone would be more than a
match for any war navy that exists on the continent
of Europe.

AN APPEAL TO ARMS_PATRICK HENRY
Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in
the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes
against a painful truth, and listen to the song of
that siren, till she transforms us into beasts. Is this
the part of wise men, engaged in a great and
arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to
be of the number of those who, having eyes, see
not, and having ears, hear not, the things which
so nearly concern our temporal salvation? For my
part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am
willing to know the whole truth, to know the worst,
and to provide for it.
I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided,
and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no
way of judging of the future but by the past.
And, judging by the past, I wish to know what there
has been in the conduct of the British ministry for
the last ten years, to justify those hopes with which
gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves
and the House? Is it that insidious smile with which
our petition has been lately received ? Trust it not,
sir: it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not
yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask your-
selves how this gracious reception of our petition
comports with those warlike preparations which
cover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets
and armies necessary to a work of love and recon-
ciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to
be reconciled, that force must be called in to win
back our love?
Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the
implements of war and subjugation,—the last argu-

ments to which kings resort. I ask gentlemen, sir,
what means this martial array, if its purpose be not
to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign
any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain
any enemy in this quarter of the world, to call for
all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir,
she has none. They are meant for us; they can be
meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and
rivet upon us those chains which the British min-
istry have been so long forging. And what have we
to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we
have been trying that for the last ten years. Have
we anything new to offer upon the subject ? Nothing.
We have held the subject up in every light of which
it is capable, but it has been all in vain.
Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplica-
tion? What terms shall we find which have not
already been exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you,
sir, deceive ourselves longer. Sir, we have done
everything that could be done to avert the storm
which is now coming on. We have petitioned, we
have remonstrated, we have supplicated, we have
prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have im-
plored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical
hands of the Ministry and Parliament. Our peti-
tions have been slighted, our remonstrances have
produced additional violence and insult, our suppli-
cations have been disregarded, and we have been
spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne.
In vain, after these things, may we indulge the
fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no
longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free;
if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable

privileges for which we have been so long contend-
ing; if we mean not basely to abandon the noble
struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and
which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon
until the glorious object of our contest shall be ob-
tained, we must fight, I repeat it, sir, we must fight.

Colonies must take place, whether you will or no;
for so it is decreed by the very nature of things,
by the progressive increase of our population, the
fertility of our soil, the extent of our territory, the
industry of our countrymen, and the immensity of
the ocean which separates the two countries. And,
if this be true, as it is most true, who does not see
that the sooner it takes place, the better; that it
would be the height of folly not to seize the present
occasion, when British injustice has filled all hearts
with indignation, inspired all minds with courage,
united all opinions in one, and put arms in every
hand? And how long must we traverse three thou-
sand miles of a stormy sea, to solicit of arrogant and
insolent men either counsels or commands to regu-
late our domestic affairs? From what we have
already achieved, it is easy to presume what we shall
hereafter accomplish. Experience is the source of
sage counsels, and liberty is the mother of great
nien. Have you not seen the enemy driven from

Lexington by citizens armed and assembled in one
day? Already their most celebrated generals have
yielded in Boston to the skill of ours. Already their
seamen, repulsed from our coasts, wander over the
ocean, the sport of tempests and the prey of famine.
Let us hail the favorable omen and fight, not for
the sake of knowing on what terms we are to be the
slaves of England, but to secure to ourselves a free
existence, to found a just and independent govern-
ment.
Why do we longer delay, why still deliberate?
Let this most happy day give birth to the American
Republic. Let her arise, not to devastate and con-
quer, but to reestablish the reign of peace and of the
laws. The eyes of Europe are fixed upon us; she
demands of us a living example of freedom, that
may contrast by the felicity of the citizens with the
ever-increasing tyranny which desolates her pol-
luted shores. She invites us to prepare an asylum
where the unhappy may find solace, and the perse-
cuted repose. She entreats us to cultivate a propi-
tious soil, where that generous plant which first
sprang up and grew in England, but is now withered
by the poisonous blasts of Scottish tyranny, may re-
vive and flourish, sheltering under its salubrious
and interminable shade all the unfortunate of the
human race. This is the end presaged by so many
omens: by our first victories, by the present ardor
and union, by the flight of Howe, and the pestilence
which broke out among Dunmore's people, by the
very winds which baffled the enemy's fleets and
transports, and that terrible tempest which engulfed
seven hundred vessels upon the coasts of Newfound-

land. If we are not this day wanting in our duty to
country, the names of the American Legislators will
be placed by posterity at the side of those of Theseus,
of Lycurgus, of Romulus, of Numa, of the three
Williams of Nassau, and of all those whose memory
has been, and will be, forever dear to virtuous men
and good citizens.
GOVERNMENT BY ARISTOCRACY
--LIVINGSTON.
The gentleman, who has so copiously declaimed
against all declamation, has pointed his artillery
against the rich and great. We are told that in
every country there is a natural aristocracy, and
that this aristocracy consists of the rich and the
great. Nay, the gentleman goes further, and ranks
in this class of men the wise, the learned, and those
eminent for their talents or great virtues. Does a
man possess the confidence of his fellow-citizens for
having done them important services? He is an
aristocrat! Has he great integrity? He is an aristo-
crat! Indeed, to determine that one is an aristocrat,
we need only to be assured that he is a man of merit.
But I hope we have many such. So sensible am I
of that gentleman's talents, integrity and virtue,
that we might at once hail him the first of the
nobles, the very Prince of the Senate!
But whom, in the name of common sense, would
the gentleman have to represent us? Not the rich,
for they are sheer aristocrats. Not the learned, the
wise, the virtuous; for they are all aristocrats.
Whom then? Why, those who are not virtuous;

those who are not wise; those who are not learned.
These are the men to whom alone we can trust our
liberties. He says, further, we ought not to choose
aristocrats because the people will not have confi-
dence in them. That is to say, the people will not
have confidence in those who best deserve and most
possess their confidence. He would have his govern-
ment composed of other classes of men. Where will
he find them? Why, he must go forth into the high-
ways, and pick up the rogue and the robber. He
must go to the hedges and the ditches, and bring in
the poor, the blind, and the lame. As the gentleman
has thus settled the definition of aristocracy, I trust
that no man will think it a term of reproach;. for
who among us would not be wise? who would not
be virtuous? who would not be above want? The
truth is, in these Republican governments we know
no such ideal distinctions. We are all equally aristo-
crats. Offices, emoluments, honors, the roads to pre-
ferment and to wealth, are alike open to all.
EXTENT OF COUNTRY NO BAR TO UNION
-RANDOLPH.
Extent of country, in my conception, ought to be
no bar to the adoption of a good government. No
extent on earth seems to me too great, provided the
laws be wisely made and executed. The principles
of representation and responsibility may pervade 8
large as well as a small territory; and tyranny is as
easily introduced into a small as into a large district.
Union, Mr. Chairman, is the rock of our salvation.

depend on the union of these States. Without union,
the people of this and the other States will undergo
the unspeakable calamities which discord, faction,
turbulence, war, and bloodshed, have continually
produced in other countries. Without union, we
throw away all those blessings for which we have so
earnestly fought. Without union there is no peace,
sir, in the land.
The American spirit ought to be mixed with
American pride,—pride to see the union magnifi-
cently triumph. Let that glorious pride which once
defied the British thunder reanimate you again. Let
it not be recorded of Americans, that, after having
performed the most gallant exploits, after having
overcome the most astonishing difficulties, and after
having gained the admiration of the world by their
incomparable valor and policy, they lost their
acquired reputation, lost their national consequence
and happiness by their own indiscretion. Let no
future historian inform posterity that Americans
wanted wisdom and virtue to concur in any regular,
efficient government. Catch the present moment.
Seize it with avidity. It may be lost, never to be
regained; and if the union be lost now, I fear it will
remain so forever.

patriotic regard to the country which he loved so
well; to which he gave his youthful vigor and his
youthful energy during the perilous period of the
early Indian warfare; to which he devoted his life
in the maturity of his powers in the field; and to
which again he offered the counsels of his wisdomi
and his experience, as President of the Convention
that framed our Constitution which he guided and
directed while in the Chair of State; and for which
the last prayer of his earthly supplication was
offered up, when it came the moment for him so
well, and so grandly, and so calmly, to die. He was
the first man of the time in which he grew. His
memory is first and most sacred in our love; and
ever hereafter, till the last drop of blood shall freeze
in the last American heart, his name shall be a spell
of power and might.
Yes, Gentlemen, there is one personal, one vast
felicity, which no man can share with him. It was
the daily beauty and towering and matchless glory
of his life, which enabled him to create his country,
and, at the same time, secure an undying love and
regard from the whole American people. “The first
in the hearts of his countrymen !" Yes, first! He
has our first and niost fervent love. Undoubtedly
there were brave and wise and good men before his
day in every colony. But the American nation, as
a nation, I do not reckon to have begun before 1774.
And the first love of that young America was Wash-
ington. The first word she lisped was his name.
Her earliest breath spoke it. It still is her proud
ejaculation; and it will be the last gasp of her expir-
ing life.

Yes, others of our great men have been appre-
ciated,—many admired by all. But him we love,
him we all love. About and around him we call up
no dissentient and discordant and dissatisfied ele-
ments,—no sectional prejudice nor bias, no party,
no creed, no dogma of politics. None of these shall
assail him. Yes, when the storm of battle blows
darkest and rages highest, the memory of Wash-
ington shall nerve every American arm and cheer
every American heart. It shall relume that Prome-
thean fire, that sublime flame of patriotism, that
devoted love of country, which his words have com-
mended, which his example has consecrated.

When gazing on the great,
Where neither guilty glory glows,
Nor despicable state?—

Bequeathed the name of Washington,
To make man blush, there was but one."
BLACK HAWK TO GENERAL STREET
You have taken me prisoner with all my war-
riors. I am much grieved; for I expected, if I did
not defeat you, to hold out much longer, and give you
more trouble, before I surrendered. I tried hard to
bring you into ambush, but your last general under-
stood Indian fighting. I determined to rush on you,
and fight you face to face. I fought hard. But your
guns were well aimed. The bullets flew like birds in
the air, and whizzed by our ears like the wind

through the trees in winter. My warriors fell
around me; it began to look dismal. I saw my evil
day at hand. The sun rose dim on us in the morn-
ing, and at night it sank in a dark cloud and looked
like a ball of fire. That was the last sun that shone
on Black Hawk. His heart is dead, and no longer
beats quick in his bosom. He is now a prisoner to
the white men: they will do with him as they wish.
But he can stand torture, and is not afraid of death.
He is no coward. Black Hawk is an Indian.
He has done nothing for which an Indian ought
to be ashamed. He has fought for his countrymen
against white men who came year after year to
cheat them and take away their lands. You know
the cause of our making war. It is known to all
white men. They ought to be ashamed of it. The
white men despise the Indians and drive them from
their homes. They smile in the face of the poor
Indian, to cheat him; they shake him by the hand, to
gain his confidence, to make him drunk, and to
deceive him. We told them to let us alone and keep
away from us; but they followed on and beset our
paths, and they coiled themselves among us like the
snake. They poisoned us by their touch. We were
not safe. We lived in danger. We looked up to the
Great Spirit. We went to our father. . We were
encouraged. His great council gave us fair words
and big promises, but we gut no satisfaction. Things
were growing worse. There were no deer in the
forest. The opossum and beaver were fled. The
springs were drying up, and our squaws and
papooses without victuals to keep them from
starving.

We called a great council and built a large fire.
The spirit of our fathers arose and spoke to us to
avenge our wrongs or die. We set up the war-
whoop and dug up the tomahawk; our knives were
ready, and the heart of Black Hawk swelled high in
his bosom, when he led his warriors to battle. He
is satisfied. He will go to the world of spirits con-
tented. He has done his duty. His father will meet
him there and commend him. Black Hawk is a true
Indian, and disdains to cry like a woman. He feels
for his wife, his children, and his friends. But he
does not care for himself. He cares for the nation
and the Indians. They will suffer. He laments
their fate. Farewell, my nation! Black Hawk tried
to save you and avenge your wrongs. He drank the
blood of some of the whites. He has been taken
prisoner, and his plans are crushed. He can do no
more. He is near his end. His sun is setting, and
he will rise no more. Fareweil to Black Hawk!
LOGAN, AN INDIAN CHIEF'S, ADDRESS
I appeal to any white man to say, if ever he
entered Logan's cabin hungry, and he gave him not
meat; if ever he came cold and naked, and he
clothed him not. During the course of the last long
and bloody war, Logan remained idle in his cabin,
an advocate for peace. Such was my love for the
whites, that my countrymen pointed at me as they
passed and said, “Logan is the friend of white men."
I had even thought to have lived with you, but for
the injuries of one man. Colonel Cresap the last

the relations of Logan, not sparing even my women
and children. There runs not a drop of my blood in
the veins of any living creature. This called on me
for revenge. I have sought it. I have killed many.
I have glutted my vengeance. For my country I
rejoice at the beams of peace. But do not think that
mine is the joy of fear. Logan never felt fear.
Logan will not turn on his heel to save his life. Who
is there to mourn for Logan? Not one.
GETTYSBURGH ADDRESS-LINCOLN.
Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers
brought forth upon this continent a new nation,
conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the proposition
that all men are created free and equal. Now we
are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether
that nation, or any nation so conceived or so dedi-
cated, can long endure. We are met on a great
battlefield of that war. We have come to dedicate a
portion of that field as a final resting place for those
who here gave their lives that the nation might live.
It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do
this. But in a larger sense we cannot dedicate, we
cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow, this ground.
The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here,
have consecrated it far above our power to add or
detract. The world will little note, nor long remem-
ber, what we say here, but it can never forget what
they did here. It is for us, the living, rather to be
dedicated here to the unfinished work which they
who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.
It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great

task remaining before us, that from these honored
dead we take increased devotion to that cause for
which they gave the last full measure of devotion;
that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not
have died in vain; that this nation, under God, shall
have a new birth of freedom, and that the govern-
ment of the people, by the people, and for the people,
shall not perish from the earth.
GLORIOUS NEW ENGLAND-PRENTISS.
Glorious New England! thou art still true to thy
ancient fame and worthy of thy ancestral honors.
We, thy children, have assembled in this far distant
land to celebrate thy birthday. A thousand fond
associations throng upon us, roused by the spirit
of the hour. On thy pleasant valleys rest, like sweet
dews of morning, the gentle recollections of our
early life; around thy hills and mountains cling, like
gathering mists, the mighty memories of the revolu-
tion; and far away in the horizon of thy past gleam,
like thy own bright northern lights, the awful vir-
tues of our pilgrim sires. But while we devote this
day to the remembrance of our native land, we for-
get that not in which our happy lot is cast. We exult
in the reflection, that, though we count by thousands
the miles which separate us from our birth-place,
still our country is the same. We are no exiles meet-
ing upon the banks of a foreign river, to swell its
waters with our home-sick tears. Here floats the
same banner which rustled above our boyish heads,
except that its mighty folds are wider and its glit-
tering stars increased in number.

The sons of New England are found in every
state of the broad republic. In the East, the South,
and the unbounded West, their blood mingles freely
with every kindred current. We have but changed
our chamber in the paternal mansion: in all its
rooms we are at home, and all who inhabit it are
our brothers. To us the Union has but one domestic
hearth: its household gods are all the same. Upon
us, then, peculiarly devolves the duty of feeding the
fires upon that kindly hearth, of guarding with
pious care those sacred household gods.
We cannot do with less than the whole Union: to
us it admits of no division. In the veins of our
children flows Northern and Southern blood: how
shall it be separated? Who shall put asunder the
best affections of the heart, the noblest instincts of
our nature? We love the land of our adoption: so
do we that of our birth. Let us ever be true to both,
and always exert ourselves in maintaining the unity
of our country, the integrity of the republic.
Accursed, then, be the hand put forth to loosen
the golden cord of union! thrice accursed the traitor-
ous lips which shall propose its severance!
But no! the Union cannot be dissolved. Its for-
tunes are too brilliant to be marred; its destinies
too powerful to be resisted. Here will be their
greatest triumph, their most mighty development.
And when, a century hence, this Crescent City
shall have filled her golden horns; when within her
broad-armed port shall be gathered the products of
the industry of a hundred millions of freemen; when
galleries of art and halls of learning shall have made
classic this mart of trade; then may the sons of the

Pilgrims, still wandering from the bleak hills of the

AT THE TOMB OF WASHINGTON
-SUTHERLAND.
My Countrymen—Soldiers of 1812! Look where
we may, we Americans cannot discover a spot so
hallowed as this sacred shrine, where are garnered
up the ashes of our beloved Washington. Around
this sepulchre we therefore assemble, and most rev-
erently bow the knee in token of our admiration of
his spotless character. He was a soldier, a states-
man, and a Christian. The Almighty gave him to
America to make us free.
This is manifested in the watchings of Provi-
dence over him, as well when the Indian levelled his
rifle at his heart, and firing, failed to kill him, as
during the after-scenes in the bloody drama of the
revolution, when he was shielded from every harm.
And, still further to indicate that our future exist-
ence as a people was largely to depend upon the
father of our country, we find the course of events
so moulded as that, after leading our army to vic-
tory, he was chosen to preside over the deliberations
of the convention that framed our Constitution.
With his unequalled name to that glorious instru-
ment that binds the states together, we may con-
fidently trust that they will never be sundered.

Who can witness the holy reverence and deep
emotions of this assemblage of the descendants of
the men of '76 at this resting-place of the great and
the good without believing that every other Ameri-
can, though not present with us, bears just as
ardent a love for our country as we do ourselves?
These states will never break the links of holy
concord that hold them together, as long as this
tomb can be found by those who shall succeed us.
The lesson to be gathered from our pilgrimage
here will be long remembered. Thousands will annu-
ally follow our example, and treading in our foot-
steps, will come up hither. Every father through-
out the whole land will, at least once, repair to the
depository of the mighty dead. Nay, more, he will
bring with him his children when of proper age, and
here, in the face of heaven and these venerated
relics, pledge them to stand by the holy brotherhood
of states.
Our mission is a progressive wonder. The voice
of the first pilgrim who had landed upon our shores,
breathing liberty in its sweet tones, has been echo-
ing from that time till now over the hills and valleys,
lakes and rivers, mountains and plains of this our
almost boundless country. It has reached from the
Atlantic far, far away, even climbing that vast
rocky barrier betwixt us and the wide-spreading
Pacific.
Our language, too, is the language of freedom.
The nations that use it are either free, or on the
high-road toward the full enjoyment of freedom.

vancing march of our America, the very Eden of
the world?
We see at a glance, in our brilliant and happy
career, the most marked demonstrations that we
have a heavenly star to light up our onward course.
God in His providence has reared His Christian
standard of liberty in all parts of our territory, has
given us school-houses, and religious temples de-
voted to His service, making our people a terror to
evil-doers and a praise to them that do well.
With such a wealth of promises surrounding us
on all sides, we will not permit ourselves to be dis-
turbed about our national destiny; for we are satis-
fied that "our Union" is in the safe-keeping of a
Power that will preserve it sure and steadfast, even
as “the everlasting hills."
THE IRISH SOLDIER-CURRAN.
The present is the most awful and important
crisis that Ireland ever saw, considering the actual
state of the nation, of the empire, and of the war in
which we are engaged. As to the original motives
of the war, it is not the time to inquire into them:
they are lost in the events. If they had been as pure
as they have been represented, how much is it to
be regretted that the issue has proved only that it
is not in mortals to command success.
The armies of Europe have poured into the field
and surrounded the devoted region of France on
every side; but, far from achieving their purpose,
they have only formed an iron hoop about her,

sions, has compressed their spring into an irresis-
tible energy and forced them into coaction.
During its progress we saw the miserable objects
for whom it was undertaken consumed in nameless
thousands, in the different quarters of Europe, by
want, and misery, and despair; or expiring on the
scaffold, or perishing in the field.
We have seen the honest body of the British
manufacturer tumbled into the common grave with
the venal carcass of the Prussian hireling; we have
seen the generous Briton submit to the alliance of
servitude and venality, and submit to it in vain. The
sad vicissitudes of each successive campaign have
been marked by the defeat of our armies and tri-
umphs of our enemies and the perfidy of our allies.
What was the situation of the contending parties
at the beginning of the contest? England, with
Spain, with Austria, with Prussia, with Holland,
with Ireland on her side; while France had to count
the revolt of Toulon, the insurrection of La Vendee,
the rebellion of Lyons, and her whole eastern terri-
tory in the hands of her enemies.
How direful the present reverse! England ex-
hausted, Holland surrendered, Austria wavering,
Prussia fled, and Spain fainting in the contest;
while France, triumphant and successful, waves a
military and triumphant sceptre over an extent of
territory that stretches from the ocean and the
Rhine to the Pyrenees and the ocean.
I will not dwell upon this miserable picture; I
will only observe that, during this long succession
of disaster and defeat, Ireland alone, of all the allies

THE AGE OF WASHINGTON
-FISHER AMES.
Great generals have arisen in all ages of the
world and perhaps most in those of despotism and
darkness. In times of violence and convulsion they
rise by the force of the whirlwind, high enough to
ride in it and direct the storm.
Like meteors they glare on the black clouds with
a splendor, which, while it dazzles and terrifies,
makes nothing visible but the darkness. The fame
of heroes is, indeed, growing vulgar; they multiply
in every long war; they stand in history and thicken
in their ranks, almost as undistinguished as their
own soldiers.
But such a chief magistrate as Washington ap-
pears like the pole-star in a clear sky, to direct the
skillful statesman. His presidency will form an
epoch, and be distinguished as the age of Wash-
ington.
Like the milky way, it whitens along its allotted
portion of the hemisphere. The latest generations
of men will survey through the telescope of history
the space where so many virtues blend their rays,

LIBERTY AND GREATNESS_LEGARE.
The name of "Republic" is inscribed upon the
most imperishable monuments of the human race;
and it is probable that it will continue to be asso-
ciated, as it has been in all the past ages, with what-
ever is heroic in character, sublime in genius, and
elegant and brilliant in the cultivation of arts and
letters.
What land has ever been visited with the in-
fluences of liberty, that did not flourish like the
spring? What people has ever worshipped at her
altars, without kindling with a loftier spirit and
putting forth nobler energies?
Where she has ever acted, her deeds have been
heroic. Where she has ever spoken, her eloquence
has been triumphant and sublime.
We live under a form of government and in a
state of society to which the world has never yet
exhibited a parallel. Is it then nothing to be "free"?
How many nations, in the whole annals of human
kind, have proved themselves worthy of being so?
Is it nothing that we are Republicans ?
Were all men as enlightened, as brave, as proud
as they ought to be, would they suffer themselves to
be insulted with any other title? Is it nothing that
so many independent sovereignties should be held
together in such a confederacy as ours?
What does history teach us of the difficulty of
instituting and maintaining such a polity, and of the

glory that ought to be given to those who enjoy its
advantages in so much perfection and on so grand
a scale?
Can any thing be more striking and sublime than
the idea of an imperial Republic, spreading over an
extent of territory, more immense than the empire
of the Caesars, in the accumulated conquests of a
thousand years, without prefects, proconsuls, or
publicans, founded in the maxims of common sense,
employing within itself no arms but those of reason,
and known to its subjects only by the blessings it
bestows and perpetuates, yet capable of directing
against a foreign foe all the energies of a military
despotism,-a Republic, in which men are com-
pletely insignificant, and principles and laws exer-
cise, throughout its vast domain, a peaceful and irre-
sistible sway, blending in one divine harmony, such
various habits and conflicting opinions, and
mingling in our institutions the light of philosophy
with all that is dazzling in the associations of heroic
achievement, extended dominion, and formidable
power?
THE GREAT DISTINCTION OF A NATION

The great distinction of a nation, the only one

of improvement, which I can speak of with an

its debtor by its discoveries of truth and by an
example of virtuous freedom. Oh, save me from a

patriotism borrows its zeal from the prospect of

be one of a poor people, plain in manners, rever-
encing God, and respecting themselves, than belong
to a rich country, which knows no higher good than
riches. Earnestly do I desire for this country, that,
instead of copying Europe with an undiscerning ser-
vility, it may have a character of its own, cor-
responding to the freedom and equality of our
institutions. One Europe is enough. One Paris is
enough. How much to be desired is it, that, sepa-
rated, as we are, from the Eastern continent, by an
ocean, we should be still more widely separated by
simplicity of manners, by domestic purity, by
inward piety, by reverence for human nature, by
moral independence, by withstanding the subjection
to fashion and that debilitating sensuality, which
characterize the most civilized portions of the Old

World. Of this country I may say, with peculiar
emphasis, that its happiness is bound up in its
virtue.
WALPOLE'S DEFENSE
On a motion to dismiss him from his Majesty's council.
It has been observed, Mr. Speaker, by several
gentlemen in vindication of this motion, that, if it
should be carried, neither my life, liberty nor estate
will be affected. But do the honorable gentlemen
consider my character and reputation as of no
moment? Is it no imputation to be arraigned before
this House, in which I have sat forty years, and to
have my name transmitted to posterity with dis-
grace and infamy? I will not conceal my sentiments,
that to be named in Parliament as a subject of
inquiry, is to me a matter of great concern; but I
have the satisfaction, at the same time, to reflect
that the impression to be made depends upon the
consistency of the charge and the motives of the
prosecutors. Had the charge been reduced to spe-
cific allegations, I should have felt myself called
upon for a specific defence. Had I served a weak or
wicked master and implicitly obeyed his dictates,
obedience to his commands must have been my only
justification. But, as it has been my good fortune
to serve a master who wants no bad ministers, and
would have hearkened to none, my defence must rest
on my own conduct. The consciousness of innocence
is sufficient support against my present prosecutors.
Survey and examine the individuals who usually
support the measures of Government, and those who

are in opposition. Let us see to whose side the
balance preponderates. Look round both Houses,
and see to which side the balance of virtue and
talents preponderates. Are all these on one side,
and not on the other? Or are all these to be counter-
balanced by an affected claim to the exclusive title
of patriotism? Gentlemen have talked a great deal
about patriotism. A venerable word, when duly
practiced! But I am sorry to say that of late it has
been so much hackneyed about, that it is in danger
of falling into disgrace. The very idea of true
patriotism is lost, and the term has been prostituted
to the very worst of purposes. A patriot, sir! Why,
patriots spring up like mushrooms! I could raise
fifty of them within the four-and-twenty hours. I
have raised many of them in one night. It is but
refusing to gratify an unreasonable or an insolent
demand, and up starts a patriot. I have never been
afraid of making patriots; but I disdain and despise
all their efforts. This pretended virtue proceeds
from personal malice and from disappointed ambi-
tion. There is not a man amongst them whose par-
ticular aim I am not able to ascertain, and from
what motive he has entered into the lists of
opposition.
RELIEF FOR FAMISHING IRELAND
--PRENTISS.
We have assembled, not to respond to shouts of
triumph from the West, but to answer the cry of
want and suffering which comes from the East. The
Old World stretches out her arms to the New. The
starving parent supplicates the young and vigorous

child for bread. There lies, upon the other side of
the wide Atlantic, a beautiful island, famous in
story and in song. Its area is not so great as that of .
the State of Louisiana, while its population is almost
half that of the Union. It has given to the world
more than its share of genius and of greatness. It
has been prolific in statesinen, warriors, and poets.
Its brave and generous sons have fought success-
fully all battles but their own. In wit and humor it
has no equal, while its harp, like its history, moves
to tears by its sweet but melancholy pathos. Into
this fair region God has seen fit to send the most
terrible of all those fearful ministers who fulfil his
inscrutable decrees. The earth has failed to give
her increase; the common mother has forgotten her
offspring, and her breast no longer affords them
their accustomed nourishment. Famine, gaunt and
ghastly famine, has seized a nation in its strangling
grasp; and unhappy Ireland, in the sad woes of the
present, forgets for a moment the gloomy history of
the past.
O! it is terrible, in this beautiful world, which
the good God has given us, and in which there is
plenty for us all, that men should die of starvation.
You, who see, each day, poured into the lap of your
city food sufficient to assuage the hunger of a na-
tion, can form but an imperfect idea of the horrors
of famine. In battle, in the fulness of his pride and
strength, little recks the soldier whether the hissing
bullet sings his sudden requiem or the cords of life
are severed by the sharp steel. But he who dies
of hunger wrestles alone, day after day, with his
grim and unrelenting enemy. The blood recedes,

the flesh deserts, the muscles relax, and the sinews
grow powerless. At last, the mind, which at first
had bravely nerved itself for the contest, gives way
under the mysterious influences which govern its
union with the body. Then he begins to doubt the
existence of an overruling Providence; he hates his
fellow-men, and glares upon them with the longings
of a cannibal, and, it may be, dies blaspheming.
Who will hesitate to give his mite to avert such
awful results ? Surely not the citizens of New
Orleans, ever famed for deeds of benevolence and
charity. Freely have your hearts and purses opened
heretofore to the call of suffering humanity. Nobly
did you respond to oppressed Greece and to
struggling Poland. Within Erin's borders is an
enemy more cruel than the Turk, more tyrannical
than the Russian. Bread is the only weapon that
can conquer him. Let us, then, load ships with this
glorious munition, and, in the name of our common
humanity, wage war against this despot Famine.
Let us, in God's name, “cast our bread upon the
waters," and if we are selfish enough to desire it
back again, we may recollect the promise, that it
shall return to us after many days.
OUR OBLIGATIONS TO THE SAILOR
--MONTFORD.
Oh, the difference between sea and land! The
sailor lives a life of daily, hourly, momentary risk,
and he reckons it by voyages. He goes on your
errands, he dares dangers for you, he lives a strange
life for you. Think of what the winter is at sea.

STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
Think of what it is to have the waves discharge
themselves on a ship, with a roar like artillery and a
force not much less. Think of what it is for a sailor
to be aloft in the rigging, holding on by a rope, wet
with the rain, or numbed with the cold, and with
the mast of the ship swaying with the wind like a
reed. Think of what it is when men drop from the
yard-arms into the sea, or when they are washed
from the deck like insects. Think of what it is, day
and night, without rest and without sleep, to strive
against a storm, against the might of wind and
waves, every wave a mighty enemy to surmount.
Think what it is to strike on a rock, to shriek but
once, and then, perhaps, be drowned. Think of the
diseases that come of hardships at sea. Think of
what it is to be sick in a lazaretto, to lie dying in a
foreign hospital. Think of all this, and then, per-
haps, you will think rightly of what it is to be a
sailor.
Think of what you yourselves owe to the sailor.
It is through his intervention that you are possessed
of those comforts that make of a house a home.
Live comfortably you cannot, live at all, perhaps,
you cannot, without seamen will expose themselves
for you, risk themselves for you, and, alas! often,
very often, drown,-drown in your service,-drown,
and leave widows and orphans destitute. O! what
a consideration it is, that so often my happiness is
from suffering somewhere. My salvation is from a
death upon a cross. The church I worship in has
every one of its pillars deep founded in a martyr's
grave. The philosophy that delights me for its truth
is what some wise man had first to learn in bitter-

ness. My comforts are mine, many of them, through
other men's miseries. Commerce spreads the world
about me with blessings, but not without there being
shipwrecks from it on every coast, and deaths by
drowning, several every day the year round.
Ah! yes; to beg with me, to plead with me, for
the widow and orphan of the mariner, there comes
from many a place where seamen have died a call,
a prayer, a beseeching voice; a cry from the coast
of Guinea, where there is fever evermore; a cry
from Arctic seas, where icebergs are death; a cry
from coral reefs, that ships are wrecked on hor-
ribly; a cry from many a foreign city, where the
sailor, as he dies, speaks of his family and is not
understood; a cry from mid-ocean, where many a
sailor drops into a sudden grave. They ask your
help, your charity, for the widows and the orphans
of those who in times past have gone down to the
sea,-have gone down to the sea in ships.
A POLITICAL PAUSE-Fox.
Says the honorable gentleman: “But we must
pause!” What! must the bowels of Great Britain be
torn out, her best blood be spilt, her treasures
wasted, that you may make an experiment? Put
yourselves, oh, that you would put yourselves on the
field of battle, and learn to judge of the sort of
horrors that you excite.
In former wars a man might at least have some
feeling, some interest, that served to balance in his
mind the impressions which a scene of carnage and

of death must inflict. But if a man were present
now at the field of slaughter, and were to inquire
for what they were fighting, "fighting !" would be
the answer, "they are not fighting, they are
pausing."
“Why is that man expiring? Why is that other
writhing with agony? What means this implacable
fury?” The answer must be: "You are quite wrong,
sir; you deceive yourself; they are not fighting; do
not disturb them; they are merely pausing. This
man is not expiring with agony; that man is not
dead; he is only pausing.
“Lord help you, sir, they are not angry with one
another; they have now no cause of quarrel; but
their country thinks that there should be a pause.
All that you see, sir, is nothing like fighting; there is
no harm, nor cruelty, nor blood-shed in it whatever;
it is nothing more than a political pause. It is
merely to try an experiment, to see whether Bona-
parte will not behave himself better than hereto-
fore; and in the mean time we have agreed to a
pause in pure friendship.”
And is this the way, sir, that you are to show
yourselves the advocates of order? You take up a
system calculated to uncivilize the world, to destroy
order, to trample on religion, to stifle in the heart,
not merely the generosity of noble sentiment, but
the affections of social nature; and in the prosecu-
tion of this system you spread terror and devasta-
tion all around you.

THE PATRIOTS COURAGE-CLAY.
There is a sort of courage which, I frankly con-
fess it, I do not possess, a boldness to which I dare
not aspire, a valor which I cannot covet. I cannot
lay myself down in the way of the welfare and
happiness of my country. That I cannot, I have not
the courage to do.
I cannot interpose the power with which I may
be invested, a power conferred, not for my personal
benefit, nor for my aggrandizement, but for my
country's good, to check her onward march to great-
ness and glory. I have not courage enough, I am
too cowardly for that.
I would not, I dare not, in the exercise of such
a trust, lie down, and place my body across the path
that leads my country to prosperity and happiness.
This is a sort of courage widely different from that
which a man may display in his private conduct and
personal relations.
Personal or private courage is totally distinct
from that higher and nobler courage which prompts
the patriot to offer himself a voluntary sacrifice to
his country's good. Apprehensions of the imputa-
tion of the want of firmness sometimes impel us to
perform rash and inconsiderate acts. It is the
greatest courage to be able to bear the imputation
of the want of courage.
But pride, vanity, egotism, so unamiable and
offensive in private life, are vices which partake of
the character of crimes in the conduct of public
affairs. The unfortunate victim of these passions
cannot see beyond the little, petty, contemptible

circle of his own personal interests. All his thoughts
are withdrawn from his country, and concentrated
on his consistency, his firmness, himself.
The high, the exalted, the sublime emotions of a
patriotism which, soaring towards heaven, rises far
above all mean, low, or selfish things, and is ab-
sorbed by one soul-transporting thought of the good
and the glory of one's country, are never felt in his
impenetrable bosom.
That patriotism which, catching its inspirations
from the immortal God, and leaving at an immeasur-
able distance below all lesser, grovelling, personal
interests and feelings, animates and prompts to
deeds of self-sacrifice, of valor, of devotion, and of
death itself—that is public virtue; that is the
noblest, the sublimest of all public virtues.
TO THE ARMY OF ITALY
-NAPOLEON BONAPARTE.
Soldiers! You have precipitated yourselves like
a torrent from the Apennines. You have over-
whelmed or swept before you all that opposed your
march. Piedmont, delivered from Austrian oppres-
sion, has returned to her natural sentiments of
peace and friendship towards France. Milan is
yours; and over all Lombardy floats the flag of the
Republic. To your generosity only do the Dukes of
Parma and of Modena now owe their political
existence. The army which proudly threatened you
finds no remaining barrier of defence against your
courage. The Po, the Tessin, the Adda, could not
stop you a single day. Those vaunted ramparts of

Italy proved insufficient: you traversed them as
rapidly as you did the Apennines. Successes as
numerous and brilliant have carried joy to the heart
of your country. Your representatives have decreed
a festival, to be celebrated in all the communes of
the Republic, in honor of your victories. There will
your fathers, mothers, wives, sisters, all who hold
you dear, rejoice over your triumphs, and boast that
you belong to them.
Yes, soldiers, you have done much; but much
still remains for you to do. Shall it be said of us
that we knew how to conquer, but not to profit by
victory? Shall posterity reproach us for having
found a Capua in Lombardy? Nay, fellow-soldiers !
I see you already eager to cry “to arms!” Inaction
fatigues you; and days lost to glory are to you days
lost to happiness. Let us, then, begone! We have
yet inany forced marches to make, enemies to van-
quish, laurels to gather, and injuries to avenge. Let
those who have sharpened the poniards of civil war
in France, who have pusillanimously assassinated
our Ministers, who have burned our vessels at
Toulon, let them now tremble! The hour of ven-
geance has knolled.
But let not the people he disquieted. We are the
friends of every people, and more especially of the
dscendants of the Brutuses, the Scipios, and other
great men to whom we look as bright exemplars. To
reestablish the Capitol; to place there with honor
the statues of the heroes who made it memorable,
—such will be some of the fruits of our victories.
They will constitute an epoch for posterity. To you,
soldiers, will belong the immortal honor of redeem-

people, free and respected by the whole world, shall
give to Europe a glorious peace, which shall indem-
nify it for all the sacrifices which it has borne the
last six years. Then, by your own firesides you shall
repose; and your fellow-citizens, when they point
out any one of you, shall say: "He belonged to the
army of Italy."
REPLY TO WALPOLE-WILLIAM PITT.
Sir, the atrocious crime of being a young man,
which the honorable gentleman has, with such spirit
and decency, charged upon me, I shall neither
attempt to palliate nor dery, but content myself
with wishing that I may be one of those whose
follies may cease with their youth, and not of that
number who are ignorant in spite of experience.
Whether youth can be imputed to any man as a
reproach, I will not, sir, assume the province of
determining, but surely age may become justly con-
temptible, if the opportunities which it brings have
passed away without improvement, and vice appears
to prevail when the passions have subsided. The
wretch who, after having seen the consequences of
a thousand errors, continues still to blunder, and
whose age has only added obstinacy to stupidity, is
surely the object of either abhorrence or contempt,
and deserves not that his gray hairs should secure
him from insult. Much more, sir, is he to be
abhorred, who, as he has advanced in age, has
receded from virtue, and becomes more wicked with
less temptation, who prostitutes himself for money

63
which he cannot enjoy, and spends the remains of
his life in the ruin of his country.
But youth, sir, is not my only crime. I have
been accused of acting a theatrical part. A the-
atrical part may either imply some peculiarities of
gesture, or a dissimulation of my real sentiments,
and an adoption of the opinions and language of
another man. In the first sense, sir, the charge is
too trifling to be confuted, and deserves only to be
mentioned to be despised. I am at liberty, like every
other man, to use my own language, and though,
perhaps, I may have some ambition to please this
gentleman, I shall not lay myself under any
restraint, nor very solicitously copy his diction or
his mien, however matured by age or modelled by
experience. If any man shall, by charging me with
theatrical behavior, imply that I utter any senti-
ments but my own, I shall treat him as a calum-
niator and a villain; nor shall any protection shelter
him from the treatment he deserves. I shall on such
an occasion without scruple trample upon all those
forms with which wealth and dignity intrench them-
selves, nor shall anything but age restrain my
resentment,-age which always brings one privi-
lege, that of being insolent and supercilious without
punishment. But with regard, sir, to those whom
I have offended, I am of opinion that, if I had acted
a borrowed part, I should have avoided their cen-
sure. The heat that offended them is the ardor of
conviction, and that zeal for the service of my
country which neither hope nor fear shall influence
me to suppress. I will not sit unconcerned while my
liberty is invaded, nor look in silence upon public

hazard to repel the aggressor, and drag the thief to

REPLY TO MR. GRENVILLE
-WILLIAM PITT
Sir, a charge is brought against gentlemen sit-
ting in this. House of giving birth to sedition in
America. Several have spoken their sentiments
with freedom against this unhappy act, and that
freedom has become their crime. Sorry I am to hear
the liberty of speech in this House imputed as a
crime; but the imputation shall not discourage me.
The gentleman tells us, America is obstinate;
America is almost in open rebellion. I rejoice that
America has resisted. Three millions of people so
dead to all the feelings of liberty as voluntarily to
let themselves be made slaves would have been fit
instruments to make slaves of all the rest. I come
not here armed at all points with law cases and acts
of Parliament, with the statute-book doubled down
in dogs' ears, to defend the cause of liberty. I would
not debate a particular point of law with the gentle-
man.
I know his abilities. But, for the defence of
liberty, upon a general principle, upon a Constitu-
tional principle, it is a ground on which I stand
firm, on which I dare meet any man.
The gentleman boasts of his bounties to Amer-
ica. Are not those bounties intended finally for the
benefit of this Kingdom? If they are not, he has
misapplied the national treasures. He asks, when

were the Colonies emancipated? I desire to know
when they were made slaves. But I dwell not upon
words. I will be bold to affirm that the profits of
Great Britain from the trade of the Colonies
through all its branches are two millions a year.
This is the fund that carried you triumphantly
through the last war. This is the price America
pays for her protection. And shall a miserable
financier come with a boast that he can fetch a
pepper-corn into the exchequer, by the loss of mil-
lions to the Nation?
A great deal has been said without doors of the
power, of the strength, of America. It is a topic
that ought to be cautiously meddled with. In a good
cause, the force of this country can crush America
to atoms. I know the valor of your troops; I know
the skill of your officers. But on this ground, on
the Stamp Act, when so many here will think it a
crying injustice, I am one who will lift up my hands
against it. In such a cause even your success would
be hazardous. America, if she fell, would fall like
the strong man. She would embrace the pillars of
the State, and pull down the constitution along with
her. Is this your boasted peace? To sheathe the
sword, not in its scabbard, but in the bowels of your
countrymen? Will you quarrel with yourselves
while the whole House of Bourbon is united against
you? While France disturbs your fisheries in New-
foundland, embarrasses your slave-trade to Africa,
and withholds from your subjects in Canada their
property stipulated by treaty? While the ransom
for the Manillas is denied by Spain? The Americans
have been wronged. They have been driven to mad-

ness by injustice. Will you punish them for the
madness you have occasioned? Rather let prudence
and temper come first from this side. I will under-
take for America that she will follow the example.
“Be to her faults a little blind;
Be to her virtues very kind."
Let the Stamp Act be repealed; and let the reason
for the repeal, because the Act was founded on an
erroneous principle, be assigned. Let it be repealed
absolutely, totally, and immediately.
AMERICA UNCONQUERABLE
-LORD CHATHAM,
This, my Lords, is a perilous and tremendous
moment. It is no time for adulation. The smooth-
ness of flattery cannot save us in this rugged and
awful crisis. It is now necessary to instruct the
Throne in the language of truth. We must, if pos-
sible, dispel the delusion and darkness which en-
velop it, and display, in its full danger and genuine
colors, the ruin which is brought to our doors. Can
Ministers still presume to expect support in their
infatuation? Can Parliament be so dead to its dig-
nity and duty as to be thus deluded into the loss of
the one and the violation of the other, as to give an
unlimited support to measures which have heaped
disgrace and misfortune upon us, measures which
have reduced this late flourishing empire to ruin and
contempt?
But yesterday, and England might have stood
against the world: now, none so poor to do her
reverence. France, my Lords, has insulted you.

She has encouraged and sustained America; and,
whether America be wrong or right, the dignity of
this country ought to spurn at the officious insult of
French interference. Can even our Ministers sus-
tain a more humiliating disgrace? Do they dare to
resent it? Do they presume even to hint a vindica-
tion of their honor and the dignity of the State, by
requiring the dismissal of the plenipotentiaries of
America ? The people, whom they affected to call
contemptible rebels, but whose growing power has
at last obtained the name of enemies, the people with
whom they have engaged this country in war, and
against whom they now command our implicit sup-
port in every measure of desperate hostility,—this
people, despised as rebels, or acknowledged as
enemies, are abetted against you, supplied with
every military store, their interests consulted, and
their ambassadors entertained, by your inveterate
enemy, and our Ministers dare not interpose with
dignity or effect.
My Lords, this ruinous and ignominious situa-
tion, where we cannot act with success nor suffer
with honor, calls upon us to remonstrate in the
strongest and loudest language of truth, to rescue
the ear of Majesty from the delusions which sur-
round it. You cannot, I venture to say, you cannot
conquer America. What is your present situation
there? We do not know the worst; but we know
that in three campaigns we have done nothing and
suffered much. You may swell every expense, and
strain every effort, still more extravagantly; accu-
mulate every assistance you can beg or borrow;
traffic and barter with every little pitiful German

Prince, that sells and sends his subjects to the
shambles of a foreign country: your efforts are for-
ever vain and impotent, doubly so from this mer-
cenary aid on which you rely; for it irritates to an
incurable resentment the minds of your enemies, to
overrun them with the sordid sons of rapine and of
plunder, devoting them and their possessions to the
rapacity of hireling cruelty. If I were an American,

The honorable member has asked: “And now
will these Americans, children planted by our care,
nourished up by our indulgence, and protected by
our arms, will they grudge to contribute their
mite?” They planted by your care!
No, your
oppressions planted them in America. They fled
from your tyranny to a then uncultivated and inhos-
pitable country, where they exposed themselves to
almost all the hardships to which human nature is
liable; and, among others, to the cruelties of a sav-
age foe the most subtle, and I will take upon me to
say the most formidable, of any people upon the face
of God's earth; and yet, actuated by principles of
true English liberty, our American brethren met all
hardships with pleasure, compared with those they
suffered in their own country from the hands of
those that should have been their friends.
They nourished up by your indulgence! They
grew by your neglect of them. As soon as you began

to care about them, that care was exercised in send-
ing persons to rule them in one department and
another, who were, perhaps, the deputies of deputies
to some members of this House, sent to spy out their
liberties, to misrepresent their actions, and to prey
upon them; men whose behavior on many occasions
has caused the blood of those sons of liberty to recoil
within them; men promoted to the highest seats of
justice, some who, to my knowledge, were glad by
going to a foreign country to escape being brought
to the bar of a court of justice in their own.
They protected by your arms! They have nobly
taken up arms in your defence; have exerted a valor
amidst their constant and laborious industry for the
defense of a country whose frontier was drenched
in blood, while its interior parts yielded all its little
savings to your emolument. And, believe me,-re-
member I this day told you so,—that same spirit of
freedom which actuated that people at first will
accompany them still; but prudence forbids me to
explain myself further. God knows I do not at this
time speak from motives of party heat. What I
deliver are the genuine sentiments of my heart.
However superior to me in general knowledge and
experience the respectable body of this House may
be, yet I claim to know more of America than most
of you, having seen and been conversant in that
country. The people, I believe, are as truly loyal as
any subjects the king has; but they are a people
jealous of their liberties, and who will vindicate
them to the last drop of their blood, if they should
ever be violated.

THE COLONISTS NOT REBELS.
-WILKES.
Mr. Speaker! The Address to the King upon the
disturbances in North America now reported from
the Committee of the whole House appears to be
unfounded, rash, and sanguinary. It draws the
sword unjustly against America. It mentions, sir,
the particular province of Massachusetts Bay as in
a state of actual rebellion. The other provinces are
held out to our indignation as aiding and abetting.
Arguments have been employed to involve them in
all the consequences of an open, declared rebellion,
and to obtain the fullest orders for our officers and
troops to act against them as rebels. Whether their
present state is that of rebellion, or of a fit and just
resistance to unlawful acts of power,-resistance to
our attempts to rob them of their property and
liberties, as they imagine, I shall not declare. This
I know, a successful resistance is a revolution, not a
rebellion. Rebellion indeed appears on the back of
a flying enemy: but revolution flames on the breast-
plate of the victorious warrior. Who can tell, sir,
whether in consequence of this day's violent and
mad Address to his Majesty the scabbard may not
be thrown away by them as well as by us; and,
should success attend them, whether in a few years
the independent Americans may not celebrate the
glorious era of the Revolution of 1775, as we do
that of 1688?
The policy, sir, of this measure I can no more
comprehend than I can acknowledge the justice of
it. Is your force adequate to the attempt? I am
satisfied it is not. Boston, indeed, you may lay in
ashes, or it may be made a strong garrison; but the

province will be lost to you. Boston will be like
Gibraltar. You will hold in the province of Massa-
chusetts Bay, as you do in Spain, a single town,
while the whole country remains in the power and
possession of the enemy. Where your fleets and
armies are stationed, the possession will be secured,
while they continue; but all the rest will be lost. In
the great scale of empire you will decline, I fear,
from the decision of this day; and the Americans
will rise to independence, to power, to all the great-
ness of the most renowned states. For they build
on the solid basis of general public liberty.
I tremble, sir, at the almost certain consequences
of such an Address, founded in cruelty and injus-
tice, equally contrary to the sound maxims of true
policy, and the unerring rule of natural right. The
Americans will certainly defend their property and
their liberties with the spirit which our ancestors
exerted, and which, I hope, we should exert on a
like occasion. They will sooner declare themselves
independent, and risk every consequence of such a
contest, than submit to the galling yoke which
Administration is preparing for them. An Address
of this sanguinary nature cannot fail of driving
them to despair. They will see that you are pre-
paring, not only to draw the sword, but to burn the
scabbard. In the most harsh manner you are de-
claring them rebels. Every idea of a reconciliation
will now vanish. They will pursue the most vigorous
course in their own defence. The whole continent
of North America will be dismembered from Great
Britain, and the wide arch of the raised empire will
fall. But may the just vengeance of the people

overtake the authors of these pernicious counsels.
May the loss of the first province of the empire be
speedily followed by the loss of the heads of those
Ministers who have persisted in these wicked, these
fatal, these most disastrous measures.
THE WAR WITH AMERICA-WILKES.
Sir, it ill becomes the duty and dignity of Parlia-
ment to lose itself in such a fulsome, adulatory Ad-
dress to the Throne as that now proposed. We ought
rather, sir, to approach it with sound and whole-
some advice, and even with remonstrances, against
the Ministers who have precipitated the nation into
an unjust, ruinous, murderous, and felonious war.
I call the war with our brethren in America an
unjust and felonious war, because the primary
cause and confessed origin of it is to attempt to take
their money from them without their consent, con-
trary to the common rights of all mankind, and those
great fundamental principles of the English Con-
stitution for which Hampden bled. I assert, sir,
that it is a murderous war, because it is an effort to
deprive men of their lives for standing up in the
defence of their property and their clear rights.
Such a war, I fear, sir, will draw down the ven-
geance of heaven on this devoted kingdom. Sir, is
any Minister weak enough to flatter himself with
the conquest of the Americans? You cannot, with
all your allies, with all the mercenary ruffians of the
North, you cannot effect so wicked a purpose. The
Americans will dispute every inch of territory with

you, every narrow pass, every strong defile, every
Thermopylæ, every Bunker's Hill. More than half
the empire is already lost, and almost all the rest is
in confusion and anarchy. We have appealed to the
sword; and what have we gained? Bunker's Hill
only, and that with the loss of twelve hundred men.
Are we to pay as dear for the rest of America ? The
idea of the conquest of that immense country is as
romantic as unjust.
The honorable gentleman who moved this Ad-
dress says, “The Americans have been treated with
lenity.” Will facts justify the assertion? Was your
Boston Port Bill a measure of lenity? Was your
Fishery Bill a measure of lenity? Was your Bill for
taking away the charter of Massachusetts Bay a
measure of lenity, or even of justice? I omit your
many other gross provocations and insults by which
the brave Americans have been driven to their
present state. Sir, I disapprove, not only the evil
spirit of this whole Address, but likewise the
wretched adulation of almost every part of it. My
wish and hope, therefore, i3, that it will be rejected
by this House; and that another, dutiful yet decent,
manly Address, will be presented to his Majesty,
praying that he would sheathe the sword, prevent
the further effusion of the blood of our fellow-
subjects, and adopt some mode of negotiation with
the general Congress, in compliance with their
repeated petition, thereby restoring peace and har-
mony to this distracted Empire.

RESENTING THE DUKE OF GRAFTON'S
ADDRESS_LORD THURLOW
Referring to the speech, from which the following is an extract, Butler
says: "It was my good fortune to hear this celebrated reply to the Duke
of Grafton who reproached Lord Thurlow with his plebeian extraction
and his recent admission into the Peerage. His Lordship had spoken too
often, and began to be heard with a civil but visible impatience, and,
under these circumstances he was attacked in the manner we have men-
tioned. Lord Thurlow rose from the Woolsack, and advanced slowly to
the place from which the Chancellor generally addresses the House of
Lords, and then, fixing on the duke the look of Jove when he has grasped
the thunder, he said in a level tone of voice) 'I am amazed at the attack
which the noble duke has made on me.' Then raising his voice,-- Yes, my
lords, I am amazed,' etc."
I am amazed at the attack which the noble Duke
has made on me. Yes, my Lords, I am amazed at
his Grace's speech. The noble Duke cannot look
before him, behind him, or on either side of him,
without seeing some noble Peer who owes his seat
in this House to his successful exertions in the pro-
fession to which I belong. Does he not feel that it is
as honorable to owe it to these, as to being the acci-
dent of an accident? To all these noble Lords the
language of the noble Duke is as applicable, and as
insulting, as it is to myself. But I do not fear to
meet it single and alone.
No one venerates the peerage more than I do;
but, my Lords, I must say that the peerage solicited
me, not I the peerage. Nay more, I can say and will
say, that, as a Peer of Parliament, as Speaker of
this right honorable House, as keeper of the great
seal, as guardian of his Majesty's conscience, as
Lord High Chancellor of England, nay, even in that
character alone in which the noble Duke would think
it an affront to be considered, but which character
none can deny me,—as a man, I am, at this moment,
as respectable, I beg leave to add, I am as much

upon.
UNJUST TAXATION OF AMERICA-BURKE.
Could anything be a subject of more just alarm
to America, than to see you go out of the plain high
road of finance, and give up your most certain
revenues and your clearest interests, merely for the
sake of insulting your Colonies ? No man ever
doubted that the commodity of tea could bear an
imposition of three-pence. But no commodity will
bear three-pence, or will bear a penny, when the
general feelings of men are irritated, and two mil-
lions of men are resolved not to pay. The feelings
of the Colonies were formerly the feelings of Great
Britain. Theirs were formerly the feelings of Mr.
Hampden, when called upon for the payment of
twenty shillings. Would twenty shillings have
ruined Mr. Hampden's fortune? No! but the pay.
ment of half twenty shillings, on the principle it was
demanded, would have made him a slave. It is the
weight of that preamble, of which you are so fond,
and not the weight of the duty, that the Americans
are unable and unwilling to bear. You are, there-
fore, at this moment, in the awkward situation of
fighting for a phantom, a quiddity, a thing that
wants, not only a substance but even a name; for a
thing which is neither abstract right nor profitable
enjoyment.
They tell you, sir, that your dignity is tied to it.
I know not how it happens, but this dignity of yours
is a terrible incumbrance to you; for it has of late

been ever at war with your interest, your equity, and
every idea of your policy. Show the thing you con-
tend for to be reason, show it to be common sense,
show it to be the means of obtaining some useful
end, and then I am content to allow it what dignity
you please. But what dignity is derived from the
perseverance in absurdity, is more than I ever could
discern. Let us, sir, embrace some system or other
before we end this session. Do you mean to tax
America, and to draw a productive revenue from
thence? If you do, speak cut; name, fix, ascertain
this revenue; settle its quantity; define its objects;
provide for its collection; and then fight, when you
have something to fight for. If you murder, rob; if
you kill, take possession: and do not appear in the
character of madmen, as well as assassins,—violent,
vindictive, bloody and tyrannical, without an object.
But may better counsels guide you !
PROSECUTION OF WARREN HASTINGS
-BURKE,
My Lords, I do not mean now to go further than
just to remind your Lordships of this, that Mr.
Hastings' government was one whole system of
oppression, of robbery of individuals, of spoliation
of the public, and of supersession of the whole sys-
tem of the English Government, in order to vest in
the worst of the natives all the power that could
possibly exist in any government; in order to defeat
the ends which all governments ought in common to
have in view. In the name of the Commons of
England, I charge all this villainy upon Warren

Hastings in this last moment of my application
to you.
My Lords, what is it that we want here, to a
great act of national justice? Do we want a cause,
my Lords? You have the cause of oppressed princes,
of undone women of the first rank, of desolated
provinces, and of wasted kingdoms.
Do you want a criminal, my Lords? When was
there so much iniquity ever laid to the charge of
any one? No, my Lords, you must not look to punish
any other such delinquent from India. Warren
Hastings has not left substance enough in India to
nourish such another delinquent.
My Lords, is it a prosecutor you want? You
have before you the Commons of Great Britain as
prosecutors; and I believe, my Lords, that the sun,
in his beneficent progress round the world, does not
behold a more glorious sight than that of men, sepa-
rated from a remote people by the material bounds
and barriers of nature, united by the bond of a social
and moral community,—all the Com
Commons of
England resenting, as their own, the indignities and
cruelties that are offered to all the people of India.
Do we want a tribunal? My Lords, no example
of antiquity, nothing in the modern world, nothing
in the range of human imagination, can supply us
with a tribunal like this. We commit safely the
interests of India and humanity into your hands.
Therefore, it is with confidence that, ordered by the
Commons,
I impeach Warren Hastings, Esquire, of high
crimes and misdemeanors.

I impeach him in the name of the Commons of
Great Britain in Parliament assembled, whose Par
liamentary trust he has betrayed.
I impeach him in the name of all the Commons
of Great Britain, whose national character he has
dishonored.
I impeach him in the name of the people of India,
whose laws, rights, and liberties, he has subverted;
whose properties he has destroyed; whose country
he has laid waste and desolate.
I impeach him in the name and by virtue of those
eternal laws of justice which he has violated.
I impeach him in the name of human nature
itself, which he has cruelly outraged, injured and
oppressed, in both sexes, in every age, rank, situa-
tion, and condition of life.
REPLY TO MR. CORRY-GRATTAN.
Has the gentleman done? Has he completely
done? He was unparliamentary from the beginning
to the end of his speech. There was scarce a word
that he uttered that was not a violation of the privi-
leges of the House. But I did not call him to order.
Why? Because the limited talents of some men
render it impossible for them to be severe without
being unparliamentary. But before I sit down I
shall show him how to be severe and parliamentary
at the same time. On any other occasion I should
think myself justifiable in treating with silent con-
tempt anything which might fall from that honor-
able member; but there are times when the insig-

nificance of the accuser is lost in the magnitude of
the accusation. I know the difficulty the honorable
gentleman labored under when he attacked me, con-
scious that on a comparative view of our characters,
public and private, there is nothing he could say
which would injure me. The public would not be-
lieve the charge. I despise the falsehood. If such
a charge were made by an honest man, I would
answer it in the manner I shall do before I sit down.
But I shall first reply to it when not made by an
honest man. The right honorable gentleman has
called me "an unimpeached traitor." I ask, why not
"traitor," unqualified by any epithet? I will tell
him: it was because he dare not. It was the act of a
coward who raises his arm to strike, but has not
courage to give the blow. I will not call him villain,
because it would be unparliamentary, and he is a
privy councillor. I will not call him fool, because
he happens to be Chancellor of the Exchequer. But
I say he is one who has abused the privilege of Par-
liament and freedom of debate, to the uttering of
language, which, if spoken out of the House, I should
answer only with a blow. I care not how high his
situation, how low his character, how contemptible
his speech; whether a privy councillor or a parasite,
my answer would be a blow. He has charged me
with being connected with the rebels. The charge
is utterly, totally, and meanly false. Does the honor-
able gentleman rely on the report of the House of
Lords for the foundation of his assertion? If he
does, I can prove to the committee there was a
physical impossibility of that report being true. But
I scorn to answer any man for my conduct, whether

he be a political coxcomb, or whether he brought
himself into power by a false glare of courage
or not.
I have returned, not, as the right honorable
member has said, to raise another storm. I have
returned to discharge an honorable debt of grati-
tude to my country, that conferred a great reward
for past services, which, I am proud to say, was not
greater than my desert. I have returned to protect
that Constitution, of which I was the parent and
the founder, from the assassination of such men as
the honorable gentleman and his unworthy asso-
ciates. They are corrupt; they are seditious; and
they, at this very moment, are in a conspiracy
against their country. I have returned to refute a
libel, as false as it is malicious, given to the public
under the appellation of a report of the committee
of the Lords. Here I stand for impeachment or
trial. I dare accusation. I defy the honorable
gentleman. I defy the Government. I defy their
whole phalanx. Let them come forth! I tell the
ministers I shall neither give them quarter nor take
it. I am here to lay the shattered remains of my
constitution on the floor of this House, in defence of
the liberties of my country.
THE AMERICAN WAR-Fox.
We are charged with expressing joy at the tri-
umphs of America. True it is that in a former ses-
sion I proclaimed it as my sincere opinion, that if
the Ministry had succeeded in their first scheme on
the liberties of America, the liberties of this coun-

try would have been at an end. Thinking this, as I
did, in the sincerity of an honest heart, I rejoiced at
the resistance which the Ministry had met to their
attempt. That great and glorious statesman, the
late Earl of Chatham, feeling for the liberties of his
native country, thanked God that America had
resisted. But, it seems, “all the calamities of the
country are to be ascribed to the wishes, and the joy,
and the speeches of Opposition.” Oh, miserable and
unfortunate Ministry! Oh, blind and incapable men,
whose measures are framed with so little foresight,
and executed with so little firmness, that they not
only crumble to pieces, but bring on the ruin of their
country, merely because one rash, weak, or wicked
man in the House of Commons makes a speech
against them.
But who is he who arraigns gentlemen on this
side of the House with causing by their inflam-
matory speeches the misfortunes of their country?
The accusation comes from one whose inflammatory
harangues have led the nation, step by step, from
violence to violence in that inhuman, unfeeling sys-
tem of blood and massacre, which every honest man
must detest, which every good man must abhor, and
every wise man condemn. And this man imputes
the guilt of such measures to those who had all along
foretold the consequences; who had prayed, en-
treated and supplicated, not only for America, but
for the credit of the nation and its eventual welfare,
to arrest the hand of Power, meditating slaughter,
and directed by injustice.
What was the consequence of the sanguinary
measures recommended in those bloody, inflamma-

tory speeches? Though Boston was to be starved,
though Hancock and Adams were proscribed, yet at
the feet of these very men the Parliament of Great
Britain was obliged to kneel, flatter, and cringe;
and, as it had the cruelty at one time to denounce
vengeance against these men, so it had the meanness
afterwards to implore their forgiveness. Shall he
who called the Americans, “Hancock and his crew,”
shall he presume to reprehend any set of men for
inflammatory speeches? It is this accursed Ameri-
can war that has led us, step by step, into all our
present misfortunes and national disgraces. What
was the cause of our wasting forty millions of
money and sixty thousand lives? The American
war. What was it that produced the French rescript
and a French war? The American war. What was
it that produced the Spanish manifesto and Spanish
war? The American war. What was it that armed
forty-two thousand men in Ireland with the argu-
ments carried on the points of forty thousand
bayonets? The American war. For what are we
about to incur an additional debt of twelve or four-
teen millions ? This accursed, cruel, diabolical
American war.
RELIGION AND GOVERNMENT
GRATTAN,
Let us reflect on the necessary limits of all
human legislation. No legislature has a right to
make partial laws; it has no right to make arbitrary
laws,--I mean laws contrary to reason. Neither
has it a right to institute any inquisition into men's

SELECTIONS FOR BEGINNERS' COURSE
83
thoughts, nor to punish any man merely for his
religion. It can have no power to make a religion
for men, since that would be to dethrone the
Almighty. I presume it will not be arrogated on the
part of the British Legislature, that his Majesty, by
and with the advice of the Lords spiritual and tem-
poral, etc., can enact that he will appoint and con-
stitute a new religion for the people of this empire;
or that, by an order in Council, the consciences and
creeds of his subjects might be suspended. Nor will
it be contended, I apprehend, that any authoritative
or legislative measure could alter the law of the
hypothenuse. Whatever belongs to the authority of
God or to the laws of nature is necessarily beyond
the province and sphere of human institution and
government. The Roman Catholic, when you dis-
qualify him on the ground of his religion, may with
great justice tell you that you are not his God, that
he cannot mould or fashion his faith by your de-
crees. When once man goes out of his sphere, and
says he will legislate for God, he would, in fact,
make himself God.
But this I do not charge upon the Parliament,
because in none of the penal acts has the Parliament
imposed a religious creed. The qualifying oath as
to the great number of offices and as to seats in
parliaments scrupulously evades religious distinc-
tions. A dissenter of any class may take it. A
deist, an atheist, may likewise take it. The Catholics
are alone excepted; and for what reason? If a deist
be fit to sit in Parliament, it can hardly be urged
that a Christian is unfit. If an atheist be competent
to legislate for his country, surely this privilege can-

84
STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
not be denied to the believer in the divinity of our
Saviour. If it be contended that, to support the
Church, it is expedient to continue these disabilities,
I dissent from that opinion. If it could, indeed, be
proved, I should say that you had acted in defiance
of all the principles of human justice and freedom,
in having taken away their Church from the Irish,
in order to establish your own; and in afterwards
attempting to secure that establishment by dis-
qualifying the people and compelling them at the
same time to pay for its support. This is to fly
directly in the face of the plainest canons of the
Almighty. For the benefit of eleven hundred to dis-
qualify four or five millions, is the insolent effort of
bigotry, not the benignant precept of Christianity;
and all this, not for the preservation of their prop-
erty,—for that was secured,—but for bigotry, for
intolerance, for avarice, for a vile, abominable, ille-
gitimate, and atrocious usurpation. The laws of
God cry out against it; the laws of England, and the
spirit and principles of its Constitution, cry out
against such a system.
DEFENSE OF CATHOLICS-GRATTAN.
Whenever one sect degrades another on account
of religion, such degradation is the tyranny of a
sect. When you enact that, on account of his re-
ligion, no Catholic shall sit in Parliament, you do
what amounts to the tyranny of a sect. When you
enact that no Catholic shail be a sheriff, you do what
amounts to the tyranny of a sect. When you enact
that no Catholic shall be a general, you do what

SELECTIONS FOR BEGINNERS' COURSE
85
amounts to the tyranny of a sect. There are two
descriptions of laws: the municipal law, which
binds the people, and the law of God, which binds
the Parliament and the people. Whenever you do
any act which is contrary to His laws, as expressed
in His work, which is the world, or in His book, the
Bible, you exceed your right; whenever you rest any
of your establishments on that excess, you rest it on
a foundation which is weak and fallacious; when-
ever you attempt to establish your government, or
your property, or your Church, on religious restric-
tions, you establish them on that false foundation,
and you oppose the Almighty; and though you had
a host of mitres on your side, you banish God from
your ecclesiastical Constitution, and freedom from
your political. In vain shall men endeavor to make
this the cause of the Church: they aggravate the
crime by the endeavor to make their God their
fellow in the injustice. Such rights are the rights
of ambition; they are the rights of conquest; and,
in your case, they have been the rights of suicide.
They begin by attacking liberty; they end by the
loss of empire.
POLITICAL DISHONESTY-SHERIDAN.
Is this a time for selfish intrigues and the little
dirty traffic for lucre and emolument? Does it suit
the honor of a gentleman to ask at such a moment?
Does it become the honesty of a minister to grant?
What! In such an hour as this, at a moment preg-
nant with the national fate, when, pressing as the
exigency may be, the hard task of squeezing the

money from the pockets of an impoverished people,
from the toil, the drudgery of the shivering poor,
must make the most practiced collector's heart ache
while he tears it from them, can it be that people of
high rank, and professing high principles,—that
they or their families should seek to thrive on the
spoils of misery, and fatten on the bread wrested
from industrious poverty? O, shame! shame! Is
it intended to confirm the pernicious doctrine so
industriously propagated, that all public men are
impostors, and that every politician has his price?
Or, even where there is no principle in the bosom,
why does not prudence hint to the mercenary and
the vain to abstain a while, at least, and wait the
fitting of the times? Improvident impatience! Nay,
even from those who seem to have no direct object
of office or profit, what is the language which their
actions speak?
“The Throne is in danger! We will support the
Throne; but let us share the smiles of royalty !"
"The order of nobility is in danger! I will fight for
nobility," says the Viscount; "but—my zeal would
be greater if I were made an Earl!” “Rouse all the
Marquis within me," exclaims the Earl, "and the
Peerage never turned forth a more undaunted cham-
pion in its cause than I shall prove!" "Stain my
green ribbon blue," cries out the illustrious Knight,
"and the fountain of honor will have a fast and
faithful servant!”
What are the people to think of our sincerity ?
What credit are they to give to our professions? Is
this system to be persevered in? Is there nothing
that whispers to that right honorable gentleman

that the crisis is too big, that the times are too
gigantic, to be ruled by the little hackneyed and
every-day means of ordinary corruption? Or, are
we to believe that he has within himself a conscious
feeling that disqualifies him from rebuking the ill-
timed selfishness of his new allies ? Let him take
care that the corruptions of the government shall
not have lost it the public heart; that the example of
selfishness in the few has not extinguished public
spirit in the many.
POLITICAL EQUALITY OF ROMAN CATHOLICS
-CURRAN.
Gentlemen say the Catholics have got everything
but seats in Parliament. Are we really afraid of
giving them that privilege? Are we seriously afraid
that Catholic venality might pollute the immaculate
integrity of the House of Commons ? That a Cath-
olic member would be more accessible to a promise,
or a pension, or a bribe than a Protestant? Lay your
hands upon your hearts, look in one another's faces,
and say, "yes," and I will vote against the amend-
ment. But is it the fact that they have everything?
Is it the fact that they have the common benefit of
the Constitution or the common protection of
the law?
Another gentleman has said, the Catholics have
got much, and ought to be content. Why have they
got that much? Is it from the minister? Is it from
the Parliament, which threw their petition over its
bar? No; they got it by the great revolution of
human affairs, by the astonishing march of the

human mind,-a march that has collected too much
momentum in its advance to be now stopped in its
progress. The bark is still afloat; it is freighted
with the hopes and liberties of millions of men; she
is already under way; the rower may faint or the
wind may sleep, but, rely upon it, she has already
acquired an energy of advancement that will sup-
port her course and bring her to her destination;
rely upon it, whether much or little remains, it is
now vain to withhold it; rely upon it, you may as
well stamp your foot upon the earth, in order to
prevent its revolution. You cannot stop it. You
will only remain a silly gnome upon its surface, to
measure the rapidity of rotation, until you are
forced round and buried in the shade of that body
whose irresistible course you would endeavor to
oppose.
MEN ABOVE MEASURES-CANNING.
If I am pushed to the wall and forced to speak my
opinion, I have no disguise nor reservation: I do
think that this is a time when the administration of
the government ought to be in the ablest and fittest
hands; I do not think the hands in which it is now
placed answer to that description. I do not pretend
to conceal in what quarter I think that fitness most
eminently resides; I do not subscribe to the doc-
trines which have been advanced, that, in times like
the present, the fitness of individuals for their
political situation is no part of the consideration to
which a member of Parliament may fairly turn his
attention. I know not a more solemn or important

duty that a member of Parliament can have to dis-
charge, than by giving at fit seasons a free opinion
upon the character and qualities of public men.
Away with the cant of "measures, not men!",—the
idle supposition that it is the harness, and not the
horses, that draw the chariot along. No, sir, if the
comparison must be made, if the distinction must
be taken, men are everything, measures compara-
tively nothing. I speak, sir, of times of difficulty
and danger; of times when systems are shaken,
when precedents and general rules of conduct fail.
Then it is, that not to this or that measure, however
prudently devised, however blameless in execution,
but to the energy and character of individuals, a
State must be indebted for its salvation. Then
Then it is
that kingdoms rise or fall in proportion as they are
upheld, not by well-meant endeavors (laudable
though they may be), but by commanding, over-
awing talents,-by able men.
And what is the nature of the times in which
we live? Look at France, and see what we have to
cope with, and consider what has made her what she
is. A man! You will tell me that she was great,
and powerful, and formidable, before the days of
Bonaparte's government; that he found in her great
physical and moral resources; that he had but to
turn them to account. True, and he did so. Com-
pare the situation in which he found France with
that to which he has raised her. I am no panegyrist
of Bonaparte; but I cannot shut my eye to the
superiority of his talents, to the amazing ascendency
of his genius. Tell me not of his measures and his
policy. It is his genius, his character, that keeps

the world in awe. Sir, to meet, to check, to curb,
to stand up against him, we want arms of the same
kind. I am far from objecting to the large military
establishments which are proposed to you. I vote
for them with all my heart. But, for the purpose of
coping with Bonaparte, one great, commanding
spirit is worth them all.
RELIGIOUS LIBERTY-O'CONNELL
Can anything be more absurd and untenable
than the argument of the learned gentleman, when
you see it stripped of the false coloring he has given
to it? First, he alleges that the Catholics are at-
tached to their religion with a bigoted zeal. I admit
the zeal, but I utterly deny the bigotry. He pro-
ceeds to insist that these feelings on our part justify
the apprehensions of Protestants. The Catholics,
he says, are alarmed for their Church: why should
not the Protestants be alarmed, also, for theirs ?
The Catholic desires safety for his religion: why
should not the Protestant require security for his?
Hence he concludes, that, merely because the Cath-
olic desires to keep his religion free, the Protestant
is thereby justified in seeking to enslave it. He says
that our anxiety for the preservation of our Church
vindicates those who deem the proposed arrange-
ment necessary for the protection of theirs;—a
mode of reasoning perfectly true and perfectly
applicable, if we sought any interference with or
control over the Protestant Church,-if we asked or
required that a single Catholic should be consulted

upon the management of the Protestant Church, or
of its revenues or privileges.
But the fact does not bear him out; for we do not
seek nor desire, nor would we accept of, any kind
of interference with the Protestant Church. We
disclaim and disavow any kind of control over it.
We ask not, nor would we allow, any Catholic
authority over the mode of appointment of their
clergy. Nay, we are quite content to be excluded
forever from even advising his Majesty with re-
spect to any matter relating to or concerning the
Protestant Church, its rights, its properties, or its
privileges. I will, for my own part, go much fur-
ther, and I do declare most solemnly that I would
feel and express equal, if not stronger repugnance,
to the interference of a Catholic with the Protestant
Church, than I have expressed and do feel to any
Protestant interference with ours. In opposing their
interference with us, I content myself with the mere
war of words. But, if the case were reversed, if
the Catholic sought this control over the religion of
the Protestant, the Protestant should command my
heart, my tongue, my arm, in opposition to so unjust
and insulting a measure. So help me God! I would
in that case not only feel for the Protestant and
speak for him, but I would fight for him, and cheer-
fully sacrifice my life in defence of the great prin-
ciple for which I have ever contended,—the prin-
ciple of universal and complete religious liberty.

IRISH DISTURBANCE BILL -O'CONNELL
I do not rise to fawn or cringe to this House. I
do not rise to supplicate you to be merciful toward
the nation to which I belong,--toward a nation
which, though subject to England, yet is distinct
from it. It is a distinct nation: it has been treated
as such by this country, as may be proved by history
and by seven hundred years of tyranny. I call upon
this House, as you value the liberty of England, not
to allow the present nefarious bill to pass. In it are
involved the liberties of England, the liberty of the
press, and of every other institution dear to
Englishmen. Against the bill I protest, in the name
of the Irish people, and in the face of heaven. I
treat with scorn the puny and pitiful assertions, that
grievances are not to be complained of, that our
redress is not to be agitated; for in such cases
remonstrances cannot be too strong, agitation can-
not be too violent, to show to the world with what
injustice our fair claims are met, and under what
tyranny the people suffer.
The clause which does away with trial by jury,
—what, in the name of heaven, is it, if it is not the
establishment of a revolutionary tribunal? It drives
the judge from his bench; it does away with that
which is more sacred than the Throne itself,—that
for which your king reigns, your lords deliberate,
your commons assemble. If ever I doubted before
of the success of our agitation for repeal, this bill,
this infamous bill, the way in which it has been
received by the House; the manner in which its
opponents have been treated; the personalities to

which they have been subjected; the yells with
which one of them has this night been greeted,—all
these things dissipate my doubts, and tell me of its
complete and early triumph. Do you think those
yells will be forgotten? Do you suppose their echo
will not reach the plains of my injured and insulted
country; that they will not be whispered in her
green valleys, and heard from her lofty hills ? O,
they will be heard there! Yes, and they will not be
forgotten. The youth of Ireland will bound with
indignation. They will say: "We are eight millions;
and you treat us thus, as though we were no more
to your country than the isle of Guernsey or of
Jersey !”
I have done my duty. I stand acquitted to my
conscience and my country. I have opposed this
measure throughout; and I now protest against it,
as harsh, oppressive, uncalled for, unjust; as estab-
lishing an infamous precedent, by retaliating crime
against crime; as tyrannous, cruelly and vindic-
tively tyrannous.
NATIONAL INDEPENDENCE-OTIS.
England may as well dam up the waters of the
Nile with bulrushes as fetter the step of Freedom,
more proud and firm in this youthful land than
where she treads the sequestered glens of Scotland
or couches herself among the magnificent mountains
of Switzerland. Arbitrary principles, like those
against which we now contend, have cost one King
of England his life; another, his crown; and they
may yet cost a third his most flourishing colonies.

We are two millions, one-fifth fighting men. We
are bold and vigorous, and we call no man master.
To the nation from whom we are proud to derive
our origin we ever were, and we ever will be, ready
to yield unforced assistance; but it must not, and
it never can be, extorted. Some have sneeringly
asked, "Are the Americans too poor to pay a few
pounds on stamped paper ?" No! America, thanks
to God and herself, is rich. But the right to take
ten pounds implies the right to take a thousand;
and what must be the wealth that avarice, aided
by power, cannot exhaust? True, the spectre is
now small; but the shadow he casts before him is
huge enough to darken all this fair land. Others
in sentimental style talk of the immense debt of
gratitude which we owe to England. And what
is the amount of this debt? Why, truly, it is the
same that the young lion owes to the dam, which
has brought it forth on the solitude of the moun-
tain, or left it amid the winds and storms of the
desert.
We plunged into the wave with the great charter
of freedom in our teeth, because the fagot and
torch were behind us. We have waked this new
world from its savage lethargy; forests have been
prostrated in our path; towns and cities have grown
up suddenly as the flowers of the tropics and the
fires in our autumnal woods are scarcely more
rapid than the increase of our wealth and popula-
tion. And do we owe all this to the kind succor of
the mother country? No! we owe it to the tyranny
that drove us from her,-to the pelting storms
which invigorated our helpless infancy.

But perhaps others will say, "We ask no money
from your gratitude, we only demand that you
should pay your own expenses.” And who, I pray,
is to judge of their necessity? Why, the King!
And, with all due reverence to his sacred majesty,
he understands the real wants of his distant sub-
jects as little as he does the language of the
Choctaws! Who is to judge concerning the fre-
quency of these demands? The Ministry. Who is
to judge whether the money is properly expended ?
The Cabinet behind the Throne. In every instance
those who take are to judge for those who pay.
If this system is suffered to go into operation, we
shall have reason to esteem it a great privilege that
rain and dew do not depend upon Parliament; other-
wise, they would soon be taxed and dried. But,
thanks to God, there is freedom enough left upon
earth to resist such monstrous injustice. The flame
of liberty is extinguished in Greece and Rome, but
the light of its glowing embers is still bright and
strong on the shores of America. Actuated by its
sacred influence, we will resist unto death. But we
will not countenance anarchy and misrule. The
wrongs that desperate community have heaped upon
their enemies shall be amply and speedily repaired.
Still, it may be well for some proud men to remem-
ber that a fire is lighted in these Colonies which one
breath of their King may kindle into such fury that
the blood of all England cannot extinguish it.

SUPPOSED SPEECH OF JOHN ADAMS
-WEBSTER.
Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I
give my hand and my heart to this vote. It is true,
indeed, that in the beginning we aimed not at in-
dependence. But there is a Divinity which shapes
our ends. The injustice of England has driven us
to arms; and, blinded to her own interest for our
good, she has obstinately persisted, till independence
is now within our grasp. We have but to reach
forth to it, and it is ours. Why, then, should we
defer the Declaration? Is any man so weak as now
to hope for a reconciliation with England, which
shall leave either safety to the country and its
liberties, or safety to his own life and his own
honor? Are not you, sir, who sit in that chair, is
not he, our venerable colleague near you, are not
both already the proscribed and predestined ob-
jects of punishment and of vengeance? Cut off
from all hope of royal clemency, what are you, what
can you be, while the power of England remains,
but outlaws ?
If we postpone independence, do we mean to
carry on or give up the war? Do we mean to sub-
mit to the measures of Parliament- Boston port-
bill and all ? Do we mean to submit, and consent
that we ourselves shall be ground to powder, and
our country and its rights trodden down in the
dust? I know we do not mean to submit. We never
shall submit. Do we intend to violate that most
solemn obligation ever entered into by men, that
plighting before God of our sacred honor to Wash-
ington, when, putting him forth to incur the dan-

gers of war, as well as the political hazards of the
times, we promised to adhere to him in every ex-
tremity with our fortunes and our lives?
I know there is not a man here who would not
rather see a general conflagration sweep over the
land, or an earthquake sink it, than one jot or tittle
of that plighted faith fall to the ground. For my-
self, having twelve months ago in this place moved
you that George Washington be appointed com-
mander of the forces raised or to be raised for de-
fence of American liberty, may my right hand for-
get this cunning, and my tongue cleave to the roof
of my mouth, if I hesitate or waver in the support
I give him! The war, then, must go on. We must
fight it through.
And if the war must go on, why put off longer
the Declaration of Independence? That measure
will strengthen us. It will give us character
abroad. The nations will then treat with us, which
they never can do while we acknowledge ourselves
subjects in arms against our sovereign. Nay, I
maintain that England herself will sooner treat for
peace with us on the footing of independence, than
consent, by repealing her acts, to acknowledge that
her whole conduct towards us has been a course of
injustice and oppression. Her pride will be less
wounded by submitting to that course of things
which now predestinates our independence, than
by yielding the points in controversy to her re-
bellious subjects. The former she would regard
as the result of fortune; the latter she would feel
as her own deep disgrace. Why, then, sir, do we
not as soon as possible change this from a civil to

a national war? And since we must fight it
through, why not put ourselves in a state to enjoy
all the benefits of victory, if we gain the victory?
If we fail, it can be no worse for us. But we shall
not fail.
The cause will raise up armies: the cause will
create navies. The people,—the people, if we are
true to them, will carry us, and will carry them-
selves, gloriously through this struggle. I care not
how fickle other people have been found. I know the
people of these colonies; and I know that resistance
to British aggression is deep and settled in their
hearts, and cannot be eradicated. Every colony,
indeed, has expressed its willingness to follow, if
we but take the lead. Sir, the Declaration will in-
spire the people with increased courage. Instead
of a long and bloody war for restoration of privi-
leges, for redress of grievances, for chartered im-
munities, held under a British king, set before them
the glorious object of entire independence, and it
will breathe into them anew the breath of life.
Read this Declaration at the head of the army:
every sword will be drawn from its scabbard, and
the solemn vow uttered, to maintain it, or to perish
on the bed of honor. Publish it from the pulpit:
religion will approve it, and the love of religious
liberty will cling round it, resolved to stand with
it, or fall with it. Send it to the public halls; pro-
claim it there; let them hear it who heard the first
roar of the enemy's cannon; let them see it who
saw their brothers and their sons fall on the field
of Bunker Hill, and in the streets of Lexington and

Concord: and the very walls will cry out in its
support.
Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs;
but I see clearly through this day's business. You
and I, indeed, may rue it. We may not live to see
the time when this Declaration shall be made good.
We may die,—die colonists; die slaves; die, it may
be, ignominiously and on the scaffold. Be it so!
Be it so! If it be the pleasure of heaven that my
country shall require the poor offering of my life,
the victim shall be ready at the appointed hour of
sacrifice, come when that hour may. But, while I
do live, let me have a country, or, at least, the
hope of a country, and that a free country.
But, whatever may be our fate, be assured that
this Declaration will stand. It may cost treasure,
and it may cost blood; but it will stand, and it will
richly compensate for both. Through the thick
gloom of the present I see the brightness of the
future as the sun in heaven. We shall make this
a glorious, an immortal day. When we are in our
graves, our children will honor it. They will cele-
brate it with thanksgiving, with festivity, with bon-
fires, and illuminations. On its annual return, they
will shed tears,-copious, gushing tears,—not of
subjection and slavery, not of agony and distress,
but of exultation, of gratitude, and of joy. Sir, be-
fore God, I believe the hour is come. My judgment
approves this measure, and my whole heart is in it.
All that I have, and all that I am, and all that I
hope in this life, I'm now ready here to stake upon
it; and I leave off, as I began, that, live or die, sur-
vive or perish, I am for the Declaration. It is my

INVIOLABILITY OF TREATIES
-FISHER AMES.
We are either to execute this treaty or break
our faith. To expatiate on the value of public faith
may pass with some men for declamation. To such
men I have nothing to say. To others I will urge,
can any circumstance mark upon a people more
turpitude and debasement? Can anything tend more
to make men think themselves mean, or to degrade
to a lower point their estimation of virtue and their
standard of action? It would not merely demoralize
mankind, it tends to break all the ligaments of
society, to dissolve that mysterious charm which
attracts individuals to the nation, and to inspire in
its stead a repulsive sense of shame and disgust.
What is patriotism? Is it a narrow affection for
the spot where a man was born? Are the very
clods where we tread entitled to this ardent prefer-
ence, because they are greener? No, sir; this is not
the character of the virtue. It soars higher for its
object. It is an extended self-love, mingling with
all the enjoyments of life, and twisting itself with
the minutest filaments of the heart. It is thus we
obey the laws of society, because they are the laws
of virtue. In their authority we see, not the array
of force and terror, but the venerable image of our
country's honor. Every good citizezn makes that
honor his own, and cherishes it, not only as precious,

but as sacred. He is willing to risk his life in its
defense, and is conscious that he gains protection
while he gives it; for what rights of a citizen will
be deemed inviolable, when a State renounces the
principles that constitute their security ? Or, if his
life should not be invaded, what would its enjoy-
ments be in a country odious in the eye of strangers
and dishonored in his own? Could he look with
affection and veneration to such a country, as his
parent? The sense of having one would die within
him: he would blush for his patriotism, if he re-
tained any, and justly, for it would be a vice. He
would be a banished man in his native land. I see no
exception to the respect that is paid among nations
to the law of good faith. It is the philosophy of
politics, the religion of governments. It is observed
by barbarians. A whiff of tobacco-smoke, or a string
of beads, gives not merely binding force, but
sanctity, to treaties. Even in Algiers a truce may
be bought for money; but, when ratified, even
Algiers is too wise, or too just, to disown and annul
its obligation.
DEFENSE OF RIGHT BY ARMS -MORRIS.
Sir, I wish for peace; I wish the negotiation may
succeed; and, therefore, I strongly urge you to
adopt these resolutions. But, though you should
adopt them, they alone will not insure success. I
have no hesitation in saying that you ought to have
taken possession of New Orleans and the Floridas,
the instant your treaty was violated. You ought
to do it now. Your rights are invaded; confidence

in negotiation is vain: there is, therefore, no alter-
native but force. You are exposed to imminent
present danger; you have the prospect of great
future advantage; you are justified by the clearest
principles of right; you are urged by the strongest
motives of policy; you are commanded by every
sentiment of national dignity. Look at the conduct
of America in her infant years. When there was
no actual invasion of right but only a claim to invade,
she resisted the claim, she spurned the insult. Did
we then hesitate? Did we then wait for foreign
alliance ? No; animated with the spirit, warmed
with the soul of freedom, we threw our oaths of
allegiance in the face of our sovereign, and com-
mitted our fortunes and our fate to the God of bat-
tles. We then were subjects. We had not then
attained to the dignity of an independent republic.
We then had no rank among the nations of the
earth. But we had the spirit which deserved that
elevated station. And, now that we have gained it,
shall we fall from our honor?
Sir, I repeat to you, that I wish for peace,-
real, lasting, honorable peace. To obtain and secure
this blessing, let us by a bold and decisive conduct
convince the Powers of Europe that we are deter-
mined to defend our rights; that we will not submit
to insult, that we will not bear degradation. This
is the conduct which becomes a generous people.
This conduct will command the respect of the world.
Nay, sir, it may rouse all Europe to a proper sense
of their situation.

INVASION OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES
-CLINTON.
If I were called upon to prescribe a course of
policy most important for this country to pursue, it
would be to avoid European connections and wars.
The time must arrive when we will have to contend
with some of the great powers of Europe; but let
that period be put off as long as possible. It is our
interest and our duty to cultivate peace, with sin-
cerity and good faith. As a young nation, pursu-
ing industry in every channel, and adventuring
commerce in every sea, it is highly important that
we should not only have a pacific character, but
that we should really deserve it. If we manifest an
unwarrantable ambition and a rage for conquest,
we unite all the great powers of Europe against us.
The security of all the European possessions in our
vicinity will eternally depend, not upon
strength, but upon our moderation and justice.
Look at the Canadas; at the Spanish territories to
the South, at the British, Spanish, French, Danish
and Dutch West India Islands; at the vast countries
to the West, as far as where the Pacific rolls its
waves.
Consider well the eventful consequences
that would result, if we were possessed by a spirit
of conquest. Consider well the impression which a
manifestation of that spirit will make upon those
who would be affected by it.

kind? Will not the nations of Europe perceive in
this conduct the germ of a loftier spirit and an
enterprising ambition, which will level them to the
earth, when age has matured our strength and
expanded our powers of annoyance, unless they
combine to cripple us in our infancy? May not the
consequences be, that we must look out for a naval
force to protect our commerce? that a close alliance
will result? that we will be thrown at once into the
ocean of European politics, where every wave that
rolls and every wind that blows, will agitate our
bark? Is this a desirable state of things? Will the
people of this country be seduced into it by all the
colorings of rhetoric and all the arts of sophistry,
by vehement appeals to their pride, and artful
addresses to their cupidity? No, sir! Three-fourths
of the American people—I assert it boldly and with-
out fear of contradiction-are opposed to this
measure. And would you take up arms with a mill-
stone hanging round your neck? How would you
bear up, not only against the force of the enemy,
but against the irresistible current of public opin-
ion? The thing, sir, is impossible; the measure is
worse than madness; it is wicked beyond the powers
of description.

cial nation. But it has been asked in debate, “Will
not Massachusetts, the cradle of liberty, submit to
such privations ?" An embargo liberty was never
cradled in Massachusetts. Our liberty was not so
much a mountain nymph as a sea nymph. She was
free as air. She could swim, or she could run. The
ocean was her cradle. Our fathers met her as she
came like the goddess of beauty from the waves.
They caught her as she was sporting on the beach.
They courted her while she was spreading her nets
upon the rocks. But an embargo liberty, a hand-
cuffed liberty, liberty in fetters, a liberty traversing
between the four sides of a prison and beating her
head against the walls, is none of our offspring. We
abjure the monster. Its parentage is all inland.
Is embargo independence? Deceive not your-
selves. It is palpable submission. Gentlemen ex-
claim, “Great Britain smites us on one cheek!” And
what does Administration? “It turns the other,
also." Gentlemen say, "Great Britain is a robber;
she takes our cloak.” And what says Administra-
tion? “Let her take our coat, also.” France and
Great Britain require you to relinquish a part of
your commerce, and you yield it entirely. At every
corner of this great city we meet some gentlemen of
the majority wringing their hands and exclaiming:
“What shall we do? Nothing but an embargo will
save us. Remove it and what shall we do?" Sir, it
is not for me, an humble and uninfluential individ-
ual, at an awful distance from the predominant
influences, to suggest plans of government. But, to
my eye, the path of our duty is as distinct as the
Milky Way,—all studded with living sapphires,

glowing with accumulating light. It is the path of
active preparation, of dignified energy. It is the
path of 1776. It consists not in abandoning our
rights, but in supporting them, as they exist and
where they exist, on the ocean as well as on the
land. But I shall be told, “This may lead to war.”
I ask, “Are we now at peace ?" Certainly not, unless
retiring from insult be peace; unless shrinking
under the lash be peace. The surest way to prevent
war is not to fear it. The idea that nothing on
earth is so dreadful as war is inculcated too stu-
diously among us. Disgrace is worse. Abandon-
ment of essential rights is worse.

legitimacy is suspended over the world, save only
one bright spot, which breaks out from the political

and gladden, the human heart. Obscure that by the
downfall of liberty here, and all mankind are en-
shrouded in a pall of universal darkness. To you,

mitting unimpaired to posterity the fair character

this high trust by trampling, or suffering to be
trampled down, law, justice, the Constitution, and
the rights of the people by exhibiting examples of
inhumanity, and cruelty, and ambition? When the
minions of despotism heard in Europe of the seizure
of Pensacola, how did they chuckle and chide the
admirers of our institutions, tauntingly pointing to
the demonstration of a spirit of injustice and
aggrandizement made by our country in the midst of
an amicable negotiation. Behold, said they, the con-
duct of those who are constantly reproaching kings.
You saw how those admirers were astounded and
hung their heads. You saw, too, when that illus-
trious man who presides over us adopted his pacific,
moderate, and just course, how they once more lifted
up their heads with exultation and delight beaming
in their countenances. And you saw how those
minions themselves were finally compelled to unite
in the general praises bestowed upon our govern-
ment. Beware how you forfeit this exalted char-
acter! Beware how you give a fatal sanction in this
infant period of our republic scarcely yet two-score
years old, to military insubordination! Remember
that Greece had her Alexander, Rome her Cæsar,
England her Cromwell, France her Bonaparte; and
that, if we would escape the rock on which they
split, we must avoid their errors.
I hope gentlemen will deliberately survey the
awful isthmus on which we stand. They may bear
down all opposition; they may even vote the general
the public thanks; they may carry him triumphantly
through this House. But, if they do, in my humble

civil authority, a triumph over the powers of this
House, a triumph over the constitution of the land.
And I pray most devoutly to heaven, that it may not
prove, in its ultimate effects and consequences, a
triumph over the liberties of the people.
MILITARY NOT ALWAYS CIVIL ABILITY
SERGEANT.
It has been maintained that the genius which
constitutes a great military man is a very high
quality, and may be equally useful in the Cabinet
and in the field; that it has a sort of universality
equally applicable to all affairs.
We have seen,
undoubtedly, instances of a rare and wonderful
combination of civil and military qualifications,
both of the highest order. That the greatest civil
qualifications may be found united with the highest
military talents, is what no one will deny who thinks
of Washington. But that such a combination is rare
and extraordinary, the fame of Washington suf-
ficiently attests. If it were common, why was he so
illustrious ?
I would ask, what did Cromwell, with all his
military genius, do for England ? He overthrew
the monarchy, and he established dictatorial power
in his own person. And what happened next? An-
other soldier overthrew the dictatorship, and re-
stored the monarchy. The sword effected both.
Cromwell made one revolution, and Monk another.
And what did the people of England gain by it?
Nothing,-absolutely nothing. The rights and

liberties of Englishmen, as they now exist, were
settled and established at the Revolution in 1688.
Now, mark the difference! By whom was that
Revolution begun and conducted? Was it by sol-
diers ? by military genius? by the sword? No! It
was the work of statesmen and of eminent lawyers,
-men never distinguished for military exploits.
The faculty, the dormant faculty, may have existed.
That is what no one can affirm or deny. But it
would have been thought an absurd and extravagant
thing to propose, in reliance upon this possible dor-
mant faculty, that one of those eminent statesmen
and lawyers should be sent, instead of the Duke of
Marlborough, to command the English forces on
the Continent.
Who achieved the freedom and the independence
of this our own country? Washington effected
much in the field; but where were the Franklins,
the Adamses, the Hancocks, the Jeffersons, and the
Lees,—the band of sages and patriots, whose
memory we revere? They were assembled in Coun-
cil. The heart of the Revolution beat in the Hall
of Congress. There was the power which, beginning
with appeals to the king and to the British nation,
at length made an irresistible appeal to the world,
and consummated the Revolution by the Declaration
of Independence, which Washington established
with their authority, and, bearing their commission,
supported by arms. And what has this band of
patriots, of sages, and of statesmen, given to us?
Not what Cæsar gave to Rome; not what Cromwell
gave to England, or Napoleon to France: they estab-
lished for us the great principles of civil, political,

and religious liberty, upon the strong foundations
on which they have hitherto stood. There may have
been military capacity in Congress; but can any one
deny that it is to the wisdom of sages, Washington
being one, we are indebted for the signal blessings
we enjoy ?
THE CONSTITUTION AND THE UNION
-WEBSTER.
A principal object in his late political move-
ments, the gentleman himself tells us, was to unite
the entire South; and against whom, or against
what, does he wish to unite the entire South? Is
not this the very essence of local feeling and local
regard? Is it not the acknowledgment of a wish and
object to create political strength, by uniting
political opinions geographically? While the gentle-
man wishes to unite the entire South, I pray to
know, sir, if he expects me to turn toward the polar-
star, and acting on the same principle, to utter a
cry of "Rally !" to the whole North. Heaven forbid!
To the day of my death, neither he nor others shall
hear such a cry from me.
Finally, the honorable member declares that he
shall now march off under the banner of State-
rights. March off from whom? March off from
what? We have been contending for great prin-
ciples. We have been struggling to maintain the
liberty and to restore the prosperity of the country;
we have made these struggles here, in the national
councils, with the old flag,—the true American flag,
the Eagle and the Stars and Stripes,—waving over

the chamber in which we sit. He now tells us, how-
ever, that he marches off under the State-rights
banner.
Let him go. I remain. I am, where I ever have
been, and ever mean to be. Here, standing on the
platform of the general Constitution,-a platform
broad enough and firm enough to uphold every
interest of the whole country, I shall still be found.
Intrusted with some part in the administration of
that Constitution, I intend to act in its spirit, and
in the spirit of those who framed it. Yes, sir. I
would act as if our fathers, who formed it for us,
and who bequeathed it to us, were looking on me,
as if I could see their venerable forms, bending
down to behold us from the abodes above. I would
act, too, as if the eye of posterity was gazing on me.
Standing thus, as in the full gaze of our ances-
tors and our posterity, having received this inheri-
tance from the former to be transmitted to the
latter, and feeling that, if I am born for any good
in my day and generation, it is for the good of the
whole country. No local policy, no local feeling, no
temporary impulse, shall induce me to yield my foot-
hold on the Constitution and the Union. I move off
under no banner not known to the whole American
people, and to their Constitution and laws. No, sir,
these walls, these columns
“fly
From their firm base as soon as I."
I came into public life, sir, in the service of the
United States. On that broad altar my earliest and
all my public vows have been made. I propose to
serve no other master. So far as depends on any

agency of mine, they shall continue united States;
united in interest and in affection; united in every-
thing in regard to which the Constitution has de-
creed their union; united in war, for the common
defence, the common renown, and the common
glory; and united, compacted, knit firmly together in
peace for the common prosperity and happiness of
ourselves and our children.
CONSTITUTIONAL CHANGES
--RANDOLPH.
Sir, I see no wisdom in making this provision for
future changes. You must give governments time
to operate on the people, and give the people time
to become gradually assimilated to their institu-
tions. Almost anything is better than this state of
perpetual uncertainty. A people may have the best
form of government that the wit of man ever de-
vised, and yet, from its uncertainty alone, may in
effect live under the worst government in the world.
Sir, how often must I repeat, that change is not
reform? I am willing that this new Constitution
shall stand as long as it is possible for it to stand;
and that, believe me, is a very short time. Sir, it is
vain to deny it. They may say what they please
about the old Constitution. The defect is not there.
It is not in the form of the old edifice, neither in the
design nor the elevation; it is in the material, it is
in the people of Virginia. To my knowledge, that
people are changed from what they have been. The
four hundred men who went out to David were in
debt. The partisans of Cæsar were in debt. The

113
fellow-laborers of Catiline were in debt. And I defy
you to show me a desperately indebted people any-
where who can bear a regular, sober government.
I throw the challenge to all who hear me. I say that
the character of the good old Virginia planter,—the
man who owned from five to twenty slaves or less,
who lived by hard work, and who paid his debts, is
passed away. A new order of things is come. The
period has arrived of living by one's wits; of living
by contracting debts that one cannot pay; and
above all, of living by office-hunting.
Sir, what do we see? Bankrupts, branded bank-
rupts, giving great dinners, sending their children
to the most expensive schools, giving grand parties,
and just as well received as anybody in society. I
say, that, in such a state of things, the old Constitu-
tion was too good for them. They could not bear it.
No, sir; they could not bear a freehold suffrage and
a property representation. I have always endeav-
ored to do the people justice; but I will not flatter
them: I will not pander to their appetite for change.
I will do nothing to provide for change. I will not
agree to any rule of future apportionment, or to
any provision for future changes, called amend-
ments to the Constitution. Those who love change,
who delight in public confusion, who wish to feed
the cauldron and make it bubble, may vote, if they
please, for future changes. But by what spell, by
what formula, are you going to bind the people to
all future time? The days of Lycurgus are gone by,
when we could swear the people not to alter the
Constitution until he should return. You may make
what entries on parchment you please. Give me a


## p. 114 (#242) ############################################

114
STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
Constitution that will last for a half a century: that
is all I wish for. No Constitution that you can make
will last the one-half of half a century. Sir, I will
stake anything, short of my salvation, that those
who are malcontent now will be more malcontent
three years hence than they are at this day. I have
no favor for this Constitution. I shall vote against
its adoption and I shall advise all the people of my
district to set their faces, aye, and their shoulders,
too, against it.
PEACEABLE SECESSION-WEBSTER.
Sir, he who sees these states now revolving in
harmony around a common centre, and expects to
see them quit their places and fly off without con-
vulsion, may look the next hour to see the heavenly
bodies rush from their spheres, and jostle against
each other in the realms of space, without causing
the crush of the universe. There can be no such
thing as a peaceable secession. Peaceable secession
is an utter impossibility. Is the great Constitution
under which we live covering this whole country,–
is it to be thawed and melted away by secession,
as the snows on the mountain melt under the in-
fluence of a vernal sun, disappear almost unob-
served, and run off ? No, sir! No, sir! I will not
state what might produce the disruption of the
Union: but, sir, I see, as plainly as I see the sun
in heaven, what that disruption itself must produce.
I see that it must produce war, and such a war as I
will not describe, in its two-fold character.

Peaceable secession !-peaceable secession! The
concurrent agreement of all the members of this
great republic to separate! A voluntary separation,
with alimony on one side and on the other. Why,
what would be the result? Where is the line to be
drawn? What states are to secede? What is to
remain American? What am I to be? An American
no longer? Am I to become a sectional man, a local
man, a separatist, with no country in common with
the gentlemen who sit around me here, or who fill
the other House of Congress. Heaven forbid !
Where is the flag of the republic to remain ?. Where
is the eagle still to tower? Or is he to cower, and
shrink, and fall to the ground? Why, sir, our an-
cestors, our fathers and our grandfathers, those of
them that are yet living amongst us with prolonged
lives, would rebuke and reproach us; and our chil-
dren and our grandchildren would cry out shame
upon us, if we, of this generation, should dishonor
these ensigns of the power of the government and
the harmony of that Union, which is every day felt
among us with so much joy and gratitude. What
is to become of the army? What is to become of
the navy? What is to become of the public lands?
How is any one of the thirty states to defend itself ?
Sir, we could not sit down here today, and draw
a line of separation that would satisfy any five men
in the country. There are natural causes that would
keep and tie us together; and there are social and
domestic relations which we could not break if we
would, and we should not if we could.

THE UNION-WEBSTER.
I profess, sir, in my career hitherto, to have
kept steadily in view the prosperity and honor of
the whole country and the preservation of our
Federal Union. It is to that Union we owe our
safety at home and our consideration and dignity
abroad. It is to that Union we are chiefly indebted
for whatever makes us most proud of our country.
That Union we reached only by the discipline of
our virtues in the severe school of adversity. It
had its origin in the necessities of disordered finance,
prostrate commerce, and ruined credit. Under its
benign influences, these great interests immediately
awoke, as from the dead, and sprang forth with
newness of life. Every year of its duration has
teemed with fresh proofs of its utility and its bless-
ings, and, although our territory has stretched out
wider and wider, and our population spread further
and further, they have not outrun its protecton or
its benefits. It has been to us all a copious fountain
of national, social, personal happiness. I have not
allowed myself, sir, to look beyond the Union, to
see what might lie hidden in the dark recess behind.
I have not coolly weighed the chances of preserving
liberty, when the bonds that unite us together shall
be broken asunder. I have not accustomed myself
to hang over the precipice of disunion, to see
whether, with my short sight, I can fathom the
depth of the abyss below; nor could I regard him
as a safe counsellor in the affairs of this govern-
ment whose thoughts should be mainly bent on con-
sidering, not how the Union should be best pre-

served, but how tolerable might be the condition of
the people when it shall be broken up and destroyed.
While the Union lasts, we have high, exciting,
gratifying prospects spread out before us, for us
and our children. Beyond that I seek not to pene-
trate the veil. God grant that in my day at least,
that curtain may not rise! God grant that on my
vision never may be opened what lies behind! When
my eyes shall be turned to behold for the last time
the sun in heaven, may I not see him shining on
the broken and dishonored fragments of a once
glorious Union; on states severed, discordant,
belligerent; on a land rent with civil feuds, or
drenched, it may be, in fraternal blood! Let their
last feeble and lingering glance rather behold the
gorgeous ensign of the republic, now known and
honored throughout the earth, still full high ad-
vanced, its arms and trophies streaming in their
original lustre, not a stripe erased or polluted, nor
a single star obscured, bearing for its motto no
such miserable interrogatory as, What is all this
worth? nor those other words of delusion and folly,
Liberty first and Union afterwards, but everywhere,
spread all over in characters of living light, blazing
on all its ample folds, as they float over the sea and
over the land, and in every wind under the whole
heavens, that other sentiment, dear to every true
American heart, Liberty and Union, now and for-
ever, one and inseparable!

HATRED OF ENGLAND
--RUFUS CHOATE.
Mr. President, we must distinguish a little. That
there exists in this country an intense sentiment of
nationality; a cherished energetic feeling and con-
sciousness of our independent and separate national
existence; a feeling that we have a transcendent
destiny to fulfil, which we mean to fulfil; a great
work to do, which we know how to do, and are able
to do; a career to run, up which we hope to ascend,
till we stand on the steadfast and glittering summits
of the world; a feeling, that we are surrounded and
attended by a noble historical group of competitors
and rivals, the other nations of the earth, all of
whom we hope to overtake and even to distance;
—such a sentiment as this exists, perhaps, in the
character of this people. And this I do not dis-
courage, I do not condemn. But, sir, that among
these useful and beautiful sentiments,—predom-
inant among them,—there exists a temper of hos-
tility towards this one particular nation, to such a
degree as to amount to a habit, a trait, a national
passion,—to amount to a state of feeling which "is
to be regretted,” and which really threatens another
war,—this I earnestly and confidently deny. I would
not hear your enemy say this. Sir, the indulgence
of such a sentiment by the people supposes them to
have forgotten one of the counsels of Washington.
Call to mind the ever seasonable wisdom of the
Farewell Address: “The nation which indulges
towards another an habitual hatred, or an habitual
fondness, is, in some degree, a slave. It is a slave
to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is

sufficient to lead it astray from its duty and its
interest."
No, sir! no, sir! We are above all this. Let the
Highland clansman, half naked, half civilized, half
blinded by the peat-smoke of his cavern, have his
hereditary enemy and his hereditary enmity, and
keep the keen, deep, and precious hatred, set on fire
of hell, alive, if he can. Let the North American
Indian have his, and hand it down from father to
son, by heaven knows what symbols of alligators,
and rattlesnakes, and war-clubs smeared with ver-
milion and entwined with scarlet. Let such a coun-
try as Poland, cloven to the earth, the armed heel
on the radiant forehead, her body dead, her soul
incapable to die,-let her remember the "wrongs of
days long past." Let the lost and wandering tribes
of Israel remember theirs. The manliness and the
sympathy of the world may allow or pardon this to
them. But shall America, young, free, prosperous,
just setting out on the highway of heaven, "decorat-
ing and cheering the elevated sphere she just begins
to move in, glittering like the morning star, full of
life and joy,”—shall she be supposed to be polluting
and corroding her noble and happy heart, by mop-
ing over old stories of stamp act, and tea tax, and
the firing of the Leopard upon the Chesapeake in a
time of peace? No, sir! No, sir! a thousand times,
no! Why, I protest, I thought all that had been
settled. I thought two wars had settled it all. What
else was so much good blood shed for on so many
more than classical fields of Revolutionary glory?
For what was so much good blood more lately shed
at Lundy's Lane, at Fort Erie, before and behind

the lines at New Orleans, on the deck of the Con-
stitution, on the deck of the Java, on the lakes, on
the sea, but to settle exactly these "wrongs of past
days"? And have we come back sulky and sullen
from the very field of honor? For my country, I
deny it.
THE LIBERTY OF THE PRESS-CURRAN.
What, then, remains ? The liberty of the press,
only,—that sacred palladium, which no influence, no
power, no minister, no government, which nothing
but the depravity or folly or corruption of a jury,
can ever destroy. And what calamities are the
people saved from, by having public communication
left open to them? I will tell you, gentlemen, what
they are saved from, and what the government is
saved from. I will tell you, also, to what both are
exposed by shutting up that communication. In
one case, sedition speaks aloud and walks abroad;
the demagogue goes forth; the public eye is upon
him; he frets his busy hour upon the stage. But
soon either weariness, or bribe, or punishment, or
disappointment, bears him down, or drives him off,
and he appears no more. In the other case, how
does the work of sedition go forward? Night after
night, the muffled rebel steals forth in the dark, and
casts another and another brand upon the pile, to
which, when the hour of fatal maturity shall arrive,
he will apply the torch.
In that awful moment of a nation's travail, of
the last gasp of tyranny and the first breath of
freedom, how pregnant is the example! The press

extinguished, the people enslaved, and the prince
undone! As the advocate of society, therefore, of
peace, of domestic liberty, and the lasting union of
the two countries, I conjure you to guard the liberty
of the press, that great sentinel of the State, that
grand detector of public imposture. Guard it, be-
cause, when it sinks, there sinks with it in one com-
mon grave the liberty of the subject and the security
of the Crown.
EULOGY ON WASHINGTON-WEBSTER.
And now, fellow-citizens, if this vision were a
reality, if Washington acrually were now amongst
us, -and if he could draw around him the shades
of the great public men of his own days, patriots
and warriors, orators and statesmen, and were to
address us in their presence, would he not say to us:
"Ye men of this generation, I rejoice and thank God
for being able to see that our labors, and toils, and
sacrifices, were not in vain. You are prosperous,
you are happy, you are grateful. The fire of liberty
burns brightly and steadily in your hearts, while
duty and the law restrain it from bursting forth in
wild and destructive conilagration. Cherish liberty,
as you love it; cherish its securities, as you wish to
preserve it.
Maintain the Constitution which we
labored so painfully to establish, and which has been
to you such a source of inestimable blessings. Pre-
serve the Union of the states, cemented as it was by
our prayers, our tears and our blood. Be true to
God, to your country, and to your duty. So shall the
whole Eastern world follow the morning sun, to

contemplate you as a nation; so shall all generations
honor you, as they honor us; and so shall that
Almighty Power which so graciously protected us,
and which now protects you, shower its everlasting
blessings upon you and your posterity!"
Great father of your country! We heed your
words; we feel their force, as if you now uttered
them with lips of flesh and blood. Your example
teaches us, your affectionate addresses teach us,
your public life teaches us your sense of the value
of the blessings of the Union. Those blessings our
fathers have tasted, and we have tasted, and still
taste. Nor do we intend that those who come after
us shall be denied the same high fruition. Our
honor, as well as our happiness, is concerned. We
cannot, we dare not, we will not, betray our sacred
trust. We will not filch from posterity the treasure
placed in our hands to be transmitted to other
generations. The bow that gilds the clouds in the
heavens, the pillars that uphold the firmament, may
disappear and fall away in the hour appointed by
the will of God; but, until that day comes, or so long
as our lives may last, no ruthless hand shall under-
mine that bright arch of Union and Liberty which
spans the continent from Washington to California.
CRIME OF INSTIGATING TREASON

act be necessary to make a man a traitor? The

sence. The framers of the Cnstitution, informed by
the examples of Greece and Rome, and foreseeing
that the liberties of this republic might, one day or
other, be seized by the daring ambition of some
domestic usurper, have given peculiar importance
and solemnity to the crime of treason, by ingrafting
a provision against it upon the Constitution. But
they have done this in vain, if the construction
contended for on the other side is to prevail. If
it require actual presence at the scene of the as-
semblage to involve a man in the guilt of treason,
how easy will it be for the principal traitor to avoid
this guilt, and escape punishment forever! He may
go into distant states, from one state to another.
He may secretly wander, like a demon of darkness,
from one end of the continent to the other. He may
enter into the confidence of the simple and unsus-
pecting. He may prepare the whole mechanism of
the stupendous and destructive engine, put it in
motion and let the rest be done by his agents. He
may then go a hundred miles from the scene of
action. Let him keep himself only from the scene
of the assemblage, and the immediate spot of the
battle, and he is innocent in law, while those he
has deluded are to suffer the death of traitors. Who
is the more guilty of this treason,—the poor, weak,
deluded instruments, or the artful and ambitious
man, who corrupted and misled them?
There is no comparison between his guilt and
theirs; and yet you secure impunity to him, while
they are to suffer death. Is this reason? Is this
moral right? No man of a sound mind and heart
can doubt for a moment between the comparative

guilt of Aaron Burr, the prime mover of the whole
mischief, and of the poor men on Blennerhassett's
Island, who called themselves “Burr's men." In
the case of murder, who is the more guilty,—the
ignorant, deluded perpetrator, or the abominable
instigator? Sir, give to the Constitution the con-
struction contended for on the other side, and you
might as well expunge the crime of treason from
your criminal code; nay, you had better do it, for
by this construction you hold out the lure of im-
punity to the most dangerous men in the com-
munity, men of ambition and talents, while you loose
the vengeance of the law on the comparatively in-
nocent. If treason ought to be repressed, I ask you,
who is the more dangerous and the more likely to
commit it, the mere instrument who applies the
force, or the daring, aspiring, elevated genius who
devises the whole plot, but acts behind the scenes ?

Venerable men! You have come down to us from

lengthened out your lives, that you might behold

and your neighbors, shoulder to shoulder, in the
strife for your country. Behold, how altered. The
same heavens are indeed over your heads; the same
ocean rolls at your feet; but all else how changed!

burning Charlestown. The ground strewed with
the dead and the dying; the impetuous charge; the
steady and successful repulse; the loud call to re-
peated assault; the summoning of all that is manly
to repeated resistance; a thousand bosoms freely
and fearlessly bared in an instant to whatever of
terror there may be in war and death;—all these
you have witnessed, but you witness them no more.
All is peace. The heights of yonder metropolis, its
towers and roofs, which you then saw filled with
wives and children and countrymen in distress and
terror, and looking with unutterable emotions for
the issue of the combat, have presented you today
with the sight of its whole happy population, come
out to welcome and greet you with an universal
jubilee. All is peace; and God has granted you this
sight of your country's happiness, ere you slumber
in the grave forever.
But, alas! you are not all here. Time and the
sword have thinned your ranks. Prescott, Putnam,
Stark, Brooks, Read, Pomeroy, Bridge!—our eyes
seek for you in vain amidst this broken band. But
let us not too much grieve, that you have met the
common fate of men. You lived to see your coun-
try's independence established, and to sheathe
your swords from war. On the light of liberty, you
saw arise the light of peace, like
“Another morn
Risen on mid-noon;”–
and the sky on which you closed your eyes was
cloudless.

great cause! Him! the premature victim of his own

self-devoting heart! Him! the head of our civil
councils, and the destined leader of our military
bands, whom nothing brought hither but the un-
quenchable fire of his own spirit! Him! Cut off by
Providence in the hour of overwhelming anxiety and
thick gloom; falling ere he saw the star of his
country rise; pouring out his generous blood like
water before he knew whether it would fertilize a
land of freedom or of bondage; how shall I struggle
with the emotions that stifle the utterance of thy
name! Our poor work may perish, but thine shall
endure. This monument may moulder away; the
solid ground it rests upon may sink down to a level
with the sea; but thy memory shall not fail. Where-
soever among men a heart shall be found that beats
to the transports of patriotism and liberty, its
aspirations shall be to claim kindred with thy spirit.
AGAINST BRITISH INJUSTICE
JOSIAH QUINCY, JR.
If there ever was a time, this is the hour for
Americans to rouse themselves and exert every
ability. Their all is at hazard and the die of fate
spins doubtful. British taxations, suspensions of
legislatures, and standing armies, are but some of
the clouds which overshadow the northern world.
Now is the time for this people to summon every
aid, human and divine; to exhibit every moral vir-
tue, and call forth every Christian grace. The wis-

By the sweat of our brow we earn the little we
possess; from nature we derive the common rights
of man; and by charter we claim the liberties of
Britons. Shall we, dare we, pusillanimously sur-
render our birthright? Is the obligation to our
fathers discharged? Is the debt we owe posterity
paid? Answer me, thou coward, who hidest thy-
self in the hour of trial, if there is no reward in
this life, no prize of glory in the next, capable of
animating thy dastard soul! Think and tremble,
thou miscreant, at the whips and stripes thy master
shall lash thee with on earth, and the flames and
scorpions thy second master shall torment thee with
hereafter! O, my countrymen! What will our chil-
dren say, when they read the history of these times,
should they find we tamely gave away, without one
noble struggle, the most invaluable of earthly bless-
ings ? As they drag the galling chain, will they not
execrate us? If we have any respect for things
sacred, any regard to the dearest treasure on earth,
if we have one tender sentiment for posterity, if we
would not be despised by the whole world, let us in
the most open, solemn manner and with determined
fortitude swear we will die, if we cannot live, free-
men!
NORTHERN LABORERS-TAYLOR.
The gentleman, sir, has misconceived the spirit
and tendency of Northern institutions. He is igno-
rant of Northern character. He has forgotten the
history of his country. Preach insurrection to the
Northern laborers! Who are the Northern laborers ?

The history of your country is their history. The
renown of your country is their renown. The bright-
ness of their doings is emblazoned on its every page.
Blot from your annals the words and the doings of
Northern laborers, and the history of your country
presents but a universal blank. Sir, who was he
that disarmed the Thunderer; wrested from his
grasp the bolts of Jove; calmed the troubled ocean;
became the central sun of the philosophical system
of his age, shedding his brightness and effulgence on
the whole civilized world; whom the great and
mighty of the earth delighted to honor; who par-
ticipated in the achievement of your independence;
prominently assisted in moulding your free institu-
tions; and the beneficial effects of whose wisdom
will be felt to the last moment of "recorded time"?
Who, sir, I ask was he? A Northern laborer, a
Yankee tallow-chandler's son, a printer's runaway
boy.
And who, let me ask the honorable gentleman,
who was he that in the days of our Revolution led
forth a Northern army, yes, an army of Northern
laborers,—and aided the chivalry of South Carolina
in their defense against British aggression, drove
the spoilers from their firesides, and redeemed her
fair fields from foreign invaders? Who was he? A
Northern laborer, a Rhode Island blacksmith,—the
gallant General Greene,-who left his hammer and
his forge, and went forth conquering and to con-
quer in the battle for our independence. And will
you preach insurrection to men like these?
Sir, our country is full of the achievements of
Northern laborers. Where is Concord and Lexing-

Bunker Hill, but in the North? And what, sir, has
shed an imperishable renown on the never-dying
names of those hallowed spots, but the blood and
the struggles, the high daring and patriotism, and
sublime courage of Northern laborers? The whole
North is an everlasting monument of the freedom,
virtue, intelligence, and indomitable independence,
of Northern laborers. Go, sir, go preach insurrec-
tion to men like these!
The fortitude of the men of the North under
intense suffering for liberty's sake has been almost
god-like. History has so recorded it. Who com-
prised that gallant army, without food, without
pay, shelterless, shoeless, penniless, and almost
naked, in that dreadful winter,—the midnight of
our Revolution,—whose wanderings could be traced
by their blood-tracks in the snow; whom no arts
could seduce, no appeal lead astray, no sufferings
disaffect; but who, true to their country and its holy
cause, continued to fight the good fight of liberty
until it finally triumphed? Who, sir, were these
men? Why, Northern laborers! Yes, sir, Northern
laborers! Who, sir, were Roger Sherman and
But it is idle to enumerate. To name the Northern
laborers, who have distinguished themselves and
illustrated the history of their country, would re-
quire days of the time of this House. Nor is it
necessary. Posterity will do them justice. Their
deeds have been recorded in characters of fire.

THE INDIAN'S RIGHT TO THE SOIL
--EVERETT.
Supposed Speech of an Indian Chief.
White man, there is eternal war between me and
thee. I quit not the land of my fathers but with my
life. In those woods where I bent my youthful bow,
I will still hunt the deer. Over yonder waters I will
glide unrestrained in ny bark canoe. By those
dashing waterfalls I will still lay up my winter's
store of food. On these fertile meadows I will still
plant my corn. Stranger, the land is mine! I under-
stand not these paper rights. I gave not my con-
sent when, as thou sayest, these broad regions were
purchased for a few baubles of my fathers. They
coulu sell what was theirs; they could sell no more.
How could my fathers sell that which the Great
Spirit sent me into the world to live upon? They
knew not what they did. The stranger came, a timid
suppliant, few and feeble, and asked to lie down on
the red man's bear-skin, and warm himself at the
red man's fire, and have a little piece of land to raise
corn for his women and children; and now he is
become strong and mighty and bold, and spreads
out his parchment over the whole, and says, “It is
mine.” Stranger, there is not room for us both. The
Great Spirit has not made us to live together. There
is poison in the white man's cup; the white man's
dog barks at the red man's heels.
If I should leave the land of my fathers, whither
shall. I fly? Shall I go to the South, and dwell among
the graves of the Pequots ? Shall I wander to the
West? The fierce Mohawk, the man-eater, is my
foe. Shall I fly to the East? The great water is

before me. No, stranger; here I have lived, and here
I will die; and if here thou abidest, there is eternal
war between me and thee. Thou hast taught me
thy arts of destruction. For that alone I thank
thee. And now take heed to thy steps: the red man
is thy foe. When thou goest forth by day, my bullet
shall whistle by thee; when thou liest down at night,
my knife is at thy throat. The noonday sun shall
not discover thy enemy, and the darkness of mid-
night shall not protect thy rest. Thou shalt plant in
terror, and I will reap in blood; thou shalt sow the
earth with corn, and I will strew it with ashes; thou
shalt go forth with the sickle, and I will follow after
with the scalping-knife; thou shalt build, and I will
burn, till the white man or the Indian shall cease
from the land. Go thy way for this time in safety;
but remember, stranger, there is eternal war be-
tween me and thee.
OUR DUTY TO OUR COUNTRY STORY.
The Old World has already revealed to us in its
unsealed books the beginning and end of all its own
marvellous struggles in the cause of liberty. Greece,
lovely Greece,
“The land of scholars and the nurse of arms,”
where sister republics in fair procession chanted the
praises of liberty and the gods, where and what is
she? For two thousand years the oppressor has
ground her to the earth. Her arts are no more. The
last sad relics of her temples are but the barracks of
a ruthless soldiery. The fragments of her columns

and her palaces are in the dust, yet beautiful in
ruins. She fell not when the mighty were upon her.
Her sons were united at Thermopylæ and Marathon,
and the tide of her triumph rolled back upon the
Hellespont. She was conquered by her own fac-
tions. She fell by the hands of her own people. The
man of Macedonia did not the work of destruction.
It was already done by her own corruptions, banish-
ments, and dissensions. Rome, republican Rome,
whose eagles glanced in the rising and setting sun,-
where and what is she? The eternal city yet re-
mains, proud even in her desolation, noble in her
decline, venerable in the majesty of religion, and
calm as in the composure of death. The malaria has
but travelled in the paths worn by her destroyers.
More than eighteen centuries have mourned over the
loss of her empire. A mortal disease was upon her
vitals before Cæsar had crossed the Rubicon, and
Brutus did not restore her health by the deep prob-
ings of the senate chamber. The Goths and Vandals
and Huns, the swarms of the North, completed only
what was already begun at home. Romans betrayed
Rome. The legions were bought and sold; but the
people offered the tribute-money.
We stand the latest, and, if we fail, probably the
last experiment of self-government by the people.
We have begun it under circumstances of the most
auspicious nature. We are in the vigor of youth.
Our growth has never been checked by the oppres-
sions of tyranny. Our constitutions have never been
enfeebled by the vices or luxuries of the Old World.
Such as we are, we have been from the beginning,
simple, hardy, intelligent, accustomed to self-

government and to self-respect. The Atlantic rolls
between us and any formidable foe. Within our own
territory, stretching through many degrees of lati-
tude and longitude, we have the choice of many
products and many means of independence. The
government is mild. The press is free. Religion is
free. Knowledge reaches, or may reach, every
home. What fairer prospect of success could be
presented? What means more adequate to accom-
plish the sublime end? What more is necessary,
than for the people to preserve what they have
themselves created ? Aiready has the age caught
the spirit of our institutions. It has already ascended
the Andes, and snuffed the breezes of both oceans.
It has infused itseif into the life-blood of Europe,
and warmed the sunny plains of France and the low
lands of Holland. It has touched the philosophy of
Germany and the North; and, moving onward to the
South, has opened to Greece the lessons of her better
days. Can it be that America under such circum-
stances can betray herself? Can it be that she is
to be added to the catalogue of republics, the inscrip-
tion upon whose ruins is: They were, but they are
not? Forbid it, my countrymen! Forbid it, heaven!

If such there breathe, go, mark him well;
For him no minstrel raptures swell;
High though his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth, as wish can claim;
Despite those titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch, concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And, doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust, from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung.
O Caledonia ! stern and wild,
Meet nurse for a poetic child !
Land of brown heath and shaggy wood,
Land of the mountain and the flood,
Land of my sires! what mortal hand
Can e'er untie the filial band
That knits me to thy rugged strand!
Still as I view each well-known scene,
Think what is now and what hath been,
Seems as to me, of all bereft,
Sole friends thy woods and streams were left;
And thus I love thenı better still,
Even in extremity of ill.
By Yarrow's stream still let me stray,
Though none should guide my feeble way;
Still feel the breeze down Ettrick break,
Although it chill my wither'd cheek;
Still lay my head by Teviot stone,
Though there, forgotten and alone,
The bard may draw his parting groan.

Will ye to your homes retire?
Look behind you! they're afire!

Who have done it! From the vale

Let their welcome be!

And the rocks shall raise their head,

your intention in attacking all honor and virtue?
Do you mean to bring all men to a level with your-
selves and to extirpate all honor and independence ?
Perhaps you imagine a vote will settle the whole
controversy.
Alas! You are not aware that the manner in
which your vote is procured is a secret to no man.
Listen; for if you are not totally callous, if your con-
sciences are not seared, I will speak daggers to your
souls, and wake you to all the hell of guilty recollec-
tion. I will follow you with whips and stings,
through every maze of your unexampled turpitude,
and plant thorns under the rose of ministerial
approbation.
You have flagrantly violated justice and the law
of the land, and opened a door for anarchy and con-
fusion. After assuming an arbitrary dominion over
law and justice, you issue orders, warrants, and
proclamations against every opponent, and send as
prisoners to your Bastile all those who have the
courage and virtue to defend the freedom of their
country.
But it is in vain that you hope by fear and terror
to extinguish the native British fire. The more
sacrifices, the more martyrs you make, the more
numerous the sons of liberty will become. They will
multiply like the hydra, and hurl vengeance on your
heads. Let others act as they will; while I have a
tongue or an arm, they shall be free.

strous proceedings, I will leave the house; nor do I

FOLLY OF DISUNION-GASTON.

Threats of resistance, secession, separation, have
become common as household words in the wicked
and silly violence of public declaimers. The public
ear is familiarized, and the public mind will soon be
accustomed, to the detestable suggestions of dis-
union.
Calculations and conjectures, what may the East
do without the South, and what may the South do
without the East; sneers, menaces, reproaches, and
recriminations, all tend to the same fatal end. What
can the East do without the South? What can the
South do without the East?
They may do much; they may exhibit to the
curiosity of political anatomists, and the pity and
wonder of the world, the "disjecta membra,” the
sundered and bleeding limbs of a once gigantic body
instinct with life and strength and vigor. They can
furnish to the philosophic historian another melan-
choly and striking instance of the political axiom,
that all republican confederacies have an inherent
and unavoidable tendency to dissolution.
They will present fields and occasions for border
wars, for leagues and counter-leagues, for the in-
trigues of petty statesmen, the struggles of military

chiefs, for confiscations, insurrections, and deeds of

who have proclaimed that men are not fit to govern
themselves, and shed a disastrous eclipse on the
hopes of rational freedom throughout the world.
Solon in his code proposed no punishment for
parricide, treating it as an impossible crime. Such
with us ought to be the crime of political parricide,

SEMPRONIUS' SPEECH FOR WAR

Which of the two to choose, slavery or death?
No! Let us rise at once, gird on our swords,
And, at the head of our remaining troops,
Attack the foe, break through the thick array
Of his thronged legions, and charge home upon him.
Perhaps some arm more lucky than the rest
May reach his heart, and free the world from
bondage.
Rise, fathers, rise! 'Tis Rome demands your help.
Rise, and revenge her slaughtered citizens,
Or share their fate! The corpse
The corpse of half her Senate
Manure the fields of Thessaly, while we
Sit here, deliberating in cold debates,
If we should sacrifice our lives to honor,
Or wear them out in servitude and chains.

Point out their wounds, and cry aloud, "To battle!"

TELEMACHUS TO THE ALLIED CHIEFS
-FENELON.
Fellow-soldiers and confederated chiefs! I grant
you, if ever man deserved to have the weapon of
stratagem and deceit turned against him, it is he
who has used it himself so often,—the faithless
Adrastus. But shall it be said that we, who have
united to punish the perfidy of this man,—that we
are ourselves perfidious ? Shall fraud be counter-
acted by fraud? If we can adopt the practices of
Adrastus without guilt, Adrastus himself is inno-
cent, and our present attempt to punish him is
unwarrantable. You have sworn, by all that is most
sacred, to leave Venusium a deposit in the hands of
the Lucanians. The Lucanian garrison, you say, is
corrupted by Adrastus. I do not doubt it. But this
garrison is still Lucanian. It receives the pay of the
Lucanians, and has not yet refused to obey them. It
has preserved, at least, an appearance of neutrality.
Neither Adrastus nor his people have yet entered it.
The treaty is still subsisting: and the gods have not
forgotten your oath.
Is a promise never to be kept but when a
plausible pretence to break it is wanting? Shall an
oath be sacred only when nothing is to be gained by
its violation? If you are insensible to the love of
virtue and the fear of the gods, have you no regard
to your interest and reputation? If, to terminate a

war, you violate your oath, how many wars will this
impious conduct excite? Who will hereafter trust
you? What security can you ever give for your good
faith? A solemn treaty? You have trampled one
under foot. An oath? You have committed perjury
when perjury was profitable, and have defied the
gods. In peace you will be regarded as treacher-
ously preparing for war. Every affair, based on a
confidence in your probity, will become imprac-
ticable. Your promises will not be believed. Nay,
the very league which now constitutes your strength
will lose its cohesive principle. Your perjury will
be the triumph of Adrastus. He will not need to
attack you himself. Your own dissensions, your
own mistrusts, your own duplicity, will be your ruin.
Ye mighty chiefs, renowned for magnanimity
and wisdom, experienced and brave, governing un-
counted thousands, despise not the counsel of a
youth! To whatever extremity war may reduce you,
let your resources be diligence and virtue. True
fortitude can never despair. But, if you once pass
the barrier of honor and integrity, the ruin of your
cause is irreparable. You can neither reestablish
that confidence without which no affair of impor-
tance can succeed, nor can you bring men back to the
reverence of that virtue which you have taught them
to despise. What have you to fear? Is not your
courage equal to victory without the aid of fraud ?
Your own power joined to that of the many under
your command,-is it not sufficient? Let us fight,
let us die, if we must, but let us not conquer
unworthily! Adrastus, the impious Adrastus, is in
our power, provided-provided we disdain to imi-

tate the cowardice and treachery which have sealed

TITUS QUINTIUS TO THE PEOPLE-LIVY.
Though I am conscious of no fault, O Romans, it
is yet with the utmost shame I have come forward
to your Assembly. You have seen it, posterity will
know it, that in my fourth consulate the Æquans
and Volscians came in arms to the very gates of
Rome, and went away unchastised. Had I foreseen
that such an ignominy had been reserved for my
official year, that Rome might have been taken while
I was Consul,—I would have shunned the office
either by exile or by death. Yes; I have had honors
enough,-of life more than enough. I should have
died in my third consulate. Whom did these most
dastardly enemies despise, us Consuls, or you citi-
zens? If we are in fault, depose us, punish us as
we deserve. If you, Romans, are to blame, may
neither gods nor men make you suffer for your
offences! Only may you repent! No, Romans, the
confidence of our enemies is not from a belief in
their own courage or in your cowardice. They have
been too often vanquished, not to know both them-
selves and you. Discord, discord amongst ourselves,
is the ruin of this city. The eternal disputes be-
tween the Senate and the people are the sole cause
of our misfortunes.
In the name of heaven, what is it, Romans, you
would have? You desired Tribunes of the commons.
For the sake of concord, we granted Tribunes. You
were eager to have Decemvirs. We suffered them

to be created. You grew weary of Decemvirs. We
compelled them to abdicate. You insisted on the
restoration of the Tribuneship. We yielded. You
invaded our rights. We have borne and still bear.
What termination is there to be to these dissensions ?
When shall we have a united city? When one com-
mon country? With the enemy at our gates, with
the Volscian foe scaling your rampart, there is no
one to hinder it. But against us you are valiant,
against us you diligently take up arms.
Come on,
then. Besiege the Senate-house. Make a camp of
the Forum. Fill the jails with our chief nobles.
Then sally out with the same determined spirit
against the enemy. Does your resolution fail? Look,
then, to see your lands ravaged, your houses plun-
dered and in flames, the whole country laid waste
with fire and sword.
Extinguish, O Romans, these fatal divisions !
Break the spell of this enchantment, which renders
you powerless and inactive! If you will but sum-
mon up the ancient Roman courage, and follow your
Consuls to the field, I will submit to any punishment,
if I do not rout and put to flight these ravagers of
our territories, and transfer to their own cities the
terror of war.

the city guards? Nothing, by the rally of all good
citizens? Nothing, by the assembling of the Senate
in this fortified place? Nothing, by the averted
looks of all here present? Seest thou not that all
thy plots are exposed ?--that thy wretched con-
spiracy is laid bare to every man's knowledge here
in the Senate ?_that we are well aware of thy pro-
ceedings of last night, of the night before: the place
of meeting, the company convoked, the measures
concerted? Alas, the times! Alas, the public
morals! The Senate understands all this. The Con-
sul sees it. Yet the traitor lives! Lives? Ay, truly,

deliberations, and, with his measuring eye, marks
out each man of us for slaughter. And we, all this
while, strenuous that we are, think we have amply
discharged our duty to the State, if we but shun this
madman's sword and fury.
Long since, O Catiline, cught the Consul to have
ordered thee to execution, and brought upon thy
own head the ruin thou hast been meditating against
others. There was that virtue once in Rome, that
a wicked citizen was held more execrable than the
deadliest foe. We have a law still, Catiline, for
thee. Think not that we are powerless, because
forbearing. We have a decree, though it rests among
our archives like a sword in its scabbard,-a decree,
by which thy life would be made to pay the forfeit
of thy crimes. And, should I order thee to be
instantly seized and put to death, I make just doubt
whether all good men would not think it done rather
too late than any man too cruelly. But, for good
reasons, I will yet defer the blow long since de-

served. Then will I doom thee, when no man is
found so lost, so wicked, nay, so like thyself, but
shall confess that it was justly dealt. While there
is one man that dares defend thee, live! But thou
shalt live so beset, so surrounded, so scrutinized, by
the vigilant guards that I have placed around thee,
that thou shalt not stir a foot against the Republic
without my knowledge. There shall be eyes to detect
thy slightest movement, and ears to catch thy
wariest whisper, of which thou shalt not dream. The
darkness of night shall not cover thy treason; the
walls of privacy shall not stifle its voice. Baffled on
all sides, thy most secret counsels clear as noon-day,
what canst thou now have in view ? Proceed, plot,
conspire, as thou wilt; there is nothing you can con-
trive, nothing you can propose, nothing you can
attempt, which I shall not know, hear, and promptly
understand. Thou shalt soon be made aware that I
am even more active in providing for the preserva-

At length, Romans, we are rid of Catiline. We
have driven him forth, drunk with fury, breathing

sword. He is gone; he is fled; he has escaped; he
has broken away. No longer, within the very walls
of the city, shall he plot her ruin. We have forced
him from secret plots into open rebellion. The bad
citizen is now the avowed traitor. His flight is the
confession of his treason. Would that his attendants

overtake him before night on the Aurelian road. Let
him not languish deprived of your society. Haste
to join the congenial crew that compose his army,

under Manlius expect Catiline for their leader? And
such an army! Outcasts from honor, and fugitives
from debt; gamblers and felons; miscreants, whose
dreams are of rapine, murder, and conflagration!
Against these gallant troops of your adversary,
prepare, O Romans, your garrisons and armies; and
first to that maimed and battered gladiator oppose
your consuls and generals; next, against that miser-
able outcast horde, lead forth the strength and
flower of all Italy. On the one side chastity con-
tends; on the other, wantonness: here purity, there
pollution; here integrity, there treachery; here
piety, there profaneness; here constancy, there
rage; here honesty, there haseness; here continence,
there lust; in short, equity, temperance, fortitude,
prudence, struggle with iniquity, luxury, cowardice,
rashness; every virtue with every vice; and, lastly,
the contest lies between well-grounded hope and
absolute despair. In such a conflict, were even
human aid to fail, would not the immortal gods
empower such conspicuous virtue to triumph over
such complicated vice?

infamous death on the cross that ill-fated and inno-
cent citizen, Publius Gavius Cosanus? And what
was his offence? He had declared his intention of
appealing to the justice of his country against your
brutal persecutions. For this, when about to em-
bark for home, he was seized, brought before you,
charged with being a spy, scourged and tortured.
In vain did he exclaim: "I am a Roman citizen! I
have served under Lucius Pretius, who is now at
Panormus, and who will attest my innocence!" Deaf
to all remonstrance, remorseless, thirsting for inno-
cent blood, you ordered the savage punishment to
be inflicted. While the sacred words, “I am a Roman
citizen,” were on his lips:—words which in the
remotest regions are a passport to protection,-you
ordered him to death, to a death upon the cross.
O liberty! O sound once delightful to every
Roman ear! O sacred privilege of Roman citizen-
ship, once sacred, now trampled on! Is it come to
this? Shall an inferior magistrate, a governor,
who holds his whole power of the Roman people, in
a Roman province, within sight of Italy, bind,
scourge, torture, and put to an infamous death a
Roman citizen? Shall neither the cries of innocence
expiring in agony, the tears of pitying spectators,
the majesty of the Roman Commonwealth, nor the
fear of the justice of his country restrain the merci-
less monster, who, in the confidence of his riches,
strikes at the very root of liberty and sets mankind
at defiance? And shall this man escape? Fathers,
it must not be! It must not be, unless you would

AGAINST THE APPOINTMENT OF RICHARD
CROMWELL TO THE PROTECTORATE
-SIR HENRY VANE.
This fierce invective came thundering down upon Richard and his
party with all the suddenness and impetuosity of an avalanche and for-
ever buried them.
Mr. Speaker! Among all the people of the uni-
verse, I know none who have shown so much zeal
for the liberty of their country as the English at this
time have done. They have by the help of divine
Providence overcome all obstacles, and have made
themselves free. We have driven away the heredi-
tary tyranny of the house of Stuart, at the expense
of much blood and treasure, in hopes of enjoying
hereditary liberty, after having shaken off the yoke
of kingship; and there is not a man among us who
could have imagined that any person would be so
bold as to dare to attempt the ravishing from us that
freedom, which cost us so much blood and so much
labor. But it so happens, I know not by what mis-
fortune, we are fallen into the error of those who
poisoned the Emperor Titus to make room for
Domitian; who made away Augustus that they
might have Tiberius; and changed Claudius for
Nero. I am sensible these examples are foreign
from my subject, since the Romans in those days
were buried in lewdness and luxury, whereas the
people of England are now renowned all over the

world for their great virtue and discipline; and yet,
-suffer an idiot, without courage, without sense,
nay, without ambition,-to have dominion in a
country of liberty. One could bear a little with
Oliver Cromwell, though, contrary to his oath of
fidelity to the Parliament, contrary to his duty to
the public, contrary to the respect he owed that
venerable body from whom he received his author-
ity, he usurped the government. His merit was so
extraordinary, that our judgments, our passions,
might be blinded by it. He made his way to empire
by the most illustrious actions; he had under his
command an army that had made him a conqueror,
and a people that had made him their general. But,
as for Richard Cromwell, his son, who is he? What
are his titles? We have seen that he had a sword by
his side; but did he ever draw it? And, what is of
more importance in this case, is he fit to get
obedience from a mighty nation, who could never
make a footman obey him? Yet we must recognize
this man as our king under the style of Protector!
A man without birth, without courage, without con-
duct! For my part, I declare, sir, it shall never be
said that I made such a man my master.
MARIE ANTOINETTE

It is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw
the Queen of France, then the Dauphiness, at Ver-
sailles; and surely never lighted on this orb, which
she hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision.
I saw her just above the horizon, decorating and

cheering the elevated sphere she just began to move
in, glittering like the morning star, full of life and
splendor and joy. Oh, what a revolution! And
what a heart must I have, to contemplate without
emotion that elevation and that fall! Little did I
dream, when she added titles of veneration to those
of enthusiastic, distant, respectful love, that she
should ever be obliged to carry the sharp antidote
against disgrace concealed in that bosom; little did
I dream that I should have lived to see such disasters
fallen upon her, in a nation of gallant men, in a
nation of men of honor, and of cavaliers. I thought
ten thousand swords must have leaped from their
scabbards, to avenge even a look that threatened
her with insult.
But the age of chivalry is gone; that of
sophisters, economists and calculators has suc-
ceeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished for-
ever. Never, never more shall we behold that gen-
erous loyalty to rank and sex, that proud submis-
sion, that dignified obedience, that subordination of
the heart, which kept alive even in servitude itself
the spirit of an exalted freedom. The unbought
grace of life, the cheap defence of nations, the nurse
of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise, is gone.
It is gone—that sensibility of principle, that chas-
tity of honor, which felt a stain like a wound, which
inspired courage whilst it mitigated ferocity, which
ennobled whatever it touched, and under which vice
itself lost half its evil by losing all its grossness.

DEFENSE OF ROMAN CATHOLICISM
SHEIL,
Calumniators of Catholicism, have you read the
history of your country? Of the charges against
the religion of Ireland the annals of England afford
the confutation. The body of your common law was
given by the Catholic Alfred. He gave you your
judges, your magistrates, your high-sheriffs, your
courts of justice, your elective system and the great
bulwark of your liberties, the trial by jury. Who
conferred upon the people the right of self-taxation,
and fixed, if he did not create, their representation ?
The Catholic Edward the First; while in the reign
of Edward the Third, perfection was given to the
representative system. Parliaments were annually
called, and the statute against constructive treason
was enacted. It is false,-foully, infamously false,
—that the Catholic religion, the religion of your
forefathers, the religion of seven millions of your
fellow-subjects, has been the auxiliary of debase-
ment, and that to its influence the suppression of
British freedom can in a single instance be referred.
I am loath to say that which can give you cause to
take offense; but, when the faith of my country is
made the object of imputation, I cannot help, I can-
not refrain, from breaking into a retaliatory inter-
rogation, and from asking whether the overthrow
of the old religion of England was not effected by
a tyrant, with a hand of iron and a heart of stone:
whether Henry did not trample upon freedom, while
upon Catholicism he set his foot; and whether
Elizabeth herself, the virgin of the Reformation, did
not inherit her despotism with her creed; whether

in her reign the most barbarous atrocities were not
committed; whether torture, in violation of the
Catholic common law of England, was not politically
inflicted, and with the shrieks of agony the Towers
of Julius in the dead of night did not reecho?
You may suggest to me that in the larger por-
tion of Catholic Europe freedom does not exist; but
you should bear in mind that, at a period when the
Catholic religion was in its most palmy state, free-
dom flourished in the countries in which it is now
extinct. False,—I repeat it, with all the vehemence
of indignant asseveration,-utterly false is the
charge habitually preferred against the religion
which Englishmen have laden with penalties and
have marked with degradation. I can bear with any
other charge but this; to any other charge I can
listen with endurance. Tell me that I prostrate my-
self before a sculptured marble; tell me that to a
canvass glowing with the imagery of heaven I bend
my knee; tell me that my faith is my perdition; and,
as you traverse the church-yards in which your fore-
fathers are buried, pronounce upon those who have
lain there for many hundred years a fearful and
appalling sentence; yes, call what I regard as the
truth not only an error, but a sin, to which mercy
shall not be extended,—all this I will bear, to all this
I will submit; nay, at all this I will but smile. But
do not tell me that I am in heart and creed a slave!
-That, my countrymen cannot brook. In their own
bosoms they carry the high consciousness that never
was imputation more foully false or more detestably
calumnious.

NO CHOICE BUT WAR
-PATRICK HENRY.
They tell us, sir, that we are weak,-unable to
cope with so formidable an adversary. But when
shall we be stronger? Will it be next week, or the
next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed,
and when a British guard shall be stationed in every
house? Shall we gather strength by irresolution
and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effec-
tual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and
hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our
enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we
are not weak, if we make a proper use of those
means which the God of nature hath placed in our
power.
Three millions of people, armed in the holy cause
of liberty, and in such a country as that which we
possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy
can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight
our battles alone. There is a just God who presides
over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up
friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir,
is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the
active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no election.
If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late
to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but
in submission and slavery. Our chains are forged.
Their clanking may be heard on the plains of
Boston. The war is inevitable; and let it come! I
repeat it, sir, let it come!
It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentle-
men may cry, peace, peace! But there is no peace.
The war is actually begun. The next gale that

sweeps from the North will bring to our ears the
clash of resounding arms. Our brethern are already
in the field. Why stand we here idle? What is it
that Gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is
life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased
at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it,
Almighty God! I know not what course others may
take, but as for me, give me liberty, or give me
death!
AMERICAN INNOVATIONS-MADISON.
Why is the experiment of an extended republic
to be rejected, merely because it may comprise what
is new? Is it not the glory of the people of America,
that whilst they have paid a decent regard to the
opinions of former times and other nations, they
have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity,
for custom, or for names to overrule the suggestions
of their own good sense, the knowledge of their own
situation, and the lesson of their own experience?
To this manly spirit posterity will be indebted for
the possession, and the world for the example, of
the numerous innovations displayed on the Ameri-
can theatre in favor of private rights and public
happiness. Had no important step been taken by
the leaders of the Revolution, for which a precedent
could not be discovered, no government established,
of which an exact model did not present itself, the
people of the United States might at this moment
have been numbered among the melancholy victims
of misguided councils ;--must, at best, have been
laboring under the weight of some of those forms

which have crushed the liberties of the rest of man-
kind. Happily for America, happily, we trust, for
the whole human race, they pursued a new and more
noble course. They accomplished a revolution which
has no parallel in the annals of human society. They
reared the fabric of governments which have no
model on the face of the globe. They formed the
design of a great confederacy, which it is incumbent
on their successors to improve and perpetuate. If
their works betray imperfections, we wonder at the
fewness of them. If they erred most in the struc-
ture of the Union, this was the most difficult to be
executed; this is the work which has been new-
modelled by the act of your Convention, and it is
that act on which you are now to deliberate and to
decide.
THE DIGNITY OF THE SENATE
--HENRY CLAY.
What patriotic purpose is to be accomplished by
this expunging resolution? Can you make that not
to be which has been? Can you eradicate from
memory and from history the fact that in March
1834, a majority of the Senate of the United States
passed the resolution which excites your enmity?
Is it your vain and wicked object to arrogate to
yourselves that power of annihilating the past
which has been denied to Omnipotence itself? Do
you intend to thrust your hands into our hearts and
to pluck out the deeply-rooted convictions which are
there? Or is it your design merely to stigmatize
us? You cannot stigmatize us.
“Ne'er yet did base dishonor blur our name.”

Standing securely upon our conscious rectitude, and
bearing aloft the shield of the Constitution of our
country, we declare your puny efforts impotent, and
we defy all your power.
But why should I detain the Senate or needlessly
waste my breath in fruitless exertions? The decree
has gone forth. It is one of urgency, too. The deed
is to be done,—that foul deed, which, like the stain
on the hands of the guilty Macbeth, all ocean's
waters will never wash out. Proceed, then, to the
noble work which lies before you, and like other
skilful executioners do it quickly. And, when you
have perpetrated it, go home to the people, and tell
them what glorious honors you have achieved for
our common country. Tell them that you have
extinguished one of the brightest and purest lights
that ever burnt at the altar of civil liberty. Tell
them that you have silenced one of the noblest bat-
teries that ever thundered in defence of the Con-
stitution, and that you have bravely spiked the
cannon. Tell them that henceforward, no matter
what daring or outrageous act any President may
perform, you have forever hermetically sealed the
mouth of the Senate. Tell them that he may fear-
lessly assume what power he pleases, snatch from
its lawful custody the public purse, command a mili-
tary detachment to enter the halls of the Capitol,
overawe Congress, trample down the Constitution,
and raze every bulwark of freedom, but that the
Senate must stand mute, in silent submission, and
not dare to lift an opposing voice; that it must wait
until a House of Representatives, humbled and sub-
dued like itself, and a majority of it composed of the

partisans of the President, shall prefer articles of
impeachment. Tell them, finally, that you have
restored the glorious doctrine of passive obedience
and non-resistance; and, when you have told them
this, if the people do not sweep you from your places
with their indignation, I have yet to learn the char-
acter of American free men.
PRESERVATION OF THE UNION BY FORCE
-CALHOUN.
It is said that the bill ought to pass, because the
law must be enforced. The law must be enforced !
The imperial edict must be executed! It is under
such sophistry, couched in general terms, without
looking to the limitations which must ever exist ir.
the practical exercise of power, that the most cruel
and despotic acts ever have been covered. It was
such sophistry as this that cast Daniel into the lions'
den, and the three Innocents into the fiery furnace.
Under the same sophistry the bloody edicts of Nero
and Caligula were executed. The law must be
enforced! Yes, the act imposing the tea-tax "must
be executed.” This was the very argument which
impelled Lord North and his administration in that
mad career which forever separated us from the
British Crown. Under a similar sophistry, "that
religion must be protected,” how many massacres
have been perpetrated, and how many martyrs have
been tied to the stake! What! Acting on this vague
abstraction, are you prepared to enforce a law, with-
out considering whether it be just or unjust, con-
stitutional or unconstitutional? Will you collect

money, when it is acknowledged that it is not
wanted ? He who earns the money, who digs it from
the earth with the sweat of his brow, has a just title
to it against the universe. No one has a right to
touch it without his consent, except his government,
and that only to the extent of its legitimate wants.
To take more is robbery; and you propose by this
bill to enforce robbery by murder. Yes, to this
result you must come by this miserable sophistry,
this vague abstraction of enforcing the law, without
a regard to the fact whether the law be just or
unjust, constitutional or unconstitutional.
In the same spirit we are told that the Union
must be preserved without regard to the means.
And how is it proposed to preserve the Union? By
force. Does any man, in his senses, believe that this
beautiful structure, this harmonious aggregate of
states produced by the joint consent of all, can be
preserved by force? Its very introduction would be
the certain destruction of this Federal Union. No,
no! You cannot keep the states united in their con-
stitutional and federal bonds by force. Has reason
fled from our borders? Have we ceased to reflect?
It is madness to suppose that the Union can be pre-
served by force. I tell you plainly that the bill,
should it pass, cannot be enforced. It will prove
only a blot upon your statute-book a reproach to the
year, and a disgrace to the American Senate. I
repeat that it will not be executed; it will rouse the
dormant spirit of the people, and open their eyes to
the approach of despotism. The country has sunk
into avarice and political corruption, from which
nothing can arouse it but some measure on the part

THE PEOPLE AND THE ELECTIONS
- M'DUFFIE.
We have been frequently told that the farmer
should attend to his plow, and the mechanic to his
handicraft, during the canvass for the Fresidency.
Sir, a more dangerous doctrine could not be incul-
cated. If there is any spectacle from the contempla-
tion of which I would shrink with peculiar horror,
it would be that of the great mass of the American
people sunk into a profound apathy on the subject
of their highest political interests. Such a spectacle
would be more portentous to the eye of intelligent
patriotism, than all the monsters of the earth and
fiery signs of the heavens to the eye of trembling
superstition. If the people could be indifferent to
the fate of a contest for the presidency, they would
be unworthy of freedom.
“Keep the people quiet! Peace! Peace!" Such
are the whispers by which the people are to be lulled
to sleep in the very crisis of their highest concerns.
Sir, "you make a solitude and call it peace!" Peace?
'Tis death! Take away all interest from the people
in the election of their Chief Ruler, and liberty is no
more. What, sir, is to be the consequence? If the
people do not elect the President, somebody must.
There is no special Providence to decide the ques-
tion. Who, then, is to make the election, and how
will it operate? Make the people indifferent, destroy
their legitimate influence, and you communicate a

morbid violence to the efforts of those who are ever
'ready to assume the control of such affairs, the mer-
cenary intriguers and interested office-hunters of
the country. Tell me not, sir, of popular violence!
Show me a hundred political factionists,—men who
look to the election of a President as a means of
gratifying their high or their low ambition, and I
will show you the very materials for a mob, ready
for any desperate adventure connected with their
common fortunes. The people can have no such
motives; they look only to the interest and glory of
the country.
There was a law of Athens, which subjected
every citizen to punishment, who refused to take
sides in the political parties which divided the
Republic. It was founded in the deepest wisdom.
The ambitious few will inevitably acquire the
ascendency in the conduct of human affairs, if the
patriotic many, the people, are not stimulated and
roused to a proper activity and effort. Sir, no nation
on earth has ever exerted so extensive an influence
on human affairs as this will certainly exercise, if
we preserve our glorious system of government in
its purity. The liberty of this country is a sacred
depository, a vestal fire which Providence has com-
mitted to us for the general benefit of mankind. It
is the world's last hope. Extinguish it, and the earth
will be covered with eternal darkness. But once put
out that fire, and I “know not where is the Prome-
thean heat which can that light relume.”

THE UNION OUR ONLY HOPE-WEBSTER.
And now, Mr. President, instead of speaking of
the possibility or utility of secession, instead of
dwelling in these caverns of darkness, instead of
groping with those ideas so full of all that is horrid
and horrible, let us come out into the light of day;
let us enjoy the fresh air of Liberty and Union; let
us cherish those hopes which belong to us; let us
devote ourselves to those great objects that are fit
for our consideration and our action; let us raise
our conceptions to the magnitude and the impor-
tance of the duties that devolve upon us; let our
comprehension be as broad as the country for which
we act, our aspirations as high as its certain des-
tiny; let us not be pigmies in a case that calls for
men. Never did there devolve on any generation of
men higher trusts than now devolve upon us for the
preservation of this Constitution and the harmony
and peace of all who are destined to live under it.
Let us make our generation one of the strongest and
brightest links in that golden chain, which is des-
tined, I fondly believe, to grapple the people of all
the states to this Constitution for ages to come.
We have a great, popular, constitutional govern-
ment, guarded by law and by judicature, and de-
fended by the whole affections of the people. No
monarchial throne presses these states together; no
iron chain of military power encircles them; they
live and stand upon a government popular in its
form, representative in its character, founded upon
principles of equality, and so constructed, we hope,
as to last forever. In all its history it has been

beneficent; it has trodden down no man's liberty,
it has crushed no State. Its daily respiration is
liberty and patriotism; its yet youthful veins are
full of enterprise, courage, and honorable love of
glory and renown. Large before, the country has
now by recent events become vastly larger. This
republic now extends, with a vast breadth, across
the whole Continent. The two great seas of the
world wash the one and the other shore. We realize
on a mighty scale the beautiful description of the
ornamental edging of the buckler of Achilles,-
“Now the broad shield complete, the artist crowned
With his last hand and poured the ocean round;
In living silver seemed the waves to roll,
And beat the bucklers verge, and bound the whole.”
AN ATTACK ON WEBSTER-HAYNE.
The honorable gentleman from Massachusetts,
after deliberating a whole night upon his course,
comes into this chamber to vindicate New England;
and, instead of making up his issue with the gentle-
man from Missouri on the charges which he had pre-
ferred, chooses to consider me as the author of those
charges; and, losing sight entirely of that gentle-
man, selects me as his adversary, and pours out all
the vials of his mighty wrath upon my devoted head.
Nor is he willing to stop there. He goes on to assail
the institutions and policy of the South, and calls in
question the principles and conduct of the state
which I have the honor to represent. When I find

acknowledged talents, and profound sagacity, pur-

suing a course like this, declining the contest offered
from the West, and making war upon the unoffend-
ing South, I must believe, I am bound to believe, he
has some object in view which he has not ventured
to disclose. Mr. President, why is this? Has the
gentleman discovered in former controversies with
the gentleman from Missouri, that he is over-
matched by that senator? And does he hope for an
easy victory over a more feeble adversary? Has
the gentleman's distempered fancy been disturbed
by gloomy forebodings of "new alliances to be
formed," at which he hinted? Has the ghost of the
murdered Coalition come back, like the ghost of
Banquo, to "sear the eyeballs of the gentleman," and
will it not "down at his bidding"? Are dark visions
of broken hopes and honors lost forever still floating
before his heated imagination? Sir, if it be his
object to thrust me between the gentleman from
Missouri and himself, in order to rescue the East
from the contest it has provoked with the West, he
shall not be gratified. Sir, I will not be dragged
into the defence of my friend from Missouri. The
South shall not be forced into a conflict not its own.
The gentleman from Missouri is able to fight his
own battles. The gallant West needs no aid from
the South to repel any attack which may be made on
them from any quarter. Let the gentleman from
Massachusetts controvert the facts and arguments
of the gentleman from Missouri, if he can; and, if
he win the victory, let him wear the honors. I shall
not deprive him of his laurels.

REPLY TO HAYNE-WEBSTER.
The masterpiece from which this is taken was delivered as a retort
to Mr. Hayne's personal attack upon Mr. Webster. See the preceding
selection.
I am not one of those, sir, who esteem any tribute
of regard, whether light and occasional, or more
serious and deliberate, which may be bestowed on
others, as so much unjustly withholden from them-
selves. But the tone and manner of the gentleman's
question forbid me thus to intercept it. I am not at
liberty to consider it as nothing more than a civility
to his friend. It had an air of taunt and disparage-
ment, a little of the loftiness of asserted superiority,
which does not allow me to pass it over without
notice. It was put as a question for me to answer,
and so put as if it were dificult for me to answer,
whether I deemed the member from Missouri an
over-match for myself in debate here. It seems to
me, sir, that this is extracrdinary language, and an
extraordinary tone, for the discussions of this body.
Matches and over-matches! Those terms are
more applicable elsewhere than here, and fitter for
other assemblies than this. Sir, the gentleman seems
to forget where and what we are. This is a senate,
a senate of equals; of men of individual honor and
personal character, and of absolute independence.
We know no masters; we acknowledge no dictators.
This is a hall for mutual consultation and discus-
sion, not an arena for the exhibition of champions.
I offer myself, sir, as a match for no man; I throw
the challenge of debate at no man's feet. But then,
sir, since the honorable member has put the question
in a manner that calls for an answer, I will give him

an answer; and I tell him, that, holding myself to
be the humblest of the members here, I yet know
nothing in the arm of his friend from Missouri,
either alone, or when aided by the arm of his friend
from South Carolina, that need deter even me from
espousing whatever opinions I may choose to
espouse, from debating whenever I may choose to
debate, or from speaking whatever I may see fit to
say, on the floor of the Senate.
Sir, when uttered as a matter of commendation
or compliment, I should dissent from nothing which
the honorable member might say of his friend. Still
less do I put forth any pretensions of my own. But,
when put to me as matter of taunt, I throw it back,
and say to the gentleman tnat he could possibly say
nothing less likely than such a comparison to wound
my pride of personal character. The anger of its
tone rescued the remark from intentional irony,
which, otherwise, probably would have been its gen-
eral acceptation. But, sir, if it be imagined that by
this mutual quotation and commendation, if it be
supposed that, by casting the characters of the
drama, assigning to each his part,—to one, the
attack; to another, the cry of onset;—or, if it be
thought that by a loud and empty vaunt of antici-
pated victory any laurels are to be won here; if it
be imagined, especially, that any or all these things
shall shake any purpose of mine, I can tell the
honorable member once for all, that he is greatly

temper; but if provoked, as I trust I never shall
allow myself to be, into crimination and recrimina-
tion, the honorable member may, perhaps, find that
in that contest there will be blows to take as well
as blows to give; that others can state comparisons
as significant, at least, as his own; and that his
impunity may, perhaps, demand of him whatever
powers of taunt and sarcasm he may possess. I
commend him to a prudent husbandry of his re-
sources.
THE CONDUCT OF THE SOUTH DURING THE
REVOLUTION
-HAYNE.
If there be one state in the Union, Mr. President,
(and I say it not in a boastful spirit), that may
challenge comparisons with any other for an uni-
form, zealous, ardent, and uncalculating devotion to
the Union, that state is South Carolina. Sir, from
the very commencement of the Revolution up to this
hour there is no sacrifice, however great, she has
not cheerfully made, no service she has ever hesi-
tated to perform. She has adhered to you in your
prosperity; but in your adversity she has clung to
you with more than filial affection. No matter what
was the condition of her domestic affairs, though
deprived of her resources, divided by parties, or
surrounded with difficulties, the call of the country
has been to her as the voice of God. Domestic dis-
cord ceased at the sound; every man became at once
reconciled to his brethern, and the sons of Carolina
were all seen crowding together to the temple,

bringing their gifts to the altar of their common
country.
What, sir, was the conduct of the South during
the Revolution? Sir, I honor New England for her
conduct in that glorious struggle. But, great as is
the praise which belongs to her, I think at least
equal honor is due to the South. They espoused the
quarrel of their brethren with a generous zeal,
which did not suffer them to stop to calculate their
interest in the dispute. Favorites of the mother
country, possessed of neither ships nor seamen to
create a commercial rivalship, they might have
found in their situation a guarantee that their trade
would be forever fostered and protected by Great
Britain. But, trampling on all considerations either
of interest or of safety, they rushed into the con-
flict, and, fighting for principle, perilled all in the
sacred cause of freedom. Never was there exhibited
in the history of the world higher examples of noble
daring, dreadful suffering and heroic endurance,
than by the Whigs of Carolina during the Revolu-
tion. The whole state from the mountains to the
was overrun by an overwhelming force of
enemy. The fruits of industry perished on the spot
where they were produced or were consumed by the
foe. The "plains of Carolina” drank up the most
precious blood of her citizens. Black and smoking
ruins marked the places which had been the habita-
tions of her children. Driven from their homes into
the gloomy and almost impenetrable swamps, even
there the spirit of liberty survived; and South Caro-
lina, sustained by the example of her Sumters and
her Marions, proved by her conduct that, though

her soil might be overrun, the spirit of her people
was invincible.
SOUTH CAROLINA IN THE WAR OF 1812
--HAYNE.
I come now to the war of 1812, a war, which, I
well remember, was called, in derision (while its
event was doubtful), the Southern war, and some-
times the Carolina war; but which is now univer-
sally acknowledged to have done more for the honor
and prosperity of the country than all other events
in our history put together. What, sir, were the
objects of that war? "Free trade and sailors'
rights!" It was for the protection of Northern
shipping and New England seamen, that the coun-
try flew to arms. What interest had the South in
that contest? If they had sat down coldly to calcu-
late the value of their interests involved in it, they
would have found that they had everything to lose
and nothing to gain. But, sir, with that generous
devotion to country so characteristic of the South,
they only asked if the rights of any portion of their
fellow-citizens had been invaded; and when told that
Northern ships and New England seamen had been
arrested on the common highway of nations, they
felt that the honor of their country was assailed;
and, acting on that exalted sentiment, "which feels
a stain like a wound,” they resolved to seek in open
war for a redress of those injuries which it did not
become freemen to endure. Sir, the whole South,
animated as by a common impulse, cordially united
in declaring and promoting that war. South Caro-
lina sent to your councils, as the advocates and sup-

porters of that war, the noblest of her sons. How
they fulfilled that trust, let a grateful country tell.
Not a measure was adopted, not a battle fought, not
a victory won, which contributed in any degree to
the success of that war, to which Southern councils
and Southern valor did not largely contribute.
MASSACHUSETTS AND SOUTH CAROLINA
-WEBSTER.
Sir, I thank God, that, if I am gifted with little
of the spirit which is said to be able to raise mortals
to the skies, I have yet none, as I trust, of that other
spirit, which would drag angels down. When I shall
be found, sir, in my place here in the Senate or else-
where to sneer at public merit, because it happened
to spring up beyond the little limits of my own state
or neighborhood; when I refuse, for any such cause
or for any cause, the homage due to American
talent, to elevated patriotism, to sincere devotion to
liberty and the country; or, if I see an uncommon
endowment of heaven, if I see extraordinary
capacity and virtue in any son of the South, and if,
moved by local prejudice or gangrened by state
jealousy, I get up here to abate the tithe of a hair
from his just character and just fame, may my
tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth! Sir, let me
recur to pleasing recollections; let me indulge in
refreshing remembrance of the past; let me remind
you that in early times no states cherished greater
harmony, both of principle and feeling, than Massa-
chusetts and South Carolina. Would to God that
mony might again return! Shoulder to shoulder

they went through the Revolution; hand in hand
they stood round the administration of Washington,
and felt his own great arm lean on them for sup-
port. Unkind feeling, if it exist, alienation and
distrust, are the growth, innatural to such soils, of
false principles since sown. They are weeds, the
seeds of which that same great arm never scattered.
Mr. President, I shall enter on no encomium
upon Massachusetts. She needs none. There she
is: behold her, and judge for yourselves. There is
her history: the world knows it by heart. The past,
at least, is secure. There is Boston and Concord and
Lexington and Bunker Hill, and there they will re-
main forever. The bones of her sons, fallen in the
great struggle for Independence, now lie mingled
with the soil of every state from New England to
Georgia; and there they will lie forever. And, sir,
where American liberty raised its first voice, and
where its youth was nurtured and sustained, there
it still lives in the strength of its manhood, and full
of its original spirit. If discord and disunion shall
wound it, if party strife and blind ambition shall
hawk at and tear it, if folly and madness, if uneasi-
ness under salutary and necessary restraints, shall
succeed to separate it from that Union by which
alone its existence is made sure, it will stand in the
end by the side of that cradle in which its infancy
was rocked; it will stretch forth its arm with what-
ever vigor it may still retain over the friends who
gather round it; and it will fall at last, if fall it
must, amidst the proudest monuments of its own
glory and on the very spot of its origin.

CRIME WILL OUT_WEBSTER.
An aged man, without an enemy in the world, in
his own house and in his own bed, is made the vic-
tim of a butcherly murder for mere pay. The fatal
blow is given, and the victim passes, without a
struggle or a motion, from the repose of sleep to the
repose of death. It is the assassin's purpose to make
sure work. He explores the wrist for the pulse. He
feels for it, and ascertains that it beats no longer.
It is accomplished. The deed is done. He retreats,
retraces his steps to the window, passes out through
it as he came in, and escapes. He has done the
murder; no eye has seen him, no ear has heard him.
The secret is his own,—and it is safe.
Ah! Gentlemen, that was a dreadful mistake.
Such a secret can be safe nowhere. The whole crea-
tion of God has neither nook nor corner where the
guilty can bestow it and say it is safe. Not to speak
of that Eye which glances through all disguises and
beholds everything as in the splendor of noon, such
secrets of guilt are never safe from detection, even
by men. True it is, generally speaking, that "mur-
der will out." True it is, that Providence hath so
ordained and doth so govern things, that those who
break the great law of heaven, by shedding man's
blood, seldom succeed in avoiding discovery. Espe-
cially, in a case exciting so much attention as this,
discovery must come, and will come, sooner or later.
A thousand eyes turn at once to explore every man,
every thing, every circumstance, connected with the
time and place; a thousand ears catch every whis-
per; a thousand excited minds intensely dwell on the

scene, shedding all their light, and ready to kindle
the slightest circumstance into a blaze of discovery.
Meantime, the guilty soul cannot keep its own
secret. It is false to itself; or, rather, it feels an
irresistible impulse of conscience to be true to itself.
It labors under its guilty possession and knows not
what to do with it. The human heart was not made
for the residence of such an inhabitant. It finds
itself preyed on by a torment, which it dares not
acknowledge to God nor man. A vulture is devour-
ing it, and it can ask no sympathy or assistance
either from heaven or earth. The secret which the
murderer possesses soon comes to possess him; and,
like the evil spirits of which we read, it overcomes
him and leads him whithersoever it will. He feels it
beating at his heart, rising to his throat, and
demanding disclosure. He thinks the whole world
sees it in his face, reads it in his eyes, and almost
hears its workings in the very silence of his
thoughts. It has become his master. It betrays his
discretion, it breaks down his courage, it conquers
his prudence. When suspicions from without begin
to embarrass him, and the net of circumstance to
entangle him, the fatal secret struggles with still
greater violence to burst forth. It must be con-
fessed; it will be confessed; there is no refuge from
confession but suicide; and suicide is confession.

PART SECOND
Selections for Intermediate Course
Note: The prose oratorical models, selected for
this, the Intermediate Course, are, as will be readily
seen, more difficult than those of the Beginners'
Course, while the lyrics and ballads and other poems
are less difficult than those of the Advanced Course;
hence the student should not be permitt;d to draw
on Course III for selections for class-reading until
he has attained
1. Considerable proficiency in force (expulsive
and explosive), pauses, inflections, modulation, and
pitch, the orotund and guttural qualities of voice,
and gesture; and
2. The ability to adapt, for the purpose of
proper impersonation, voice, attitude, and gesture to
the characters in the ballads and other pieces where
such impersonation is required.
THE SUFFERINGS OF IRELAND-SHEIL.
The population of Ireland has doubled since the
Union. What is the condition of the mass of the
people? Has her capital increased in the same pro-

pestilence, of the Irish hovel, and, if you have the
heart to do so, mock at the calamities of the country

perity of Ireland. The mass of the people are in a
condition more wretched than that of any nation in
Europe; they are worse housed, worse covered,
worse fed, than the basest boors in the provinces of
Russia; they dwell in habitations to which your
swine would not be committed; they are covered
with rags which your beggars would disdain to
wear, and not only do they never taste the flesh of
the animals which crowd into your markets, but,
while the sweat drops from their brows, they never
touch the bread into which their harvests are con-
verted. For you they toil, for you they delve; they
reclaim the bog and drive the plow to the mountain's
top for you. And where does all this misery exist?
In a country teeming with fertility and stamped
with the beneficent intents of God. When the famine
of Ireland prevailed, when her cries crossed the
Channel and pierced your ears and reached your
hearts, the granaries of Ireland were bursting with
their contents, and, while a people knelt down and
stretched out their hands for food, the business of
deportation, the absentee tribute, was going on.
Talk of the prosperity of Ireland! Talk of the
external magnificence of a poor-house, gorged with
misery within!
But the Secretary for the Treasury exclaims: "If
the agitators would let us alone, and allow Ireland
to be tranquil!” The agitators, forsooth! Does he
venture, has he the intrepidity, to speak thus?
Agitators! Against deep potations let the drunkard
rail: at Crockford's let there be homilies against the
dice-box; let every libertine lament the progress of
licentiousness, when his Majesty's ministers deplore

the influence of demagogues and Whigs complain of
agitation. How did you carry the Reform? Was it
not by impelling the people almost to the verge of
revolution? Was there a stimulant for their pas-
sions, was there a provocative for their excitement,
to which you did not resort? If you have forgotten,
do you think that we shall fail to remember your
meetings at Edinburgh, at Paisley, at Manchester,
at Birmingham? Did not three hundred thousand
men assemble? Did they not pass resolutions
against taxes? Did they not threaten to march on
London? Did not two of the cabinet ministers indite
to them epistles of gratitude and of admiration?
And do they now dare, have they the audacity, to
speak of agitation?. Have we not as good a title to
demand the restitution of our Parliament, as the
ministers to insist on the reform of this House?
IMMORTALITY -MASSILLON.
If we wholly perish with the body, what an im-
posture is this whole system of laws, manners, and
usages, on which human society is founded! If we
wholly perish with the body, these maxims of
charity, patience, justice, honor, gratitude, and
friendship, which sages have taught and good men
have practised,—what are they but empty words,
possessing no real and binding efficacy? Why should
we heed them, if in this life only we have hope?
Speak not of duty. What can we owe to the dead,
to the living, to ourselves, if all are or will be
nothing? Who shall dictate our duty, if not our own

pleasures, if not our own passions ? Speak not of
morality. It is a mere chimera, a bugbear of human
invention, if retribution terminate with the grave.
If we must wholly perish, what to us are the
sweet ties of kindred? What the tender names of
parent, child, sister, brother, husband, wife, or
friend? The characters of a drama are not more
illusive. We have no ancestors, no descendants;
since succession cannot be predicated of nothing-
ness. Would we honor the illustrious dead? How
absurd to honor that which has no existence! Would
we take thought for posterity? How frivolous to
concern ourselves for those whose end, like our
own, must soon be annihilation! Have we made a
promise? How can it bind nothing to nothing?
Perjury is but a jest: "The last injunctions of the
dying,—what sanctity have they more than the last
sound of a chord that is snapped, of an instrument
that is broken?
To sum up all: If we must wholly perish, then
is obedience to the laws but an insensate servitude;
rulers and magistrates are but the phantoms which
popular imbecility has raised up; justice is an
unwarrantable infringement upon the liberty of
men,-an imposition, a usurpation; the law of mar-
riage is a vain scruple; modesty, a prejudice; honor
and probity, such stuff as dreams are made of; and
incests, murders, parricides, the most heartless
cruelties, and the blackest crimes, are but the legiti-
mate sports of man's irresponsible nature; while
the harsh epithets attached to them are merely such
as the policy of legislators has invented and im-
posed on the credulity of the people.

Here is the issue to which the vaunted philos.
ophy of unbelievers must inevitably lead. Here is
that social felicity, that sway of reason, that eman-
cipation from error, of which they eternally prate
as the fruit of their doctrines. Accept their maxims,
and the whole world falls back into a frightful
chaos; and all the relations of life are confounded:
and all ideas of vice and virtue are reversed; and
the most inviolable laws of society vanish; and all
moral discipline perishes; and the government of
states and nations has no longer any cement to up-
hold it; and all the harmony of the body politic
becomes discord; and the human race is no more
than an assemblage of reckless barbarians, shame-
less, remorseless, brutal, denaturalized, with no
other law than force, no other check than passion, no
other bond than irreligion, no other god than self!
Such would be the world which impiety would make.
Such would be this world, were a belief in God and
immortality to die out of the human heart.
ABOU BEN ADHEM-LEIGH HUNT.
Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase!)
Awoke one night from a sweet dream of peace,
And saw within the moonlight in his room
Making it rich and like a lily in bloom,
An angel, writing in a book of gold.
Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold,
And to the Presence in the room he said:
"What writest thou ?" The vision raised its head,
And, with a look made all of sweet accord,

Answered: “The names of those who love the Lord.”
"And is mine one?” said Abou. "Nay, not so,"
Replied the angel. Abou spake more low,
But cheerily still; and said: “I pray thee, then,
Write me as one that loves his fellow-men."
The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night
It came again, with a great wakening light,
And showed the names whom love of God had
blessed,
And, lo! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.
SHERIDAN'S RIDE
-THOMAS BUCHANAN READ.
Up from the South at break of day,
Bringing to Winchester fresh dismay,
The affrighted air with a shudder bore,
Like a herald in haste to the chieftain's door,
The terrible grumble and rumble and roar,
Telling the battle was on once more,
And Sheridan twenty miles away.
And wider still those billows of war
Thundered along the horizon's bar;
And louder yet into Winchester rolled
The roar of that red sea uncontrolled,
Making the blood of the listener cold,
As he thought of the stake in that fiery fray,
And Sheridan twenty miles away.
But there is a road from Winchester town,
A good, broad highway leading down;
And there through the flush of the morning light,
A steed as black as the steeds of night

Was seen to pass, as with eagle flight.
As if he knew the terrible need,
He stretched away with his utmost speed;
Hills rose and fell; but his heart was gay,
With Sheridan fifteen miles away.
Still sprang from those swift hoofs, thundering
South,
The dust, like smoke from the cannon's mouth;
Or the trail of a comet, sweeping faster and faster,
Foreboding to traitors the doom of disaster.
The heart of the steed and the heart of the master
Were beating like prisoners assaulting their walls,
Impatient to be where the battle-field calls;
Every nerve of the charger was strained to full play,
With Sheridan only ten miles away.
Under his spurning feet the road
Like an arrowy Alpine river flowed,
And the landscape sped away behind
Like an ocean flying before the wind,
And the steed, like a bark fed with furnace ire,
Swept on with his wild eye full of fire.
But lo! he is nearing his heart's desire;
He is snuffing the smoke of the roaring fray,
With Sheridan only five miles away.
The first that the General saw were the groups
Of stragglers, and then the retreating troops;
What was done?—What to do?-A glance told him
both.
And striking his spurs, with a terrible oath
He dashed down the line, 'mid a storm of huzzas,
And the wave of retreat checked its course there,
because

The sight of the master compelled it to pause.
With foam and with dust the black charger was
gray;
By the flash of his eye and his red nostrils' play,
He seemed to the whole great army to say:
"I have brought you Sheridan all the way,
From Winchester town, to save the day.”
Hurrah, hurrah for Sheridan!
Hurrah, hurrah for horse and man!
And when their statues are placed on high,
Under the dome of the Union sky,
The American soldiers' 'Temple of Fame,
There with the glorious General's name
Be it said in letters both bold and bright:
“Here is the steed that saved the day
By carrying Sheridan into the fight,
From Winchester,—twenty miles away!”

She once was a lady of honor and wealth,
Bright glowed on her features the roses of health;
Her vesture was blended of silk and of gold,
And her motion shook perfume from every fold:
Joy revealed around her, love shone at her side,
And gay was her smile as the glance of a bride;
And light was her step in the mirth-sounding hall,
When she heard of the daughters of Vincent de Paul.
She felt in her spirit the summons of grace,
That called her to live for the suffering race;

And heedless of pleasure, of comfort, of home,
Rose quickly like Mary, and answered, “I come.”
She put from her person the trappings of pride,
And passed from her home with the joy of a bride,
Nor wept at the threshold, as onward she moved;
For her heart was on fire in the cause it approved.
Lost ever to fashion, to vanity lost,
That beauty that once was the song and the toast;
No more in the ball-room that figure we meet,
But gliding at dusk to the wretch's retreat.
Forgot in the halls is that high-sounding name,
For the Sister of Charity blushes at fame;
Forgot are the claims of her riches and birth,
For she barters for heaven the glory of earth.
Those feet that to music could gracefully move,
Now bear her alone on the mission of love;
Those hands that once dangled the perfume and gem
Are tending the helpless, or lifted for them;
That voice that once echoed the song of the vain,
Now whispers relief to the bosom of pain;
And the hair that was shining with diamond and
pearl,
Is wet with the tears of the penitent girl.
Her down-bed, a pallet; her trinkets, a bead;
Her luster, one taper that serves her to read;
Her sculpture, the crucifix nailed by her bed;
Her paintings, one print of the thorn-crowned head;
Her cushion, the pavement, that wearies her knees;
Her music, the psalm, or the sigh of disease;
The delicate lady lives mortified there,
And the feast is forsaken for fasting and prayer.

Yet not to the service of heart and of mind,
Are the cares of that heaven-minded virgin confined,
Like Him whom she loves, to the mansions of grief
She hastes with the tidings of joy and relief.
She strengthens the weary, she comforts the weak,
And soft is her voice in the ear of the sick;
Where want and affliction on mortals attend,
The Sister of Charity there is a friend.
Unshrinking where pestilence scatters his breath,
Like an angel she moves 'mid the vapor of death;
Where rings the loud musket and flashes the sword,
Unfearing she walks, for she follows the Lord.
How sweetly she bends o’er each plague-tainted face
With looks that are lighted with holiest grace;
How kindly she dresses each suffering limb,
For she sees in the wounded the image of Him.
Behold her, ye worldly! behold her, ye vain!
Who shrink from the pathway of virtue and pain;
Who yield up to pleasure your nights and your days,
Forgetful of service, forgetful of praise,
Ye lazy philosophers, self-seeking men,
Ye fireside philanthropists, great at the pen,
How stands in the balance your eloquence weighed
With the life and the deeds of that high-born maid?

The katydid begins to sing;
The early dews are falling;
Into the stone-heap darts the mink,
The swallows skim the river's brink,
And home to the woodland fly the crows,
When over the hill the farm-boy goes,
Cheerily calling,
"Co”, boss! co', boss! co'! co'! co'!"
Farther, farther, over the hill,
Faintly calling, calling still,
“Co', boss! co', boss! co'! co’!"
Into the yard the farmer goes
With grateful heart at the close of day;
Harness and chain are hung away;
In the wagon-shed stand yoke and plow;
The straw's in the stack, the hay in the mow;
The cooling dews are falling;
The friendly sheep his welcome bleat;
The pigs come grunting to his feet;
The whinnying mare her master knows,
When into the yard the farmer goes
His cattle calling,
“Co', boss! co', boss! co'! co'! co’!"
While still the cow-boy, far away,
Goes seeking those that have gone astray,
"Co, boss! co', boss! co'! co'!"
Now to her task the milkmaid goes :
The cattle come crowding through the gate,
Lowing, pushing, little and great;
About the trough, by the farm-yard pump,
The frolicsome yearlings frisk and jump,
While the pleasant dews are falling;

The new milch heifer is quick and shy,
But the old cow waits with tranquil eye;
And the white stream into the bright pail flows,
When to her task the milkmaid goes,
Soothingly calling,
“So, boss! so, boss! so! so! so!”
The cheerful milkmaid takes her stool,
And sits and milks in the twilight cool,
Saying, "so, so, boss! so! so!”
To supper at last the farmer goes :
The apples are pared, the paper read,
The stories are told, ther all to bed :
Without, the cricket's ceaseless song
Makes shrill the silence all night long;
The heavy dews are falling:
The housewife's hand has turned the lock;
Drowsily ticks the kitchen clock;
The household sinks to deep repose,
But still in sleep the farm-boy goes
Singing, calling,
"Co", boss! co', boss! co'! co'! co'!"
And oft the milkmaid in her dreams
Drums on the pail with the flashing streams,
Murmuring, “So, boss! so!"

Reeled from the sabre-stroke,
Shattered and sundered.

Stormed at with shot and shell,
While horse and hero fell,
They that had fought so well
Came through the jaws of death
Back from the mouth of hell,
All that was left of them,
Left of six hundred.
When can their glory fade?
Oh, the wild charge they made!
All the world wondered,
Honor the charge they made!
Honor the Light Brigade,
Noble Six Hundred !
TRUE ELOQUENCE
-DANIEL WEBSTER.
When public bodies are to be addressed on
momentous occasions, when great interests are at
stake and strong passions excited, nothing is valu-
able in speech, further than it is connected with
high intellectual and moral endowments. Clear-
ness, force, and earnestness are the qualities which
produce conviction. True eloquence, indeed, does
not consist in speech. It cannot be brought from
far. Labor and learning may toil for it, but they

will toil in vain. Words and phrases may be mar-
shalled in every way, but they cannot compass it.
It must exist in the man, in the subject, and in the
occasion. Affected passion, intense expression, the
pomp of declamation, all may aspire after it, they
cannot reach it. It comes, if it come at all, like
the outbreaking of a fountain from the earth, or
the bursting forth of volcanic fires, with spontan-
eous, original, native force. The graces taught in
the schools, the costly ornaments and studied con-
trivances of speech, shock and disgust men, when
their own lives, and the fate of their wives, their
children and their country hang on the decision of
the hour. Then words have lost their power,
rhetoric is vain, and all elaborate oratory con-
temptible. Even genius itself then feels rebuked
and subdued, as in the presence of higher qualities.
Then patriotism is eloquent; then self-devotion is
eloquent. The clear conception, outrunning the de-
ductions of logic, the high purpose, the firm resolve,
the dauntless spirit, speaking on the tongue, beam-
ing from the eye, informing every feature, and
urging the whole man onward, right onward, to his
object,—this, this is eloquence; or, rather, it is
something greater and higher than all eloquence,-
it is action, noble, sublime, godlike action.
NATURE PROCLAIMS A DEITY

thunder proclaims Him in the heavens, the ocean
declares His immensity. Man alone has said, there
is no God. Unite in thought at the same instant
the most beautiful objects in nature. Suppose that
you see at once all the hours of the day and all
the seasons of the year: a morning of spring and a
morning of autumn; a night bespangled with stars
and a night darkened by clouds; meadows enamelled
with flowers; forests hoary with snow; fields gilded
by the tints of autumn,—theli alone you will have a
just conception of the universe. While you are
gazing on that sun which is plunging into the vault
of the West, another observer admires him emerging
from the gilded gates of the East. By what incon-
ceivable power does that aged star, which is sinking
fatigued and burning in the shades of the evening,
reappear at the same instant fresh and humid with
the rosy dew of the morning? At every hour of the
day the glorious orb is at once rising, resplendent as
noon-day, and setting in the West; or, rather, our
senses deceive us, and there is, properly speaking,
no East or West, no North or South in the world.
THE FIRST VIEW OF THE HEAVENS
-0. M. MITCHEL.
Often have I swept backward in imagination six
thousand years and stood beside our great ancestor,
as he gazed for the first time upon the going down
of the sun. What strange sensations must have
swept through his bewildered mind, as he watched
the last departing ray of the sinking orb, uncon-
scious whether he should ever behold its return.

Wrapped in a maze of thought, strange and
startling, he suffers his eye to linger long about the
point at which the sun had slowly faded from view.
A mysterious darkness creeps over the face of
nature; the beautiful scenes of earth are slowly
fading one by one from his dimmed vision.
A gloom deeper than that which covers earth
steals across the mind of earth's solitary inhabitant.
He raises his inquiring gaze toward heaven, and lo!
a silver crescent of light, clear and beautiful, hang-
ing in the western sky, meets his astonished gaze.
The young moon charms his untutored vision, and
leads him upward to her bright attendants, which
are now stealing one by one from out the deep blue
sky. The solitary gazer bows, wonders, and adores.
The hours glide by; the silver moon is gone; the
stars are rising, slowly ascending the heights of
heaven, and solemnly sweeping downward in the
stillness of the night. A faint streak of rosy light is
seen in the East; it brightens; the stars fade; the
planets are extinguished; the eye is fixed in mute
astonishment on the growing splendor, till the first
rays of the returning sun dart their radiance on the
young earth and its solitary inhabitant.
The curiosity excited on this first solemn night,
the consciousness that in the heavens God had de-
clared His glory, the eager desire to comprehend the
mysteries that dwell in their bright orbs have clung
through the long lapse of six thousand years to the
descendants of him who arst watched and wondered.
In this boundless field of investigation human genius
has won its most signal victories.

Generation after generation has rolled away, age
after age has swept silently by; but each has
swelled, by its contributions, the stream of dis-
covery. Mysterious movements have been un-
ravelled; mighty laws have been revealed; ponder-
ous orbs have been weighed; one barrier after an-
other has given way to the force of intellect; until
the mind, majestic in its strength, has mounted step
by step up the rocky height of its self-built pyramid,
from whose star-crowned summit it looks out upon
the grandeur of the universe self-clothed with the
prescience of a God.
THE CLOSING YEAR-PRENTICE.
'Tis midnight's holy hour, and silence now
Is brooding like a gentle spirit o'er
The still and pulseless world. Hark! On the winds
The bell's deep tones are swelling: 'tis the knell
Of the departed year. No funeral train
Is sweeping past; yet on the stream and wood
With melancholy light the moon-beams rest
Like a pale, spotless shroud; the air is stirred
As by a mourner's sigh; and on yon cloud
That floats so still and placidly through heaven,
The spirits of the seasons seem to stand,-
Young Spring, bright Summer, Autumn's solemn
form,
And Winter, with his aged locks, and breathe
In mournful cadences that come abroad
Like the far wind-harp's wild and touching wail,
A melancholy dirge o'er the dead year,
Gone from the Earth forever.

'Tis a time
For memory and for fears. Within the deep,
Still chambers of the heart a spectre dim,
Whose tones are like the wizard voice of time,
Heard from the tomb of ages, points its cold
And solemn finger to the beautiful
And holy visions that have passed away,
And left no shadow of their loveliness
On the dead waste of life. That spectre lifts
The coffin-lid of hope and joy and love,
And, bending mournfully above the pale,
Sweet forms that slumber there, scatters dead
flowers
O'er what has passed to nothingness.
The year
Has gone, and with it many a glorious throng
Of happy dreams. Its mark is on each brow,
Its shadow in each heart. In its swift course
It waved its sceptre o'er the beautiful,
And they are not. It laid its pallid hand
Upon the strong man, and the haughty form
Is fallen, and the flashing eye is dim.
It trod the hall of revelry, where thronged
The bright and joyous, and the tearful wail
Of stricken ones is heard where erst the song
And reckless shout resounded.
It passed o'er
The battle-plain, where sword, and spear, and shield,
Flashed in the light of mid-day,—and the strength
Of serried hosts is shivered, and the grass,
Green from the soil of carnage, waves above

The crushed and moldering skeleton. It came
And faded like a wreath of mist at eve;
Yet, ere it melted in the viewless air,
It heralded its millions to their home
In the dim land of dreams.
Remorseless Time!
Fierce spirit of the glass and scythe! What power
Can stay him in his silent course, or melt
His iron heart to pity? On, still on
He presses, and forever. The proud bird,
The condor of the Andes, that can soar
Through heaven's unfathomable depths, or brave
The fury of the northern hurricane,
And bathe his plumage in the thunder's home,
Furls his broad wings at nightfall, and sinks down
To rest upon his mountain crag. But time
Knows not the weight of sleep or weariness,
And night's deep darkness has no chain to bind
His rushing pinions.
Revolutions sweep
O'er earth, like troubled visions o'er the breast
Of dreaming sorrow; cities rise and sink
Like bubbles on the water; fiery isles
Spring blazing from the ucean, and go back
To their mysterious caverns; mountains rear
To heaven their bald and blackened cliffs, and bow
Their tall heads to the plain; new empires rise,
Gathering the strength of hoary centuries,
And rush down like the Alpine avalanche,
Startling the nations, and the very stars,
Yon bright and burning blazonry of God,
Glitter awhile in their eternal depths,

And like the Pleiad, loveliest of their train,
Shoot from their glorious spheres, and pass away
To darkle in the trackless void,—yet time,
Time, the tomb-builder, holds his fierce career,
Dark, stern, all-pitiless, and pauses not
Amid the mighty wrecks that strew his path,
To sit and muse like other conquerors
Upon the fearful ruin he has wrought.
THE TWO ROADS
-JEAN PAUL RICHTER.
It was New Year's night. An aged man was
standing at a window. He mournfully raised his
eyes towards the deep blue sky, where the stars were
floating like white lilies on the surface of a clear,
calm lake. Then he cast them on the earth, where
few more helpless beings than himself were moving
towards their inevitable goal, the tomb. Already he
had passed sixty of the stages which lead to it, and
he had brought from his journey nothing but errors
and remorse. His health was destroyed, his mind
unfurnished, his heart sorrowful, and his old age
devoid of comfort.
The days of his youth rose up in a vision before
him, and he recalled the solemn moment when his
father had placed him at the entrance of two roads,
one leading into a peaceful, sunny land, covered with
a fertile harvest, and resounding with soft, sweet
songs; while the other conducted the wanderer into
a deep, dark cave, whence there was no issue, where

poison flowed instead of water, and where serpents
hissed and crawled.
He looked towards the sky and cried out in his
anguish: "O youth, return! O my father, place me
once more at the crossway of life, that I may choose
the better road !" But the days of his youth had
passed away, and his parents were with the
departed. He saw wandering lights float over dark
marshes, and then disappear. "Such," he said,
“were the days of my wasted life!" He saw a star
shoot from heaven, and vanish in darkness athwart
the church-yard. “Behold an emblem of myself !”
he exclaimed; and the sharp arrows of unavailing
remorse struck him to the heart.
Then he remembered his early companions, who
had entered life with him, but who having trod the
paths of virtue and industry were now happy and
honored on this New Year's night. The clock in the
high church-tower struck and the sound, falling on
his ear, recalled the many tokens of the love of his
parents for him, their erring son: the lessons they
had taught him; the prayers they had offered up in
his behalf. Overwhelmed with shame and grief, he
dared no longer look towards that heaven where
they dwelt. His darkened eyes dropped tears, and
with one despairing effort he cried aloud: "Come
back, my early days! Come back !"
And his youth did return; for all this had been
but a dream, visiting his slumbers on New Year's
night. He was still young; his errors only were
no dream. He thanked God fervently that time was
still his own; that he had not yet entered the deep,
dark cavern, but that he was free to tread the road

leading to the peaceful land where sunny harvests
wave.
Ye who still linger on the threshold of life,
doubting which path to choose, remember that when
years shall have passed, and your feet shall stumble
on the dark mountain, you will cry bitterly, but cry
in vain: “O youth, return! Oh, give me back my
early days!"
THANATOPSIS_BRYANT.
To him, who in the love of nature holds
Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
A various language; for his gayer hours
She has a voice of gladness and a smile
And eloquence of beauty, and she glides
Into his darker musings with a mild
And healing sympathy, that steals away
Their sharpness ere he is aware.
When thoughts
Of the last bitter hour come like a blight
Over thy spirit, and sad images
Of the stern agony and shroud and pall
And breathless darkness and the narrow house
Make thee to shudder and grow sick at heart,
Go forth into the open sky and list
To nature's teaching, while from all around,
Earth and her waters and the depths of air,
Comes a still voice:

In all his course; nor yet in the cold ground
Where thy pale form was laid with many tears,
Nor in the embrace of ocean shall exist
Thy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim
Thy growth, to be resolved to earth again;
And, lost each human trace, surrendering up
Thine individual being, shalt thou go
To mix forever with the elements,
To be a brother to th' insensible rock
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain
Turns with his share and treads upon. The oak
Shall send its roots abroad, and pierce thy mold.
Yet not to thy eternal resting place
Shalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish
Couch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down
With patriarchs of the infant world, with kings,
The powerful of the earth, the wise, the good,
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,
All in one mighty sepulcher.
The hills,
Rock-ribbed and ancient as the sun; the vales,
Stretching in pensive quietness between;
The venerable woods; rivers that move
In majesty, and the complaining brooks
That make the meadows green; and, poured round
all,
Old ocean's gray and melancholy waste,
Are but the solemn decorations all
Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,
The planets, all the infinite host of heaven,
Are shining on the sad abodes of death
Through the still lapse of ages.

All that tread
The globe are but a handful to the tribes
That slumber in its bosom. Take the wings
Of morning, and the Barcan desert pierce,
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods
Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound
Save his own dashings, yet the dead are there;
And millions in those solitudes, since first
The flight of years began, have laid them down
In their last sleep: the dead reign there alone.
So shalt thou rest; and what if thou shalt fall
Unnoticed by the living; and no friend
Take note of thy departure? All that breathe
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh
When thou art gone; the solemn brood of care
Plod on: and each one, as before, will chase
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come
And make their bed with thee. As the long train
Of ages glides away, the sons of men,
The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes
In the full strength of years, matron and maid,
And the sweet babe, and the gray-haired man,
Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,
By those, who in their turn, shall follow them.
So live, that when thy summons comes to join
The innumerable caravan, that moves
To that mysterious realm, where each shall take
His chamber in the silent halls of death,
Thou go not like the quarry-slave at night
Scourged to his dungeon, but sustained and soothed
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,

About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.
TO A SKELETON-ANONYMOUS.
Behold this ruin! 'Twas a skull,
Once of ethereal spirit full.
This narrow cell was life's retreat,
This space was thought's mysterious seat.
What beauteous visions filled this spot,
What dreams of pleasure long forgot?
Nor hope nor joy nor love nor fear
Have left one trace of record here.
Beneath this mouldering canopy
Once shone the bright and busy eye;
But start not at the dismal void:
If social love that eye employed,
If with no lawless fire it gleamed,
But through the dews of kindness beamed,
That eye shall be forever bright
When stars and sun are sunk in night.
Within this hollow cavern hung
The ready, swift, and tuneful tongue;
If falsehood's honey it disdained,
And when it could not praise was chained;
If bold in virtue's cause it spoke,
Yet gentle concord never broke,
This silent tongue shall plead for thee
When time unveils eternity.
Say, did these fingers delve the mine
Or with the envied rubies shine?

To hew the rock or wear a gem
Can little now avail to them.
But if the page of truth they sought,
Or comfort to the mourner brought,
These hands a richer meed shall claim
Than all that wait on wealth and fame.
Avails it whether bare or shod
These feet the paths of duty trod?
If from the bowers of ease they fled,
To seek affliction's humble shed;
If grandeur's guilty bribe they spurned,
And home to virtue's cot returned,
These feet with angel wings shall vie,
And tread the palace of the sky.
THE LUCK OF EDENHALL
-LONGFELLOW.
Of Edenhall, the youthful lord
Bids sound the festal trumpet's call;
He rises at the banquet board,
And cries, 'mid the drunken revellers all,
“Now bring me the Luck of Edenhall !”
The butler hears the words with pain,
The house's oldest seneschal,
Takes slow from its silken cloth again
The drinking-glass of crystal tall:
They call it, The Luck of Edenhall."
Then said the Lord : "This glass to praise,
Fill with red wine from Portugal!"
The graybeard with trembling hand obeys;

A purple light shines over all,
It beams from the Luck of Edenhall.
Then speaks the Lord, and waves it light,
"This glass of flashing crystal tall
Gave to my sires the Fountain-Sprite;
She wrote in it, "If this glass doth fall,
Farewell then, O Luck of Edenhall !”
“ 'Twas right a goblet the Fate should be
Of the joyous race of Edenhall.
Deep draughts drink we right willingly;
And willingly ring with merry call,
Kling! klang! to the Luck of Edenhall!"
First rings it deep and full and mild,
Like to the song of a nightingale;
Then like the roar of a torrent wild;
Then mutters at last like the thunder's fall,
The glorious Luck of Edenhall.
"For its keeper takes a race of might,
The fragile goblet of crystal tall;
It has lasted longer than is right.
Kling! klang !with a harder blow than all
Will I try the Luck of Edenhall!"
As the goblet ringing flies apart,
Suddenly cracks the vaulted hall;
And through the rift the wild flames start;
The guests in dust are scattered all,
With the breaking Luck of Edenhall.
In storms the foe with fire and sword:
He in the night had scaled the wall,
Slain by the sword lies the youthful lord,

But holds in his hand the crystal tall,
The shattered Luck of Edenhall.
On the morrow the butler gropes alone,
The graybeard in the desert hall,
He seeks his lord's burnt skeleton,
He seeks in the dismal ruin's fall
The shards of the Luck of Edenhall.
“The stone wall,” saith he, "doth fall aside,
Down must the stately columns fall;
Glass is this earth's luck and pride;
In atoms shall fall this earthly ball
One day like the Luck of Edenhall!"

“Poor fool!” the base and soulless worldling cries,
"To waste his strength for naught, to blanch his
cheek,
And bring pale death upon him in his prime.
Why did he not to pleasure give his days,
His nights to rest, and live while live he might?"
What is't to live? To breathe the vital air,
Consume the fruits of earth, and doze away
Existence? Never! this is living death;
'Tis brutish life, base groveling. E'en the brutes
Of nobler nature live not lives like this.
Shall man, then, formed to be creation's lord,
Stamped with the impress of Divinity, and sealed
With God's own signet, sink below the brute?
Forbid it, heaven! It cannot, must not be!

Oh! when the mighty God from nothing brought
This universe, when at His word the light
Burst forth, the sun was set in heaven,
And earth was clothed in beauty; when the last,
The noblest work of all, from dust He framed
Our bodies in His image, when He placed
Within its temple-shrine of clay the soul,
Th' immortal soul, infused by His own truth,
Did He not show, 'tis this which gives to man
His high prerogative? Why then declare
That he who thinks less of his worthless frame,
And lives a spirit even in this world,
Lives not as well, lives not as long, as he
Who drags out years of life without one thought,
One hope, one wish, beyond the present hour?
How shall we measure life? Not by the years,
The months, the days, the moments that we pass
On earth. By him, whose soul is raised above
Base worldly things, whose heart is fixed in heaven,
His life is measured by that soul's advance,
Its cleansing from pollution and from sin,
The enlargement of its powers, the expanded field
Wherein it ranges, till it glows and burns
With holy joys, with high and heavenly hopes.
When in the silent night all earth lies hushed
In slumber, when the glorious stars shine out,
Each star a sun, each sun a central light
Of some fair system, ever wheeling on
In one unbroken round, and that again
Revolving round another sun,—while all,
Suns, stars, and systems proudly roll along
In one majestic ever-onward course

In space uncircumscribed and limitless,
Oh! think you then the undebaséd soul
Can calmly give itself to sleep, to rest?
No! In the solemn stillness of the night
It soars from earth, it dwells in angels' homes
It hears the burning song, the glowing chant,
That fills the sky-girt vaults of heaven with joy.
It pants, it sighs, to wing its flight from earth,
To join the heavenly choirs and be with God.
And it is joy to muse upon the written page,
Whereon are stamped the gushings of the soul
Of genius; where in never-dying light
It glows and flashes as the lightning's glare;
Or where it burns with ray more mild, more sure,
And wins the soul, that half would turn away
From its more brilliant flashings. These are hours
Of holy joy, of bliss so pure that earth
May hardly claim it. Let his lamp grow dim
And flicker to extinction; let his cheek
Be pale as sculptured marble, and his eye
Lose its bright lustre, till his shrouded frame
Is laid in dust, himself can never die.
His years, 'tis true, are few,—his life is long;
For he has gathered many a precious gem;
Enraptured, he has dwelt where master minds
Have poured their own deep musings, and his heart
Has glowed with love to Him who framed us thus,
Who placed within this worthless tegument
The spark of pure Divinity which shines
With light unceasing.

AGAINST GOVERNMENT EXTRAVAGANCE
CRITTENDEN.
The bill under consideration is intended to
authorize the Treasury Department to issue ten mil-
lions of Treasury Notes, to be applied to the dis-
charge of the expenses of Government. Habits of
extravagance, it seems, are hard to change. They
constitute a disease; ay, sir, a very dangerous one.
That of the present administration came to a crisis
about eight months ago, and it cost the patient ten
millions of Treasury Notes to get round the corner.
And now it is as bad as ever. Another crisis has
come, and the doctors ask for ten millions more. The
disease is desperate. Money or death! They say,
if the bill is rejected, Government must "stop.
What must stop? The laws? The judicial tribunals?
The Legislative bodies? The institutions of the
country? No, no, sir! All these will remain and
go on. What stops, then? Its own extravagance,-
that must stop, and “there's the rub!” Besides, sir,
I must really be permitted to say, that, if to keep
this Administration on its feet is to cost ten millions
of extraordinary supply every six or eight months,
why, Mr. President, the sooner its fate is recorded in

the bills of mortality the better. Let me know how
this money is to be applied. I never will vote a dol-
lar on the mere cry of "exigency!"_"crisis !” I will
be behind no man in meeting the real necessities of
my country, but I will not blindly or heedlessly vote
away the money of the people or involve them in
debt. If the government wants money, let it bor-
row it. If extravagance or necessity shall bring a
national debt upon us, let it come openly, and not
steal upon us in the disguise of Treasury Notes. “O!
but it is no debt,” say gentlemen; "it is only issuing
a few notes, to meet a crisis." Well, sir, whether it
be a national debt, I will not say. This I know, it
will be followed, whatever it is, with the serious and
substantial consequence, that the people of the
United States will have to pay it, every cent of it,
and with interest. Sir, I desire to see this experi-
menting Administration forced to make some
experiments in economy. It is almost the only sort
of experiment to which it seems averse. Its cry is
still for money, money, money! But, for one, I say
to it, "Take physic, Pomp !" Lay aside your extrava-
gance. Too much money has been your bane. And
I do not feel myself required by any duty to grant
you more at present. If I did, it would not be in the
form proposed by the bill.

our country. Against this barbarian king, who in
his battle array reckons as many nations as our
ranks do soldiers, what could united Greece effect ?
In this emergency there is need that some unex-
pected power should interpose itself; that a valor
and devotion, unknown hitherto even to Sparta,
should strike, amaze, confound, this ambitious
despot! From our blood, here freely shed to-day,
shall this moral power, this sublime lesson of
patriotism proceed. To Greece it shall teach the
secret of her strength; to the Persians, the certainty
of their weakness. Before our scarred and bleeding
bodies, we shall see the great king grow pale at his
own victory and recoil affrighted. Or, should he
succeed in forcing the pass of Thermopylae, he will
tremble to learn, that in marching upon our cities he
will find ten thousand after us equally prepared for
death. Ten thousand, do I say? O, the swift con-
tagion of a generous enthusiasm! Our example
shall make Greece all fertile in heroes. An aveng-
ing cry shall follow the cry of her affliction. Coun-
try! Independence! From the Messenian hills to
the Hellespont, every heart shall respond; and a
hundred thousand heroes, with one sacred accord,
shall arm themselves in unulation of our unanimous
death. These rocks shall give back the echo of their
oaths. Then shall our little band, the brave three
hundred, from the world of shades revisit the scene;
behold the haughty Xerxes, a fugitive, re-cross the

Yes, fellow-soldiers, history and posterity shall
consecrate our ashes. Wherever courage is honored
through all time, shall Thermopylæ and the Spartan
three hundred be remembered. Ours shall be an
immortality such as no human glory has yet at-
tained. And when ages shall have swept by, and
Sparta's last hour shall have come, then even in her
ruins shall she be eloquent. Tyrants shall turn
away from them, appalled; but the heroes of liberty,
the poets, the sages, the historians of all time, shall
invoke and bless the memory of the gallant three
hundred of Leonidas.
LOVE OF COUNTRY AND HOME
-JAMES MONTGOMERY.
There is a land, of every land the pride,
Beloved by heaven o'er all the world beside;
Where brighter suns dispense serener light,
And milder moons imparadise the night:
There is a spot of earth supremely blest,
A dearer, sweeter spot than all the rest,
Where man, creation's tyrant, casts aside
His sword and sceptre, pageantry and pride,
While in his softened looks benignly blend
The sire, the son, the husband, brother, friend.-
“Where shall that land, that spot of earth, be
found ?"
Art thou a man? A patriot? Look around !
0, thou shalt find, howe'er thy footsteps roam,
That land thy country, and that spot thy home!
On Greenland's rocks, o'er rude Kamchatka's plains,
In pale Siberia's desolate domains;

When the wild hunter takes his lonely way,
Tracks through tempestuous snows his savage prey,
Or, wrestling with the might of raging seas,
Where round the Pole the eternal billows freeze,
Plucks from their jaws the stricken whale, in vain
Plunging down headlong through the whirling main,
His wastes of snow are lovlier in his eye
Than all the flowery vales beneath the sky,
And dearer far than Cæsar's palace-dome,
His cavern-shelter, and his cottage-home.
O'er China's garden-fields and peopled floods,
In California's pathless world of woods;
Round Andes' heights, where Winter, from his
throne,
Looks down in scorn upon the Summer zone;
By the gay borders of Bermuda's isles,
Where Spring with everlasting verdure smiles;
On pure Madeira's vine-robed hills of health;
In Java's swamps of pestilence and wealth;
Where Babel stood, where wolves and jackals drink,
'Midst weeping willows, on Euphrates' brink;
On Carmel's crest; by Jordan's reverend stream,
Where Canaan's glories vanished like a dream;
Where Greece, a spectre, haunts her heroes' graves,
And Rome's vast ruins darken Tiber's waves;
Where broken-hearted Switzerland bewails
Her subject mountains and dishonored vales;
Where Albion's rocks exult amidst the sea,
Around the beauteous isle of Liberty ;-
Man, through all ages of revolving time,
Unchanging man, in every varying clime,
Deems his own land of every land the pride,

PHILIP AN ENEMY OF ATHENIAN
DEMOCRACY-DEMOSTHENES.
There are persons among you, O Athenians, who
think to confound a speaker by asking, "What, then,
is to be done ?" To which I might answer: “Nothing
that you are doing; everything that you leave
undone!” And it would be a just and a true reply.
But I will be more explicit; and may these men, so
ready to question, be equally ready to act. In the
first place, Athenians, admit the incontestable fact,
that Philip has broken your treaties; that he has
declared war against you. Let us have no more
crimination and recrimination on this point! And
then, recognize the fact, that he is the mortal enemy
of Athens, of its very soil, of all within its walls,
ay, of those even who most flatter themselves that
they are high in his good graces. For, what Philip
most dreads and abhors is our liberty, our demo-
cratic system. For the destruction of that, all his
snares are laid, all his projects are shaped. And in
this is he not consistent? He is well aware that,
though he should subjugate all the rest of Greece,
his conquest would be insecure, while your democ-
racy stands. He knows that, should he experience
one of those reverses to which the lot of humanity
is so liable, it would be into your arms that all those
nations, now forcibly held under his yoke, would

rush. Is there a tyrant to be driven back ?-Athens
is in the field. Is there a people to be enfranchised ?
-Lo, Athens, prompt to aid! What wonder, then,
that Philip should be impatient while Athenian
liberty is a spy upon his evil days? Be sure, O my
countrymen, that he is your irreconcilable foe; that
it is against Athens that he musters and disposes
all his armaments; against Athens that all his
schemes are laid.
What, then, ought you, as wise men, convinced
of these truths, to do? You ought to shake off your
fatal lethargy; contribute according to your means;
summon
your allies
allies to contribute; and take
measures to retain the troops already under arms;
so that if Philip has an army prepared to
attack and subjugate all the Greeks, you may also
have one ready to succor and to save them. Tell me
not of the trouble and expense which this will in-
volve. I grant it all. But consider the dangers that
menace you, and how much you will be the gainers
by engaging heartily at once in the general cause.
Indeed, should some god assure you that, however
inactive and unconcerned you might remain, yet in
the end you should not be molested by Philip, still
it would be ignominious, (Be witness, heaven!)-it
would be beneath you, beneath the dignity of your
State, beneath the glory of your ancestors, to sacri-
fice to your own selfish repose the interests of all
the rest of Greece. Rather would I perish than
recommend such a course. Let some other man urge
it upon you, if he will; and listen to him, if you can.
But, if my sentiments are yours,-if you foresee, as
I do, that the more we leave Philip to extend his

conquests, the more we are fortifying an enemy,
whom, sooner or later, we must cope with,—why do
you hesitate? What wait you? When will you put
forth your strength? Wait you the constraint of
necessity? What necessity do you wait? Can there
be a greater for freemen, than the prospect of dis-
honor? Do you wait for that? It is here already;
it presses, it weighs on us now. Now, did I say?
Long since,long since, was it before us, face to
face. True, there is still another necessity in re-
serve,the necessity of slaves,-blows and stripes !
Wait you for them? The gods forbid! The very
words, in this place, are an indignity!
AGAINST AWARDING A CROWN TO
DEMOSTHENES-AESCHINES.
When Demothenes boasts to you, O Athenians,
of his democratic zeal, examine, not his harangues,
but his life; not what he professes to be, but what
he really is ;-redoubtable in words, impotent in
deeds; plausible in speech, perfidious in action. As
to his courage, has he not himself, before the
assembled people, confessed his poltroonery ? By
the laws of Athens, the man who refuses to bear
arms, the coward, the deserter of his post in battle,
is excluded from all share in the public delibera-
tions, denied admission to our religious rites, and
rendered incapable of receiving the honor of a
crown. Yet now it is proposed to crown a man
whom your laws expressly disqualify.
Which, think you, was the more worthy citizen,
Themistocles, who commanded your fleet when you

vanquished the Persian at Salamis, or Demosthenes,
the deserter? Miltiades, who conquered the Bar-
barians at Marathon, or this hireling traitor ?
Aristides, surnamed the Just, or Demosthenes, who
merits a far different surname? By all the gods of
Olympus, it is a profanation to mention in the same
breath this monster and those great men. Let him
cite, if he can, one among them all to whom a crown
was decreed. And was Athens ungrateful ? No!
She was magnanimous, and those uncrowned citi-
zens were worthy of Athens. They placed their
glory, not in the letter of a decree, but in the remem-
brance of a country, of which they had merited well,
-in the living, imperishable remembrance.
And now a popular orator, the mainspring of our
calamities, a deserter from the field of battle, a
deserter from the city, claims of us a crown, exacts
the honor of a proclamation. Crown him! Pro-
claim his worth! My countrymen, this would not
be to exalt Demosthenes, but to degrade yourselves,
to dishonor those brave men who perished for you
in battle. Crown him! Shall his recreancy win
what was denied to their devotion? This would
indeed be to insult the memory of the dead, and to
paralyze the emulation of the living.
When Demosthenes tells you that as ambassador
he wrested Byzantium from Philip,—that as orator,
he roused the Acarnanians and subdued
subdued the
Thebans, let not the braggart impose on you. He
flatters himself that the Athenians are simpletons
enough to believe him, as if in him they cherished
the very genius of persuasion, instead of a vile

calumniator. But when, at the close of his defence,
he shall, summon to his aid his accomplices in cor-
ruption, imagine then, O Athenians, that you behold
at the foot of this tribune, from which I now address
you the great benefactors of the Republic arrayed
against them. Solon, who environed our liberty
with the noblest institutions,—Solon, the philos-
opher, the mighty legislator,—with that benignity
so characteristic, implores you not to pay more
regard to the honeyed phrases of Demosthenes than
to your own oaths, your own laws. Aristides, who
fixed for Greece the apportionment of her contribu-
tions, and whose orphan daughters were dowered by
the people, is moved to indignation at this prostitu-
tion of justice, and exclaims: "Think on your
fathers! Arthmius of Zelia brought gold from
Media into Greece, and for the act barely escaped
death in banishment; and now Demosthenes, who
has not merely brought gold, but who received it as
the price of treachery, and still retains it-
Demosthenes it is unblushingly proposed to invest
with a golden crown! Froin those who fell at Mara-
thon and at Platæa, from Themistocles, from the
very sepulchres of your ancestors, issues the pro-
testing groan of condemnation and rebuke.

despicable by nature, and incapable of any trace of
generous and noble deeds; ape of a tragedian, third-
rate actor, spurious orator! For what, Æschines, ,
does your eloquence profit the country? You now
descant upon what is past and gone; as if a phy-
sician, when called to patients in a sinking state,
should give no advice, nor prescribe any course by
which the disease might be cured; but, after one
of them had died, and the last offices were perform-
ing to his remains, should follow him to the grave,
and expound how the poor man never would have
died had such and such things only been done.
Moonstricken! Is it now that at length you too
speak out?
As to the defeat, that incident in which you so
exult (wretch! who should rather mourn for it),
look through my whole conduct, and you shall find
nothing there that brought down this calamity on
my country. Consider only, Athenians: Never,
from any embassy upon which you sent me, did I
come off worsted by Philip's ambassadors; not from
Thessaly, not from Ambracia, not from Illyria, not
from the Thracian kings, not from the Byzantians,
nor from any other quarter whatever,—nor finally,
of late, from Thebes. But wheresoever his negotia-
tors were overcome in debate, thither Philip
marched, and carried the day by his arms. Do you,
then, exact this of me? And are you not ashamed,
at the moment you are upbraiding me for weakness,
to require that I should defy him single-handed,
and by force of words alone? For what other
weapons had I? Certainly not the lives of men, nor
the fortune of warriors, nor the military operations

of which you are so blundering as to demand an
account at my hands.
But, whatever a minister can be accountable for,
-make of that the strictest scrutiny, and I do not
object. Now, what falls within this description?
To decry events in their first beginnings, to cast his
look forward, and to warn others of their approach.
All this I have done. Then, to confine within the
narrowest bounds all delays, and backwardness, and
ignorance, and contentiousness,faults which are
inherent and unavoidable in all States; and, on the
other hand, to promote unanimity, and friendly dis-
positions, and zeal in the performance of public
duty; and all these things I likewise did, nor can any
man point out any of them that, so far as depended
on me, was left undone.
If, then, it should be asked by what means Philip
for the most part succeeded in his operations, every
one would answer, by his army, by his largesses, by
corrupting those at the head of affairs. Well, then,
I neither had armies, nor did I command them; and
therefore the argument respecting military opera-
tions cannot touch me. Nay, in so far as I was
inaccessible to bribes, there I conquered Philip. For,
as he who purchases any one overcomes him who
has received the price and sold himself, so he who
will not take the money, nor consent to be bribed,
has conquered the bidder. Thus, as far as I am
concerned, this country stands unconquered.

PUBLIUS CORNELIUS SCIPIO TO HIS ARMY
BEFORE BATTLE-LIVY.
This and the following selection are extracted from speeches, as re-
ported by Livy, delivered by two opposing generals to their armies,
(Scipio to the Romans and Hannibal to the Carthagenians) before the
battle of Ticinus, in which the Carthagenians were victorious.
I would have you fight, O soldiers, not only with
that spirit with which you are wont to encounter
other enemies, but with a certain indignation and
resentment, such as you might experience if you
should see your slaves suddenly taking up arms
against you. We might have slain these Cartha-
genians, when they were shut up in Eryx, by
hunger, the most dreadful of human tortures. We
might have carried over our victorious fleet to
Africa, and in a few days have destroyed Carthage
without opposition. We yielded to their prayers for
pardon; we released them from the blockade; we
made peace with them when conquered; and we
afterwards held them under our protection, when
they were borne down by the African war. In return
for these benfits, they come, under the leadership of
a hot-brained youth, to lay waste our country. Ah!
Would that the contest on your side were now for
glory, and not for safety! It is not for the possession
of Sicily and Sardinia, but for Italy, that you must
fight; nor is there another army behind, which,
should we fail to conquer, can resist the enemy; nor
are there other Alps, during the passage of which,
fresh forces may be procured. Here, soldiers, here
we must make our stand. Here we must fight, as if
we fought before the walls of Rome. Let every man
bear in mind, it is not only his own person, but his
wife and children he must now defend. Nor let the

thought of them alone possess his mind. Let him
remember that the Roman Senate, the Roman
people, are looking with anxious eyes to our exer-
tions; and that, as our valor and our strength shall
this day be, such will be the fortune of Rome, such
the welfare, nay, the very existence of our country.
HANNIBAL TO HIS ARMY-LIVY.
See the foregoing selection.
Here, soldiers, you must either conquer or die.
On the right and left two seas enclose you, and you
have no ship to fly to for escape. The river Po
around you,—the Po, larger and more impetuous
than the Rhone,—the Alps behind, scarcely passed
by you when fresh and vigorous, hem you in. Here
fortune has granted you the termination of your
labors; here she will bestow a reward worthy of
the service you have undergone. All the spoils that
Rome has amassed by so many triumphs will be
yours. Think not that, in proportion as this war is
great in name, the victory will be difficult. From
the Pillars of Hercules, from the ocean, from the
remotest limits of the world, over mountains and
rivers, you have advanced victorious through the
fiercest nations of Gaul and Spain. And with whom
are you now to fight? With a raw army, which this
very summer was beaten, conquered, and sur-
rounded; an army unknown to their leader, and he
to them. Shall I compare myself, almost born and
certainly bred in the tent of my father, that illus-
trious commander,-myself, the conqueror, not only
of the Alpine nations, but of the Alps themselves,

myself, who was the pupil of you all, before I became
your commander,—to this six months' general? Or
shall I compare his army with mine?
On what side soever I turn my eyes, I behold all
full of courage and strength: a veteran infantry; a
most gallant cavalry; you, our allies, most faithful
and valiant; you, Carthagenians, whom not only your
country's cause, but the justest anger, impels to
battle. The valor, the confidence of invaders, are
ever greater than those of the defensive party. As
the assailants in this war, we pour down with hostile
standards upon Italy. We bring the war. Suffering,
injury, and indignity, fire our minds. First they de-
manded me, your leader, for punishment; and then
all of you, who had laid siege to Saguntum. And, had
we been given up, they would have visited us with the
severest tortures. Cruel and haughty nation! Every-
thing must be yours, and at your disposal! You are
to prescribe to us with whom we shall have war, with
whom peace! You are to shut us up by the boun-
daries of mountains and rivers, which we must not
pass! But you—you are not to observe the limits
yourselves have appointed! "Pass not the Iberus!"
What next? "Saguntum is on the Iberus. You must
not move a step in any direction !”—Is it a small
thing that you have deprived us of our most ancient
provinces, Sicily and Sardinia? Will you take Spain
also? Should we yield Spain, you will cross over
into Africa. Will cross, did I say? They have sent
the two Consuls of this year, one to Africa, the other
to Spain.
Soldiers, there is nothing left to us in any quar-
ter, but what we can vindicate with our swords.

Let those be cowards who have something to look

There is a necessity for us to be brave. There is no
alternative but victory or death; and, if it must be
death, who would not rather encounter it in battle
than in flight? The immortal gods could give no
stronger incentive to victory. Let but these truths

PENSION LIST RIDICULED-CURRAN.
This polyglot of wealth, this museum of curiosi-
ties, the Pension List, embraces every link in the
human chain, every description of men, women and
children, from the exalted excellence of a Hawke or
a Rodney to the debased situation of the lady who
humbleth herself that she may be exalted. But the
lessons it inculcates form its greatest perfection. It
teacheth, that sloth and vice may eat that bread
which virtue and honesty may starve for after they
have earned it. It teaches the idle and dissolute to
look up for that support which they are too proud
to stoop and earn. It directs the minds of men to
an entire reliance on the ruling Power of the State,
who feeds the ravens of the Royal aviary, that cry
continually for food. It teaches them to imitate
those saints on the Pension List, that are like the
lilies of the field: they toil not, neither do they spin,
and yet are arrayed like Solomon in his glory. In
fine, it teaches a lesson, which, indeed, they might
have learned from Epictetus, that it is sometimes

good not to be over-virtuous; it shows, that, in pro-
portion as our distresses increase, the munificence
of the Crown increases also; in proportion as our
clothes are rent, the royal mantie is extended
over us.
Notwithstanding that the Pension List, like
charity, covers a multitude of sins, give me leave to
consider it as coming home to the members of this
House; give me leave to say, that the Crown, in
extending its charity, its liberality, its profusion, is
laying a foundation for the independence of Parlia-
ment; for hereafter, instead of orators or patriots
accounting for their conduct to such mean and un-
worthy persons as freeholders, they will learn to
despise them, and look to the first man in the State;
and they will by so doing have this security for their
independence, that while any man in the kingdom
has a shilling, they will not want one.

That father, faint in death below, his voice no longer
heard.
He called aloud: "Say, father, say, if yet my task
is done!"
He knew not that the chieftain lay, unconscious of
his son.
"Speak, father!" once again he cried, "if I may yet
be gone!
And”—but the booming shots replied, and fast the
flames rolled on.
Upon his brow he felt their breath, and in his wav-
ing hair,
And looked from that lone post of death, in still, yet
brave despair.
And shouted but once more aloud, "My father!
Must I stay?"
While o'er him fast, through sail and shroud, the
wreathing fires made way.
They wrapped the ship in splendor wild; they
caught the flag on high;
And streamed above the gallant child, like banners
in the sky.
There came a burst of thunder sound, the boy-oh,
where was he?
Ask of the winds, that far around with fragments
strewed the sea,-
With mast, and helm, and pennon fair, that well had
borne their part.
But the noblest thing which perished there was that
young, faithful heart.

THE PATRIOT'S PASS-WORD
JAMES MONTGOMERY.
"Make way for liberty !” he cried,
Made way for liberty, and died.
In arms the Austrian phalanx stood,
A living wall, a human wood;
Impregnable their front appears,
All horrent with projected spears.
Opposed to these, a hovering band
Contended for their father-land;
Peasants, whose new-found strength had broke
From manly necks the ignoble yoke;
Marshalled once more at Freedom's call,
They came to conquer or to fall.
And now the work of life and death
Hung on the passing of a breath;
The fire of conflict burned within;
The battle trembled to begin;
Yet, while the Austrians held their ground,
Point for assault was nowhere found;
Where'er the impatient Switzers gazed,
Th' unbroken line of lances blazed;
That line 'twere suicide to meet,
And perish at their tyrants' feet.
How could they rest within their graves,
To leave their homes the haunts of slaves ?
Would they not feel their children tread
With clanking chains above their head?
It must not be: this day, this hour,
Annihilates th' invaders power!
All Switzerland is in the field;
She will not fly, she cannot yield.

She must not fall; her better fate
Here gives her an immortal date.
Few were the numbers she could boast,
But every freeman was a host,
And felt as 'twere a secret known
That one should turn the scale alone,
While each unto himself was he
On whose sole arm hung victory.
It did depend on one, indeed;
Behold him,-Arnold Winkelried!
There sounds not to the trump of fame
The echo of a nobler name.
Unmarked he stood amid the throng,
In rumination deep and long,
Till you might see, with sudden grace,
The very thought come o'er his face;
And, by the motion of his form,
Anticipate the bursting storm;
And, by the uplifting of his brow,
Tell where the bolt would strike, and how.
But 'twas no sooner thought than done,
The field was in a moment won.
"Make way for liberty !” he cried,
Then ran, with arms extended wide,
As if his dearest friend to clasp;
Ten spears he swept within his grasp.
"Make way for liberty !” he cried,
Their keen points crossed from side to side:
He bowed amongst them like a tree,
And thus made way for liberty.
Swift to the breach his comrades fly,
“Make way for liberty!” they cry,

And through the Austrian phalanx dart,
As rushed the spears through Arnold's heart;
While, instantaneous as his fall,
Rout, ruin, panic, seized them all:
An earthquake could not overthrow
A city with a surer blow.
Thus Switzerland again was free,
Thus death made way for liberty.
THE CHARCOAL MAN -TROWBRIDGE.
Though rudely blows the wintry blast,
And sifting snows fall white and fast,
Mark Haley drives along the street,
Perched high upon his wagon seat;
His sombre face the storm defies,
And thus from morn till eve he cries,
"Charco'! charco'!"
While echo faint and far replies,
"Hark, O! hark, O!”
“Charco’!”—“Hark, O!”—Such cheery sounds
Attend him on his daily rounds.
The dust begrimes his ancient hat;
His coat is darker far than that;
'Tis odd to see his sooty form
All speckled with the feathery storm;
Yet in his honest bosom lies
Nor spot nor speck, though still he cries:
"Charco'! charco'!"
And many a roguish lad replies,
"Ark, ho! ark ho!"

“Charco’!”—“Ark, ho!”-Such various sounds
Announce Mark Haley's morning rounds.
Thus all the cold and wintry day
He labors much for little pay;
Yet feels no less of happiness
Than many a richer man, I guess,
When through the shades of eve he spies
The light of his own home, and cries,
"Charco'! charco'!"
And Martha from the door replies,-
"Mark, ho! Mark, ho!”
"Charco'!”—“Mark, ho!" Such joy abounds
When he has closed his daily rounds.
The hearth is warm, the fire is bright,
And while his hand, washed clean and white,
Holds Martha's tender hand once more,
His glowing face bends fondly o'er
The crib wherein his darling lies,
And in a coaxing tone he cries,-
"Charco'! charco'!"
And baby with a laugh replies,
"Ah, go! ah, go"
"Charco'!"_"Ah, go!"—while at the sounds
The mother's heart with gladness bounds.
Then honored be the charcoal man!
Though dusky as an African,

As through an Alpine village passed
A youth, who bore, 'mid snow and ice,
A banner with the strange device,

His brow was sad; his eye beneath
Flashed like a falchion from its sheath;
And like a silver clarion rung
The accents of that unknown tongue,

Of household fires gleam warm and bright;
Above, the spectral glaciers shone;

THE INCORRUPTIBLE PATRIOT-JONES.
I spurn your gilded bait, oh king! My faith you can-
not buy.
Go, tamper with some craven heart, and dream of
victory.
My honor never shall be dimmed by taking such a
bribe:
The honest man can look above the mercenary
tribe.
Carlisle and Eden may consort to bring about a
peace;
Our year of jubilee will be the year of our release.
Until your fleets and armies are all remanded back,
Freedom's avenging angel will keep upon your

What said our noble Laurens ? What answer did he
make?
Did he accept your overtures, and thus our cause
forsake?
No! As his country's mouth-piece, he spoke the
burning words:
“Off with conciliation's terms; the battle is the
Lord's!”
Are ye afraid of Bourbon's house? And do ye now
despair,
Because to shield the perishing the arm of France
is bare?
That treaty of alliance, which makes a double
strife,
Has, like the sun, but warmed afresh your viper
brood to life.
And art thou, Johnstone, art thou, pray, upon this
mission sent,
To keep at distance by thy craft the throne's dis-
memberment?
Dismemberment !-ah, come it must, for union is
a sin,
When parents' hands the furnace heat, and thrust
the children in.
Why, English hearts there are at home, that
pulsate with our own;
Voices beyond Atlantic's waves send forth a loving
tone;
Within the Cabinet are men who would not offer
gold,
To see our country's liberty, like chattel, bought
and sold.

You say that office shall be mine if I the traitor

Can office ever compensate for honesty's decay?
Ten thousand pounds! ten thousand pounds! Shall
I an Esau prove,
And for a mess of pottage sell the heritage I love?

Or Valley Forge annihilate, and wipe away its

If you can make the orphans' tears forget to plead

Then you may find a patriot's soul that owns a

The King of England cannot buy the faith which

tended rule; we, for our country, our altars, and our
our homes. They follow an adventurer whom they
fear, and obey a power which they hate; we serve a
monarch whom we love, a God Whom we adore.
Whenever they move in anger, desolation tracks their
progress. Whenever they pause in amity, affliction
mourns their friendship. They boast they come but
to improve our state, enlarge our thoughts, and free
us from the yoke of error. Yes, they will give en-
lightened freedom to our minds, who are themselves
the slaves of passion, avarice, and pride. They offer
us their protection. Yes, such protection as vultures
give to lambs,-covering and devouring them! They
call on us to barter all of good we have enhanced
and proved for the desperate chance of something
better which they promise. Be our plain answer
this: The throne we honor is the people's choice;
the laws we reverence are our brave fathers' legacy;
the faith we follow teaches us to live in bonds of
charity with all mankind, and die with hope of bliss
beyond the grave. Tell your invaders this; and tell
them, too, we seek no change, and, least of all, such
change as they would bring us!
CATILINE TO HIS ARMY --BEN JOHNSON.
I never yet knew, soldiers, that in fight
Words added virtue unto valiant men;
Or that a general's oration made
An army fall or stand: but how much prowess,
Habitual or natural, each man's breast
Was owner of, so much in act it showed.

Whom neither glory nor danger can excite,
'Tis vain to attempt with speech.
Two armies wait us, soldiers : one from Rome,
The other from the provinces of Gaul.
The sword must now direct and cut our passage.
I only, therefore, wish you, when you strike,
To have your valors and your souls about you;
And think you carry in your laboring hands
The things you seek,glory and liberty.
For by your swords the Fates must be instructed.
If we can give the blow, all will be safe;
We shall not want provision nor supplies;
The colonies and free towns will lie open;
Where, if we yield to fear, expect no place
Nor friend, to shelter those whom their own fortune
And ill-used arms have left without protection.
You might have lived in servitude or exile,
Or safe at Rome, depending on the great,
But that you thought those things unfit for men;
And in that thought, my friends, you then were
valiant;
For no man ever yet changed peace for war,
But he that meant to conquer. Hold that purpose!
Meet the opposing army in that spirit!
There's more necessity you should be such,
In fighting for yourselves, than they for others.
He's base who trusts his feet, whose hands are
armed.
Methinks I see death and the Furies waiting
What we will do, and all the heaven at leisure
For the great spectacle. Draw, then, your swords!

JAFFAR-LEIGH HUNT.
Jaffar, the Barmecide, the good vizier,
The poor man's hope, the friend without a peer,-
Jaffar was dead, slain by a doom unjust;
And guilty Haroun, sullen with mistrust
Of what the good, and e'en the bad, might say,
Ordained that no man living, from that day,
Should dare to speak his name on pain of death.
All Araby and Persia held their breath;
All but the brave Mondeer; he, proud to show
How far for love a grateful soul could go,
And facing death for every scorn and grief
(For his great heart wanted a great relief),
Stood forth in Bagdad daily in the square,
Where once had stood a happy house, and there
Harangued the tremblers at the Simitar
On all they owed to the divine Jaffar.
"Bring me this man,” the caliph cried. The man
Was brought, was gazed upon. The mutes began
To bind his arms. "Welcome, brave cords," cried he,
"From bonds far worse Jaffar delivered me:
From wants, from shames, from loveless house-
hold fears;
Made a man's eyes friends with delicious tears,
Restored me, loved me, and put me on a par
With his great self. How can I pay Jaffar?"

Haroun, who felt that on a soul like this
The mightiest vengeance could but fall amiss,
Now deigned to smile, as one great lord of fate
Might smile upon another half as great.
He said: “Let worth grow frenzied if it will;
The caliph's judgment shall be master still.
Go, and since gifts so move thee, take this gem,
The richest in the Tartar's diadem,
And hold the giver as thou deemest fit!"

High toward the heavens, as though to meet his

Exclaimed, “This, too, I owe to thee, Jaffar!"
THE INCHCAPE ROCK-SOUTHEY.
No stir in the air, no stir in the sea,
The ship was still as she could be;
Her sails from heaven received no motion;
Her keel was steady in the ocean.
Without either sign or sound of their shock,
The waves flowed over the Inchcape rock;
So little they rose, so little they fell,
They did not move the Inchcape bell.
The Abbot of Aberbrothock
Had placed that bell on the Inchcape rock;
On a buoy in the storm it floated and swung,
And over the waves its warning run
When the rock was hid by the surge's swell,
The mariners heard the warning bell;

And then they knew the perilous rock,
And blest the Abbot of Aberbrothock.
The sun in heaven was shining gay;
All things were joyful on that day;
The sea-birds screamed as they wheeled round,
And there was joyance in their sound.
The buoy of the Inchcape bell was seen,
A darker speck on the ocean green;
Sir Ralph the Rover walked his deck,
And he fixed his eye on the darker speck.
He felt the cheering power of Spring;
It made him whistle, it made him sing;
His heart was mirthful to excess,
But the Rover's mirth was wickedness.
His eye was on the Inchcape float;
Quoth he: “My men, put out the boat,
And row me to the Inchcape rock,
And I'll plague the Abbot of Aberbrothock.”
The boat is lowered, the boatman row,
And to the Inchcape rock they go;
Sir Ralph bent over from the boat,
And he cut the bell from the Inchcape float.
Down sunk the bell with a gurgling sound;
The bubbles rose and burst around;
Quoth Sir Ralph: "The next who comes to the rock
Won't bless the Abbot of Aberbrothock."
Sir Ralph the Rover sailed away;
He scoured the seas for many a day;
And now, grown rich with plundered store,
He steers his course for Scotland's shore.

So thick a haze o'erspreads the sky,
They cannot see the sun on high;
The wind hath blown a gale all day;
At evening it hath died away.
On the deck the Rover takes his stand:
So dark it is they see no land.
Quoth Sir Ralph: "It will be lighter soon,
For there is the dawn of the rising moon."
“Canst hear,” said one, “the breakers roar?
For methinks we should be near the shore.
Now where we are I cannot tell,
But I wish I could hear the Inchcape bell."
They hear no sound; the swell is strong;
Though the wind hath failen, they drift along,
Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock,
"Oh Christ! it is the Inchcape rock!"
Sir Ralph the Rover tore his hair;
He cursed himself in his despair.
The waves rushed in on every side;
The ship is sinking beneath the tide.
But, even in his dying fear,
One dreadful sound could the Rover hear,-
A sound as if, with the Inchcape bell,
The devil below was ringing his knell.

An oak and an elm-tree stand beside,
And behind does an ash-tree grow,
And a willow from the bank above
Droops to the water below.
A traveler came to the well of St. Keyne:
Pleasant it was to his eye;
For from cock-crow he had been traveling,
And there was not a cloud in the sky.
He drank of the water so cool and clear,
For thirsty and hot was he,
And he sat down upon the bank,
Under the willow-tree.
There came a man from the neighboring town,
At the well to fill his pail;
On the well-side he rested it,
And bade the stranger hail.

"For an if thou hast a wife,

Shall drink before his wife,
A happy man henceforth is he,
For he shall be master for life;

Heaven help the husband then !"
The stranger stooped to the well of St. Keyne,
And drank of the waters again.
"You drank of the well, I warrant, betimes ?"
He to the countryman said.
But the countryman smiled as the stranger spake,
And sheepishly shook his head.
“I hastened, as soon as the wedding was done,
And left my wife in the porch.
But i' faith, she had been wiser than me,
For she took a bottle to church."

repairing
To wander alone by the wind-beaten hill.
But the day-star attracted his eye's sad devotion;
For it rose o'er his own native isle of the ocean,
Where once, in the fire of his youthful emotion,
He sang the bold anthem of Erin go bragh.

Sad is my fate!—said the heart-broken stranger,
The wild deer and wolf to a covert can flee;
But I have no refuge from famine and danger,
A home and a country remain not to me.
Never again in the green sunny bowers,
Where my forefathers lived, shall I spend the sweet
hours,
Or cover my harp with the wild woven flowers,
And strike to the numbers of Erin go bragh.
Erin, my country, though sad and forsaken,
In dreams I revisit thy sea-beaten shore;
But, alas ! in a far foreign land I awaken,
And sigh for the friends who can meet me no more.
O cruel fate! wilt thou never replace me
In a mansion of peace, where no perils can chase
me?
Never again shall my brothers embrace me.
They died to defend me, or live to deplore.
Where is my cabin door, fast by the wild wood ?
Sisters and sire, did ye weep for its fall?
Where is the mother that looked on my childhood?
And where is the bosom friend, dearer than all?
Oh, my sad heart, long abandoned by pleasure,
Why did it dote on a fast-fading treasure?
Tears like the rain drops may fall without measure,
But rapture and beauty they cannot recall.
Yet all its sad recollections suppressing,
One dying wish my lone bosom can draw:
Erin! an exile bequeaths thee his blessing!
Land of my forefathers! Erin go bragh!

Stay, lady, stay, for mercy's sake,
And hear a helpless orphan's tale.
Ah! sure my looks must pity wake;
'Tis want that makes my cheek so pale.
Yet I was once a mother's pride,
And my brave father's hope and joy;
But in the Nile's proud fight he died,
And I am now an orphan boy.
Poor foolish child! How pleased was I,
When news of Nelson's victory came,
Along the crowded streets to fly,
And see the lighted windows flame.
To force me home my mother sought;
She could not bear to see me joy;
For with my father's life 'twas bought,
And made me a poor orphan boy.
The people's shouts were long and loud;
My mother, shuddering, closed her ears.
“Rejoice! rejoice!” still cried the crowd;
My mother answered with her tears.
“Why are you crying thus,” said I,
"While others laugh and shout with joy ?”

"What is an orphan boy?" I cried,
As in her face I looked and smiled;

On that pleasant morn of the early fall
When Lee marched over the mountain-wall,
Over the mountains winding down,
Horse and foot, into Frederick town.
Forty flags with their silver stars,
Forty flags with their crimson bars,
Flapped in the morning wind: the sun
Of noon looked down, and saw not one.
Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,
Bowed with her fourscore years and ten;
Bravest of all in Frederick town,
She took up the flag the men hauled down;
In her attic window the staff she set,
To show that one heart was loyal yet.
Up the street came the rebel tread,
Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.
Under his slouched hat left and right
He glanced; the old flag met his sight.
"Halt!" the dust-brown ranks stood fast.
"Fire!”—out blazed the rifle-blast.
It shivered the window, pane and sash;
It rent the banner with seam and gash.
Quick, as it fell, from the broken staff
Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf;
She leaned far out on the window sill,
And shook it forth with a royal will,

"Shoot, if you must, this old gray head,
But spare your country's flag,” she said.
A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,
Over the face of the leader came;
The nobler nature within him stirred
To life at that woman's deed and word:
“Who touches a hair of yon gray head
Dies like a dog! March on!” he said.
All day long through Frederick street
Sounded the tread of marching feet:
All day long that free flag tossed
Over the heads of the rebel host.
Ever its torn folds rose and fell
On the loyal winds that loved it well;
And, through the hill-gaps, sunset light
Shone over it with a warm good-night.
Barbara Frietchie's work is o'er,
And the Rebel rides on his raids no more.
Honor to her! and let a tear
Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall's bier.
Over Barbara Frietchie's grave,
Flag of Freedom and Union, wave!
Peace and order and beauty draw
Round thy symbol of light and law!
And ever the stars above look down
On thy stars below in Frederick town!

It is said that at the bloody fight or Buena Vista, in the war with
Mexico, Mexican women were seen hovering near the field of death giving

with impartial tenderness.
"Speak and tell us, our Ximena, looking northward

O'er the camp of the invaders, o'er the Mexican

Who is losing? who is winning? are they far or

Look abroad, and tell us, sister, whither rolls the

"Down the hills of Angostura still the storm of

Blood is flowing, men are dying; God have mercy

I see but smoke of cannon clouding through the
mountain rain."-

before,
Bearing on, in strange confusion, friend and foe-

Like some wild and troubled torrent sweeping
down its mountain course.".

Listen, my children, and you shall hear
Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,
On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-Five:
Hardly a man is now alive
Who remembers that famous day and year.
He said to his friend: "If the British march
By land or sea from the town to-night,
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry-arch
Of the North Church tower, as a signal light, -
One if by land, and two if by sea;
And I on the opposite shore will be,
Ready to ride and spread the alarm
Through every Middlesex village and farm,
For the country-folk to be up and to arm.”

Then he said good-night, and with muffled oar
Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,
Just as the moon rose over the bay,
Where swinging wide at her moorings lay
The Somerset, British man-of-war:
A phantom ship, with each mast and spar
Across the moon, like a prison-bar,
And a huge, black hulk, that was magnified
By its own reflection in the tide.
Meanwhile, his friend through alley and street
Wanders and watches with eager ears,
Till in the silence around him he hears
The muster of men at the barrack-door,
The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,
And the measured tread of the grenadiers,
Marching down to their boats on the shore.
Then he climbed the tower of the Old North Church
By the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,
To the belfry-chamber overhead,
And startled the pigeons from their perch
On the sombre rafters, that round him made
Masses and moving shapes of shade,-
By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,
To the highest window in the wall,
Where he paused to listen and look down
A moment on the roofs of the town,
And the moonlight flowing over all,
Beneath, in the church-yard, lay the dead
In their night-encampment on the hill,
Wrapped in silence so deep and still,
That he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,

For suddenly all his thoughts are bent
On a shadowy something far away,
Where the river widens to meet the bay,
A line of black, that bends and floats
On the rising tide, like a bridge of boats.
Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,
Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride,
On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.
Now he patted his horse's side,
Now gazed on the landscape far and near,
Then impetuous stamped the earth,
And turned and tightened his saddle-girth;
But mostly he watched with eager search
The belfry-tower of the Old North Church,
As it rose above the graves on the hill,
Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.
And lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height,
A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!
He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,
But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight
A second lamp in the belfry burns.
A hurry of hoofs in a village-street,
A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,
And beneath from the pebbles, in passing, a spark
Struck out by a steed that flies fearless and fleet:

That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the
light,
The fate of a nation was riding that night;
And the spark struck out by that steed in his flight
Kindled the land into flame with its heat.
It was twelve by the village-clock,
When he crossed the bridge into Medford town:
He heard the crowing of the cock,
And the barking of the farmer's dog,
And felt the damp of the river-fog,
That rises when the sun goes down.
It was one by the village-clock,
When he galloped into Lexington.
He saw the gilded weathercock
Swim in the moonlight as he passed,
And the meeting-house windows, blank and bare,
Gaze at him with a spectral glare,
As if they already stood aghast
At the bloody work they would look upon.
It was two by the village-clock,
When he came to the bridge in Concord town.
He heard the bleating of the flock,
And the twitter of birds among the trees,
And felt the breath of the morning-breeze
Blowing over the meadows brown.
And one was safe and asleep in his bed
Who at the bridge would be first to fall,
Who that day would be lying dead,
Pierced by a British musket-ball.
You know the rest. In the books you have read,
How the British regulars fired and fled,
How the farmers gave them ball for ball,

From behind each fence and farm-yard wall,
Chasing the red-coats down the lane,
Then crossing the fields to emerge again
Under the trees at the turn of the road,
And only pausing to fire and load.
So through the night rode Paul Revere;
And so through the night went his cry of alarm
To every Middlesex village and farm,
A cry of defiance and not of fear,-
A voice in the darkness, a knock at the door,
And a word that shall echo for evermore.
For, borne on the night-wind of the past,
Through all our history to the last,
In the hour of darkness and peril and need,
The people will awaken and listen to hear
The hurrying hoof-beat of that steed,
And the midnight-message of Paul Revere.
THE BATTLE OF THE BALTIC
-CAMPBELL.
Of Nelson and the North
Sing the glorious day's renown,
When to battle fierce came forth
All the might of Denmark's crown,
And her arms along the deep proudly shone;
By each gun the lighted brand
In a bold determined hand,
And the Prince of all the land
Led them on.
Like leviathans afloat
Lay their bulwarks on the brine,
While the sign of battle flew

On the lofty British line;
It was ten of April morn by the chime.
As they drifted on their path
There was silence deep as death,
And the boldest held his breath
For a time.
But the might of England flushed
To anticipate the scene;
And her van the fleeter rushed
O'er the deadly space between.
"Hearts of oak!” our captain cried, when each gun
From its adamantine lips
Spread a death-shade round the ships,
Like the hurricane eclipse
Of the sun.
Again! again! again!
And the havoc did not slack,
Till a feeble cheer the Dane
To our cheering sent us back;
Their shots along the deep slowly boom,
Then ceased, and all is wail,
As they strike the shattered sail,
Or in conflagration pale
Light the gloom.
Out spoke the victor then,
As he hailed them o'er the wave:
"Ye are brothers! ye are men!
And we conquer but to save;
So peace instead of death let us bring;
But yield, proud foe, thy fleet

And make submission meet
To our king."
Then Denmark blessed our chief,
That he gave her wounds repose;
And the sounds of joy and grief
From her people wildly rose,
As death withdrew his shades from the day,
While the sun looked smiling bright
O’er a wide and woeful sight,
Where the fires of funeral light
Died away
Now joy, Old England raise,
For the tidings of thy might,
By the festal cities' blaze,
Whilst thy wine-cup shines in light;
And yet, amidst that joy and uproar,
Let us think of them that sleep
Full many a fathom deep,
By thy wild and stormy steep,
Elsinore.
Brave hearts, to Britain's pride
Once so faithful and so true,
On the deck of fame that died
With the gallant good Riou-
Soft sigh the winds of Heaven o'er their grave!
While the billow mournful rolls,
And the mermaid's song condoles,
Singing glory to the souls
Of the brave.

THE DEATH OF LEONIDAS-CROLY.
It was the wild midnight; a storm was in the sky;
The lightning gave its light, and the thunder echoed
by.
The torrent swept the glen, the ocean lashed the
shore;
Then rose the Spartan men, to make their bed in
gore.
Swift from the deluged ground three hundred took
the shield;
Then, silent, gathered round the leader of the field.
All up the mountain's side, all down the woody vale,
All by the rolling tide waved the Persian banners
pale.
And foremost from the pass, among the slumbering
band
Sprang King Leonidas, like the lightning's living
brand;
Then double darkness fell, and the forest ceased its
moan;
But there came a clash of steel, and a distant dying
groan.
Anon a trumpet blew, and a fiery sheet burst high,
That o'er the midnight threw a blood-red canopy.
A host glared on the hill, a host glared by the bay,
But the Greeks rushed onward still like leopards in
their play
The air was all a yell, and the earth was all a flame,
Where the Spartan's bloody steel on the silken tur-
bans came;

And still the Greek rushed on, where the fiery tor-
rent rolled,
Till, like a rising sun, shone Xerxes' tent of gold.
They found a royal feast, his midnight banquet,
there.
And the treasures of the East lay beneath the Doric
spear.
Then sat to the repast the bravest of the brave.
That feast must be their last, that spot must be their
grave.
Up rose the glorious rank, to Greece one cup poured
high;
Then hand in hand they drank, “To immortality!"
Fear on King Xerxes fell, when, like spirits from
the tomb,
With shout and trumpet knell, he saw the warriors
conie.
But down'swept all his power with chariot and with
charge;
Down poured the arrows' shower, till sank the Spar-
tan targe.
Thus fought the Greek of old; thus will he fight
again:
Shall not the self-same mould bring forth the self-
same men ?

And silver-sweet the village bells o'er mount and

And in the Church of St. Florent were gathered
young and old;
When rushing down the woodland hill in fiery
haste was seen,
With panting steed and bloody spur, a noble
Angevin.
And bounding on the sacred floor, he gave his
fearful cry,
“Up! up for France! the time is come for France to

“Your queen is in the dungeon; your king is in his

O'er Paris waves the flag of death, the fiery tri-

Your nobles in their ancient halls are hunted down

In convent cells and holy shrines the blood is

His son is to the scaffold sent, his daughter sent to

With torch in hand and hate in heart the rebel host

Old Kaspar's work was done,
And he before his cottage door
Was sitting in the sun;
And by him sported on the green
His little grandchild Wilhelmine.
She saw her brother Peterkin
Roll something large and round,
Which he beside the rivulet
In playing there had found;
He came to ask what he had found,
That was so large and smooth and round

And with a natural sigh,-
"Tis some poor fellow's skull," said he,
“Who fell in the great victory.”
“I find them in the garden,
For there's many here about;
And often when I go to plow
The plowshare turns them out.
For many thousand men," said he,
"Were slain in that great victory."
"Now tell us what 'twas all about,"

And little Wilhelmine looks up
With wonder-waiting eyes;
"Now tell us all about the war,

"It was the English," Kaspar cried,
"Who put the French to rout;
But what they fought each other for

But everybody said," quoth he,

"My father lived at Blenheim then,
Yon little stream hard by ;

MARGUERITE OF FRANCE
-MRS. HEMANS.
King Louis IX, of France, had undertaken a crusade against the
Turks, and was held a captive by them, while the enemy was besieging the
city of Damietta, then occupied by the troops of the Christians.
It was
there that Marguerite, Louis' queen, gave birth to a son, whom in memory
of her misfortunes she named Tristan. Hearing that the troops of her
husband were about to capitulate the city to the foe, she hastily summoned
the knights, entrusted with the defense of the city, to her apartments, and
by her heroic appeal so wrought upon their spirits that they vowed to
stand by her and the cross to the end.

The Moslem spears were gleaming
Round Damietta's towers,
Though a Christian banner from her wall,
Waved free its lily-flowers.
Ay, proudly did the banner wave,
As Queen of earth and air;
But faint hearts throbbed beneath its folds,
In anguish and despair.
Deep, deep in paynim dungeon,
Their kingly chieftain lay,
And low on many an Eastern field
Their knighthood's best array.
'Twas mournful, when at feasts they met,
The wine-cup round to send,
For each that touched it silently,
Then missed a gallant friend.
And mournful was their vigil
On the beleagured wall,
And dark their slumber, dark with dreams,
Of slow defeat and fall.
Yet a few hearts of chivalry
Rose high to breast the storm,
And one, of all the loftiest there,
Thrilled in a woman's form.
A woman, meekly bending
O'er the slumber of her child,
With her soft sad eyes of weeping love,
As the Virgin Mother's mild.
Oh! roughly cradled was thy babe,
Midst the clash of spear and lance,
And a strange, wild bower was thine, young Queen,
Fair Marguerite of France !

A dark and vaulted chamber,
Like a scene for wizard-spell,
Deep in the Saracenic gloom
Of the warrior citadel,-
And there midst arms the couch was spread,
And with banners curtained o'er,
For the daughter of the minstrel-land,
The gay Provencal shore,
For the bright queen of St. Louis,
The star of court and hall.
But the deep strength of the gentle heart
Wakes to the tempest's call.
Her lord was in the paynim's hold,
His soul with grief oppressed,
Yet calmly lay she desolate,
With her young babe on her breast.
There were voices in the city,
Voices of wrath and fear:
“The walls grow weak, the strife is vain,
We will not perish here!
Yield! yield! and let the crescent gleam
O'er tower and bastion high!
Our distant homes are beautiful;
We stay not here to die!"
They bore those fearful tidings
To the sad queen where she lay;
They told a tale of wavering hearts,
Of treason and dismay:
The blood rushed through her pearly cheek,
The sparkle to her eye,--
“Now call me hither those recreant knights,
From the bands of Italy !"

Then through the vaulted chambers
Stern iron fotsteps rang;
And heavily the sounding floor
Gave back the sabre's clang.
They stood around her,-steel-clad men,
Moulded for storm and fight,
But they quailed before the loftier soul
In that pale aspect bright.
Yes, as before the falcon shrinks
The bird of meaner wing,
So shrank they from the imperial glance
Of her, that fragile thing.
And her flute-like voice rose clear and high
Through the din of arms around,
Sweet, and yet stirring to the soul,
As a silver clarion's sound.
“The honor of the lily
Is in your hands to keep,
And the Banner of the Cross, for Him
Who died on Calvary's steep:
And the city which for Christian prayer
Hath heard the holy bell,
And is it these your hearts would yield
To the godless infidel?
“Then bring me here a breastplate,
And a helm, before ye fly,
And I will gird my woman's form,
And on the ramparts die.
And the boy whom I have borne for woe,
But never for disgrace,
Shall go within mine arms to death
Meet for his royal race.

Unsheathed in many a hand,

Again a noble band.

Throned in state, behold his armies without pause
defiling o'er;
Only on the eighth the rearward to the other side

Then one haughty glance of triumph far as eye

Far as eye could reach he saw them, multitudes
equipped for war,
Medians with their bows and quivers, linked armor
and tiar:
From beneath the sun of Afric, from the snowy

And from India's utmost borders, nations gathered

All in league against the freedom and the one hope

Midnight is there; and silence enthroned in heaven

Upon her own calm mirror, upon a sleeping town;
For Bregenz, that quaint city upon the Tyrol shore,
Has stood above Lake Constance, a thousand years
and more.
Her battlements and towers upon their rocky steep
Have cast their trembling shadows for ages on the
deep;
Mountain and lake and valley a sacred legend
know,
Of how the town was saved one night, three hun-
dred years ago.
Far from her home and kindred a Tyrol maid had
fied,
To serve in the Swiss valleys, and toil for daily
bread;
And every year that fleeted so silently and fast,
Seemed to bear farther from her the memory of the
past.
She served kind, gentle masters, nor asked for rest
or change;
Her friends seemed no more new ones, their speech
seemed no more strange;
And when she led her cattle to pasture every day,
She ceased to look and wonder on which side Bre-
genz lay.
She spoke no more of Bregenz, with longing and
with tears;
Her Tyrol home seemed faded in a deep mist of
years;
She heeded not the rumors of Austrian war or
strife;

Each day she rose contented to the calm toils of
life.
Yet, when her master's children would clustering
round her stand,
She sang them the old ballads of her own native
land;
And when at morn and evening she knelt before
God's throne,
The accents of her childhood rose to her lips alone.
And so she dwelt: the valley more peaceful year by
year;
When suddenly strange portents of some great
deed seemed near.
The golden corn was bending upon its fragile stalk,
While farmers, heedless of their fields, paced up
and down in talk.
The men seemed stern and altered, with looks cast
on the ground;
With anxious faces, one by one the women gath-
ered round;
All talk of flax or spinning or work was put away;
The very children seemed afraid to go alone to
play.
One day, out in the meadow with strangers from
the town,
Some secret plan discussing, the men walked up
and down.
Yet now and then seemed watching a strange un-
certain gleam,
That looked like lances 'mid the trees that stood
below the stream.

And cried: "We drink the downfall of an accursed
land!

The women shrank in terror, (yet pride, too, had
her part,)
But one poor Tyrol maiden felt death within her
heart.
Before her stood fair Bregenz, once more her
towers arose;
What were the friends beside her? Only her coun-
try's foes.
The faces of her kinsfolk, the days of childhood
flown,
The echoes of her mountains reclaimed her as their
own.
Nothing she heard around her, though shouts rang
forth again,
Gone were the green Swiss valleys, the pasture,
and the plain;
Before her eyes one vision, and in her heart one
cry,
That said, "Go forth, save Bregenz, and then if
need be, die!”

Horses and weary cattle were standing in the shed;
She loosed the strong white charger, that fed from
out her hand,
She mounted and she turned his head toward her
native land.
Out, out into the darkness, faster, and still more
fast,-
The smooth grass flies behind her, the chestnut
wood is passed;
She looks up; clouds are heavy;—Why is her steed
so slow?
Scarcely the wind beside them, can pass them as
they go.
"Faster!" she cries, "Oh, faster!" Eleven the
church-bells chime;
"O God," she cries, “help Bregenz, and bring me
there in time !"
But louder than bells' ringing, or lowing of the
kine,
Grows nearer in the midnight the rushing of the
Rhine.
Shall not the roaring waters their headlong gallop
check ?
The steed draws back in terror,—she leans above
his neck,
To watch the flowing darkness,—the bank is high
and steep-
One pause—he staggers forward, and plunges in
the deep.

Defiance greets the army that marches on the

And if to deeds heroic should endless fame be paid,

Of cymbals and of drums,
As if earth would cleave in sunder.
There you might see the Moors
Arming themselves in haste,
And the two main battles
How they were forming fast;
Horsemen and footmen mixt,
A countless troop and vast.
The Moors are moving forward,
The battle soon must join,-
"My men stand here in order,
Ranged upon a line!
Let not a man move from his rank
Before I give the sign."
Pero Bermuez heard the word,
But he could not refrain,

He held the banner in his hand,
He gave his horse the rein.-
"You see yon foremost squadron there,
The thickest of the foes,
Noble Cid, God be your aid,
For there your banner goes !
Let him that serves and honors it,
Show the duty that he owes.”
Earnestly the Cid called out,
“For heaven's sake be still !"
Bermuez cried, "I cannot hold,"
So eager was his will.
He spurred his horse, and drove him on
Amid the Moorish route.
They strove to win the banner,
And compassed him about;
Had not his armor been so true,
He had lost either life or limb.
The Cid called out again,
"For heaven's sake succor him!”
Their shields before their breasts,
Forth at once they go,
Their lances in the rest
Levelled fair and low;
Their banners and their crests
Waving in a row,
Their heads all stooping down
Towards the saddle bow.
The Cid was in the midst,
His shout was heard afar:
"I am Rui Diaz,
The champion of Bivar;

Strike amongst them, gentlemen,
For sweet mercies' sake!"
There where Bermuez fought
Amidst the foe they brake,-
Three hundred bannered knights,-
It was a gallant show.
Three hundred Moors they killed,
A man at every blow;
When they wheeled and turned,
As many more lay slain.
You might see them raise their lances,
And level them again.
There you might see the breastplates,
How they were cleft in twain,
And many a Moorish shield
Lie scattered on the plain;
The pennons that were white
Marked with a crimson stain,
The horses running wild
Whose riders had been slain.
DEATH AND THE WARRIOR

"Ay, warrior, arm! and wear thy plume
On a proud and fearless brow!
I am the lord of the lonely tomb,
And a mightier one than thou.
Bid thy soul's love farewell, young chief,
Bid her a long farewell!
Like the morning's dew shall pass that grief;
Thou comest with me to dwell.

“Thy bark may rush through the foaming deep,
Thy steed o'er the breezy hill;
But they bear thee on to a place of sleep,
Narrow, and cold, and chill.”.
"Was the voice I heard thy voicé, O Death?
And is thy day so near?
Then on the field shall my life's last breath
Mingle with victory's cheer.
"Banner shall float, with the trumpet's note,
Above me as I die.
And the palm-tree wave o'er my noble grave,
Under the Syrian sky.
High hearts shall burn in the royal hall,
When the minstrel names that spot;
And the eyes I love shall weep my fall,-
Death, death! I fear thee not!"
"Warrior, thou bearest a haughty heart,
But I can bend its pride.
How should'st thou know that thy soul will part
In the hour of victory's tide ?
It may be far from thy steel-clad bands
That I shall make thee mine;
It may be lone on the desert's sands
Where men for fountains pine.
“It may be deep, amidst heavy chains,
In some strong paynim hold;
I have slow, dull steps, and lingering pains,
Wherewith to tame the bold.”—
"Death, death! I go to a doom unblest,
If this indeed must be;
But the Cross is bound upon my breast,
And I may not shrink from thee.

REGULUS TO THE ROMAN SENATE
-SARGENT.
Ill does it become me, O Senators of Rome,-ill
does it become Regulus, after having so often stood
in this venerable Assembly clothed with the su-
preme dignity of the Republic, to stand before you
a captive, the captive of Carthage. Though out-
wardly I am free, though no fetters encumber the
limbs or gall the flesh, yet the heaviest of chains,
the pledge of a Roman Consul, makes me the bonds-
man of the Carthagenians. They have my promise
to return to them, in the event of the failure of
this their embassy. My life is at their mercy. My
honor is my own,-a possession which no reverse
of fortune can jeopard; a flame which imprisonment
cannot stifle, time cannot dim, death cannot extin-
guish.
Of the train of disasters which followed close on
the unexampled successes of our arms, of the bitter
fate which swept off the flower of our soldiery, and
consigned me, your general, wounded and senseless,
to Carthagenian keeping, I will not speak. For five
years a rigorous captivity has been my portion.
For five years the society of family and friends, the
dear amenities of home, the sense of freedom, and
the sight of country, have been to me a recollection
and a dream,—no more. But during that period

Rome has retrieved her defeats. She has recovered
under Metellus what under Regulus she lost. She
has routed armies. She has taken unnumbered
prisoners. She has struck terror to the hearts of
the Carthagenians, who have now sent me hither
with their ambassadors, to sue for peace, and to
propose that, in exchange for me, your former Con-
sul, a thousand common prisoners of war shall be
given up. You have heard the ambassadors. Their
intimations of some unimaginable horror, I know
not what, impending over myself, should I fail to
induce you to accept their terms, have strongly
moved your sympathies in my behalf.
Another appeal, which I would you might have
been spared, has lent force to their suit. A wife and
children, threatened with widowhood and orphan-
age, weeping and despairing, have knelt at your
feet, on the very threshold of the Senate-chamber.
"Conscript Fathers! Shall not Regulus be saved ?
Must he return to Carthage to meet the cruelties
which the ambassadors brandish before our eyes ?”
-With one voice you answer, “No!" Countrymen!
Friends! For all that I have suffered, for all that I
may have to suffer, I am repaid in the compensation
of this moment. Unfortunate you may hold me;
but, Oh! not undeserving.
Your confidence in my
honor survives all the ruin that adverse fortune
could inflict. You have not forgotten the past.
Republics are not ungrateful. May the thanks I
cannot utter bring down blessings from the gods
on you and Rome!
Conscript Fathers! There is but one course to
be pursued. Abandon all thought of peace. Reject

the overtures of Carthage. Reject them wholly and
unconditionally. What! Give back to her a thou-
sand able-bodied men, and receive in return this one
attenuated, war-worn, fever-wasted frame,—this
weed, whitened in a dungeon's darkness, pale and
sapless, which no kindness of the sun, no softness
of the summer breeze, can ever restore to health
and vigor! It must not, it shall not be! O! were
Regulus what he was once, before captivity had un-
strung his sinews and enervated his limbs, he might
pause; he might proudly think he were well worth
a thousand of the foe; he might say: "Make the
exchange! Rome shall not lose by it!" But now-
alas! now 'tis gone,—that impetuosity of strength,
which could once make him a leader, indeed, to pene-
trate a phalanx or guide a pursuit. His very armor
would be a burthen now. His battle-cry would be
drowned in the din of the onset. His sword would
fall harmless on the opponent's shield. But, if he
cannot live, he can at least die, for his country. Do
not deny him this supreme consolation. Consider,
that every indignity, every torture, which Carthage
shall heap on his dying hours, will be better than a
trumpet's call to your armies. They will remember
only Regulus, their fellow-soldier and their leader.
They will forget his defeats. They will regard only
his services to the Republic. Tunis, Sardinia, Sicily,
every well-fought field, won by his blood and theirs,
will flash on their remembrance and kindle their
avenging wrath. And so shall Regulus, though dead,
fight as he never fought before against the foe.
Conscript Fathers! There is another theme. My
family,--forgive the thought !—To you, and to

my name, no testament but my example.
Ambassadors of Carthage! I have spoken, though
not as you expected. I am your captive. Lead me
back to whatever fate may await me. Doubt not
that you shall find, to Roman hearts, country is
dearer than life, and integrity more precious than
freedom.
HOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS
FROM GHENT TO AIX
-ROBERT BROWNING.
I sprang to the stirrup, and Joris, and he;
I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three.
“Good speed!” cried the watch, as the gate-bolts
undrew;
"Speed !” echoed the wall to us galloping through;
Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,
And into the midnight we galloped abreast.
Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace
Neck by neck, stride for stride, never changing our
place;
I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,
Then shortened each stirrup, and set the peak
right,
Rebuckled the cheek-strap, chained slacker the
bit,-
Nor galloped less steadily Roland, a whit.
'Twas moonset at starting; but while we drew near
Lokeren, the cocks crew and twillight dawned
clear;

At Boom a great yellow star came out to see;
At Duffeld 'twas morning as plain as could be;
And from Mechlin church steeple we heard the
half-chime,
So Joris broke silence with, “Yet there is time!”
At Aerschot up leaped of a sudden the sun,
And against him the cattle stood black every one,
To stare through the mist at us galloping past,
And I saw my stout galloper Roland, at last,
With resolute shoulders, each butting away
The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray.
And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent
back
For my voice, and the other pricked out on his
track;
And one eye's black intelligence,-ever that glance
O'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance.
And the thick, heavy spume-flakes which aye and
anon
His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on.
By Hasselt, Dirck groaned; and cried Joris: "Stay
spur!
Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault's not in her,
We'll remember at “Aix”; for one heard the quick
wheeze
Of her chest, saw the stretched neck and stagger-
ing knees,
And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,
As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.
So we were left galloping, Joris and I,
Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;

The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh,
'Neath our feet broke the brittle, bright stubble
like chaff;
Till over by Dalhem a dome-spire sprang white,
And “Gallop,” gasped Joris, "for Aix is in sight!"
"How they'll greet us!”—and all in a moment his
roan
Rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone;
And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight
Of the news which alone could save Aix from her
fate,
With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,
And with circles of red for his eye-sockets' rim.
Then I cast loose my buffcoat, each holster let fall,
Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all,
Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear,
Called my Roland his pet-name, my horse without
peer;
Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise,
bad or good,
Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood.
And all I remember is,-friends flocking round
As I sate with his head 'twixt my knees on the
ground,
And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,
As I poured down his throat our last measure of
wine,
Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)
Was no more than his due who brought good news
from Ghent.

THE GLADIATOR --BYRON.
The seal is set.—Now welcome, thou dread power!
Nameless, yet thus omnipotent, which here
Walk'st in the shadow of the midnight hour
With a deep awe, yet all distinct from fear.
Thy haunts are ever where the dead walls rear
Their ivy mantles, and the solemn scene
Derives from thee a sense so deep and clear,
That we become a part of what has been,
And grow unto the spot, all-seeing, but unseen.
And here the buzz of eager nations ran,
In murmured pity, or loud-roared applause,
As man was slaughtered by his fellow-man.
And wherefore slaughter,—wherefore, but because
Such were the bloody circus' genial laws,
And the imperial pleasure. Wherefore not?
What matters where we fall to fill the maws
Of worms, on battle plains or listed spot?
Both are but theatres where the chief actors rot.
I see before me the gladiator lie:
He leans upon his hand; his manly brow
Consents to death, but conquers agony,
And his drooped head sinks gradually low.
And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow
From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,
Like the first of a thunder-shower.—And now
The arena swims around him;—he is gone
Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hailed the
wretch who won.
He heard it, but he heeded not; his eyes
Were with his heart, and that was far away;

But where his rude hut by the Danube lay;

To be a garrison for common cut-throats!
What! will ye all combine to tie a stone,
Each to each other's neck, and drown like dogs!
Are you so bound in fetters of the mind
That there you sit, as if you were yourselves
Incorporate with the marble? Syracusans !
But no! I will not rail nor chide nor curse you !
I will implore you, fellow-countrymen,
With blinded eyes, and weak and broken speech,
I will implore you-0! I am weak in words, ,
But I could bring such advocates before you:
Your fathers' sacred images; old men,
That have been grandsires; women with their
children,
Caught up in fear and hurry, in their arms;
And those old men should lift their shivering voices
And palsied hands, and those affrighted mothers
Should hold their innocent infants forth, and ask,
Can you make slaves of them?

THE DEATH OF HOFER
Translated from the German by James C. Mangan.
At Mantua long had lain in chains
The gallant Hofer bound;
But now his day of doom was come:
At morn the deep roll of the drum
Resounded o'er the soldiered plains.
O heaven! With what a deed of dole
The hundred thousand wrongs were crowned
Of trodden-down Tyrol!
With iron-fettered arms and hands
The hero moved along,
His heart was calm, his eye was clear:
Death was for traitor-slaves to fear.
He oft amid his mountain bands,
Where Inn's dark wintry waters roll,
Had faced it with his battle-song,
The Sandwirth of Tyrol.
Anon he passed the fortress wall,
And heard the wail that broke
From many a brother thrall within.
"Farewell!” he cried. "Soon may you win
Your liberty! God shield you all!
Lament not me! I see my goal.
Lament the land that wears the yoke,
Your land and mine, Tyrol!”
So through the files of musketeers
Undauntedly he passed,
And stood within the hollow square.
Well might he glance around him there,

And proudly think on by-gone years.
Amid such serfs his bannerol,
Thank God, had never braved the blast
On thy green hills, Tyrol!
They bade him kneel; but he with all
A patriot's truth replied:
"I kneel alone to God on high:
As thus I stand so dare I die,
As oft I fought so let me fall!
Farewell,"—his breast a moment swoll
With agony he strove to hide,-
"My Kaiser and Tyrol!"
No more emotion he betrayed.-
Again he bade farewell
To Francis and the faithful men
Who girt his throne. His hands were then
Unbound for prayer, and thus he prayed:
“God of the free, receive my soul!
And you, slaves, fire!" So bravely fell
Thy foremost man, Tyrol!

Thanking God for all His goodness
In the product of their soil;—

When a cry rung through the welkin,
And appeared upon the scene,
A panting dog with crest erect,
Foaming mouth and savage mien.
"He is mad!" was shrieked in chorus,
In dismay they all fell back,
All,—except one towering figure,
'Twas the smith of Ragenbach.
God had given this man His image,
Nature stamped him as complete,
Now it was incumbent on him,
To perform a greater feat
Than Horatius at the bridge,
When he stood on Tiber's bank,
For behind him were his townsfolk,
Who appalled with terror sank.
From the most appalling danger,
That which makes the bravest quail,
While they all were grouped together,
Shaking limbs and visage pale.
For a moment cowered the beast,
Snapping to the left and right,
While the blacksmith stood before him
In the power of his might.
“One must die to save the many:
Let it then my duty be:
I've the power, fear not, neighbors;
From this peril you'll be free.”
As the lightning from the storm-cloud
Leaps to earth with sudden crash,
So upon the rabid monster
Did this man and hero dash.

In the death-grip then they struggled,
Man and dog with scarce a sound,
Till from out the fearful conflict
Rose the man from off the ground;
Gashed and gory from the struggle,
But the beast lay stiff and dead;
There he stood while people gathered
And rained blessings on his head.
"Friends," he said, "from one great peril
With God's help I've set you free,
But my task is not yet ended,
There is danger now in me.
Yet secure from harm you shall be,
None need fear before I die:
That my sufferings may be shortened,
Ask of Him who rules on high.”
Then unto his forge he straightway
Walked erect with rapid step,
While the people followed after,
Some with shouts while others wept,
And with nerve as steady as when
He had plied his trade for gain,
He selected without faltering
From his store, the heaviest chain.
To his anvil first he bound it,
Next his limb he shackled fast,
Then he said unto his townsfolk:
"All your danger now is past.
Place within my reach, I pray you,
Food and water for a time,
Until God shall ease my sufferings
By His gracious will divine."

THE LEAP OF CURTIUS
-GEORGE ASPINALL
Within Rome's forum suddenly
A wide gap opened in a night,
Astounding those who gazed on it,
A strange, terrific sight.
In Senate all their sages met,
And, seated in their chairs of state,
Their faces blanched with deadly fear,
Debated long and late.
A sign inimical to Rome
They deemed it, a prognostic dire,
A visitation from the gods
In token of their ire.
Yet how to have their minds resolved,
How ascertain in this their need,
Beyond the shadow of a doubt,
If thus it were indeed.
In silence brooded they awhile,
Unbroken by a single word,
While from the capital without
The lightest sounds were heard.

Then rose the eldest magistrate,
A tall old man with locks like snow,
Straight as a dart, and with an eye
That oft had quelled the foe.
And thus with ripe, sonorous voice,
No note or tone of which did shake
Or indicate the wear of time,
The aged Nestor spake:
"Fathers, the Oracle is nigh;
To it then let us promptly send,
And at the shrine inquire what this
Dread marvel doth portend.
“And if to Rome it augurs ill,
Then ask we, ere it be too late,
How we may best avert the doom,
And save the sacred state,-
“That state to every Roman dear,
As dear as brother, friend or wife,
For which each true-born son would give,
If needful, even life.
"For what, O Fathers! What were life
Apart from altar, hearth and home?
Yea, is not all our highest good
Bound up with that of Rome?
“And now adjourn we for a space
Till three full days have circled round,
And on the morning of the fourth
Let each one here be found."

For such short interval did part;
For they were Romans staunch and tried,
And sad was every heart.
The fourth day dawned, and when they met,
The Oracle's response was known:
Something most precious in the chasm
To close it must be thrown.
But if unclosed it shall remain,
Thereon shall follow Rome's decay,
And all the splendor of her state
Shall pale and pass away.
Something most precious! What the gift
That may prevent the pending fate,
What costly offering will the gods
Indeed propitiate?
While this they pondered, lo! a sound
Of footsteps fell on every ear,
And in their midst a Roman youth
Did presently appear.
Apollo's brow, a mien like Mars,
In beauty's mould he seemed new made,
As on his golden hair the sun
With dazzling dalliance played.

His own young life,—he offers that,
Yea, volunteers himself to throw
Within the cleft to make it close,
And stay the heavy woe.
And now on horseback, fully armed,
Behold him, for the hour hath come,
The Roman guards keep watch and ward,
And beats the muffled drum.
The consuls, proctors, soothsayers,
Within the forum group around,
Young Curtius in the saddle sits;
There yawns the severed ground.
Each pulse is stayed, he lifts his helm,
And bares his forehead to the sky,
And to the broad, blue heaven above,
Upturns his flashing eye.
"O Rome! O country best beloved,
Thou land in which I first drew breath.
I render back the life thou gav'st,
To rescue thee from death.”
Then spurring on his gallant steed,
A last and brief farewell he said,
And leapt within the gaping gulf,
Which closed above his head.

And the Caesar gave the order: "Loose the lions
from their den!
For Rome must have a spectacle worthy of gods

Forth to the broad arena a little band was led,
But words forbear to utter how the sinless blood
was shed:
No sigh the victims proffered, but now and then a
prayer
From lips of age and lips of youth rose upward on
the air.
And the savage Cæsar muttered: “By Hercules! I
swear,
Braver than gladiators these dogs of Christians
are.”
Then a lictor bending slavishly, saluting with his
axe,
Said: “Mighty Imperator! the sport one feature
lacks:
We have an Afric lion, savage, and great of limb,
Fasting since yester-eve; is the Grecian maid for
him?"
The Emperor assented.-With a frantic roar and
bound
The monster, bursting from his den, gazed terribly
around;
And toward him moved a maiden, slowly, but yet
serene.
“By Venus !" cried the Emperor, “she walketh like
a queen.”

Unconscious of the myriad eyes she crossed the
blood-soaked sand,
Till face to face the maid and beast in opposition
stand;
The daughter of Athene, in white arrayed, and
fair,
Gazed on the monster's lowered brow, and breathed
a silent prayer.
Then forth she drew a crucifix and held it high in
air.
Lo, and behold! A miracle! The lion's fury fled,
And at the Christian maiden's feet he laid his
lordly head;
While as she fearlessly caressed, he slowly rose,
and then
With one soft, backward look at her, retreated to
his den.
One shout rose from the multitude, tossed like a
stormy sea;
“The gods have so decreed it; let the Grecian maid
go free!”
Within the catacombs that night a saint with
snowy hair
Folded upon his aged breast his daughter, young
and fair;
And the gathered brethren lift a chant of praise
and prayer;
From the monster of the desert, from the heathen
fierce and wild,
God has restored to love and life his sinless, trust-

GUALBERTO'S VICTORY
*--E, C. DONNELLY.
A mountain pass so narrow that a man
Riding that way to Florence, stooping, can
Touch with his hand the rocks on either side,
And pluck the flowers that in the crannies hide.
Here, on Good Friday, centuries ago,
Mounted and armed, John Gualbert met his foe,
Mounted and armed as well, but riding down
To the fair city from the woodland brown,
This way and that, swinging his jeweled whip,
A gay old love-song on his careless lip,
And on his charger's neck the reins loose thrown.
An accidental meeting,—but the sun
Burned on their brows, as if it had been one
Of deep design, so deadly was the look
Of mutual hate their olive faces took;
As, knightly courtesy forgot in wrath,
Neither would yield his enemy the path.
“Back!” cried Gualberto. “Never!” yelled his foe;
And on the instant, sword in hand, they throw
Them from their saddles, nothing loath,
And fall to fighting, with a smothered oath,-
A pair of shapely, stalwart cavaliers,
Well-matched in stature, weapons, weight, and
years.
Theirs was a long, fierce struggle on the grass,
Thrusting and parrying up and down the pass,
Swaying from left to right, in combat clenched,
Till all the housings of their steeds were drenched
With brutal gore: and ugly blood-drops oozed
Upon the rocks, from head and hands contused.

But at the close, when Gualbert stopped to rest,
His heel was planted on his foeman's breast;
And looking up, the fallen courtier sees,
As in a dream, gray rocks and waving trees
Before his glazing vision faintly float,
While Gualbert's sabre glitters at his throat.
"Now die, base wretch !" the victor fiercely cries,
His heart of hate outflashing from his eyes:
"Never again, by the all-righteous Lord!
Shalt thou with life, escape this trusty sword.
Revenge is sweet!” And upward glanced the steel;
But ere it fell,—dear Lord! a silvery peal
Of voices chanting in the town below,
Grave, ghostly voices chanting far below,
Rose, like a fountain's spray from spires of snow,
And chimed and chimed to die in echoes slow.
In the sweet silence following the sound,
Gualberto and the man upon the ground
Glared at each other with bewildered eyes,-
The glare of hunted deer on leashed hound;
And then the vanquished, struggling to arise,
Made one last effort, while his face grew dark
With pleading agony: "Gualberto! hark !
The chant-the hour—thou know'st the olden
fashion,-
The monks below intone our Lord's dear Passion.
Oh! by this cross !”—and here he caught the hilt
Of Gaulbert's sword, and by the blood once spilt
Upon it for us both long years ago,
Forgive-forget-and spare a fallen foe!”

The face that bent above grew white and set;
Christ or the demon ?-in the balance hung:
The lips were drawn,—the brow bedewed with
sweat,-
But on the grass the harmless sword was flung:
And stooping down, the hero, generous, wrung
The outstretched hand. Then, lest he lose control
Of the but half-tamed passions of his soul,
Fled up the pathway, tearing casque and coat
To ease the tempest throbbing at his throat;
Fled up the crags, as if a fiend pursued,
And paused not till he reached a chapel rude.
There in the cool, dim stillness, on his knees,
Trembling, he flings himself, and, startled, sees
Set in the rock a crucifix antique,
From which the wounded Christ bends down to
speak:
"Thou hast done well, Gualberto. For My sake
Thou didst forgive thine enemy; now take
My gracious pardon for thy times of sin,
And from this day a better life begin.”
White flashed the angels' wings above his head,
Rare, subtile perfumes through the place were
shed;
And golden harps and sweetest voices poured
Their glorious hosannas to the Lord,
Who in that hour, and in that chapel quaint,
Changed by His power, by His dear love's con-
straint,
Gualbert the sinner into John the saint.

THE ROBBER
From the German
On the lone deserted cross-road,
Under the high crucifix,
Stood the robber, slyly lurking;
In his hand his naked sabre,
And his rifle, heavy loaded;
For the merchant would he plunder,
Who with his full weight of money,
With his garments, and his rare wines,
Came to-day home from the market.
Down already had the sun sunk,
And the moon peers through the cloudlets,
And the robber stands awaiting
Under the high crucifix.
Hark! a sound like angel voices,
Soft, low, sighing deep entreaty,
Coming clear as evening bells
Borne through the still atmosphere!
Sweet, with unaccustomed accent,
Steals a prayer upon his ear,
And he stands and listens anxious:
"O thou Guide of the deserted!
O thou Guardian of the lost ones!
Bend, oh bend Thy heavenly face,
Clear as sunlight, softly smiling,
Down on us, four little ones;
Fold, oh fold Thy arms of mercy,
Which were on the cross extended,
Like two wings around our father,
That no storm destroy his pathway,
That his good steed may not stumble,

That the robber, still and lurking
In the forest, may not harm him.
O Protector of th' abandoned,
O Thou guide of the deserted,
Send us home our own dear father!”—
And the robber heard it all
Under the high crucifix.
Then the youngest crossing himself,
Folding his soft hands demurely,
"O Thou dear Christ,” lisps he, childlike,
“Oh, I know Thou art almighty,
Sitting on the throne of heaven,
With the stars all glittering golden,-
As the nurse has told me often,-
Oh, be gracious, 0 Thou dear Christ!
Give the robbers, the rapacious,
Give them bread, and bread in plenty,
That they may not need to plunder
Or to murder our good father!
Did I know where lived a robber,
I would give this little chainlet,
Give to him this cross and girdle,
Saying, 'O thou dear, dear robber,
Take this chain, this cross and girdle,
That you may not need to plunder
Or to murder our dear father!'”
And the robber hears it all
Under the high crucifix.
From afar he hears approaching
Snorting steeds and wheels swift rolling;
Slowly then he takes his rifle,
Slowly does he seize his sabre.

And he stands there deeply thinking,
Under the high crucifix.
And the children still are kneeling,
"O Thou Guide of the deserted,
O Thou Guardian of the wanderer,
Send us home our own dear father!”
And the father came home riding
All in safety, unendangered;
Clasps his children to his bosom,-
Happy stammerings, kisses sweet.-
Only the bare sabre found they ;
Found the rifle heavy loaded;
Both had fallen from his hand
Under the high crucifix.
MURILLO'S TRANCE*_M. J. PRESTON.
"Here, Pedro, while I quench these candles, hold
My lantern; for, I promise you, we burn
No waxlights at our chapel-shrines till morn,
As in the great Cathedral, kept ablaze
Like any crowded plaza in Seville,
From sun to sun. I wonder if they think
That the dead knights,—Fernando and the rest,-
Whose bronze and marble couches line the walls,
Like to scared children, cannot sleep i’ the dark.”
And, muttering thus, the churlish sacristan
Went, snuffing out the lights that only served
To worsen the wan gloom.

And, mindful still
Of his Dolores' greed of candle-ends,
He chid, at whiles, some lagging worshipper,
Nor spared to hint, above the low-dropped heads,
Grumblings of sunshine being in Seville
Cheaper than waxlight, and 'twere best to pray
When all the saints were broad awake, and thus
Liker to hear.
So shuffling on, he neared
The altar with its single lamp a-light.
Above, touched with its glow, the chapel's pride,
Its one Ribera hung,-a fearful-sad,
Soul-harrowing picture of the stark dead Christ,
Stretched on the cross beneath a ghastly glare
Of lurid rift, that made more terrible
The God-forsaken loneliness. In front,
A chasm of shadow clove the checkered floor;
And hastening towards it, the old verger called
Wonderingly back:
“Why, Pedro, only see!
The boy kneels still! What ails him, think you?
Here
He came long hours before the vesper-chime;
And all the while, as to and fro I've wrought,-
Cleansing of altar-steps and dusting shrines,
And such like tasks,—I have not missed him once
From that same spot. What marvel if he were
Some lunatic escaped from Caridad?
Observe! he takes no heed of aught I say:
'Tis time he waked.”
As moveless as the statues
Niched round, a youth before the picture knelt,

His hands tight clenched, and his moist forehead
strewn
With tossings of dank hair. Upon his arm
The rude old man sprang such a sudden grasp
As caused a start; while in his ear he cried
Sharply, “Get hence! What do you here so late ?"
Slow on the questioner a face was turned
That caused the heavy hand to drop,-a face
Strangely pathetic, with wide-gazing eyes
And wistful brows, and lips that wanly made
Essay to speak before the words would come;
And an imploring lifting of the hands
That seemed a prayer:
-"I wait,—I wait," he said,
“Till Joseph bring the linen, pure and white,
Till Mary fetch the spices; till they come,-
Peter and John and all the holy women,
And take Him down; but o, they tarry long!

THE O'KAVANAGHSHEA.
The Saxons had met, and the banquet was spread,
And the wine in fleet circles the jubilee led;
And the banners, that hung round the festal that

Seemed brighter by far than when lifted in fight.
In came the O'Kavanagh, fair as the morn,
When earth to new beauty and vigor is born:
They shrank from his glance like the waves from
the prow,
For nature's nobility sat on his brow.

Attended alone by his vassal and bard,
No trumpet to herald, no clansmen to guard,
He came not attended by steed or by steel:
No danger he knew, for no fear did he feel.
In eye, and on lip, his high confidence smiled,
So proud, yet so knightly; so gallant, yet mild;
He moved like a god through the light of that hall,
And a smile, full of courtliness, proffered to all.
“Come pledge us, lord chieftain! come pledge us !"
they cried.
Unsuspectingly free to the pledge he replied,
And this was the peace-branch O’Kavanagh bore,--
“The friendships to come, not the feuds that are
o'er!"—
But, minstrel, why cometh a change o'er thy
theme?
Why sing of red battle; what dream dost thou
dream?
Ha! "Treason!” 's the cry, and “Revenge!" is the
call,
As the swords of the Saxons surrounded the hall.
A kingdom for Angelo's mind to portray
Green Erin's undaunted avenger that day,-
The far-flashing sword, and the death-darting eye,
Like some comet commissioned with wrath from
the sky.
Through the ranks of the Saxon he hewed his red
way,-
Through lances, and sabres, and hostile array;
And, mounting his charger, he left them to tell
The tale of that feast, and its bloody farewell.

And now on the Saxons his clansmen advance,
With a shout from each heart, and a soul in each

And swept through their ranks like the angel of

THE BATTLE OF WATERLOO-BYRON.
There was a sound of revelry by night,
And Belgium's capital had gathered then
Her beauty and her chivalry, and bright
The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men:
A thousand hearts beat happily; and when
Music arose, with its voluptuous swell,
Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,
And all went merry as a marriage-bell.-
But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising
knell.
Did ye not hear it?-No; 'twas but the wind,
Or the car rattling o'er the stony street.
On with the dance! let joy be unconfined;
No sleep till morn, when youth and pleasure meet,
To chase the glowing hours with flying feet.-
But hark! that heavy sound breaks in once more,

As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
And nearer, clearer, deadlier, than before!
Arm! arm! it is—it is—the cannon's opening roar!
Within a windowed niche of that high hall
Sat Brunswick's fated chieftain. He did hear
That sound the first amidst the festival,
And caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear;
And when they smiled because he deemed it near,
His heart more truly knew that peal too well,
Which stretched his father on a bloody bier,
And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell.
He rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell.
Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,
And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,
And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago
Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness;
And there were sudden partings, such as press
The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
Which ne'er might be repeated. Who could guess
If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,
Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could
rise.
And there was mounting in hot haste:the steed,
The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,
Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,
And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;
And the deep thunder, peal on peal, afar;
And near, the beat of the alarum drum
Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;
While thronged the citizens, with terror dumb,
Or whispering, with white lips, "The foe! They
come! They come !"

Last eve, in beauty's circle, proudly gay;

The morn, the marshalling in arms; the day,

CÆSAR'S PASSAGE OF THE RUBICON
-KNOWLES.
A gentleman, Mr. Chairman, speaking of
Cæsar's benevolent disposition, and of the reluctance
with which he entered into the civil war, observes :
“How long did he pause upon the brink of the
Rubicon!" How came he to the brink of that river?
How dared he cross it? Shall private men respect
the boundaries of private property, and shall a man
pay no respect to the boundaries of his country's
rights? How dared he cross that river? O! but
"he paused upon the brink.” He should have
perished upon the brink ere he had crossed it! Why
did he pause? Why does a man's heart palpitate
when he is on the point of committing an unlawful
deed? Why does the very murderer, his victim
sleeping before him, and his glaring eye taking the
measure of the blow, strike wide of the mortal part?
Because of conscience! 'Twas that made Cæsar
pause upon the brink of the Rubicon. "Compassion"!
What compassion? The compassion of an assassin,

that feels a momentary shudder, as his weapon be-
gins to cut. “Caesar paused upon the brink of the
Rubicon!" What was the Rubicon? The boundary
of Cæsar's province. From what did it separate
his province? From his country. Was that country
a desert? No, it was cultivated and fertile, rich and
populous. Its sons were men of genius, spirit and
generosity. Its daughters were lovely, susceptible,
and chaste. Friendship was its inhabitant. Love
was its inhabitant. Domestic affection was its in-
habitant. Liberty was its inhabitant. All bounded
by the stream of the Rubicon! What was Cæsar,
that stood upon the bank of that stream? A traitor,
bringing war and pestilence into the heart of that
country. No wonder that he paused; no wonder if,
his imagination wrought upon by his conscience, he
had beheld blood instead of water, and heard groans
instead of murmurs. No wonder if some gorgon
horror had turned him into stone upon the spot!
But no!—He cried, “The die is cast!" He plunged !
He crossed! And Rome was free no more.
THE BALLAD OF ISHMAEL DAY
One summer morning a daring band
Of rebels rode into Maryland,
Over the prosperous peaceful farms,
Sending terror and strange alarms,
The clatter of hoofs and the clang of arms.
Fresh from the South, where the hungry pine
They ate like Pharaoh's starving kine,
They swept the land like devouring surge,

And left their path, to its furthest verge,
Bare as the track of the locust-scourge.
“The rebels are coming," far and near
Rang the tidings of dread and fear;
Some paled and cowered and sought to hide;
Some stood erect in their fearless pride;
And women shuddered, and children cried.
But others, vipers in human form,
Stinging the bosom that kept them warm,
Welcomed with triumph the thievish band,
Hurried to offer the friendly hand,
As the rebels rode into Maryland,
Made them merry with food and wine,
Clad them in garments rich and fine,
For rags and hunger to make amends,
Flattered them, praised them with selfish ends:
“Leave us scathless, for we are friends!"
Could traitors trust a traitor? No!
Little they favored friend or foe,
But gathered the cattle the farms across,
Flinging back, with a scornful toss,
"If ye are friends, ye can bear the loss !”
Flushed with triumph and wine and prey,
They neared the dwelling of Ishmael Day,
A sturdy old veteran, gray and old,
With heart of a patriot, firm and bold,
Strong and steadfast, unbribed, unsold.
And Ishmael Day, his brave head bare,
His white locks tossed by the morning air,
Fearless of danger or death or scars,

Went out to raise, by the farm-yard bars,
The dear old flag of the Stripes and Stars.
Proudly, steadily, up it flew,
Gorgeous with crimson and white and blue:
His withered hand as he shook it freer,
May have trembled, but not with fear,
While, shouting, the rebels drew more near.
“Halt!”—They had seen the hated sign
Floating free from old Ishmael's line-
“Lower that rag!” was their wrathful cry.
"Never!" rung Ishmael Day's reply;
“Fire, if it please you; I can but die!"
One, with a loud, defiant laugh,
Left his comrades, and neared the staff.
"Down !" came the fearless patriot's cry,
"Dare to lower that flag, and die!
One must bleed for it-you or I!”
But caring not for the stern command,
He drew the halliards with daring hand;
Ping! went the rifle-ball; down he came
Under the flag he had tried to shame:
Old Ishmael Day took careful aim.
Seventy winters and three had shed
Their snowy glories on Ishmael's head;
But though cheeks may wither, and locks grow
gray,
His fame shall be fresh, and young alway:
Honor be to old Ishmael Day!

THE FIREMAN-ROBERT T. CONRAD.
The city slumbers. O'er its mighty walls
Night's dusky mantle, soft and silent, falls;
Sleep o'er the world slow waves its wand of lead,
And ready torpors wrap each sinking head.
Stilled is the stir of labor and of life;
Hushed is the hum, and tranquilized the strife.
Man is at rest, with all his hopes and fears:
The young forget their sports, the old their cares;
The grave are careless; those who joy or weep
All rest contented on the arm of sleep.
Sweet is the pillowed rest of beauty now,
And slumber smiles upon her tranquil brow;
Her bright dreams lead her to the moonlit tide,
Her heart's own partner wandering by her side;
'Tis summer's eve; the soft gales scarcely rouse
The low-voiced ripple and the rustling boughs;
And, faint and far, some minstrel's melting tone
Breathes to her heart a music like its own.
When, hark! O horror! what a crash is there!
What shriek is that which fills the midnight air?
'Tis fire! 'tis fire! She wakes to dream no more;
The hot blast rushes through the blazing door;
The dun smoke eddies round; and, hark! that cry:
“Help! help! Will no one aid ? I die, I die!"
She seeks the casement; shuddering at its height
She turns again; the fierce flames mock her flight;
Along the crackling stairs they fiercely play,
And roar, exulting, as they seize their prey.
“Help! help! Will no one come ?” She can no more,
But, pale and breathless, sinks upon the floor.

The falling timbers menace him with death;
The sinking floors his hurried step betray;

Still on! yet on! once more! Thank heaven, she's

Heroic work of Irish troops allied with the French against the English.
Thrice at the huts of Fontenoy the English column

And twice the lines of Saint Antoine, the Dutch in

For town and slope were filled with fort and flank-
ing battery,
And well they swept the English ranks and Dutch
auxiliary.
As vainly through De Barri's wood the British
soldiers burst,

And ordered up his last reserve, his latest chance
to try.

And mustering come his chosen troops, like clouds

Six thousand English veterans in stately column
tread;
Their cannon blaze in front and flank; Lord Hay is

Steady they step adown the slope; steady they
climb the hill;
Steady they load; steady they fire, moving right
onward still;
Betwixt the wood and Fontenoy, as through a fur-
nace blast,
Through rampart, trench, and palisade, and bullets
showering fast;
And on the open plain above they rose and kept
their course,
With ready fire and grim resolve that mocked at
hostile force;
Past Fontenoy, past Fontenoy, while thinner grow
their ranks,
They break, as broke the Zuyder Zee, through Hol-
land's ocean banks.
More idly than the summer flies, French tirailleurs
rush round;

To death they rush, but rude their shock; not un-

hearts to-day,-
The treaty broken ere the ink wherewith 'twas writ
could dry,
Their plundered homes, their ruined shrines, their
women's parting cry,
Their priesthood hunted down like wolves, their
country overthrown,-

Yet, mustering all the strength they have, they

With empty guns clutched in their hands, the head-
long Irish broke.

“Revenge! remember Limerick! dash down the

LEIGH HUNT.
King Francis was a hearty king, and loved a royal

And one day as his lions fought, sat looking on the

The nobles filled the benches, with the ladies in

And ’mongst them sat the Count de Lorge, with one
for whom he sighed.
And truly 'twas a gallant thing to see that crown-
ing show:
Valor and love, and a king above, and the royal
beasts below.
Ramped and roared the lions, with horrid laughing
jaws;
They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a
wind went with their paws;

With wallowing might and stifled roar they rolled
on one another.
Till all the pit with sand and mane was in a thun-
derous smother.
The bloody foam above the bars came whisking
through the air;
Said Francis then, “Faith, gentlemen, we're better
here than there."
De Lorge's love o'erheard the king, a beauteous
lively dame,
With smiling lips and sharp bright eyes, which al-
ways seemed the same;
She thought: “The Count, my lover, is brave as
brave can be,
He surely would do wondrous things to show his
love of me:
King, ladies, lovers, all look on; the occasion is
divine;
I'll drop my glove, to prove his love; great glory
will be mine!”
She dropped her glove, to prove his love, then
looked on him and smiled;
He bowed, and in a moment leaped among the lions
wild :
The leap was quick, return was quick, he has re-
gained his place,
Then threw the glove, but not with love, right in
the lady's face.
“By heaven!” said Francis, “Rightly done!" and he
rose from where he sat;
“No love," quoth he, “but vanity, sets love a task
like that."

At midnight in his guarded tent
The Turk was dreaming of the hour,
When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,
Should tremble at his power:
In dreams through camp and court he bore
The trophies of a conqueror;-
In dreams his song of triumph heard ;
Then wore his monarch's signet ring;
Then pressed that monarch's throne,-a king:
As wild his thoughts and gay of wing
As Eden's garden bird.
An hour passed on,--the Turk awoke;
That bright dream was his last.
He woke, to hear his sentries shriek,
"To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek !"
He woke, to die midst flame and smoke
And shout and groan and sabre-stroke,
And death-shots falling thick and fast,
As lightnings from the mountain cloud;
And heard, with voice as trumpet loud,
Bozzaris cheer his band:
"Strike! till the last armed foe expires !
Strike! for your altars and your fires !
Strike! for the green graves of your sires;
God, and your native land!”
They fought like brave men long and well;
They piled the ground with Moslem slain;

And the red field was won;
Then saw in death his eyelids close,
Calmly, as to a night's repose,
Like flowers at set of sun.
Come to the bridal chamber, death!
Come to the mother, when she feels
For the first time her first-born's breath;
Come when the blessed seals
That close the pestilence are broke,
And crowded cities wail its stroke;
Come in consumption's ghastly form,
The earthquake shock, the ocean storm;
Come when the heart beats high and warm,
With banquet song and dance and wine,
And thou art terrible: the tear,
The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier,
And all we know, or dream, or fear,
Of agony, are thine.
But to the hero, when his sword
Has won the battle for the free,
Thy voice sounds like a prophet's word;
And in its hollow tones are heard
The thanks of millions yet to be.
Bożzaris! with the storied brave,
Greece nurtured in her glory's time,
Rest thee! There is no prouder grave,
Even in her own proud clime.
We tell thy doom without a sigh,

FALL OF WARSAW
- THOMAS CAMPBELL
O sacred Truth! Thy triumph ceased a while,
And Hope, thy sister, ceased with thee to smile,
When leagued oppression poured to Northern wars
Her whiskered pandours and her fierce hussars,-
Waved her dread standard to the breeze of morn,
Pealed her loud drum, and twanged her trumpet
horn;
Tumultuous horror brooded o'er her van,
Presaging wrath to Poland, and to man!
Warsaw's last champion from her heights sur-
veyed
Wide o'er the fields a waste of ruin laid.
“O heaven!” he cried, “my bleeding country save!
Is there no hand on high to shield the brave?
Yet, though destruction sweep these lovely plains,
Rise, fellow-men, our country yet remains !
By that dread name, we wave the sword on high,
And swear for her to live with her to die!"
He said; and on the rampart heights arrayed
His trusty warriors, few, but undismayed;
Firm paced and slow, a horrid front they form,
Still as the breeze, but dreadful as the storm;
Low, murmuring sounds along their banners
fly,
"Revenge, or death!"—the watchword and reply;
Then pealed the notes, omnipotent to charm,

And the loud focsin tolled their last alarm.
In vain, alas! in vain, ye gallant few !
From rank to rank your volleyed thunder flew.
O! bloodiest picture in the book of time,
Sarmatia fell, unwept, without a crime;
Found not a generous friend, a pitying foe,
Strength in her arms, nor mercy in her woe.
Dropped from her nerveless grasp the shattered
spear,
Closed her bright eye, and curbed her high career.
Hope for a season bade the world farewell,
And freedom shrieked, as Kosciusko fell.
O righteous heaven! Ere freedom found a grave,
Why slept the sword, omnipotent to save?
Where was thine arm, O vengeance, where thy rod,
That smote the foes of Sion and of God?
Departed spirits of the mighty dead!
Ye that at Marathon and Leuctra bled!
Friends of the world! Restore your swords to man,
Fight in his sacred cause, and lead the van!
Yet for Sarmatia's tears of blood atone,
And make her arm puissant as your own!
Oh, once again to freedom's cause return
The patriot Tell,—the Bruce of Bannockburn!
Yes, thy proud lords, unpitied land! shall see
That man hath yet a soul, and dare be free!
A little while, along thy saddening plains,
The starless night of desolation reigns;
Truth shall restore the light by nature given,
And, like Prometheus, bring the fires of heaven.
Prone to the dust oppression shall be hurled,
Her name, her nature, withered from the world.

THE SEMINOLE'S DEFIANCE-PATTEN.
Blaze, with your serried columns! I will not bend
the knee;
The shackle ne'er again shall bind the arm which
now is free!
I've mailed it with the thunder, when the tempest
muttered low,
And where it falls, ye well may dread the lightning
of its blow.
I've scared you in the city; I've scalped you on the
plain;
Go, count your chosen where they fell beneath my
leaden rain!
I scorn your proffered treaty; the pale-face I defy;
Revenge is stamped upon my spear, and "blood"
my battle-cry!
Some strike for hope of booty; some to defend their
all;
I battle for the joy I have to see the white man fall.
I love among the wounded to hear his dying moan,
And catch, while chanting at his side, the music of
his groan.
Ye've trailed me through the forest; ye've tracked
me o'er the stream;
And struggling through the everglade your brist-
ling bayonets gleam;
But I stand as should the warrior, with his rifle and
his spear;
The scalp of vengeance still is red, and warns you,
-“Come not here!"
Think ye to find my homestead ?-I gave it to the
fire.

But, should ye crave life's nourishment, enough I

I live on hate,—'t is all my bread; yet light is not

I loathe you with my bosom. I scorn you with
mine eye.
And I'll taunt you with my latest breath, and fight

I ne'er will ask for quarter, and I ne'er will be your

But I'll swim the sea of slaughter till I sink beneath

CRITICISM OF MR. BROUGHAM'S SPEECH
ON THE ADDRESS_-CANNING.
Few orators have ever wielded the weapon of satire and humorous
sarcasm more effectively than Mr. Canuing. This and the following pieces,
gathered from the speeches of Mr. Canning have been especially selected
to give the student of Elocution an occasion to exercise himself in the
production of this style of invective. Peculiar pitches and inflections of
the voice, significant expression of the eyes and countenance, and char-
acteristic forms of gesture and bodily poco are needed, to deliver a scathing
rebuke to abuses and to hold them up to ridicule and contempt
I now turn to that other part of the honorable
and learned gentleman's speech, in which he ac-
knowledges his acquiescence in the passages of the
Address, echoing the satisfaction felt at the success
of the liberal commercial principles adopted by this
country, and at the steps taken for recognizing the
new States of America.
It does happen, however, that the honorable and
learned gentleman, being not unfrequently a speak-
er in this house, nor very concise in his speeches,


## p. 322 (#450) ############################################

322
STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
and touching occasionally, as he proceeds, on al-
most every subject within the range of his imagin-
ation, as well as making some observations on the
matters on hand, and having at different periods
proposed and supported every innovation of which
the law or constitution of the country is susceptible,
-it is impossible to innovate, without appearing to
borrow from him.
Either, therefore, we must remain forever locked
up as in a northern winter, or we must break our
way out by some mode already suggested by the
honorable and learned gentleman; and then he cries
out: “Ah, I was there before you! That is what I
told you to do; but, as you would not do it then, you
have no right to do it now."
In Queen Anne's reign there lived a very sage
and able critic, named Dennis, who in his old age
was the prey of a strange fancy, that he had him-
self written all the good things in all the good plays
that were acted. Every good passage that he met
with in any author he insisted was his own. “It is
none of his," Dennis would always say; "it is mine."
He went one day to see a new tragedy. Nothing
particularly good, to his taste, occurred, till a scene
in which a great storm was represented. As soon
as he had heard the thunder rolling overhead, he
exclaimed, “That's my thunder!" So it is with the
honorable and learned gentleman—it's all his thun-
der! It will henceforth be impossible to confer any
boon, or make any innovation, but he will claim it
as his thunder.
But it is due to him to acknowledge that he does
not claim every thing. He will be content with the

exclusive merit of the liberal measures relating to
trade and commerce. Not desirous of violating his
own principles, by claiming a monopoly of foresight
and wisdom, he kindly throws overboard to my
honorable and learned friend near him, the praise
of South America.
I should like to know whether, in some degree,
this also is not his thunder. He thinks it right in
itself; but, lest we should be too proud if he ap-
proved our conduct in toto, he thinks it wrong in
point of time. I differ from him essentially; for, if
I pique myself on any thing in this affair, it is on
the time.
That, at some time or other, States, which had
separated themselves from
from the mother-country,
should be admitted to the rank of independent na-
tions, is a proposition to which no possible dissent
could be given. The whole question was one of
time and mode.
There were two modes: one a reckless and head-
long course, by which we might have reached our
object at once, but at the expense of drawing upon
us consequences not lightly to be incurred; the other
was more strictly guarded in point of principle; so
that, while we pursued our own interest, we took
care to give no just cause of offense to other powers,
while we acted in obedience to a sound and enlight-
ened policy.
PEACE WITH FRANCE CANNING.
The friendship of Holland! The independence
of Spain! Is there a man so besotted as to suppose


## p. 324 (#452) ############################################

324
STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
that there is one hour of peace with France pre-
served by either of these unhappy countries, that
there is one syllable of friendship uttered by them
towards France, but what is extorted by the imme-
diate pressure, or by the dread and terror of French
arms ?-
-“Mouth-honor, breath,
Which the poor heart would fain refuse, but dare not.”
Have the regenerated Republic of Holland, the de-
graded Monarchy of Spain, such reason to rejoice in
the protection of the French Republic, that they
would voluntarily throw themselves between her and
any blow which might menace her existence?
But does the honorable gentleman intend his
motion as a motion for peace? If he really thinks
this a moment for opening a negotiation, why has
he not the candor and manliness to say so? Mark, I
entreat you, how delicately he manages it. He will
not speak to France, but he would speak at her. He
will not propose, not he, that we should say to the
Directory, "Will you make peace?" No, sir; we are
merely to say to ourselves, loud enough for the
Directory to overhear us: "I wish these French
gentlemen would make an overture to us.” Now, sir,
does this save the dignity of the country? Or is it
only a sneaking, shabby way of doing what, if fit
to be done at all, must, to have any serious effect,
be done openly, unequivocally and directly? But
I beg the honorable gentleman's pardon; I mis-
represent him; I certainly do. His motion does not
amount even to so much as I have stated. He begins
further off. The soliloquy which he prompts us by
his motion is no more than this: "We must continue

to make war against France, to be sure, and we are
sorry for it; but we will not do it as if we bore
malice. We will not make an ill-natured, hostile
kind of war any longer,—that we won't. And who
knows but, if they should happen to overhear this
resolution, as the Directory are good-natured at bot-
tom, their hearts may soften and grow kind towards
us,—and then they will offer to make a peace!" And
thus, sir, and thus only, is the motion a motion for
peace.
THE ANTAGONISM OF VICES-CANNING.
My honorable and learned friend began by tell-
ing us that, after all, hatred is no bad thing in itself.
“I hate a tory,” says my honorable friend; "and
another man hates a cat; but it does not follow that
he would hunt down the cat, or I the tory." Nay,
so far from it, hatred, if it be properly managed, is,
according to my honorable friend's theory, no bad
preface to a rational esteem and affection. It pre-
pares its votaries for a reconciliation of differ-
ences, for lying down with their most inveterate
enemies, like the leopard and the kid in the vision of
the prophet. This dogma is a little startling, but it
is not altogether without precedent. It is borrowed
from a character in a play, which is, I dare say, as
great a favorite with my learned friend as it is with
me, I mean the comedy of the Rivals; in which
Mrs. Malaprop, giving a lecture on the subject of
marriage to her niece, (who is unreasonable enough
to talk of liking, as a necessary preliminary to such
a union), says, “What have you to do with your
29

likings and your preferences, child? Depend upon
it, it is safest to begin with a little aversion. I am
sure I hated your poor dear uncle like a blackamoor
before we were married; and yet, you know, my
dear, what a good wife I made him.” Such is my
learned friend's argument, to a hair. But, finding
that this doctrine did not appear to go down with
the House so glibly as he had expected, my honor-
able and learned friend presently changed his tack,
and put forward a theory which, whether for nov-
elty or for beauty, I pronounce to be incomparable;
and, in short, as wanting nothing to recommend it
but a slight foundation in truth. “True philosophy,"
says my honorable friend, "will always continue to
lead men to virtue by the instrumentality of their
conflicting vices. The virtues, where more than one
exists, may live harmoniously together; but the
vices bear mortal antipathy to one another, and,
therefore, furnish to the moral engineer the power
by which he can make each keep the other under
control.” Admirable! But, upon this doctrine, the
poor man who has but one single vice must be in a
very bad way: no fulcrum, no moral power, for
effecting his cure! Whereas, his more fortunate
neighbor, who has two or more vices in his composi-
tion, is in a fair way of becoming a very virtuous
member of society. I wonder how my learned friend
would like to have this doctrine introduced into his
domestic establishment. For instance, suppose that
I discharge a servant because he is addicted to
liquor, I could not venture to recommend him to my
honorable and learned friend. It might be the poor
man's only fault, and therefore clearly incorrigible;

327
but, if I had the good fortune to find out that he was
also addicted to stealing, might I not, with a safe
conscience, send him to my learned friend with a
strong recommendation, saying, "I send you a man
whom I know to be a drunkard; but I am happy to
assure you he is also a thief: you cannot do better
than employ him; you will make his drunkenness
counteract his thievery, and no doubt you will bring
him out of the conflict a very moral personage.”
THE WAR WITH FRANCE-CANNING.
We have been told that this is a war into which
we have been hurried by clamor and prejudice; in
short, that it is a war of passion. An appeal is made
to our prudence; and we are asked, with an air of
triumph, what are we to get by this war? Sir, that
we have still a government; that the functions of
this House have not been usurped by a correspond-
ing society, or a Scotch Convention; that, instead
of sitting in debate here, whether or not we shall
subsidize the king of Sardinia, we are not rather
employed in devising how to raise a forced loan for
some proconsular deputy, whom the banditti of
Paris might have sent to receive our contributions;
-Sir, that we sit here at all,—these are the fruits
of the war.
But, when neither our reason nor our prudence
can be set against the war, an attempt is made to
alarm our apprehensions. The French are stated
to be an invincible people: inflamed to a degree of
madness with the holy enthusiasm of freedom, there


## p. 328 (#456) ############################################

328
STUDENT'S CLASS-BOOK OF ELOCUTION
is nothing that they cannot accomplish. I am as
ready as any man to allow that the French are
enthusiastically animated, be it how it may, to a
state of absolute insanity. I desire no better proof
of their being mad, than to see them hugging them-
selves in a system of slavery so gross and grinding
as their present, and calling, at the same time, aloud
upon all Europe to admire and envy their freedom.
But, before their plea of madness can be admitted
as conclusive against our right to be at war with
them, gentlemen would do well to recollect that of
madness there are several kinds. If theirs had been
a harmless idiot lunacy, which had contented itself
with playing its tricks and practicing its fooleries
at home,—with inventing nick-names for the
calendar, I should have been far from desiring to
interrupt their innocent amusements; we might
have looked on with hearty contempt, indeed, but
with a contempt not wholly unmixed with com-
miseration. But, if theirs be a madness of a dif-
ferent kind,-a moody, mischievous insanity,if,
not contented with tearing and wounding them-
selves, they proceed to exert their unnatural
strength for the annoyance of their neighbors,-if,
not satisfied with weaving straws and wearing fet-
ters at home, they attempt to carry their systems
and their slavery abroad, and to impose them on the
nations of Europe,—it becomes necessary, then, that
those nations should be roused to resistance. Such
a disposition must, for the safety and peace of the
world, be repelled, and, if possible, be eradicated.

THE BARON'S LAST BANQUET-GREENE.
O'er a low couch the setting sun had thrown its
latest ray.
Where, in his last strong agony, a dying warrior
lay,
The stern old Baron Rudiger, whose frame had
ne'er been bent
By wasting pain, till time and toil its iron strength
had spent.
"They come around me here, and say my days of
life are o'er,
That I shall mount my noble steed and lead my
band no more;
They come, and, to my beard, they dare to tell me
now that I,
Their own liege lord and master born, that I—ha!
ha !must die.
"And what is death? I've dared him oft, before the
paynim spear;
Think ye he's entered at my gate, has come to
seek me here?
I've met him, faced him, scorned him, when the
fight was raging hot ;-
I'll try his might, I'll brave his power;—defy, and
fear him not.
"Ho! sound the tocsin from my tower, and fire the
culverin;
Bid each retainer arm with speed; call every
vassal in!
Up with my banner on the wall !—The banquet-
board prepare;

Throw wide the portal of my hall, and bring my
armor there!"
An hundred hands were busy then; the banquet
forth was spread;
And rung the heavy oaken floor with many a mar-
tial tread;
While from the rich, dark tracery, along the
vaulted wall,
Lights gleamed on harness, plume and spear, o'er
the proud old Gothic hall.
Fast hurrying through the outer gate, the mailed
retainers poured,
On through the portal's frowning arch, and
thronged around the board;
While at its head, within his dark, carved, oaken
chair of state,
Armed cap-a-pie, stern Rudiger, with girded fal-
chion, sate.
“Fill every beaker up, my men ! Pour forth the
cheering wine!
There's life and strength in every drop,—thanks-
giving to the vine!
Are ye all there, my vassals true?-mine eyes are
waxing dim.
Fill round, my tried and fearless ones, each goblet
to the brim!
“Ye're there, but yet I see you not!— Draw forth
each trusty sword,
And let me hear your faithful steel clash once
around my board!

I hear it faintly ;-louder yet! What clogs my
heavy breath?
Up, all !and shout for Rudiger, 'Defiance unto
death!'"
Bowl rang to bowl, steel clanged to steel, and rose
a deafening cry,
That made the torches flare around, and shook the
flags on high:
“Ho! cravens! do ye fear him? Slaves! traitors!
have ye flown?
Ho! cowards, have ye left me to meet him here
alone?
“But I defy him!—Let him come!" Down rang the
massy cup,
While from its sheath the ready blade came flash-
ing half-way up;
And, with the black and heavy plumes scarce
trembling on his head,
There, in his dark, carved, oaken chair, old Rudiger
sat-dead.

Of petty tyrants, feudal despots,-lords,
Rich in some dozen paltry villages;
Strong in some hundred spearmen; only great
In that strange spell,—a name!

Full of all gentleness, of calmest hope,
Of sweet and quiet joy: there was the look
Of heaven upon his face, which limners give
To the beloved disciple. How I loved

Brother at once and son! He left my side,
A summer bloom on his fair cheeks, a smile
Parting his innocent lips. In one short hour,
That pretty, harmless boy was slain! I saw
The corse, the mangled corse, and then I cried
For vengeance: Rouse, ye Romans! Rouse, ye

Enfranchised through yon starry dome,
Rejoice; for souls of kindred fire

To their young loves, re-climbed the steep
And gained the shrine. His chiefs stood round,

Near and more near its echoings

Had seen those listening warrior-men,
With their swords grasped, their eyes of flame
Turned on their chief, could doubt the shame,
Th' indignant shame with which they thrill
To hear those shouts, and yet stand still?
He read their thoughts; they were his own:-
"What! while our arms can wield these blades,
Shall we die tamely, die alone?
Without one victim to our shades,
One Moslem heart where, buried deep,
The sabre from its toil may sleep?
No! God of Iran's burning skies!
Thou scorn'st th' inglorious sacrifice.
No! Though of all earth's hope bereft,
Life, swords, and vengeance still are left.
We'll make yon valley's reeking caves
Live in the awe-struck minds of men,
Till tyrants shudder when their slaves
Tell of the Ghebers' bloody glen.
Follow, brave hearts! This pile remains
Our refuge still from life and chains;
But his the best, the holiest bed,
Who sinks entombed in Moslem dead!"

THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB
-BYRON.
The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the
sea,
When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.
Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green,
That host with their banners at sunset were seen;
Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath
flown,
That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.
For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the
blast,
And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;
And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,
And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew
still.
And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,
But through it there rolled not the breath of his
pride;
And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,
And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.
And there lay the rider distorted and pale,
With the dew on his brow and the rust on his mail;
And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,
The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.
And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail;
And the idols are broken in the temple of Baal;
And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,
Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord.

SPARTACUS TO THE GLADIATORS AT CAPUA
-KELLOGG.
It had been a day of triumph in Capua. Lentulus,
returning with victorious eagles, had amused the
populace with the sports of the amphitheatre to an
extent hitherto unknown even in that luxurious city.
The shouts of revelry had died away; the roar of the
lion had ceased; the last loiterer had retired from
the banquet; and the lights in the palace of the vic-
tor were extinguished. The moon, piercing the
tissue of fleecy clouds, silvered the dewdrops on the
corslet of the Roman sentinel, and tipped the dark
waters of the Vulturnus with a wavy, tremulous
light. No sound was heard, save the last sob of some
retiring wave, telling its story to the smooth pebbles
of the beach; and then all was still as the breast
when the spirit had departed. In the deep recesses
of the amphitheatre, a band of gladiators were
assembled; their muscles still knotted with the
agony of conflict, the foam upon their lips, the scowl
of battle yet lingering on their brows; when
Spartacus, starting forth from amid the throng,
thus addressed them:
“Ye call me chief; and ye do well to call him chief,
who for twelve long years has met upon the arena

Rome could furnish, and who never yet lowered his

arm.

as the brooks by which I sported; and when at noon
I gathered the sheep beneath the shade, and played
upon the shepherd's flute, there was a friend, the
son of a neighbor, to join me in the pastime. We
led our flocks to the same pasture, and partook to-
gether our rustic meal. One evening, after the sheep
were folded, and we were all seated beneath the
myrtle which shaded our cottage, my grandsire, an
old man, was telling of Marathon and Leuctra; and
how in ancient times a little band of Spartans, in a
defile of the mountains, had withstood a whole army.
I did not then know what war was; but my cheeks
burned, I knew not why, and I clasped the knees of
that venerable man, until my mother, parting the
hair from off my forehead, kissed my throbbing
temples, and bade me go to rest, and think no more
of those old tales and savage wars. That very night,
the Romans landed on our coast. I saw the breast
that had nourished me trampled by the hoof of the
war-horse; the bleeding body of my father flung
amidst the blazing rafters of our dwelling.
“Today I killed a man in the arena; and, when I
broke his helmet-clasps, behold! he was my friend!
He knew me, smiled faintly, gasped, and died;—the
same sweet smile upon his lips that I had marked,
when, in adventurous boyhood, we scaled the lofty
cliff to pluck the first ripe grapes, and bear them
home in childish triumph. I told the prætor that
the dead man had been my friend, generous and
brave; and I begged that I might bear away the

body, to burn it on a funeral pile, and mourn over
its ashes. Ay! upon my knees, amid the dust and
blood of the arena, I begged that poor boon, while
all the assembled maids and matrons, and the holy
virgins they call Vestals, and the rabble, shouted
in derision, deeming it rare sport, forsooth, to see
Rome's fiercest gladiator turn pale and tremble at
sight of that piece of bleeding clay. And the prætor
drew back as I were polution, and sternly said: “Let
the carrion rot; there are no noble men but
Romans!” And so, fellow-gladiators, must you, and
so must I, die like dogs. O Rome! Rome! Thou
hast been a tender nurse to me. Ay! thou hast given
to that poor, gentle, timid shepherd-lad, who never
knew a harsher tone than a flute-note, muscles of
iron and a heart of flint; taught him to drive the
sword through plaited mail and links of rugged
brass, and warm it in the marrow of his foe;to
gaze into the glaring eye-balls of the fierce
Numidian lion, even as a boy upon a laughing girl.
And he shall pay thee back, until the yellow Tiber
is red as frothing wine, and in its deepest ooze thy
life-blood lies curdled.
“Ye stand here now like giants, as ye are! The
strongth of brass is in your toughened sinews; but
to-morrow some Roman Adonis, breathing sweet
perfume from his curly locks, shall with his lily
fingers pat your red brawn, and bet his sesterces
upon your blood. Hark! hear ye yon lion roaring
in his den? 'Tis three days since he tasted flesh;
but to-morrow he shall break his fast upon yours,-
and a dainty meal for him ye will be! If ye are
beasts, then stand here like fat oxen, waiting for

Strike down yon guard, gain the mountain passes,
and there do bloody work, as did your sires at Old
Thermopylæ! Is Sparta dead? Is the old Grecian
spirit frozen in your veins, that you do crouch and
cower like a belabored hound beneath his master's
lash? O comrades! warriors! Thracians! If we
must fight, let us fight for ourselves! If we must
slaughter, let us slaughter our oppressors! If we
must die, let it be under the clear sky, by the bright
waters, in noble, honorable battle!"
SPARTACUS TO THE ROMAN ENVOYS
IN ETRURIA-SARGENT.
Envoys of Rome, the poor camp of Spartacus is
too much honored by your presence. And does Rome
stoop to parley with the escaped gladiator,—with
the rebel ruffian, for whom heretofore no slight has
been too scornful? You have come, with steel in
your right hand, and with gold in your left. What
heed we give the former, ask Cossinius; ask
Claudius; ask Varinius; ask the bones of your
legions that fertilize the Lucanian plains. And for
your gold, would ye know what we do with that?
Go ask the laborer, the trodden poor, the helpless
and the hopeless, on our route; ask all whom Roman
tyranny had crushed or Roman avarice plundered.
Ye have seen me before; but ye did not then shun
my glance as now. Ye have seen me in the arena,
when I was Rome's pet ruffian, daily smeared with
blood of men or beasts. One day—shall I forget it

ever?—ye were present; I had fought long and well.
Exhausted as I was, your munerator, your lord of
the games, bethought him, it were an equal match
to set against me a new man, younger and lighter
than I, but fresh and valiant. With Thracian sword
and buckler, forth he came, a beautiful defiance on
his brow! Bloody and brief the fight. "He has it !”
cried the people; "habet! habet!" But still he
lowered not his arm, until, at length, I held him,
gashed and fainting, in my power. I looked around
upon the Podium, where sat your Senators and men
of State, to catch the signal of release, of mercy.
But not a thumb was reversed. To crown your
sport, the vanquished man must die. Obedient
brute that I was, I was about to slay him, when a
few hurried words, rather a welcome to death than
a plea for life, told me he was a Thracian. I stood
transfixed. The arena vanished. I was in Thrace,
upon my native hills. The sword dropped from my
hands. I raised the dying youth tenderly in my
arms. O, the magnanimity of Rome! Your haughty
leaders, enraged at being cheated of their death-
show, hissed their disappointment and shouted,
"Kill!" I heeded them as I would heed the howl of
wolves. Kill him ?- They might better have asked
the mother to kill the babe, smiling in her face.
Ah! he was already wounded unto death; and, amid
the angry yells of the spectators, he died. That
night I was scourged for disobedience. I shall not
forget it. Should memory fail, there are scars here
to quicken it.
Well; do not grow impatient. Some hours after,
finding myself, with seventy fellow-gladiators, alone

in the amphitheatre, the laboring thought broke
forth in words. I said, I know not what. I only
know that, when I ceased, my comrades looked each
other in the face, and then burst forth the simul-
taneous cry, "Lead on! lead on, O Spartacus !"
Forth we rushed, seized what rude weapons chance
threw in our way, and to the mountains speeded.
There, day by day, our little band increased. Dis-
dainful Rome sent after us a handful of her troops,
with a scourge for the slave, Spartacus. Their
weapons soon were ours. She sent an army; and
down from old Vesuvius we poured, and slew three
thousand. Now it was Spartacus, the dreaded rebel !
A larger army, headed by the Praetor, was sent,
and routed; then another still. And always I re-
membered that fierce cry, riving my heart, and call-
ing me to “kill!” In three pitched battles, have I
not obeyed it? And now affrighted Rome sends her
two Consuls, and puts forth all her strength by
land and sea, as if a Pyrrhus or a Hannibal were on
her borders.
Envoys of Rome! To Lentulus and Gellius bear
this message: "Their graves are measured !” Look
on that narrow stream, a silver thread, high on the
mountain's side. Slenderly it winds, but soon is
swelled by others meeting it, until a torrent terrible
and strong, it sweeps to the abyss, where all is ruin.
So Spartacus comes on. So swells his force, small
and despised at first, but now resistless. On, on to
Rome we come! The gladiators come! Let Opulence
tremble in all his palaces! Let Oppression shudder
to think the oppressed may have their turn! Let
Cruelty turn pale at thought of redder hands than

his! O! we shall not forget Rome's many lessons.
She shall not find her training was all wasted upon
indocile pupils. Now, begone! Prepare the Eternal
City for our games!
THE GLADIATOR-J. A. JONES.
They led a lion from his den,
The lord of Afric's sun-scorched plain;
And there he stood, stern foe of men,
And shook his flowing mane.
There's not of all Rome's heroes, ten
That dare abide this game.
His bright eye naught of lightning lacked;
His voice was like the cataract.
They brought a dark-haired man along,
Whose limbs with gyves of brass were bound;
Youthful he seemed, and bold, and strong,
And yet unscathed of wound.
Blithely he stepped among the throng,
And careless threw around
A dark eye, such as courts the path
Of him who braves a Dacian's wrath.
Then shouted the plebeian crowd,-
Rung the glad galleries with the sound;
And from the throne there spake aloud
A voice: “Be the bold man unbound!
And, by Rome's sceptre, yet unbowed,
By Rome, earth's monarch crowned,
Who dares the bold, the unequal strife,
Though doomed to death, shall save his life."

Joy was upon that dark man's face;
And thus, with laughing eye, spake he:
“Loose ye the lord of Zaara's waste,
And let my arms be free:
'He has a martial heart,' thou sayest;
But oh! who will not be
A hero, when he fights for life,
For home and country, babes and wife?
“And thus I for the strife prepare;
The Thracian falchion to me bring,
But ask th' imperial leave to spare
The shield,-a useless thing.
Were I a Samnite's rage to dare,
Then o'er me would I fling
The broad orb; but to lion's wrath
The shield were but a sword of lath."
And he has bared his shining blade,
And springs he on the shaggy foe;
Dreadful the strife, but briefly played ;-
The desert-king lies low.
His long and loud death-howl is made;
And there must end the show.
And when the multitude were calm,
The favorite freed man took the palm.
"Kneel down Rome's emperor beside !"
He knelt, that dark man. O'er his brow
Was thrown a wreath in crimson dyed,
And fair words gild it now:
"Thou art the bravest youth that ever tried
To lay a lion low;
And from our presence forth thou go'st
To lead the Dacians of our host".

Then flushed his cheek, but not with pride
And grieved and gloomily spake he:
"My cabin stands where blithely glide
Proud Danube's waters to the sea:
I have a young and blooming bride,
And I have children three.
No Roman wealth or rank can give
Such joy as in their arms to live.
"My wife sits at the cabin door,
With throbbing heart and swollen eyes;
While tears her cheek are coursing o'er,
She speaks of sundered ties;
She bids my tender babes deplore
The death their father dies;
She tells these jewels of my home,
I bleed to please the rout of Rome.
"I cannot let those cherubs stray
Without their sire's protecting care;
And I would chase the griefs away
Which cloud my wedded fair."
The monarch spoke; the guards obey;
And gates unclosed are:
He's gone!-No golden bribes divide
The Dacian from his babes and bride.
THREE DAYS IN THE LIFE OF COLUMBUS

Untried and unlimited, swept his glance.

We venture no further through danger and
doubt."
"Three days, and I give you a world !” he replied;
“Bear up, my brave comrades; three days shall
decide."
He sails, but no token of land is in sight;
He sails, but the day shows no more than the
night;
On, onward he sails, while in vain o'er the lee
The lead is plunged down through a fathomless sea.
The pilot in silence, leans mournfully o'er
The rudder which creaks mid the billowy roar;
He hears the hoarse moan of the spray-driving
blast,
And its funeral wail through the shrouds of the
mast.
The stars of far Europe have sunk from the skies,
And the great Southern Cross meets his terrified
eyes;
But, at length, the slow dawn, softly streaking the
night,
Illumes the blue vault with its faint crimson light.
"Columbus ! 'tis day, and the darkness is o'er."-
"Day! and what dost thou see?”—“Sky and ocean:
no more !”
The second day's past, and Columbus is sleeping,
While mutiny near him its vigil is keeping:
"Shall he perish?"_"Ay! death!" is the barbarous
cry;
"He must triumph to-morrow, or, perjured, must
die!"

Ungrateful and blind !Shall the world-linking
sea,
He traced for the future, his sepulchre be?
Shall that sea, on the morrow, with pitiless waves,
Fling his corse on that shore which his patient eye
craves,-
The corse of an humble adventurer? Then-
One day later,--Columbus, the first among men!
But, hush! he is dreaming !-A veil on the main,
At the distant horizon, is parted in twain,
And now, on his dreaming eye,-rapturous sight!
Fresh bursts the New World from the darkness of
night!
0, vision of glory! how dazzling it seems!
How glistens the verdure! how sparkle the
streams!
How blue the far mountains! how glad the green
isles!
And the earth and the ocean, how dimpled with
smiles !
"Joy! joy!” cries Columbus, “this region is
mine!”—
Ah! not e'en its name, wondrous dreamer, is thine!
But, lo! his dream changes. Columbus looks forth,
And a bright constellation beholds in the North.
'Tis the herald of empire! A people appear,
Impatient of wrong, and unconscious of fear.
They level the forest; they ransack the seas;
Each zone finds their canvas unfurled to the breeze.
"Hold!" Tyranny cries; but their resolute breath
Sends back the reply, "Independence or death !"

The plowshare they turn to a weapon of might,
And, defying all odds, they go forth to the fight.
They have conquered. The people, with grateful
acclaim,
Look to Washington's guidance, from Washing-

Behold Cincinnatus and Cato combined
In his patriot heart and republican mind.

But fades in the light of thy simple renown?
And lo! by the side of the hero, a sage,
In freedom's behalf, sets his mark on the age;
Whom science adoringly hails, while he wrings
The lightning from heaven, the sceptre from kings.
At length, o'er Columbus slow consciousness
breaks,
“Land! land !" cry the sailors; "land! land!”—he

He runs, yes! behold it!-it blesseth his sight,
The land! O, dear spectacle! transport! delight!
O, generous sobs, which he cannot restrain!
What will Ferdinand say? and the future? and
Spain?

His king will repay all the ills he has known:
In exchange for a world what are honors and
gains ?
Or a crown? But how is he rewarded ?— With

THE PALMER-SCOTT.
"Open the door, some pity to show:
Keen blows the northern wind;
The glen is white with the drifted snow,
And the path is hard to find.
No outlaw seeks your castle gate,
From chasing the king's deer,
Though even an outlaw's wretched state
Might claim compassion here.
A weary palmer worn and weak,
I wander for my sin;
O, open, for our Lady's sake!
A pilgrim's blessing win!
The hare is crouching in her form,
The hart beside the hind;
An aged man, amid the storm,
No shelter can I find.
You hear the Ettrick's sullen roar,
Dark, deep, and strong is he,
And I must ford the Ettrick o'er,
Unless you pity me.
The iron gate is bolted hard,
At which I knock in vain;
The owner's heart is closer barred,
Who hears me thus complain.
Farewell, farewell! and heaven grant,
When old and frail you be,
You never may the shelter want,
That's now denied to me!"

The ranger on his couch lay warm,
And heard him plead in vain;
But oft, amid December's storm,
He'll hear that voice again:
For lo! when through the vapors dank
Morn shone on Ettrick fair,
A corpse, amid the alders rank,
The palmer weltered there.
INCIDENT OF THE FRENCH CAMP
- ROBERT BROWNING.
You know we French stormed Ratisbon:
A mile or so away,
On a little mound, Napoleon
Stood on our storming day;
With neck out-thrust-you fancy how,-
Legs wide, arms locked behind,
As if to balance the prone brow,
Oppressive with its mind.
Just as perhaps he mused: “My plans
That soar, to earth may fall,
Let once my army-leader Lannes
Waver at yonder wall,”—
Out 'twixt the battery-smokes there flew
A rider, bound on bound
Full galloping; nor bridle drew
Until he reached the mound.
Then off there flung in smiling joy,
And held himself erect
By just his horse's mane, a boy:
You hardly could suspect,-

(So tight he kept his lips compressed,
Scarce any blood came through),
You looked twice ere you saw—his breast
Was all but shot in two.
“Well,” cried he, “Emperor, by God's grace
We've got you Ratisbon.
The Marshal's in the market-place,
And you'll be there anon,
To see your flag-bird flap his vans,
Where I, to heart's desire,
Perched him!” The chief's eye flashed; his plans
Soared up again like fire.
The chief's eye flashed, but presently
Softened itself, as sheathes
A film the mother-eagle's eye
When her bruised eaglet breathes :
"You're wounded !" "Nay,”—his soldier's pride
Touched to the quick,-he said,
"I'm killed, sire!” And, his chief beside,
Smiling, the boy fell dead.
ON BOARD THE CUMBERLAND

"Stand to your guns, men !” Morris cried.
Small need to pass the word;
Our men at quarters ranged themselves
Before the drum was heard.
And then began the sailors' jests:
"What thing is that, I say?"—
"A long-shore meeting-house adrift
Is standing down the bay!”

A frown came over Morris' face;
The strange, dark craft he knew:
“That is the iron Merrimac,
Manned by a rebel crew.
“So shot your guns and point them straight;
Before this day goes by,
We'll try of what her metal's made."
A cheer was our reply.
“Remember, boys, this flag of ours
Has seldom left its place;
And where it falls, the deck it strikes
Is covered with disgrace.
“I ask but this; or sink or swim,
Or live or nobly die,
My last sight upon earth may be
To see that ensign fly!"
Meanwhile the shapeless iron mass
Came moving o'er the wave,
As gloomy as a passing hearse,
As silent as the grave.
Her ports were closed; from stern to stern
No sign of life appeared.
We wondered, questioned, strained our eyes,
Joked,—every thing but feared.
She reached our range. Our broadside rang;
Our heavy pivots roared;
And shot and shell, a fire of hell,
Against her side we poured.
God's mercy! From her sloping roof
The iron tempest glanced,

As hail bounds from a cottage-thatch,
And round her leaped and danced;
Or when against her dusky hull
We struck a fair, full blow,
The mighty, solid iron globes
Were crumbled up like snow.
On, on, with fast increasing speed,
The silent monster came,
Though all our starboard battery
Was one long line of flame.
She heeded not; no guns she fired;
Straight on our bows she bore;
Through riving plank and crashing frame
Her furious way she tore.
Alas! our beautiful, keen bow,
That in the fiercest blast
So gently folded back the seas,
They hardly felt we passed.
Alas! alas! my Cumberland,
That ne'er knew grief before,
To be so gored, to feel so deep
The tusk of that sea-boar.
Once more she backward drew apace;
Once more our side she rent.
Then, in the wantonness of hate,
Her broadside through us sent.
The dead and dying round us lay,
But our foemen lay abeam;
Her open port-holes maddened us,
We fired with shout and scream.

We felt our vessel settling fast;
We knew our time was brief:
“Ho! man the pumps!" But they who worked,
And fought not, wept with grief.
“Oh! keep us but an hour afloat!
Oh! give us only time
To mete unto yon rebel crew
The measure of their crime !"
From captain down to powder-boy,
No hand was idle then:
Two soldiers, but by chance aboard,
Fought on like sailor men.
And when a gun's crew lost a hand,
Some bold marine stepped out,
And jerked his braided jacket off,
And hauled the gun about.
Our forward magazine was drowned,
And up from the sick-bay
Crawled out the wounded, red with blood,
And round us gasping lay ;-
Yes, cheering, calling us by name,
Struggling with failing breath
To keep their shipmates at the post
Where glory strove with death.
With decks afloat and powder gone,
The last broadside we gave
From the guns' heated iron lips,
Burst out beneath the wave.
So sponges, rammers, and handspikes,
As men-of-war's men should,

We placed within their proper racks,
And at our quarters stood.
"Up to the spar deck! save yourselves !"
Cried Selfridge. "Up, my men!
God grant that some of us may live
To fight yon ship again!"
We turned: we did not like to go;
Yet staying seemed but vain,
Knee-deep in water; so we left,
Some swore, some groaned with pain.
We reached the deck. There Randall stood:
“Another turn, men,-so!"
Calmly he aimed his pivot gun :
“Now, Tenny, let her go!”
It did our sore hearts good to hear
The song our pivot sang,
As rushing on from wave to wave
The whirring bomb-shell sprang.
Brave Randall leaped upon the gun,
And waved his cap in sport;
“Well done! well aimed! I saw that shell
Go through an open port!"
It was our last, our deadliest shot;
The deck was overflown;
The poor ship staggered, lurched to port,
And gave a living groan.
Down, down, as headlong through the waves,
Our gallant vessel rushed,
A thousand gurgling watery sounds
A round my senses gushed.

Then I remember little more;
One look to heaven I gave,
Where, like an angel's wing, I saw
Our spotless ensign wave.
I tried to cheer. I cannot say
Whether I swam or sank;
A blue mist closed around my eyes,
And everything was blank.
When I awoke, a soldier lad,
All dripping from the sea,
With two great tears upon his cheeks,
Was bending over me.
I tried to speak. He understood
The wish I could not speak.
He turned me. There, thank God! the flag
Still fluttered at the peak!
And there, while thread shall hang to thread,
Oh, let that ensign fly!
The noblest constellation set
Against the northern sky,
A sign that we who live may claim
The peerage of the brave;
A monument that needs no scroll,
For those beneath the wave.

From Vega and Sierra, from Betis and Xenil,
They have come with helm and cuirass of gold and
twisted steel.
'Tis the holy Baptist's feast they hold in royalty
and state,
And they have closed the spacious lists, beside the
Alhambra's gate;
In gowns of black with silver laced, within the
tented ring,
Eight Moors to fight the bull are placed in presence
of the king.
Eight Moorish lords, of valor tried, with stalwart
arm and true,
The onset of the beasts abide, as they come rushing
through.
The deeds they've done, the spoils they've won, fill
all with hope and trust;
Yet, ere high in heaven appears the sun, they all
have bit the dust.
Then sounds the trumpet clearly, then clangs the
loud tambour:
Make room, make room for Gazul! Throw wide,
throw wide the door!
Blow, blow the trumpet clearer still! More loudly
strike the drum!
The alcayde of Algava to fight the bull doth come.
And first before the king he passed, with reverence
stooping low;
And next he bowed him to the queen, and the In-
fantas all a-row;

Then to his lady's grace he turned, and she to him
did throw
A scarf from out her balcony, 'twas whiter than
the snow.
With the life-blood of the slaughtered lords all slip-
pery in the sand,
Yet proudly in the centre hath Gazul ta'en his stand;
And ladies look with heaving breast, and lords with
anxious eye;
But firmly he extends his arm; his look is calm and
high.
Three bulls against the knight are loosed, and two
come roaring on;
He rises high in stirrup, forth stretching his rejon;
Each furious beast upon the breast he deals him
such a blow,
He blindly totters and gives back, across the sand to
go.
"Turn, Gazul, turn!" the people cry:—the third
comes up behind;
Low to the sand his head holds he, his nostrils snuff
the wind;
The mountaineers, that lead the steers, without
stand whispering low:
“Now thinks this proud alcayde to stun Harpado
so?”
From Guadiana comes he not, he comes not from
Xenil,
From Guadalarif of the plain, or Barves of the hill;
But where from out the forest burst Xarama's
waters clear,

Beneath the oak trees was he nursed,—this proud
and stately steer.
Dark is his hide on either side, but the blood within
doth boil,
And the dun hide glows, as if on fire, as he paws to
the turmoil:
His eyes are jet, and they are set in crystal rings of
snow;
But now they stare with one red glare of brass upon
the foe.
Upon the forehead of the bull the horns stand close
and near;
From out the broad and wrinkled skull like daggers,
they appear;
His neck is massy, like the trunk of some old, knot-
ted tree,
Whereon the monster's shagged mane, like billows
curled ye see.
His legs are short, his hams are thick, his hoofs are
black as night;
Like a strong flail he holds his tail in fierceness of
his might;
Like something molten out of iron, or hewn from
forth the rock,
Harpado of Xarama stands, to bide the alcayde's
shock.

The white foam of the charger on Harpado's front
of dun;
Once more advance upon his lance, once more, thou
fearless one!
Once more, once more! In dust and gore to ruin
must thou reel!
In vain, in vain thou tearest the sandi with furious
heel!
In vain, in vain, thou noble beast!-I see, I see thee
stagger!
Now keen and cold thy neck must hold the stern
alcayde's dagger!
They have slipped a noose around his feet, six horses
are brought in,
And away they drag Harpado with a loud and joy-
ful din.
Now stoop thee, lady, from thy stand, and the ring
of price bestow
Upon Gazul of Algava, that hath laid Harpado low.
A HEBREW TALE
-MRS. SIGOURNEY.
Twilight was deepening with a tinge of eve,
As toward his home in Israel's sheltered vales
A stately Rabbi drew. His camels spied
Afar the palm-trees' lofty heads, that decked
The dear, domestic fountain, and in speed
Pressed with broad foot the smooth and dewy
glade.
The holy man his peaceful threshold passed
With hasting step. The evening meal was spread,

And she who from life's morn his heart had shared
Breathed her fond welcome. Bowing o'er the board,
The blessing of his father's God he sought,
Ruler of earth and sea. Then, raising high
The sparkling wine-cup, “Call my sons,” he bade,
"And let me bless them ere their hour of rest."
The observant mother spake with gentle voice
Somewhat of soft excuse,—that they were wont
To linger long amid the Prophet's school,
Learning the holy law their father loved.
His sweet repast with sweet discourse was blent,
Of journeying and return.—“Would thou hadst
seen
With me the golden morning break to light
Yon mountain summits, whose blue, waving line
Scarce meets thine eye, where chirp of joyous
birds,
And breath of fragrant shrubs, and spicy gales,
And sigh of waving boughs, stirred in the soul
Warm orisons. Yet most I wished thee near
Amid the temple's pomp, when the high priest,
Clad in his robe pontifical, invoked
The God of Abraham, while from lute and harp,
Cymbal and trump and psaltery and glad breath
Of tuneful Levite, and the mighty shout
Of all our people, like the swelling sea,
Loud hallelujahs burst. When next I seek
Blest Zion's glorious hill, our beauteous boys
Must bear me company. Their early prayers
Will rise as incense. Thy reluctant love
No longer must withhold them: the new toil
Will give them sweeter sleep, and touch their cheek

With brighter crimson. 'Mid their raven curls
My hand I'll lay, and dedicate them there,
Even in those hallowed courts, to Israel's God:
Two spotless lambs, well pleasing in his sight.
But yet, methinks, thou’rt paler grown, my love;
And the pure sapphire of thine eye looks dim,
As though 'twere washed with tears."
Faintly she smiled:
"One doubt, my lord, I fain would have thee solve:
Gems of rich lustre and of countless cost
Were to my keeping trusted. Now, alas!
They are demanded. Must they be restored?
Or may I not a little longer gaze
Upon their dazzling hues?" His eye grew stern
And on his lip there lurked a sudden curl
Of indignation : "Doth my wife propose
Such doubt, as if a master might not claim
His own again?" "Nay, Rabbi, come behold
These priceless jewels ere I yield them back.”
So to their spousal chamber with soft hand
Her lord she led. There, on a snow-white couch
Lay his two sons, pale, pale and motionless,
Like fair twin-lilies, which some grazing kid
In wantonness had cropped. “My sons! my sons !
Light of my eyes !" the astonished father cried;
"My teachers in the law, whose guileless hearts
And prompt obedience warned me oft to be
More perfect with my God!"
To earth he fell,
Like Lebanon's rent cedar: while his breast
Heaved with such groans as when the laboring soul
Breaks from its clay companion's close embrace.

The mourning mother turned away and wept
Till the first storm of passionate grief was still;
Then, pressing to his ear her faded lip,
She sighed in tone of tremulous tenderness:
"Thou didst instruct me, Rabbi, how to yield
The summoned jewels: see, the Lord did give,
The Lord hath taken away.”
“Yea," said the sire,
“And blessed be his name. Even for thy sake,
Thrice blessed be Jehovah.” Long he pressed
On those cold, beautiful brows his quivering lip,
While from his eye the burning anguish rolled.
Then, kneeling low, those chastened spirits poured
Their mighty homage.
BELSHAZZAR'S FEAST-HUGHES.
Joy holds her court in great Belshazzar's hall,
Where his proud lords attend their monarch's call.
The rarest dainties of the teeming East
Provoke the revel and adorn the feast.
And now the monarch rises.-"Pour," he cries,
“To the great gods, the Assyrian deities !
Pour forth libations of the rosy wine
To Nebo, Bel, and all the powers divine!
Those golden vessels crown, which erewhile stood
Fast by the oracle of Judah's God,
Till that accursed race—"
But why, O king!
Why dost thou start, with livid cheek?-Why fling
The untasted goblet from thy trembling hand?
Why shake thy joints, thy feet forget to stand?

Why roams thine eye, which seems in wild amaze
To shun some object, yet returns to gaze,-
Then shrinks again appalled, as if the tomb
Had sent a spirit from its inmost gloom?
Awful the horror, when Belshazzar raised
His arm, and pointed where the vision blazed.
For see! enrobed in flame, a mystic shade,
As of a hand, a red right-hand, displayed !
And, slowly moving o'er the wall, appear
Letters of fate, and characters of fear.
In deathlike silence grouped, the revellers all
Fix their glazed eyeballs on the illumined wall.
See! now the vision brightens,—now 'tis gone,
Like meteor flash, like heaven's own lightning
flown.
But, though the hand hath vanished, what it writ
Is uneffaced. Who will interpret it?
In vain the sages try their utmost skill:
The mystic letters are unconstrued still.
“Quick, bring the prophet! Let his tongue proclaim
The mystery of that visionary flame !"
The holy prophet came, and stood upright,
With brow serene, before Belshazzar's sight.
The monarch pointed trembling to the wall:
"Behold the portents that our heart appall!
Interpret them, O prophet! Thou shalt know
What gifts Assyria's monarch can bestow."
Unutterably awful was the eye
Which met the monarch's: and the stern reply
Fell heavy on his soul: "Thy gifts withhold,
Nor tempt the Spirit of the Law with gold.

Thy kingdom numbered, and thy glory flown,
The Mede and Persian revel on thy throne.
Weighed in the balance, thou hast kicked the beam.
See to yon Western sun the lances gleam,
Which, ere his Orient rays adorn the sky,
Thy blood shall sully with a crimson dye.'
In the dire carnage of that night's dread hour,
Crushed mid the ruins of his crumbling power,
Belshazzar fell beneath an unknown blow,-
His kingdom wasted, and its pride laid low.
BERNARDO DEL CARPIO
-MRS. HEMANS.
Bernardo del Carpio's father, the Count of Saldana, had been a
prisoner of King Alphonso of Asturias when Bernardo was still a child.
The son had made many ineffectual efforts for the release of his father,
and, finally, had taken up arms against the king. So destructive did the
war turn out to be that the sovereign was forced by his people to yield.
Accordingly he offered Bernardo his father's freedom on condition that
Bernardo give up the castle and stronghold of Carpio with all the
prisoners detained there. The terms were gladly acceded to. When told
by the king that the long imprisoned father was on his way from the
dungeon, Bernardo rode forth with the king to meet him. According to
the ancient chronicle from which the ballad is taken, the inhuman king
was conscious of the terrible anguish he was about to inflict on the ex-
pectant son, when with almost fiendish mockery he assured him: “Look
where thy father is ; now go, and greet him, whom thou hast so long
desired to see."
The warrior bowed his crested head, and tamed his
heart of fire,
And sued the haughty king to free his long-im-
prisoned sire;
"I bring thee here my fortress-keys, I bring my
captive train,
I pledge thee faith, my liege, my lord !—0! break
my father's chain !"

"Rise, rise! Even now thy father comes, a ransomed
man, this day.
Mount thy good horse; and thou and I will meet
him on his way."
Then lightly rose that loyal son, and bounded on
his steed,
And urged, as if with lance in rest, the charger's
foamy speed.
And lo! from far, as on they pressed, there came a
glittering band,
With one that 'midst them stately rode, as a leader
in the land.
"Now haste, Bernardo, haste! For there, in very
truth, is he,
The father whom thy faithful heart hath yearned
so long to see."
His dark eye flashed, his proud breast heaved, his
cheek's hue came and went;
He reached that gray-haired chieftain's side, and
there, dismounting, bent;
A lowly knee to earth he bent, his father's hand he
took,-
What was there in its touch that all his fiery spirit
shook?
That hand was cold,-a frozen thing, it dropped
from his like lead!
He looked up to the face above,—the face was of
the dead!
A plume waved o'er the noble brow,—the brow was
fixed and white!
He met, at last, his father's eyes,—but in them was
no sight!

Up from the ground he sprang and gazed ;—but
who could paint that gaze?
They hushed their very hearts, that saw its horror
and amaze.
They might have chained him, as before that stony
form he stood;
For the power was stricken from his arm, and from
his lip the blood.
"Father!" at length he murmured low, and wept
like childhood then:-
Talk not of grief till thou hast seen the tears of
warlike men!
He thought on all his glorious hopes, and all his
young renown;
He flung his falchion from his side, and in the dust
sat down.
Then covering with his steel-gloved hands his
darkly mournful brow,
“No more, there is no more," he said, "to lift the
sword for now;
My king is false,—my hope betrayed! My father-
O! the worth,
The glory, and the loveliness, are passed away from
earth!
"I thought to stand where banners waved, my sire,
beside thee yet!
I would that there our kindred blood on Spain's
free soil had met!
Thou wouldst have known my spirit then: for thee
my fields were won;
And thou hast perished in thy chains, as though
thou hadst no son.”

Then, starting from the ground once more, he
seized the monarch's rein,
Amidst the pale and wildered looks of all the
courtier train;
And, with a fierce, o'ermastering grasp, the rearing
war-horse led,
And sternly set them face to face, the king before
the dead :-
"Came I not forth, upon thy pledge, my father's
hand to kiss ?-
Be still, and gaze thou on, false king! and tell me
what is this?
The voice, the glance, the heart, I sought,-give
answer, where are they?
If thou wouldst clear thy perjured soul, send life
through this cold clay!
"Into these glassy eyes put light;—be still! keep
down thine ire !
Bid these white lips a blessing speak,—this earth
is not my sire.
Give me back him for whom I strove, for whom my
blood was shed !-
Thou canst not?—and a king !-His dust be moun-
tains on thy head!"
He loosed the steed; his slack hand fell; upon the
silent face;
He cast one long, deep, troubled look, then turned
from that sad place.
His hope was crushed, his after fate untold in mar-
tial strain;
His banner led the spears no more amidst the hills
of Spain.

BERNARDO AND ALPHONSO
-LOCKHART.
The incident narrated in this poem is a sequel to the one told in the
preceding ballad.
With some good ten of his chosen men, Bernardo
hath appeared
Before them all in the palace hall, the lying king
to beard;
With cap in hand and eye on ground, he came in
reverent guise,
But ever and anon he frowned and flame broke
from his eyes.
"A curse upon thee!" cries the king, "who com'st
unbid to me;
But what from traitors blood should spring, save
traitors like to thee?
His sire, lords, had a traitor's heart; perchance
our champion brave
May think it were a pious part to share Don
Sancho's grave.”—
"Whoever told this tale the king hath rashness to
repeat,"
Cries Bernard, “Here my gage I fling before the
liar's feet!
No treason was in Sancho's blood, no stain in mine
doth lie:
Below the throne what knight will own the coward
calumny?
The blood that I like water shed, when Roland did
advance,
By secret traitors hired and led, to make us slaves
of France:

The life of King Alphonso I saved at Ronceval,—
Your words, Lord King, are recompense abundant
for it all.
Your horse was down; your hope was flown; I saw
the falchion shine,
That soon had drunk your royal blood, had I not
ventured mine;
But memory soon of service done deserteth the
ingrate,
And ye’ve thanked the son, for life and crown, by
the father's bloody fate.
Ye swore upon your kingly faith, to set Don Sancho
free,
But, curse upon your paltering breath, the light he
ne'er did see;
He died in dungeon cold and dim, by Alphonso's
base decree,
And visage blind, and stiffened limb, were all they
gave to me.
The King that swerveth from his word hath
stained his purple black,
No Spanish lord will draw the sword behind a liar's
back;
But noble vengeance shall be mine, an open hate
I'll show:
The King hath injured Carpio's line, and Bernard
is his foe.”
“Seize! seize him!” loud the king doth scream;
“There are a thousand here;
Let his foul blood this instant stream!-What!
caitiffs, do ye fear?

Seize! seize the traitor!"_But not one to move a
finger dareth,
Bernardo standeth by the throne, and calm his
sword he bareth.
He drew the falchion from the sheath, and held it
up on high;
And all the hall was still as death. Cries Bernard:
"Here am I,
And here is the sword that owns no lord, excepting
heaven and me;
Fain would I know who dares his point,-King,
Conde, or Grandee!”
Then to his mouth the horn he drew-it hung be-
low his cloak-
His ten true men the signal knew, and through the
ring they broke;
With helm on head, and blade in hand, the knights
the circle brake,
And back the lordlings 'gan to stand, and the false
king to quake.
“Ha! Bernard,” quoth Alphonso, “what means this
warlike guise ?
You know full well I jested; you know your worth
I prize.”—
But Bernard turned upon his heel, and smiling
passed away;
Long rued Alphonso and his realm the jesting of
that day.

THE MOOR'S REVENGE
FROM THE POLISH.
Before Granada's fated walls, encamped in proud
array,
And flushed with many a victory, the Spanish army
lay.
Of all Granada's fortresses but one defies their
might:
On Alphuara's minarets the crescent still is bright.
Almanzor! King Almanzor! All vainly you resist:
Your little band is fading fast away like morning
mist,
A direr foe, than ever yet they met on battle-plain,
Assaults life's inmost citadel, and heaps the ground
with slain.
One onset more of Spanish ranks,—and soon it will
be made,-
And Alphuara's towers must reel, and in the dust
be laid.
"And shall the haughty infidel pollute this sacred
land ?"
Almanzor said, as mournfully he marked his
dwindling band.
“Upon our glorious crescent shall the Spanish set
his heel?
And is there not one lingering hope? Can heaven
no aid reveal ?
Ay, by our holy Prophet, now one ally still re-
mains;
And I will bind him close to me, for better death,
than chains.”
The victors at the banquet sat, and music lent its
cheer,

When suddenly a sentry's voice announced a
stranger near;
From Alphuara had he come, with fierce, unwonted
speed,
And much it would import to Spain the news he
bore to heed.
“Admit him!” cry the revellers;—and in the pilgrim
strode,
And, throwing off his mantle loose, a Moorish habit
showed.
"Almanzor! King Almanzor!" they cried, with one
acclaim.
“Almanzor!” said the Moslem chief,—“Almanzor is

“To serve your prophet and your king, O Spaniards,

Believe, reject me, if you will; this breast has out-

No longer in his creed or cause Almanzor can con-

For all the Powers above, 'tis clear, are fighting on
your side.”

ish chieftain said:
“Granada's last intrenchment now we speedily shall

shall renew;
And in this cup of foaming wine we'll drink to
yours and you."
Right eagerly, to grasp the hands outstretched on

Almanzor rushed, and greeted each as bridegroom
might his bride;
He glued his fevered lips to theirs; he kissed them
on the cheek;
And breathed on all as if his heart would all its
passion wreak.
But suddenly his limbs relax, a flush comes o'er his
face,
He reels, as, with a pressure faint, he gives a last
embrace;
And livid, purple grows his skin, and wild his eye-
balls roll,
And some great torture seems to heave the life-
roots of his soul.
“Look, giaours! Miscreants in race, and infidels in
creed !
Look on this pale, distorted face, and iell me what

These limbs convulsed, these fiery pangs, these eye-
balls hot and blear,-
Ha! know ye not what they portend? The plague,

And it has sealed you for its own; ay, every Judas
kiss
I gave shall bring anon to you an agony like this!
All art is vain; your poisoned blood all leechcraft
will defy,
Like me ye shall in anguish writhe, like me in tor-
ture die!”

Still deeper rolled the darkness from on high,
Gigantic volume upon volume wound:
Above, a pillar shooting to the sky;
Below, a mighty sea, that spread incessantly.
Voices are heard, a choir of golden strings,
Low winds, whose breath is loaded with the rose;
Then chariot-wheels, the nearer rush of wings;
Pale lightning round the dark pavilion glows:
It thunders, the resplendent gates unclose.
Far as the eye can glance, on height o'er height
Rise fiery waving wings, and star-crowned brows,
Millions on millions, brighter and more bright,
Till all is lost in one supreme, unmingled light.
But two beside the sleeping pilgrim stand,
Like cherub-kings, with lifted, mighty plume,
Fixed, sun-bright eyes, and looks of high com-

Father of countless myriads that shall come,
Sweeping the land like billows of the sea,
Bright as the stars of heaven from twilight's

Till He is given, whom angels long to see,
And Israel's splendid line is crowned with Deity.

With a soft cheek upon the lulling tide,
Forgot the lifting winds: and the long stems,
Whose flowers the water like a gentle nurse
Bears on its bosom, quietly gave way,
And leaned, in graceful attitude, to rest.
How strikingly the course of nature tells
By its light heed of human suffering,
That it was fashioned for a happier world.
King David's limbs were weary. He had fled
From far Jerusalem; and now he stood
With his faint people, for a little space,
Upon the shore of Jordan. The light wind
Of morn was stirring, and he bared his brow,
To its refreshing breath; for he had worn
The mourner's covering, and had not felt
That he could see his people until now.
They gathered round him on the fresh green bank,
And spoke their kindly words. And as the sun
Rose up in heaven, he knelt among them there,
And bowed his head upon his hands to pray.
Oh! when the heart is full,—when bitter thoughts
Come crowding thickly up for utterance,
And the poor common words of courtesy
Are such a very mockery,-how much
The bursting heart may pour itself in prayer!
He prayed for Israel; and his voice went up
Strongly and fervently. He prayed for those,
Whose love had been his shield; and his deep tones
Grew tremulous. But, oh! for Absalom,-
For his estranged, misguided Absalom,--
The proud bright being who had burst away
In all his princely beauty, to defy
The heart that cherished him,-for him he poured

In agony, that would not be controlled,
Strong supplication, and forgave him there,
Before his God, for his deep sinfulness.
The pall was settled. He who slept beneath,
Was straightened for the grave; and as the folds
Sank to the still proportions, they betrayed
The matchless symmetry of Absalom.
His hair was yet unshorn, and silken curls
Were floating round the tassels as they swayed
To the admitted air. His banner soiled
With trailing through Jerusalem, was laid,
Reversed, beside him: and the jeweled hilt
Whose diamonds lit the passage of his blade,
Rested like mockery on his covered brow.
The soldiers of the king trod to and fro,
Clad in the garb of battle; and their chief,
The mighty Joab, stood beside the bier,
And gazed upon the dark pall steadfastly,
As if he feared the slumberer might stir.
A slow step startled him. He grasped his blade,
As if a trumpet rang; but the bent form
Of David entered, and he gave command
In a low tone to his few followers,
And left him with his dead. The king stood still
Till the last echo died; then, throwing off
The sackcloth from his brow, and laying back
The pall from the still features of his child,
He bowed his head upon him, and broke forth
In the resistless eloquence of woe:
"Alas! my noble boy! that thou should'st die,
Thou who wert made so beautifully fair!

How could he mark thee for the silent tomb,
My proud boy, Absalom?
"Cold is thy brow, my son, and I am chill
As to my bosom I have tried to press thee.
How was I wont to feel my pulses thrill,
Like a rich harp string, yearning to caress thee,
And hear thy sweet 'My father' from these dumb
And cold lips, Absalom!
“The grave hath won thee. I shall hear the gush
Of music, and the voices of the young;
And life will pass me in the mantling blush,
And the dark tresses to the soft winds flung,
But thou no more with thy sweet voice shalt come
To meet me, Absolom!
"And, oh! when I am stricken, and my heart
Like a bruised reed, is waiting to be broken,
How will its love for thee, as I depart,
Yearn for thine ear to drink its last deep token!
It were so sweet, amid death's gathering gloom,
To see thee, Absalom!
“And now, farewell! 'Tis hard to give thee up,
With death so like a gentle slumber on thee;
And thy dark sin-oh! I could drink the cup
If from this woe its bitterness had won thee.
May God have called thee, like a wanderer, home,
My lost boy, Absalom!"
He covered up his face, and bowed himself
A moment on his child; then giving him
A look of melting tenderness, he clasped
His hands convulsively, as if in prayer.

I had a vision: evening sat in gold
Upon the bosom of a boundless plain,
Covered with beauty:-garden, field, and fold,
Studding the billowy sweep of ripening grain,
Like islands in the purple summer main.
And temples of pure marble met the sun,
That tinged their white shafts with a golden stain;
And sounds of rustic joy, and labor done,
Hallowed the lovely hour, until her pomp was gone.
The plain was hushed in twilight, as a child
Slumbers beneath its slow-drawn canopy;
But sudden tramplings came, and voices wild,
And tossings of rude weapons caught the eye;
And on the hills, like meteors in the sky,
Burst sanguine fires; and ever and anon
To the clashed spears the horn gave fierce reply;
And round their beacons trooping thousands shone,
Then sank like evil things, and all was dark and
lone.
'Twas midnight: there was wrath in that wild
heaven;
Earth was sepulchral dark. At once a roar
Pealed round the mountain-tops, like ocean driven
Before the thunders on th' eternal shore:
Down rushed, as if a sudden earthquake tore

The bowels of the hills, a flood of fire:
Like lava, mingled spears and torches pour,
The plain is deluged; higher still and higher
Swell blood and flame, till all is like one mighty
pyre.
'Twas dawn: and still the black and bloody smoke
Rolled o'er the champaign like a vault of stone;
But as the sun's slow wheels the barrier broke,
He lit the image of a fearful one,
Throned in the central massacre, alone-
An iron diadem upon his brow,
A naked lance beside him, that yet shone
Purple and warm with gore; and crouching low
All men in one huge chain, alike the friend and foe.
The land around him, in that sickly light,
Showed like th' upturning of a mighty grave;
Strewn with crushed monuments and remnants
white
Of man; all loneliness,—but when some slave,
With faint, fond hand, the hurried burial gave,
Then died. The despot sat upon his throne,
Scoffing to see the stubborn traitors wave
At his least breath. The good and brave were gone
To exile or the tomb. Their country's life was done.
COEUR DE LEON AT THE BIER OF
HIS FATHER-

Torches were blazing clear,
Hymns pealing deep and slow,
Where a king lay stately on his bier
In the church of Fontevrault.

Banners of battle o'er him hung,
And warriors slept beneath,
And light as noon's broad light was flung
On the settled face of death,
On the settled face of death
A strong and ruddy glare;
Though dimmed at times by the censer's breath,
Yet it fell still brightest there;
As if each deeply furrowed trace
Of earthly years to show.
Alas! that sceptred mortal's race
Had surely closed in woe!
The marble floor was swept
By many a long dark stole,
As the kneeling priests, round him that slept,
Sang mass for the parted soul;
And solemn were the strains they poured
Through the stillness of the night,
With the cross above, and the crown and sword,
And the silent king in sight.
There was heard a heavy clang,
As of steel-girt men the tread,
And the tombs and the hollow pavement rang
With a sounding thrill of dread;
And the holy chant was hushed awhile,
As by the torch's flame
A gleam of arms up the sweeping aisle
With a mail-clad leader came.
He came with haughty look,
An eagle glance and clear;
But his proud heart through its breast-plate shook
When he stood beside the bier.

He stood there still with a drooping brow,
And clasped hands o'er it raised;
For his father lay before him low,
It was Cour de Leon gazed.
And silently he strove
With the workings of his breast;
But there's more in late repentant love
Than steel may keep suppressed.
And his tears brake forth, at last, like rain,
Men held their breath in awe,
For his face was seen by his warrior-train,
And he recked not that they saw.
He looked upon the dead,
And sorrow seemed to lie,-
A weight of sorrow, even like lead,
Pale on the fast-shut eye.
He stooped and kissed the frozen cheek,
And the heavy hand of clay,
Till bursting words, yet all too weak,
Gave his soul's passion way.
"O father! is it vain,
This late remorse and deep?
Speak to me, father, once again!
I weep,-behold, I weep!
Alas! my guilty pride and ire!
Were but this work undone,
I would give England's crown, my sire,
To hear thee bless thy son.

Ere now the dust hath stirred!

THE SEVENTH PLAGUE OF EGYPT
-CROLY.
'Twas morn: the rising splendor rolled
On marble towers and roofs of gold;
Hall, court, and gallery, below,
Were crowded with a living flow;
Egyptian, Arab, Nubian, there,
The bearers of the bow and spear,
The hoary priest, the Chaldee sage,
The slave, the gemmed and glittering page;
Helm, turban, and tiara, shone
A dazzling ring round Pharaoh's throne.
There came a man: the human tide
Shrank backward from his stately stride;
His cheek with storm and time was tanned;
A shepherd's staff was in his hand;
A shudder of instinctive fear
Told the dark king what step was near;
On through the host the stranger came,
It parted round his form like flame.
He stooped not at the footstool stone,
He clasped not sandal, kissed not throne;
Erect he stood amid the ring,
His only words,—"Be just, o king!"
On Pharaoh's cheek the blood flushed high,
A fire was in his sullen eye;
Yet on the chief of Israel
No arrow of his thousands fell;
All mute and moveless as the grave
Stood chilled the satrap and the slave.
“Thou'rt come," at length the monarch spoke,
Haughty and high the words outbroke:

"Is Israel weary of its lair,
The forehead peeled, the shoulder bare?
Take back the answer to your band:
Go, reap the wind; go, plough the sand!
Go, vilest of the living vile,
To build the never-ending pile,
Till, darkest of the nameless dead,
The vulture on their flesh is fed!
What better asks the howling slave
Than the base life our bounty gave?"
Shouted in pride the turbaned peers,
Upclashed to heaven the golden spears.
"King! thou and thine are doomed !Behold!"
The prophet spoke ;—the thunder rolled.
Along the pathway of the sun
Sailed vapory mountains, wild and dun.
“Yet there is time,” the prophet said.
He raised his staff,—the storm was stayed.
"King! be the word of freedom given.
What art thou, man, to war with heaven?”
There came no word; the thunder broke.
Like a huge city's final smoke,
Thick, lurid, stifling, mixed with flame,
Through court and hall the vapors came.
Loose as the stubble in the field,
Wide flew the men of spear and shield;
Scattered like foam along the wave,
Flew the proud pageant, prince, and slave;
Or, in the chains of terror bound,
Lay, corpse-like on the smouldering ground.
“Speak, king !-the wrath is but begun!
Still dumb?--Then, Heaven, thy will be done!"

Echoed from earth a hollow roar
Like ocean on the midnight shore.
A sheet of lightning o'er them wheeled,
The solid ground beneath them reeled;
In dust sank roof and battlement;
Like webs the giant walls were rent;
Red, broad, before his startled gaze
The monarch saw his Egypt blaze.
Still swelled the plague,—the flame grew pale;
Burst from the clouds the charge of hail;
With arrowy keenness, iron weight,
Down poured the ministers of fate;
Till man and cattle, crushed, congealed,
Covered with death the boundless field.
Still swelled the plague,—uprose the blast,
The avenger, fit to be the last.
On ocean, river, forest, vale,
Thundered at once the mighty gale.
Before the whirlwind flew the tree,
Beneath the whirlwind roared the sea;
A thousand ships were on the wave,-
Where are they? Ask that foaming grave!
Down go the hope, the pride of years,
Down go the myriad mariners;
The riches of earth's richest zone,-
Gone! like flash of lightning, gone!
And, lo! that first fierce triumph o'er,
Swells ocean on the shrinking shore;
Still onward, onward, dark and wide,
Engulfs the land the furious tide.
Then bowed thy spirit, stubborn king,
Thou serpent, reft of fang and sting!

THE OLD SURGEON'S STORY*
E. C. DONNELLY.
'Twas in a Southern hospital, a month ago or more.
(God save us! how the days drag on these weary
Times of war!)
They brought me, in the sultry noon, a youth whom
they had found
Deserted by his regiment upon the battle-ground,
And bleeding his young life away through many a
gaping wound.
Dark-haired and slender as a girl, a handsome lad
was he,
Despite the pallor of his wounds, each one an agony.
A ball had carried off his arm, and zigzag passage
frayed
Into his chest so wild a rent, that, when it was dis-
played,
I, veteran surgeon that I was, turned white as any
maid.
“There is no hope ?” he slowly said, noting my
changing cheek;

You should have struck me to the ground;
You should have played a chieftain's part;

"You should have crushed me unto death.
But here I swear with living breath,
That for this wrong which you have done,
I'll wreak my vengeance on your son,-
"On him, and you, and all your race.—”
He said, and bounding from his place,
He seized the child with sudden hold,
A smiling infant, three years old;
And starting like a hunted stag,
He scaled the rock, he clomb the crag,
And reached, o'er many a wide abyss,
The beetling seaward precipice;
And leaning o'er its topmost ledge,
He held the infant o'er the edge:-
"In vain thy wrath, thy sorrow vain;
No hand shall save it, proud Maclaine!"
With flashing eye and burning brow,
The mother followed, heedless how,
O'er crags with mosses overgrown,
And stair-like juts of slippery stone.
But midway up the rugged steep,
She found a chasm she could not leap;
And kneeling on its brink, she raised
Her supplicating hands, and gazed.

“Come, Evan,” said the trembling chief,
His bosom wrung with pride and grief,
“Restore the boy, give back my son,
And I'll forgive the wrong you've done.”
"I scorn forgiveness, haughty man!
You've injured me before the clan;
And nought but blood shall wipe away
The shame I have endured to-day.”
And as he spoke, he raised the child,
To dash it 'mid the breakers wild,
But, at the mother's piercing cry,
Drew back a step, and made reply:
"Fair lady, if your lord will strip,
And let a clansman wield the whip,
Till skin shall fray, and blood shall run,
I'll give you back your little son."
The lady's cheek grew pale with ire,
The chieftain's eyes flashed sudden fire;
He drew a pistol from his breast,
Took aim,—then dropped it, sore distressed.
"I might have slain my babe instead. -
Come, Evan, come," the father said,
And through his heart a tremor ran;
"We'll fight our quarrel man to man."-

“You've heard my answer, proud Maclaine:

The lady stood in mute despair,
With freezing blood and stiffening hair;
She moved no limb, she spoke no word;
She could but look upon her lord.
He saw the quivering of her eye,
Pale lips and speechless agony;
And, doing battle with his pride,
“Give back the boy ,-1 yield,” he cried.
A storm of passions shook his mind:
Anger and shame and love combined;
But love prevailed, and bending low,
He bared his shoulders to the blow.
"I smite you," said the clansman true;
"Forgive me, chief, the deed I do!
For by yon heaven that hears me speak,
My dirk in Evan's heart shall reek!”
But Evan's face beamed hate and joy;
Close to his breast he hugged the boy:
"Revenge is just, revenge is sweet,
And mine, Lochbuy, shall be complete.”
Ere hand could stir, with sudden shock,
He threw the infant o'er the rock,
Then followed with a desperate leap,
Down fifty fathoms to the deep.

Scarce were the splintered lances dropped,
Scarce were the swords drawn out,
Ere recreant Lara, sick with fear,
Had wheeled his steed about.
His courser reared, and plunged, and neighed,
Loathing the fight to yield;
But the coward spurred him to the bone,
And drove him from the field.
Gonzalez in his stirrups rose:
"Turn, turn, thou traitor knight!
Thou bold tongue in a lady's bower,
Thou dastard in a fight!”
But vainly valiant Gomez cried
Across the waning fray:
Pale Lara and his craven band
To Burgos scoured away.

Should ride where Lara led!
"Yet ye who fear to follow me,
As yon traitor turn and fly;
For I lead ye not to win a field:
I lead ye forth to die.
"Olea, plant my standard here,
Here on this little mound;
Here raise the war-cry of thy house,
Make this our rallying ground.
“Forget not, as thou hope'st for grace,
The last care I shall have,
Will be to hear thy battle-cry,
And see that standard wave.”
Down on the ranks of Aragon
The bold Gonzalez drove,
And Olea raised his battle-cry,
And waved the flag above.
Slowly Gonzalez' little band
Gave ground before the foe;
But not an inch of the field was won
Without a deadly blow;
And not an inch of the field was won
That did not draw a tear
From the widowed wives of Aragon,
That fatal news to hear.
Backward and backward Gomez fought,
And high o'er the clashing steel,
Plainer and plainer rose the cry,
“Olea for Castile!”

Till his dauntless standard shadowed him;

Yet he moved not where he stood,
Though each gaping joint of armor ran
A stream of purple blood.
As, pierced with countless wounds, he fell,
The standard caught his eye,
And he smiled, like an infant hushed asleep,
To hear the battle-cry.
Now one by one the wearied knights
Have fallen, or basely flown;
And on the mound where his post was fixed
Olea stood alone.
"Yield up thy banner, gallant knight!
Thy lord lies on the plain;
Thy duty has been nobly done;
I would not see thee slain.”
“Spare pity, King of Aragon!
I would not hear thee lie:
My lord is looking down from heaven
To see his standard fly."

Thou hast nor lance nor shield;

Can neither fly nor yield !”

And there, against all Aragon,

Olea fought until the sword
Snapped in his sturdy hand.

Which laughs at earthly fears,
He hurled the broken hilt, and drew
His dagger on the spears.

From every vein he bled.
Clasping the standard to his heart,

That rang as if a trumpet blew,-

When Jephthah went to battle against the Ammonites he vowed that
if he were victorious whatsoever should come forth from his home to
meet him on his return should be offered up as a burnt offering. To his
horror, the first to come out to meet him was his daughter and only
child. She consented to the fulfillment of his vow. (See Judges XI and

She stood before her father's gorgeous tent,
To listen for his coming. Her loose hair
Was resting on her shoulders, like a cloud
Floating around a statue, and the wind,
Just swaying her light robe, revealed a shape
Praxiteles might worship. She had clasped

Her hands upon her bosom, and had raised
Her beautiful, dark, Jewish eyes to heaven,
Till the long lashes lay upon her brow.
Onward came
The leaden tramp of thousands. Clarion notes
Rang sharply on the ear at intervals;
And the low, mingled din of mighty hosts,
Returning from the battle, poured from far,
Like the deep murmur of a restless sea.
They came, as earthly conquerors always come,
With blood and splendor, revelry and woe.
The stately horse treads proudly: he hath trod
The brow of death, as well. The chariot-wheels
Of warriors roll magnificently on;
Their weight hath crushed the fallen. Man is there,
Majestic, lordly man, with his sublime

Lifting his crest in triumph; for his heel
Hath trod the dying like a wine-press down.
The mighty Jephthah led his warriors on
Through Mizpeh's streets. His helm was proudly
set,
And his stern lip curled slightly, as if praise
Were for the hero's scorn. His step was firm,
But free as India's leopard; and his mail,
Whose shekels none in Israel might bear,
Was like a cedar's tassel on his frame.
His crest was Judah's kingliest; and the look
Of his dark, lofty eye, and bended brow,
Might quell the lion. He led on; but thoughts
Seemed gathering round which troubled him. The

Grew visible upon his swarthy brow,
And his proud lip was pressed as if with pain.
He trod less firmly; and his restless eye
Glanced forward frequently, as if some ill
He dared not meet were there. His home was near,
And men were thronging, with that strange delight
They have in human passions, to observe
The struggle of his feelings with his pride.
He gazed intently forward. The tall firs
Before his door were motionless. The leaves
Of the sweet aloe, and the clustering vines
Which half concealed his threshold, met his eye,
Unchanged and beautiful; and one by one,
The balsam, with its sweet-distilling stems,
And the Circassian rose, and all the crowd
Of silent and familiar things, stole up,
Like the recovered passages of dreams.
He strode on rapidly. A moment more,
And he had reached his home; when lo! there sprang
One with a bounding footstep, and a brow
Of light, to meet him. O, how beautiful!
Her dark eye flashing like a sun-lit gem,
And her luxuriant hair,-'twas like the sweep
Of a swift wing in visions. He stood still,
As if the sight had withered him. She threw
Her arms about his neck: he heeded not.
She called him "Father," but he answered not.
She stood and gazed upon him. Was he wroth?
There was no anger in that blood-shot eye.
Had sickness seized him? She unclasped his helm,
And laid her white hand gently on his brow,
And the large veins felt stiff and hard, like cords.
The touch aroused him. He raised up his hands,

And spoke the name of God in agony.
She knew that he was stricken then, and rushed
Again into his arms, and with a flood
Of tears she could not stay, she sobbed a prayer
That he would breathe his agony in words.
He told her, and a momentary flush
Shot o'er her countenance; and then the soul
Of Jephthah's daughter wakened; and she stood
Calmly and nobly up, and said 'twas well,
And she would die.
The sun had well-night set.
The fire was on the altar; and the priest
Of the High God was there. A pallid man
Was stretching out his trembling hands to heaven,
As if he would have prayed, but had no words ;-
And she who was to die, the calmest one
In Israel at that hour, stood up alone,
And waited for the sun to set. Her face
Was pale, but very beautiful; her lip
Had a more delicate outline, and the tint
Was deeper; but her countenance was like
The majesty of angels.
The sun set,
And she was dead, but not by violence.

And words of good cheer to boot,
Whilst Owen was wild to be plucking
The English clan up by the root;
Where regicide Oliver reveled
With his Puritan, ironside horde,
And cut down both marble and monarchy,
Grimly and grave, with the sword;
There, in that old town of history,
England, in famed ninety-eight,
Was busy with gallows and yeomen,
Propounding the laws of the State.-
They were hanging a young lad—a rebel-
On a gibbet before the old jail,
And they marked his weak spirit to falter,
And his white face to quiver and quail;
And he spoke of his mother, whose dwelling
Was but a short distance away,-
A poor, lorn, heart-broken widow,-
And he her sole solace and stay.
“Bring her here,” cried the chief of the yeomen,
"A lingering chance let us give
To this spawn of a rebel to babble,
And by her sage counsel to live.”
And quick a red trooper went trotting
From the town to the poor cabin-door,
And he found the old lone woman sitting
And spinning upon the bare floor.

"Your son is in trouble, old damsel !
They have him within, in the town,
And he wishes to see you; so bustle,
And put on your tucker and gown.”
The old woman stopped from the spinning,
With a frown on her deep-wrinkled brow:
"I know how it is, cursed yeoman!
I am ready; I'll go with you now."
He seized her, enraged, by the shoulder,
And lifting her up on his steed,
Stuck the spurs; and they rode to the city,
Right ahead, and with clattering speed.
They stopped at the foot of the gallows,
And the mother confronted the son,
And she hugged his young heart to her bosom,
And kissed his face, pallid and wan.
And as the rope dangled before her,
She held the loop fast in her hand;
For, though her proud soul was unblenching,
Her frail limbs were failing to stand.
And whilst the raw yeomen came crowding
To witness the harrowing scene,
The brave mother flushed to the forehead,
And spoke with the air of a queen:
"My son, they are going to hang you,
For loving your faith and your home,
And they called me to urge you, and save you,
And, in God's name, I've answered and come.
They murdered your father before you,
And I knelt on the red, reeking sod,
And I watched his hot blood steaming upward
To call down the vengeance of God.

No blot did he leave on his name,
And I always could pray at his cold grave,-
Oh! the priest could kneel there without

"To hell with your priests and your rebels !"
The captain cried out with a yell,
Whilst, from the tall tower in the temple,
Rang out the sweet Angelus bell.
“Blessed Mother!" appealed the poor widow,
“Look down on my child and on me!”—
“Blessed Mother!" sneered out the vile yeoman;
“Tell your son to confess, and be free."
“Never! never !-He'll die like his father.-
My boy! give your life to the Lord;
But of treason to Ireland, ma vourneen!
Never breathe one dishonoring word !"
His white cheek flushed up at her speaking;
His heart bounded up at her call;
And his hushed spirit seemed, at awaking,
To scorn death, yeomen, and all.
“I'll die, and I'll be no informer;
My kin I will never disgrace;
And when God lets me see my poor father
I can lovingly look in his face."
“You'll see him in hell!” cried the yeoman,
As he flung the sad widow away.-
And the youth in a moment was strangling
In the broad eye of shuddering day.

“Give the gallows a passenger outside !"
A tall Hessian spluttered aloud,
As he drove a huge nail in the timber
Mid the curses and cries of the crowd.
Then, seizing the poor bereaved mother,
He passed his broad belt round her throat,
Whilst her groaning was lost in the drum-beat,
And her shrieks in the shrill bugle note.
And mother and son were left choking,
And struggling and writhing in death,
Whilst angels looked down on the murder,
And devils were wrangling beneath.
SARDANAPALUS-ATHERSTONE.
Then went the king,
Flushed with the wine, and in his pride of power
Glorying; and with his own strong arm upraised
From out its rest the Assyrian banner broad,
Purple and edged with gold; and, standing then
Upon the utmost summit of the mount,
Round, and yet round for two strong men a task
Sufficient deemed—he waved the splendid flag,
Bright as a meteor streaming.
At that sight
The plain was in a stir: the helms of brass
Were lifted up, and glittering spear-points waved,
And banners shaken, and wide trumpet mouths
Upturned; and myriads of bright-harnessed steeds
Were seen uprearing, shaking their proud heads;
And brazen chariots in a moment sprang,
And clashed together. In a moment more
Up came the monstrous universal shout,

Like a volcano's burst. Up, up to heaven
The multitudinous tempest tore its way,
Rocking the clouds: from all the swarming plain
And from the city rose the mingled cry:
"Long live Sardanapalus, king of kings!
May the king live for ever!” Thrice the flag
The monarch waved; and thrice the shouts arose
Enormous, that the solid walls were shook,
And the firm ground made tremble.
At his height,
A speck scarce visible, the eagle heard,
And felt his strong wing falter; terror-struck,
Fluttering and wildly screaming, down he sank,
Down through the quivering air. Another shout,
His talons droop, his sunny eye grows dark,
His strengthless pennons fail, plumb down he falls,
Even like a stone. Amid the far off hills,
With eye of fire, and shaggy mane upreared,
The sleeping lion in his den sprang up;
Listened awhile,—then laid his monstrous mouth
Close to the floor, and breathed hot roarings out
In fierce reply.

Spring through the gate; the lofty chariot then,
Of ebony, with gold and gems thick strewn,
Even like the starry night. The spokes were gold,
With fellies of strong brass; the naves were brass,
With burnished gold o'erlaid, and diamond
rimmed;
Steel were the axles, in bright silver case;
The pole was cased in silver: high aloft,
Like a rich throne, the gorgeous seat was framed,
Of ivory part, part silver, and part gold;
On either side a golden statue stood:
Upon the right, and on a throne of gold,
Great Belus, of the Assyrian empire first,
And worshipped as a god; but, on the left,
In a resplendent car by lions drawn,
A goddess; on her head a tower; and, round,
Celestial glory: this the deity
Whom most the monarch worshipped; she whom,
since,
Astarte or Derceto men have named,
And Venus, queen of love. Around her waist
A girdle, glittering with all radiant gems,
Seemed heaving to her breath. Behind the car,
Full in the centre, on the ebon ground,
Flamed forth a diamond sun; on either side,
A horned moon of diamond; and beyond,
The planets, each one blazing diamond.
Such was the chariot of the king of kings.
Himself in dazzling armor stands aloft,
And rules the fiery steeds. His shield of gold,
His spear, his helm, his bow and quiver hang
Within the roomy car. Thus, like a god,

Bends to the ground, and every voice cries out:
"Long live Sardanapalus, king of kings!
May the king live for ever!” Thrice he smiles,
And waves his hand to all; and thrice the shouts
To heaven go up. Then on his starting horse
Springs every rider; every charioteer
Leaps to his car; and through the sounding streets
The pageant flames, and on the dusty plain
Pours forth; and evermore, from street to street,
Runs on the cry: “The king! the king comes forth!
The king of kings in his war-chariot comes;
Long live Sardanapalus, king of kings!
May the king live for ever!”
To the walls
The cry flies on; they hear it on the plains :
The plains cry out; they hear it in the heavens.
On through the bowing host the monarch drives;
High over all conspicuous, the bright crown,
Like an ethereal fire, through all the field
Flashing perpetual light. From rank to rank,
From nation unto nation goes he on;
And still all knees are bent, all voices raised
As to a deity.

Of age, and womanhood, and infancy,

The axes and the curule chair, the car, and laurel

Still press us for your cohorts, and, when the fight

Still fill your garners from the soil which our good
swords have won.
But, by the shades beneath us, and by the gods

Add not unto your cruel hate your yet more cruel

Have ye not graceful ladies, whose spotless lineage
springs
From Consuls, and High Pontiffs, and ancient Alban

Are there not times, Patricians, when great States
Rush to their ruin? Rome is no more like Rome,
Than a foul dungeon's like the glorious sky.
What is she now? Degenerate, gross, defiled,
The tainted haunt, the gorged receptacle,
Of every slave and vagabond of earth:
A mighty grave that luxury has dug,
To rid the other realms of pestilence!
Ye wait to hail me Consul?
Consul! Look on me,—on this brow,—these hands;
Look on this bosom, black with early wounds.
Have I not served the State from boyhood up,
Scattered my blood for her, labored for, loved her?
I had no chance; wherefore should I be Consul?
No! Cicero still is master of the crowd.
Why not? He's made for them, and they for him:
They want a sycophant, and he wants slaves.
Well, let him have them!

Patricians! They have pushed me to the gulf.
I have worn down my heart, wasted my means,
Humbled my birth, bartered my ancient name,
For the rank favor of the senseless mass,
That frets and festers in your Commonwealth ;
And now,
The very men with whom I walked through life,
Nay, till within this hour, in all the bonds
Of courtesy and high companionship,
This day, as if the heavens had stamped me black,
Turned on their heel, just at the point of fate,
Left me a mockery in the rabble's midst,
And followed their plebeian Consul, Cicero!
This was the day to which I looked through life,
And it has failed me, vanished from my grasp
Like air!
Roman no more! The rabble of the streets
Have seen me humbled; slaves may gibe at me.
For all the ills
That chance or nature lays upon our heads,
In chance or nature there is found a cure.
But self-abasement is beyond all cure.
The brand is here, burned in the living flesh,
That bears its mark to the grave; that dagger's
plunged
Into the central pulses of the heart;
The act is the mind's suicide, for which
There is no after-health, no hope, no pardon.

Better the quick release of glorious wounds,

And it must fall. Her boasted strength's a ghost,
Fearful to dastards, yet, to trenchant swords,
Thin as the passing air. A single blow,
In this diseased and crumbling state of Rome,
Would break your chains like stubble.

Have you climbed up to walls and battlements,
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
The live-long day, with patient expectation,
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome;
And when you saw his chariot but appear,
Have you not made an universal shout,
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks
To hear the replication of your sounds,
Made in her concave shores?
And do you now put on your best attire ?
And do you now cull out a holiday ?
And do you now strew flowers in his way,

'Tis about twenty years since Abel Law,

Was wedded to
A most abominable shrew.

Could no more be compared with hers,

Her eyes were like a weasel's; she had a harsh
Face, like a cranberry marsh,
All spread
With spots of white and red;
Hair of the color of a wisp of straw,
And a disposition like a cross-cut saw.
The appellation of this lovely dame
Was Nancy;—don't forget the name.
Her brother David was a tall,
Good-looking chap, and that was all;
One of your great, big nothings, as we say
Here in Rhode Island, picking up old jokes
And cracking them on other folks.-
Well, David undertook one night to play
The Ghost, and frighten Abel, who,
He knew,
Would be returning from a journey through
A grove of forest wood
That stood
Below
The house some distance,-half a mile or so.

Whether he twitched his most revered

Does not the hound betray our pace,
And gins and guns destroy our race?
Thieves dread the searching eye of power,
And never feel the quiet hour,
Old age, which few of us shall know,
Now puts a period to my woe.
Would you true happiness attain,
Let honesty your passions rein;
So live in credit and esteem,
And the good name you lost, redeem.”

“The counsel's good," a fox replies,
"Could we perform what you advise.
Think what our ancestors have done;
A line of thieves from son to son:
To us descends the long disgrace,
And infamy hath marked our race.
Though we like harmless sheep should feed,
Honest in thought, in word, and deed;
Whatever henroost is decreased,
We shall be thought to share the feast.
The change shall never be believed,
A lost good name is ne'er retrieved.”
“Nay, then,” replies the feeble fox,
"But hark! I hear a hen that clocks:
Go, but be moderate in your food;
A chicken too might do me good."

A BOY HERO-ANONYMOUS.
O'er "The Devil's Gulch," a chasm wild,
Sprung a mighty bridge; a roaring tide
Rushed headlong through the depths below.
From a watch-tower high, a shining glow
The watchman nightly made to shed
Its warning signals of green or red,
As the mighty engine thundered down,
At morn and eve, from a far-off town.
A great storm rages o'er steep and fell,
And "The Devil's Gulch" is a roaring hell
Of waters, foaming wild and white,
While darkness deepens into night.
Carl Springel takes his poor old crutch,
(The watchman's son,-he's lame, and Dutch),
And goes forth, hobbling through the night.
Though his steps are heavy, his heart is light,
For he carries to his father dear
His evening meal and helpful cheer.
What cares he for the wind and rain ?
First, love and duty, then home again. .
Now he rounds the curve of the mountain track-
What is that he hears?-a deafening crack !
Then a rumbling crash through the blinding storm:
"The bridge! oh, the bridge! the bridge is gone!
Oh, father! father!” hear him cry,

But his voice is lost in the howling sky;
And the train, the train is speeding down,
With its living load from the distant town.
Though bitter grief his heart doth rack,
He sees the hand-car on the track,
He sees the lantern's blood-red gleam,
He hears the engine's whistle scream.
He climbs on the car; the crank he turns,
First slow, then fast. His heart it burns
With anguish, sorrow, hopes, and fears.
He tugs and strains; and now he hears
The train come thundering through the night,
And now he sees the headlight bright.
He knows he's numbered with the dead,
But waves the lantern above his head.
He shouts: “The bridge! the bridge is down!
The bridge is down! the bridge is—”
Drowned in the awful din of train and storm,
The engine strikes, and his mangled form
Is dashed a hundred feet aside,
But the train stops short of the roaring tide.
In Germany the tale is told,
On a tombstone white, in words of gold:
"Carl Springel's grave,
Aged fourteen.
The crippled hero and martyr gave
His life two hundred lives to save."

Sped straight on to its duty. The last of the gang

“Macgregor, Macgregor, remember our foemen;

The clans are impatient, and chide thy delay;
Arise! let us bound to Glen-Lyon away."

He turned his red eye to the braes of Strathfillan:
"Go, Malcolm, to sleep, let the clans be dismissed;
The Campbells this night for Macgregor must
rest."
"Macgregor, Macgregor, our scouts have been
flying,
Three days round the hills of M'Nab and Glen-
Lyon;
Of riding and running such tidings they bear,
We must meet them at home, else they'll quickly be
here."-
“The Campbell may come, as his promises bind
him,
And haughty M'Nab, with his giants behind him;
This night I am bound to relinquish the fray,
And do what it freezes my vitals to say.
"Forgive me, dear brother, this horror of mind;
Thou knowest in the strife I was never behind,
Nor ever receded a foot from the van,
Or blenched at the ire or the prowess of man:
But I've sworn, by the cross, by my God, and my
all:
An oath which I cannot, and dare not recall,
Ere the shadows of midnight fall East from the
pile,
To meet with a spirit this night in Glen-Gyle.
"Last night, in my chamber, all thoughtful and
lone,
I called to remembrance some deeds I had done,
When entered a lady, with visage so wan,
And looks such as never were fastened on man.

I knew her, O brother! I knew her too well!
Of that once fair dame such a tale I could tell,
As would thrill thy bold heart; but how long she
remained,
So racked was my spirit, my bosom so pained,
I knew not,—but ages seemed short to the while;
Though proffer the Highlands, nay, all the green
isle,
With length of existence no man can enjoy,
The same to endure, the dread proffer I'd fly!
“She told me, and turned my chilled heart to a
stone,
The glory and name of Macgregor were gone;
That the pine, which for ages had shed a bright
halo
Afar on the mountains of Highland Glen-Falo,
Should wither and fall ere the turn of yon moon,
Smit through by the canker of hated Colquhoun;
That a feast on Macgregors each day should be
common
For years to the eagles of Lennox and Lomond.
“A parting embrace, in one moment she gave;
Her breath was a furnace, her bosom the grave.
Then flitting illusive, she said, with a frown:
‘The mighty Macgregor shall yet be my own!”
"Macgregor, thy fancies are wild as the wind;
The dreams of the night have disordered thy mind.
Come, buckle thy panoply; march to the field;

This night the proud chief his presumption shall
rue;
Rise, brother, these chinks in his heart-blood will
glue.”
Like glimpse of the moon thro' the storm of the
night,
Macgregor's red eye shed one sparkle of light:
It faded, -it darkened,—he shuddered, he sighed;
"No! not for the universe!" low he replied.
Away went Macgregor, but went not alone:
To watch the dread rendezvous, Malcolm has gone.
All silent they went, for the time was approach-
ing:
The moon the blue zenith already was touching;
No foot was abroad on the forest or hill,
No sound but the lullaby sung by the rill:
Young Malcolm, at distance couched, trembling the
while;
Macgregor stood lone by the brook of Glen-Gyle.
Few minutes had passed, ere they spied on the
stream
A skiff sailing light, where a lady did seem;
Her sail was the web of the gossamer's loom;
The glow-worm her wake-light, the rainbow her
boom;
A dim rayless beam was her prow and her mast,
Like wold-fire at midnight, that glares on the
waste.
Though rough was the river with rock and cascade,
No torrent, no rock, her velocity stayed.

Young Malcolm beheld the pale lady approach,
The chieftain salute her and shrink from her touch.
He saw the Macgregor kneel down on the plain,
As begging for something he could not obtain;
She raised him indignant, derided his stay,
Then bore him on board, set her sail, and away.
Though fast the red bark down the river did
glide,
Yet faster ran Malcolm adown by its side.
"Macgregor! Macgregor!” he bitterly cried;
“Macgregor! Macgregor!" the echoes replied.
He struck at the lady, but, strange though it seem,
His sword only fell on the rocks and the stream;
But the groans from the boat, that ascended amain,
Were groans from a bosom in horror and pain.
They reached the dark lake, and bore lightly away:
Macgregor is vanished forever and aye!

The night-wind with a desolate moan swept by,
And the old shutters of the turret swung
Creaking upon their hinges; and the moon,
As the torn edges of the clouds flew past,
Struggled aslant the stained and broken panes
So dimly, that the watchful eye of death
Scarcely was conscious when it went and came.
The fire beneath his crucible was low,
Yet still it burned; and ever, as his thoughts
Grew insupportable, he raised himself
Upon his wasted arm, and stirred the coals
With difficult energy; and when the rod

Fell from his nerveless fingers, and his eye
Felt faint within its socket, he shrunk back
Upon his pallet, and, with unclosed lips,
Muttered a curse on death.
The silent room
From its dim corners mockingly gave back
His rattling breath; the humming in the fire
Had the distinctness of a knell; and when
Duly the antique horologe beat one,
He drew a phial from beneath his head,
And drank. And instantly his lips compressed,
And, with a shudder in his skeleton frame,
He rose with supernatural strength, and sat
Upright, and communed with himself:
"I did not think to die
Till I had finished what I had to do:
I thought to pierce th' eternal secret through
With this my mortal eye;
I felt,—0 God! it seemeth even now-
This cannot be the death-dew on my brow;
"And yet it is,—I feel
Of this dull sickness at my heart afraid;
And in my eyes the death-sparks flash and fade,
And something seems to steal
Over my bosom like a frozen hand,
Binding its pulses with an icy band.
“And this is death! But why
Feel I this wild recoil? It cannot be
Th' immortal spirit shuddereth to be free.
Would it not leap to fly, ,
Like a chained eaglet at its parent's call?
I fear, I fear, that this poor life is all.

To live but for a hope that mocks at last;
To agonize, to strive, to watch, to fast,
To waste the light of day,

All that we have and are for this,-for naught!
“Grant me another year,

Something to satisfy this thirst within!
I would know something here!
Break for me but one seal that is unbroken!
Speak for me but one word that is unspoken!

With a swift dizziness, and my heart grows sick,

The upper stars into the pathless sky,
To see th' invisible spirits, eye to eye,
To hurl the lightning back,
To tread unhurt the sea's dim-lighted halls,
To chase day's chariot to the horizon-walls;
“And more, much more,—for now

To nurse and purify this human love,
To clear the god-like brow

Open and ashy pale, th' expression wore
Of his death-struggle. His long, silvery hair
Lay on his hollow temples, thin and wild;
His frame was wasted, and his features wan
And haggard as with want, and in his palm
His nails were driven deep, as if the throe
Of the last agony had wrung him sore.

The holy priest of God. The incense lamp
Burned with a struggling light, and a low chant
Swelled through the hollow arches of the roof,
Like an articulate wail; and there, alone,
Wasted to ghastly thinness, Helon knelt.

Died in the distant aisles, and he rose up,
Struggling with weakness, and bowed down his

Unto the sprinkled ashes, and put off

And to the desert wild,
From all thou lov'st, away thy feet must flee,
That from thy plague his people may be free.

Nor set thy foot a human threshold o'er;

By desert well, or river's grassy brink.

Thy heart is heavy, and thine eyes are dim,
Lift up thy prayer beseechingly to Him
Who, from the tribes of men,

In the lone wilderness, and bathed his brow,
Hot with the burning leprosy, and touched
The loathsome water to his fevered lips,
Praying he might be so blest,—to die.
Footsteps approached, and with no strength to flee,
He drew the covering closer on his lip,
Crying, “Unclean! unclean!" and in the folds
Of the coarse sackcloth shrouding up his face,
He fell upon the earth till they should pass.
Nearer the stranger came, and bending o'er

Of a rich instrument, most strangely sweet;
And the dull pulses of disease awoke,
And for a moment beat beneath the hot
And leprous scales with a restoring thrill.
“Helon, arise!" And he forgot his curse,
And rose and stood before him.

Mingled in the regard of Helon's eye,
As he beheld the Stranger. He was not

The lion would have crouched to in his lair.
His garb was simple, and His sandals worn;
His stature modeled with a perfect grace;
His countenance, the impress of a God
Touched with the open innocence of a child;
His eye was blue and calm, as is the sky
In the serenest noon; His hair, unshorn,
Fell to His shoulders; and His curling beard
The fulness of perfected manhood bore.
He looked on Helon earnestly awhile,
As if His heart was moved; and stooping down,
He took a little water in His hand
And laid it on his brow, and said, “Be clean!"
And lo! the scales fell from him, and his blood
Coursed with delicious coolness through his veins,
And his dry palms grew moist, and on his brow
The dewy softness of an infant's stole.
His leprosy was cleansed, and he fell down
Prostrate at Jesus' feet, and worshipped Him.

With clutching bony fingers, that pictured the grim
grip of death,
Gave the crew on the good sail-ship “Hester" a
warning. But still not a breath,
That seemed in the least like a storm-wind blew
over the tranquil blue deep.
The two children in charge of the Captain were
safe in the cabin, asleep.
Captain William T. Brown was the skipper; a
braver tar never trod deck:
He was standing but now by the helmsman, and
anxiously scanning the speck
Of cloud as large now as his jacket, and above it,
what looked like a head;
While below stretched long limbs, ghostly shapes,
that made the heart heavy with dread.
And e'en as he gazed and shuddered, the arms
stretched out more and more wide;
The face grinned down at the skipper, the limbs
seemed to make a long stride
Toward the ship. Quickly gave he the word to the
helmsman to make all secure,
Then laid his own hand to the sail-ropes, and
pulled, and tied all safe and sure.
The time could be counted by heart-beats, so
quickly the storm-fiend drew near;
Where a minute ago was clear blue sky, now
stretched heavy cloud, dark and drear.
Each man watched the work of the skipper, each
one tied a rope round his waist,
Each fastened himself to some stout beam, each
man to his neighbor was laced.

"O God! we've forgotten the babies! I promised

They're the children of Reginald Ashton, my old

Ave sanctissima, maiden mild,
Place watchful guards to-night
All round thy child!

In deluge of rain,
Ne'er asked I thy guidance,

On the sea!

words of the psalm died below:
"Oh, Mary will certainly save us! I have often and
often heard say
That if, in the midst of the ocean, there be but a
maid near to pray
To Mary, the Mother of Sorrows, and she pray
with a babe on her knee,

As she sang, “Watch over us, mother! we trust in
thee, hear! oh, hear!"
The storm-fiend shrieked in his fury and rage, but
the song rang on
Until the demon was vanquished, and the terrible
peril gone.
After hours and hours of drifting, the fog-bank
dissolved away;
The rays of the sun just rising, disclosed a beauti-
ful bay.
They were riding safe in the harbor; though never
an anchor bound,
Nor yet a cable held them, they were riding safe
and sound.
Men came down to them, sore-hearted, and won-
dered at the sight,
For on the shore, as on the sea, it had been a woe-
ful night.
Not a house was left in the village, the tempest had
leveled the town;
Many a wreck lay on the beach, telling of sailors
gone down.
"Ah! they had not a maid and a babe on board, to
pray
To the Holy Mother Mary who hears their cry
alway.”—
"A maid, indeed! Where is she? Let us see her;
bring her ashore."
They hastened down to the cabin, but paused ere
they entered the door.
Sitting, facing the gang-way, one child clinging
close to her side,

The other babe clasped to her bosom, the saintly
singer had died.
Her lips were still partly open, her glance was up-
ward cast,
She had sung, until, like the sailors, she into harbor
passed.
On the bluff, just up from the harbor, there stands
a quaint old tower;
A great bell swings backward and forward at night
to tell the hour.
And 'tis said that in a tempest, if sailors the shore
are near
And listen, the words come to them, "Hear! oh,
hear!"
And then if they all kneel and whisper a prayer to
the Mother above,
They are saved from death by drowning, saved by
the maiden's love,
Which so moves the Mother of Sorrows that she
spares the sailors' lives
For the sake of the sailors' mothers and the sailors'
waiting wives.
THE THIEF ON THE CROSS
-GEO. M. VICKERS.
Crouching low, but not with fear,
A robber earthward bends his ear;
The distant footfalls nearer grow,
Hesitating, stumbling, slow;
Then quicker, as the 'lated wight
Beholds each cheerful, twinkling light;
Jerusalem lies at his feet,

Anon he'll tread the lively street;
Soon Olivet will be descended,
Kedron crossed, his journey ended;
And, as he nears her looming walls,
The gladdening sight his strength recalls.
But hark! What awful shrieks are those
That break the peaceful night's repose ?-
Two darksome forms, like goblins grim,
Weird antics cut in the starlight dim:
Advancing-retreating; a parry-a thrust,
Now having the 'vantage, now prone in the dust.
Ha! See! The traveler's gleaming knife
Has all but reached the bandit's life!
But the groan, suppressed by an iron will,
His mettle proves, though bandit still;
E’en wounded, yet he scowls disdain,
The gash ignores, unheeds the pain:
He scorns to cringe, but with a bound,
Hurls, crushed, his victim to the ground!*

'Twas morn in ancient Palestine,
The air was hushed, the sky serene;
No leaflet stirred, no warbler sang;
Yet nature seemed to feel a pang.
But why? The dewdrop sparkled still,
Fair blossoms scented vale and hill,
E'en the sunward sky poured forth its flood,
Its red, inverted sea of blood.
Ho! Barabbas, ho! Hear Pilate's decree:
The Nazarene dieth, but thou goest free!

Off went the shackles, and forth from the cell
Stepped the bold felon; then followed the yell,
The cry of despair and of anguish and pain,
As the door of the dungeon swung to again.
Yet within the walls of that living grave
Was a bandit bad—but a bandit brave.
He was one of the three in that prison-room
Who hopelessly waited a terrible doom;
Yet he stood with his arms athwart his breast,
And the measured rise and fall of the chest,
With the sweeping glance of his fearless eye,
All told of a villain that dared to die.
Already there floated within the gate
Wild rumors of how they met their fate,
Of the earnest though haughty mien of him
Who shuddered and writhed on an outer limb;
Of the One who imploringly raised his eyes,
Who seemed to be gazing beyond the skies;
Of another who jeered in the jaws of death,
And cursed the law with his waning breath;
Of the which should be first or latest to die,
As happened the thoughts of the passers-by.
But out on the road as yė move along,
Behold the returning, the sated throng!
Press onward and upward; thrust them aside;
Their flush of confusion shall be your guide;-
Halt! Rigidly, grimly, there hang the three
On the veriest crest of Calvary.
Look at the sunken, the bloodshot eye
Of the raving blasphemer about to die:
Note how he gasps, how he twists with pain,
Cursing, and cursing, yet cursing in vain.

And the one in the centre, say, who is He
Whom the soldiers and rabble press round to see?
What legend of crime, what sign of disgrace,
That flutters and flares at the populace?
Come read what is writ o'er the victim's head;
Soft! Ye must move with a reverent tread.
And thus run the words that your eyes peruse:
“Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews !”
A bandit hath seen them and read them, too,
And he scans them again like the thing were new;
And each time the meek Monarch breathes forth a
prayer
It seemeth to lessen the robber's despair;
For the proud look of courage fades out from his
face,
And a tender expression beams forth in its place.
Perhaps as the soul is about to take flight,
New scenes glad the view of its wondering sight,
As mariners, nearing a newly-found shore,
Gaze enraptured on beauties unheard of before.
Still he dwells on the face of the crucified King,
Nor gives heed to the shouts that derisively ring,-
On the thorn-tortured brow, on the dry, moving
lips,
On the blood that adown the pale cheek slowly
drips.
All, all meet his gaze, and he utters a sigh,
While a single bright tear-drop starts forth from
his eye.
As the pain-stricken babe to its mother reveals,
By the language of looks, the keen anguish it feels,

So the robber's sad glances now seem to impart
To yon Jesus the weight of remorse at his heart.
"Remember me, Lord!" Hear the bandit implore!
He whom life could not tempt to crave pity before.
What strange fascination hath conquered the

What power converts to the mystic belief?
And the merciful Jesus replies from the tree:

BRUTUS OVER THE DEAD LUCRETIA
-PAYNE.
Lucretia, dishonored by Sextus Tarquinius, had slain herself. Brutus,
pretending to be a fool, swears vengeance against Sextus. The latter is
the son of Tarquinius Superbus. To understand the story here referred
to, it must be noted that Tarquinius Superbus married the elder daughter
of Servius Tullius, named Tullia ; his brother, Aruns, taking to wife
her younger sister, also named Tullia. The two women, like the two men,
were antipodal characters; the elder Tullia and Aruns, mild ; the younger
Tullia and Tarquinius Superbus, haughty. The latter two murdered both
the former, and married. To gain the throne, Tullia's own father was
then murdered, over whose dead body she rode in triumph.
Would you know why I summoned you together?
Ask ye what brings me here? Behold this dagger,
Clotted with gore! Behold that frozen corse!
See where the lost Lucretia sleeps in death!
She was the mark and model of the time,
The mold in which each female face was formed,
The very shrine and sacristy of virtue.
The worthiest of the worthy. Not the nymph
Who met old Numa in his hallowed walks,
And whispered in his ear her strains divine,
Can I conceive beyond her. The young choir
Of vestal virgins bent to her. 'Tis wonderful,

Amid the darnel, hemlock, and base weeds,
Which now spring rife from the luxurious compost
Spread o'er the realm, how this sweet lily rose,
How from the shade of those ill neighboring plants
Her father sheltered her, that not a leaf
Was blighted, but, arrayed in purest grace,
Bloomed in unsullied beauty. O my countrymen!
You all can witness when that she went forth
It was a holiday in Rome; old age
Forgot its crutch, labor its task,—all ran;
And mothers, turning to their daughters, cried,
“There, there's Lucretia!" Now, look ye, where she
lies!
That beauteous flower, that innocent sweet rose,
Torn up by ruthless violence,–gone! gone! gone!
Say, would you seek instruction? Would ye ask
What ye should do? Ask ye yon conscious walls,
Which saw his poisoned brother,-
Ask yon deserted street, where Tullia drove
O'er her dead father's corse, 'twill cry, Revenge!
Ask yonder senate-house, whose stones are purple
With human blood, and it will cry, Revenge!
Go to the tomb where lies his murdered wife,
And the poor queen, who loved him as her son,
Their unappeased ghosts will shriek, Revenge!
The temples of the gods, the all-viewing heavens,
The gods themselves shall justify the cry,
And swell the general sound, Revenge! Revenge!
And we will be revenged, my countrymen!
Brutus shall lead you on; Brutus, a name
Which will, when you're revenged, be dearer to him
Than all the noblest titles earth can boast.

If mad ambition in this guilty frame
Had strung one kingly fibre, yea, but one,-
By all the gods, this dagger which I hold
Should rip it out, though it entwined my heart.
Now take the body up. Bear it before us
To Tarquin's palace; there we'll light our torches,
And, in the blazing conflagration, rear
A pile for these chaste relics, that shall send
Her soul among the stars. On! Brutus leads you;
On to the Forum! The fool shall set you free!
THE ROMAN SENTINEL
-WARD M. FLORENCE.
The morning sun rose from his crimson couch
In the Orient-land, and bathed the world
In golden showers of refreshing light.
With orange and with jasmine the gardens
Of Pompeii were beautiful and fragrant;
The hazy air, mild and calm, wrapped this proud
Old Italian city in a mantle
Of dreamful repose. On her streets the tramp
Of feet, now and then, broke the lazy quiet,
Some bought, some sold, some danced, some played,
some slept;
And each one went about his daily work,
Nor dreamed of danger near.
At a gate commanding entrance to Pompeii
Was placed a trusty sentinel. His tall,
Erect and warlike stature told a tale

Of dauntless courage. Proud of the faith and
Confidence placed in his loyal heart,
The sentinel's eyes shone like brilliant stars.
His trumpet, sword, and buckler hung about
His frame with airy lightness, while his face,
His bearing, and his every action
Proclaimed in terms and force significant,-
“Here stands a Roman Soldier !"
While pacing to and fro his measured beat,
And dreaming dreams of long expected honors,
There comes, beneath him, a strange, quick move-
ment.
He stops—waits-listens. Ah, it comes again!
Then he knows the awful truth, an earthquake,
That dreadful harbinger of volcanic
Action. A third time, and the ground doth heave
Like ocean billows. Up, through ev'ry vein
The soldier's blood darts with freezing torture.
He looks toward the bay; it boils and struggles
In its mad contention, lashing itself
As it lashes the shore. He lifts his trumpet
And sounds a loud alarm. Back from the throat
Of great Vesuvius returns the answer,-
A rumble, rumble, rumble, like distant
Artillery. Volumes of smoke, dense and
Gigantic, roll from the maddened crater.
Daylight ceases; no sun; no moon; no stars:
Now dreadful, appalling, and magnificent
Blazes the weird, Plutonian candle.
The ground heaves; it rocks again. The waters
Leap beyond their shores! See! the giant mountain
Trembles! Then one long, unnatural, roaring

Peal of wild volcanic thunder, and the
Fiery lakes of hell are hurled, seething,
Into the clouds above. Sound the danger
Signals! Rouse the thoughtless people! Fly! fly!
Fly for your lives! Too late! too late! forever
Too late! A molten sea of liquid fire
Pours down upon the fated city.
Ghastly imps, the specters of ruin, gloat
Above the hissing surges. Now a rain
Of red-hot ashes, stones, and cinders falls
Thick and fast for miles around. In the streets,
In their shops, in their homes, that startled mass
Of poor humanity is suddenly
Clasped in the arms of unexpected death.
Old age, manhood, buoyant youth, and helpless
Infancy all, all at once are buried
'Neath the burning fury of that awful
Avalanche.
When the pent up ire
Of grim Vesuvius had burst its massive
Prison bars, the soldier thought: "What shall
I do? To yon projecting rock I quick
Can fly and safety find. But can I thus betray
My sacred trust and win the name of coward ?
Is life a gem worth such a price to me?
Could e'er again these Roman lips repeat
The name my father bore? No! no! no! Here!
Here will I stand; so let the fiends of hell
Exhaust their utmost fury! Trumpet, sound

Seventeen
Hundred years rolled by ere again the light
Of day shone on the buried city;
Then excavation broke the seals which held
The solemn secret. Two hundred thousand
Skulls and more were found entombed beneath
The ashes. Every stone and piece of metal
Lifted from the ancient ruins, told o'er
And o'er the horrors of that dark eruption.
At his post the sentinel's bones had kept
Their long and ghastly vigil.
CAMBYSES AND THE MACROBIAN BOW
-PAUL H. HAYNE.
One morn, hard by a slumberous streamlet's wave,
The plane-trees stirless in the unbreathing calm,
And all the lush-red roses drooped in dream,
Lay King Cambyses, idle as a cloud
That waits the wind,-aimless of thought and
will,
But with vague evil, like the lightning's bolt
Ere yet the electric death be forged to smite,
Seething at heart. His courtiers ringed him round,
Whereof was one who to his comrades' ears,
With bated breath and wonder-arched brows,
Extolled a certain Bactrian's matchless skill
Displayed in bow-craft: at whose marvelous feats,
Eagerly vaunted, the King's soul grew hot
With envy, for himself erewhile had been
Rated the mightiest archer in his realm.

Slowly he rose, and pointing southward, said:
"Seest thou, Prexaspes, yonder slender palm,
A mere wan shadow quivering in the light,
Topped by a ghostly leaf-crown? Prithee now,
Can this, thy famous Bactrian, standing here,
Cleave with his shaft a hand's-breadth marked
thereon ?"
To which Prexaspes answered: "Nay, my lord;
I spake of feats compassed by mortal skill,
Not of gods' prowess." Unto whom the king:
"And if myself, Prexaspes, made essay,
Think'st thou, wise counselor, I too should fail ?"
"Needs must I, sire,"—albeit the courtier's voice
Trembled, and some dark prescience bade him
pause,
"Needs must I hold such cunning more than man's;
And for the rest, I pray thy pardon, king,
But yester-eve, amid the feast and dance,
Thou tarriedst with the beakers over-long."
The thick, wild, treacherous eyebrows of the king,
That looked a sheltering ambush for ill thoughts
Waxing to manhood of malignant acts,
These treacherous eyebrows, pent-house fashion,
closed
O'er the black orbits of his fiery eyes,
Which, clouded thus, but flashed a deadlier gleam
On all before him. Suddenly as fire
Half-choked and smouldering in its own dense
smoke,
Bursts into roaring radiance and swift flame,
Touched by keen breaths of liberating wind,
So now Cambyses' eyes a stormy joy

Stormily filled; for on Prexaspes' son,
His first-born son, they lingered,—a fair boy
(Midmost his fellow-pages flushed with sport),
Who, in his office of King's cup-bearer,
So gracious and so sweet were all his ways,
Had even the captious sovereign seemed to please;
While for the court, the reckless, reveling court,
They loved him one and all.-
"Go," said Cambyses now, his voice a hiss,
Poisonous and low, "go, bind my dainty page
To yonder palm-tree; bind him fast and sure,
So that no finger stirreth; which being done,
Fetch me, Prexaspes, the Macrobian bow."
Thus ordered, thus accomplished. Fast they bound
The innocent child, the while that mammoth bow,
Brought by the spies from Ethiopian camps,
Lay in the king's hand; slowly, sternly up,
He reared it to the level of his sight,
Reared, and bent back its oaken massiveness
Till the vast muscles, tough as grapevines, bulged
From naked arm and shoulder, and the horns
Of the fierce weapon groaning, almost met,
When, with one lowering glance askance at him,
His doubting satrap, the king coolly said,
"Prexaspes, look, my aim is at the heart !"
Then came the sharp twang, and the deadly whirr
Of the loosed arrow, followed by the dyll,
Drear echo of a bolt that smites its mark;
And those of keenest vision shook to see
The fair child fallen forward across his bonds,

With all his limbs a-quivering. Quoth the King,
Clapping Prexaspes' shoulder as in glee,
"Go thou, and tell me how that shaft hath sped !"
Forward the wretched father, step by step,
Crept, as one creeps whom black Hadean dreams,
Visions of fate and fear unutterable,
Draw, tranced and rigid, towards some definite goal
Of horror; thus he went, and thus he saw
What never in the noontide or the night,
Awake or sleeping, idle or in toil,
'Neath the wild forest or the perfumed lamps
Of palaces, shall leave his stricken sight
Unblasted, or his spirit purged of woe.
Prexaspes saw, yet lived,saw, and returned
Where still environed by his dissolute court,
Cambyses leaned, half-scornful, on his bow.
The old man's face was riven, and white as death;
But making meek obeisance to his king,
He smiled (ah, such a smile!) and feebly said:
"What am I, mighty master, what am I,
That I durst question my lord's strength and skill?
His arrows are like arrows of the god,
Egyptian Horus,—and for proof, but now
I felt a child's heart (once the child was mine,
'Tis my lord's now, and death's), all mute and still,
Pierced by his shaft, and cloven, ye gods! in twain,"
Then laughed the great king loudly, till his beard
Quivered, and all his stalwart body shook
With merriment; but when his mirth was calmed,
"Thou art forgiven," said he, "forgiven, old man;
Only when next these Persian dogs shall call

And tell them how, and to what purpose, once-
Once, on a morn which followed hot and wan
A night of monstrous revel and debauch,

THE RAVEN-POE.
To interpret the following selection correctly, the student of Elocution
should closely observe and enter into the feeling of impatience and despair,
bordering almost on frenzy, to which the poet has strung the soul of his
subject.
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered,
weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of for-
gotten lore,
While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there
came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my
chamber-door.
“ 'Tis some visitor," I muttered, "tapping at my
chamber-door-
Only this, and nothing more.”
Ah! distinctly I remember, it was in the bleak
December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost
upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought
to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow,-sorrow for
the lost Lenore,
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels
name Lenore,
Nameless here forevermore.

And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each
purple curtain
Thrilled me, filled me with fantastic terrors never
felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood
repeating:
“ 'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my cham-
ber-door,-
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my cham-
ber-door:
That it is, and nothing more."
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then
no longer,
"Sir,” said I "or madam, truly your forgiveness I
implore;
But the fact is, I was napping, and so gently you
came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my
chamber-door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you." Here I opened
wide the door:
Darkness there, and nothing more.
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there,
wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared
to dream before;
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness
gave no token,
And the only word there spoken was the whispered
word, "Lenore!"

This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the
word, "Lenore!”
Merely this, and nothing more.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within
me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping, somewhat louder
than before.
"Surely," said I, "surely there is something at my
window-lattice;
Let me see then what thereat is, and this mystery
explore:
Let my heart be still a moment, and this mystery
explore:
'Tis the wind, and nothing more."
Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a
flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately raven of the saintly days
of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute
stopped or stayed he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my
chamber-door,-
Perched upon a bust of Pallas, just above my cham-
ber-door,
Perched and sat, and nothing more.
Then, this ebon bird beguiling my sad fancy into
smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance
it wore,
“Though thy cresť be shorn and shaven, thou,” I
said, “art sure no craven;

Ghastly, grim, and ancient raven, wandering from
the nightly shore.
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night's
Plutonian shore ?"
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore!"
Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear dis-
course so plainly,
Though its answer little meaning, little relevancy
bore;
For we cannot help agreeing, that no living human
being
Ever yet was blest with seeing bird above his cham-
ber-door,
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his
chamber-door,
With such name as “Nevermore !"
But the raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust,
spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he
did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered, not a feather then
he fluttered,
Till I scarcely more than muttered: "Other friends
have flown before:
On the morrow he will leave me, as my hopes have
flown before.”
Then the bird said, "Nevermore!"
Startled at the stillness, broken by reply so aptly
spoken,
“Doubtless," said I, “what it utters is its only stock
and store,

Caught from some unhappy master, whom un-
merciful disaster
Followed fast and followed faster, till his songs one
burden bore,
Till the dirges of his hope that melancholy burden
bore,
Of 'Never-nevermore!'”
But the raven still beguiling all my sad soul into
smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of
bird, and bust, and door.
Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to
linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird
of yore,—
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and
ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking, “Nevermore!"
Thus sat I engaged in guessing, but no syllable
expressing
To the fowl, whose fiery eyes now burned into my
bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease
reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamplight
gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining, with the lamplight
gloating o'er,
She shall press-ah, nevermore.
Then methought the air grew denser, perfumed
from an unseen censer

of Lenore !
Quaff, oh, quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this

Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed
thee here ashore,
Desolate, yet all undaunted, on this desert land
enchanted,
On this home by horror haunted, tell me truly, I
implore,
Is there is there balm in Gilead?_Tell me tell
me, I implore!"
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore!"
“Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—Prophet still, if

By that heaven that bends above us, by that God
we both adore,
Tell this soul, with sorrow laden, if within the
distant Aidenn,

"Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I
shrieked, upstarting,
“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night's

Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul
hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken !-Quit the bust
above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy
form from off my door!”
Quoth the raven, "Nevermore!"
And the raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is
sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas, just above my cham-
ber-door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's
that is dreaming,
And the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his
shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies float-

Shall be lifted-Nevermore!

From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.
Hear the mellow wedding-bells,-
Golden bells!
What a world of happiness their harmony foretells!
Through the balmy air of night,
How they ring out their delight!
From the molten-golden notes,
And all in tune,
What a liquid ditty floats
To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats
On the moon!
Oh, from out the sounding cells,
What a gush of euphony voluminously wells !
How it swells !
How it dwells
On the future! how it tells
Of the rapture that impels
To the swinging and the ringing
Of the bells, bells, bells,-
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells,-
To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells!
Hear the loud alarum bells,
Brazen bells!

What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells !
In the startled ear of night
How they scream out their affright!
Too much horrified to speak,
They can only shriek, shriek,
Out of tune,
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic
fire,
Leaping higher, higher, higher,
With a desperate desire,
And a resolute endeavor,
Now, now to sit, or never,
By the side of the pale-faced moon.
Oh, the bells, bells, bells !
What a tale their terror tells
Of Despair!
How they clang, and clash, and roar!
What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the palpitating air!
Yet the ear, it fully knows,
By the twanging
And the clanging,
How the danger ebbs and flows;
In the jangling
And the wrangling
How the danger sinks and swells,
By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the
bells,
Of the bells,
Of the bells, bells, bells, bells,
Bells, bells, bells,
In the clamor and the clangor of the bells!

Hear the tolling of the bells,
Iron bells!
What a world of solemn thought their monody
compels !
In the silence of the night,
How we shiver with affright
At the melancholy menace of their tone!
For every sound that floats
From the rust within their throats
Is a groan.
And the people,-ah! the people,
They that dwell up in the steeple,
All alone,
And who tolling, tolling, tolling,
In that muffled monotone,
Feel a glory in so rolling
On the human heart a stone.
They are neither man nor woman;
They are neither brute nor human:
They are ghouls:
And their king it is who tolls;
And he rolls, rolls, rolls, rolls,
A pæan from the bells.
And his merry bosom swells
With the pæan of the bells.
And he dances and he yells;
Keeping time, time, time,
In a sort of runic rhyme,
To the paen of the bells,-
Of the bells;
Keeping time, time, time,

FITZ-JAMES AND RODERIC DHU
-SIR WALTER SCOTT.
Fitz-James, King of Scotland, while hunting, becomes separated from
his companions and lost in the depths of the forest. In his efforts to
find his way out, he falls in with Roderic Dhu, who guides the stranger
as far as Coilantogle Ford, and there challenges him to mortal combat.
The chief in silence strode before,
And reached that torrent's sounding shore.
And here his course the chieftain stayed,
Threw down his target and his plaid,
And to the lowland warrior said:
"Bold Saxon! to his promise just,
Vich Alpine has discharged his trust.
This murderous chief, this ruthless man,
This head of a rebellious clan,
Hath led thee safe through watch and ward,
Far past Clan-Alpine's utmost guard.
Now, man to man, and steel to steel,
A chieftain's vengenance thou shalt feel.
See, here all vantageless I stand,
Armed, like thyself, with single brand;

For this is Coilantogle Ford,
And thou must keep thee with thy sword."
The Saxon paused: "I ne'er delayed,
When foeman bade me draw my blade;
Nay more, brave chief, I vowed thy death:
Yet sure thy fair and generous faith,
And my deep debt for life preserved,
A better meed have well deserved:
Can nought but blood our feud atone?
Are there no means?”—“No, stranger, none!
And hear,—to fire thy flagging zeal,-
The Saxon cause rests on thy steel;
For thus spoke fate by prophet bred
Between the living and the dead:
'Who spills the foremost foeman's life,
His party conquers in the strife.'”
“Then, by my word,” the Saxon said,
“The riddle is already read.
Seek yonder brake beneath the cliff ;
There lies Red Murdoch, stark and stiff :
Thus fate has solved her prophecy,
Then yield to fate, and not to me."
Dark lightning flashed from Roderic's eye:-
"Soars thy presumption then so high,
Because a wretched kern ye slew,
Homage to name to Roderic Dhu?
He yields not, he, to man or fate.
Thou add'st but fuel to my hate:
My clansmen's blood demands revenge.-
Not yet prepared? By heaven, I change
My thought, and hold thy valor light

As that of some vain carpet-knight,
Who ill deserved my courteous care,
And whose best boast is but to wear
A braid of his fair lady's hair.”
“I thank thee, Roderic, for the word.
It nerves my heart, it steels my sword:
For I have sworn this braid to stain
In the best blood that warms thy vein.
Now, truce, farewell! and ruth, begone!
Yet think not that by thee alone,
Proud chief, can courtesy be shown.
Though not from copse, or heath, or cairn,
Start at my whistle clansmen stern,
Of this small horn one feeble blast
Would fearful odds against thee cast.
But fear not, -doubt not, which thou wilt:
We try this quarrel hilt to hilt."
Then each at once his falchion drew,
Each on the ground his scabbard threw,
Each looked to sun, and stream, and plain,
As what he ne'er might see again;
Then, foot and point and eye opposed,
In dubious strife they darkly closed.
Ill fared it then with Rhoderic Dhu,
That on the field his targe he threw,
Whose brazen studs and tough bull-hide
Had death so often dashed aside;
For, trained abroad his arms to wield,
Fitz-James' blade was sword and shield.
He practised every pass and ward,
To thrust, to strike, to feint, to guard,
While, less expert, though stronger far,

The Gael maintained unequal war.
Three times in closing strife they stood,
And thrice the Saxon blade drank blood;
No stinted draught, no scanty tide,
The gushing flood the tartans dyed.
Fierce Roderic felt the fatal drain,
And showered his blows like wintry rain;
And, as firm rock or castle roof,
Against the winter shower is proof,
The foe, invulnerable still,
Foiled his wild rage by steady skill,
Till, at advantage ta'en, his brand
Forced Roderic's weapon from his hand;
And, backward borne upon the lea,
Brought the proud chieftain to his knee.
“Now, yield thee, or by Him who made
The world thy heart's blood dyes my blade!”
“Thy threats, thy mercy I defy!
Let recreant yield, who fears to die!"
Like adder darting from his coil,
Like wolf that dashes through the toil,
Like mountain-cat who guards her young,
Full at Fitz-James' throat he sprung;
Received, but recked not of a wound,
And locked his arms his foeman round.-
Now, gallant Saxon, hold thine own!
No maiden's hand is round thee thrown!
That desperate grasp thy frame might feel,
Through bars of brass and triple steel!
They tug, they strain ;-down, down they go,
The Gael above, Fitz-James below.

The chieftain's gripe his throat compressed,
His knee was planted in his breast;
His clotted locks he backward threw,
Across his brow his hand he drew,
From blood and mist to clear his sight,
Then gleamed aloft his dagger bright.
But hate and fury ill supplied
The stream of life's exhausted tide;
And all too late the advantage came,
To turn the odds of deadly game;
For, while the dagger gleamed on high,
Reeled soul and sense, reeled brain and eye.
Down came the blow, but in the heath
The erring blade found bloodless sheath.
The struggling foe may now unclasp
The fainting chief's relaxing grasp:
Unwounded from the dreadful close,
But breathless all, Fitz-James arose.
THE PARTING OF MARMION AND DOUGLAS
SIR WALTER SCOTT.
The Scottish Earl Douglas, in obedience to his sovereign's behest, had
received into his castle the English Lord Marmion, not, however, without
evincing contempt and "cold respect” for his guest.
The train without the castle drew,
And Marmion stopped to bid adieu.
“Though something I might 'plain,” he said,
“Of cold respect to stranger guest,
Sent hither by your king's behest,
While in Tantallon's towers I staid,
Part we in friendship from your land,
And, noble earl, receive my hand."

But Douglas round him drew his cloak,
Folded his arms, and thus he spoke:
"My manors, halls, and bowers shall still
Be open, at my sovereign's will,
To each one whom he lists, howe'er
Unmeet to be the owner's peer.
My castles are my king's alone,
From turret to foundation-stone;
The hand of Douglas is his own,
And never shall in friendly grasp
The hand of such as Marmion clasp."
Burned Marmion's swarthy cheek like fire,
And shook his very frame for ire.
"And this to me!” he said;
"An 'twere not for thy hoary beard,
Such hand as Marmion's had not spared
To cleave the Douglas' head.
And first I tell thee, haughty peer,
He, who does England's message here,
Although the meanest in her State,
May well, proud Angus, be thy mate.
And, Douglas, now I tell thee here,
Even in thy pitch of pride,
Here in thy hold, thy vassals near,
(Nay, never look upon your lord,
And lay your hands upon your sword!)
I tell thee, thou’rt defied !
And if thou saidst I am not peer
To any lord in Scotland here,
Lowland or Highland, far or near,
Lord Angus, thou hast lied !"

On the Earl's cheek the flush of rage
O'ercame the ashen hue of age.
Fierce he broke forth: "And dar'st thou then
To beard the lion in his den,
The Douglas in his hall ?
And hop'st thou hence unscathed to go?
No! by St. Bride of Bothwell, no!
Up drawbridge, grooms! What, warder, ho!
Let the portcullis fall!”
Lord Marmion turned,well was his need,
And dashed the rowels in his steed,
Like arrow through the archway sprung;
The ponderous gate behind him rung;
To pass, there was such scanty room,
The bars, descending, razed his plume.
The steed along the drawbridge flies,
Just as it trembled on the rise;
Nor lighter does the swallow skim
Along the smooth lake's level brim:
And when Lord Marmion reached his band,
He halts, and turns with clenched hand,
A shout of loud defiance pours,
And shakes his gauntlet at the towers.
THE DEATH OF MARMION
-SIR WALTER SCOTT.
The English Lord Marmion had played a brilliant part in the battle
of Flodden Field, in which the English defeated the Scotch.
And soon straight up the hill there rode
Two horsemen, drenched with gore,
And in their arms, a helpless load,
A wounded knight they bore.

His hand still strained the broken brand,
His arms were smeared with blood and sand;
Dragged from among the horses' feet,
With dinted shield and helmet beat,
The falcon-crest and plumage gone,-
Can that be haughty Marmion?
Young Blount his armor did unlace,
And, gazing on his ghastly face,
Said: "By Saint George, he's gone!
The spear-wound has our master sped:
And see the deep cut on his head!
Good-night to Marmion!"
“Unnurtured Blount! Thy brawling cease;
He opes his eyes," said Eustace, "peace!"
When, doffed his casque, he felt free air,
Around 'gan Marmion wildly stare;
"Where's Harry Blount? Fitz Eustace, where?
Linger ye here, ye hearts of hare?
Redeem my pennon!—Charge again!
Cry, ‘Marmion to the rescue!'—Vain!
Last of my race, on battle-plain
That shout shall ne'er be heard again!
Must I bid twice?—Hence, varlets! Fly!
Leave Marmion here alone—to die!"
With fruitless labor Clara bound,
And strove to stanch the gushing wound.
The war, that for a space did fail,
Now, trebly thundering, swelled the gale,
And “Stanley!" was the cry.
A light on Marmion's visage spread,
And fired his glazing eye.
With dying hand, above his head

He shook the fragment of his blade,
And shouted, “Victory!”
"Charge, Chester, charge! On, Stanley, on!"
Were the last words of Marmion.
TIME'S MIDNIGHT VOICE-YOUNG.
Creation sleeps. 'Tis as the general pulse
Of life stood still, and Nature made a pause,
An awful pause, prophetic of her end.
The bell strikes one. We take no note of time,
But from its loss. To give it, then, a tongue,
Is wise in man. As if an angel spoke,
I feel the solemn sound. If heard aright,
It is the knell of my departed hours.
Where are they? With the years beyond the flood.
It is the signal that demands despatch:
How much is to be done! My hopes and fears
Start up alarmed, and o'er life's narrow verge
Look down-on what? A fathomless abyss!
A dread eternity! How surely mine!
And can eternity belong to me,
Poor pensioner on the bounties of an hour?
How poor, how rich, how abject, how august,
How complicate, how wonderful, is man!
How passing wonder He who made him such,
Who centred in our make such strange extremes !
From different natures marvellously mixed,
Connection exquisite of distant worlds!
Distinguished link in being's endless chain!
Midway from nothing to the Deity!
A beam ethereal, sullied, and absorpt!

Dim miniature of greatness absolute!
An heir of glory! A frail child of dust!
Helpless immortal! Insect infinite!
A worm! A god !—I tremble at myself,
And in myself am lost. At home a stranger.
Thought wanders up and down, surprised, aghast,
And wondering at her own; how reason reels!
O what a miracle to man is man,
Triumphantly distressed! What joy, what dread, -
Alternately transported, and alarmed !
What can preserve my life, or what destroy ?
An angel's arm can't snatch me from the grave;
Legions of angels can't confine me there.
Even silent night proclaims my soul immortal.
CAIUS GRACCHUS APPEALS FROM THE

It appears
I am cited here, because I have returned
Without my general's leave, and for the crime
Of having raised the tumult at Fregella.
First, with the first. I have remained my time;
Nay, I have over-served it by the laws,-
The laws which Caius Gracchus dares not break.
But, Censors, let that pass. I will propose
A better question for your satisfaction:
"How have I served my time?" I'll answer that.
“How have I served my time? For mine own gain,
Or that of the Republic ?” What was my office ?
Quæstor. What was its nature? Lucrative,

So lucrative, that all my predecessors
Who went forth poor returned home very rich.
I went forth poor enough,
But have returned still poorer than I went.
Ye citizens of Rome, behold what favor
Your masters show your brethren! I have borne
My country's arms with honor; over-served
My time; returned in poverty that might
Have amassed treasures, and they thus reward
me;
Prefer a charge against me without proof,
Direct or indirect, without a testimony,
Weighty or light, without an argument,
Idle or plausible, without as much
Of feasibility as would suffice
To feed suspicion's phantom. Why is this?
How have I bought this hatred? When my brother,
Tiberius Gracchus, fell beneath their blows,
I called them not assassins. When his friends
Fell sacrifices to their after-vengeance,
I did not style them butchers; did not name them
The proud, perfidious, insolent Patricians.
Ye men of Rome, there is no favor, now,
For justice. Grudgingly her dues are granted.
Your great men boast no more the love of country.
They count their talents; measure their domains;
Enlarge their palaces; dress forth their banquets;
Awake their lyres and timbrels; and with their
floods
Of ripe Falernian drown the little left
Of virtue.-Romans, I would be your tribune.
Fear not, Censors! I would raise no tumult;
This hand's the first to arm against the man

Whoe'er he be, that favors civil discord.
I have no gust for blood, nor for oppression.
I sacrifice to justice and to mercy.
The laws! the laws! Of common right the guard;
The wealth, the happiness, the freedom of
The Nation! Who has hidden them, defaced them,
Sold them, corrupted them from the pure letter?
Why do they guard the rich man's cloak from a
rent,
And tear the poor man's garment from his back?
Why are they, in the proud man's grasp, a sword,
And in the hand of the humble man, a reed?
The laws! The laws! I ask you for the laws,-
Demand them in my country's sacred name!
Still silent? Reckless still of my appeal ?
Romans! I ask the office of your tribune!
ODE ON THE PASSIONS-COLLINS.
When Music, heavenly maid, was young,
While yet in early Greece she sung,
The Passions oft, to hear her shell,
Thronged around her magic cell,
Exulting, trembling, raging, fainting,
Possessed beyond the Muse's painting;
By turns, they felt the glowing mind
Disturbed, delighted, raised, refined,
Till once, 'tis said, when all were fired,
Filled with fury, rapt, inspired,
From the supporting myrtles round
They snatched her instruments of sound;

Would prove his own expressive power.

Amid the chords bewildered laid;
And back recoiled, he knew not why,
Even at the sound himself had made.

In lightnings owned his secret stings;
In one rude clash he struck the lyre,

And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail.
Still would her touch the strain prolong;
And, from the rocks, the woods, the vale,
She called on Echo still through all her song;
And, where her sweetest theme she chose,
A soft responsive voice was heard at every close;
And Hope, enchanted, smiled, and waved her golden

Yet still he kept his wild unaltered mien,
While each strained ball of sight seemed bursting

Poured through the mellow horn her pensive soul:
And, dashing soft, from rocks around,
Bubbling runnels joined the sound;
Through glades and glooms the mingled measure

Or o'er some haunted streams, with fond delay,
Round a holy calm diffusing,
Love of peace and lonely musing,
In hollow murmurs died away.

To some unwearied minstrel dancing;
While, as his flying fingers kissed the strings,

Loose were her tresses seen, her zone unbound;
And he, amid his frolic play,
As if he would the charming air repay,
Shook thousand odors from his dewy wings.

The watchful guards upon him swept;
The grim king marked his bearing high.
“What wouldst thou with thy knife! Reply!”—
“The city from the tyrant free!”—
“The death-cross shall thy guerdon be."
"I am prepared for death, nor pray,"
Haughtily Damon said, “to live;
Enough, if thou one grace wilt give;
For three brief suns the death delay.
A sister's nuptial rites now stay
My promised coming, leagues away.
I boast a friend, whose life for mine,
If I should fail the cross, is thine.”
The tyrant mused, and smiled, and said,
With gloomy craft, "So let it be;
Three days I will vouchsafe to thee.
But, mark: if, when the time be sped,
Thou fail'st, thy surety dies instead.
His life shall buy thine own release;
Thy guilt atoned, my wrath shall cease.”
And Damon sought his friend: "The king
Ordains, my life, the cross upon,
Shall pay the deed I would have done;
Yet grants three days' delay to me,
My sister's marriage-rites to see,
If thou, my Pythias, wilt remain
Hostage till I return again."
One clasp of hands: and Pythias said
No word, but to the tyrant strode,
While Damon went upon his road.
Ere the third sun in heaven was red,

The rite was o'er, the sister wed;
And back, with anxious heart unquailing,
He hastes to keep the pledge unfailing.
Down the great rains unending bore;
Down from the hills the torrents rushed:
In one broad stream, the brooklets gushed
And Damon halts beside the shore.
The bridge was swept the tides before;
And the tumultuous waves in thunder,
Rushed o'er the shattered arch and under.
Frantic, dismayed, he takes his stand;
Dismayed, he strays and shouts around:
His voice awakes no answering sound:
No boat will leave the sheltering strand,
To bear him to the wished-for land;
No boatman will Death's pilot be;
The wild stream gathers to a sea.
Prostrate a while he raves, he weeps;
Then raised his arms to Jove, and cried:
"Stay thou, oh, stay the maddening tide!
Midway, behold, the swift sun sweeps
And ere he sink adown the deeps,
If I should fail, his beams will see
My friend's last anguish, slain for me!"
Fierce runs the stream, more broad it flows;
And wave on wave succeeds, and dies:
And hour on hour, remorseless, flies.
Despair at last to daring grows:
Amid the flood his form he throws,
With vigorous arm the roaring waves
Cleaves, and a God that pities saves.

Lo! reddening in the evening sun,
From far, the domes of Syracuse!

His leal and trusty herdsman he,-
And to the master bends his knee.
“Back!
—Thou canst aid thy friend no more:
The niggard time already's flown;
His life is forfeit: save thine own!
Hour after hour in hope he bore,
Nor might his soul its faith give o'er;

Vain life, since it cannot requite him!
But death can yet with me unite him.

How friend to friend can faith forsake;
But, from the double-death, shall know
That truth and love yet live below."

-TRANSLATION FROM SCHILLER.
Heavy and solemn,
A cloudy column,
Through the green plain they marching came,
Measureless spread, like a table dread,
For the wild grim dice of the iron game.
Looks are bent on the shaking ground,
Hearts beat loud with a knelling sound;
Swift by the breasts that must bear the brunt,
Gallops the major along the front,-
"Halt!"
And fettered they stand at the stark command,
And the warriors, silent, halt.
Proud in the blush of morning glowing,
What on the hill-top shines in flowing?
"See you the foeman's banners waving ?”
"We see the foeman's banners waving !"

“God be with ye, children and wife!"
Hark to the music,—the trump and the fife,-
How they ring through the ranks, which they rouse
to the strife!
Thrilling they sound, with their glorious tone;
Thrilling they go through the marrow and bone.
Brothers, God grant, when this life is o'er,
In the life to come that we meet once more!*
See the smoke how the lightning is cleaving asund-
er!
Hark! the guns, peal on peal, how they boom in
their thunder!
From host to host, with kindling sound, ,
The shouting signal circles round.
Ay, shout it forth to life or death:
Freer already breathes the breath.
The war is waging, slaughter raging,
And heavy through the reeking pall
The iron death-dice fall.
Nearer they close, foes upon foes;
“Ready!”—from square to square it goes.
They kneel as one man, from flank to flank,
And the fire comes sharp from the foremost rank;
Many a soldier to earth is sent,
Many a gap by the balls is rent;
O'er the corse before springs the hinder man,
That the line may not fail to the fearless van;
To the right, to the left, and around and around,
Death whirls in its dance on the bloody ground.
God's sunlight is quenched in the fiery fight
Over the host falls a brooding night.
* Lines in italics may be sung.

Brothers, God grant, when this life is o'er,
In the life to come that we meet once more!
The dead men lie bathed in the weltering blood;
And the living are blent in the slippery flood;
And the feet, as they reeling and sliding go,
Stumble still on the corses that sleep below.
“What! Francis!”—“Give Charlotte my last fare-
well.”
As the dying man murmurs, the thunders swell.
"I'll give-0 God! are their guns so near?
Ho! comrades !-Yon volley !Look sharp to the
rear!-
I'll give thy Charlotte thy last farewell.
Sleep soft; where death thickest descendeth in rain,
The friend thou forsakest thy side may regain."
Hitherward, thitherward reels the fight;
Dark and more darkly day glooms into night.
Brothers, God grant, when this life is o'er,
In the life to come that we meet once more!
Hark to the hoofs that galloping go!
The adjutants flying,
The horseman press hard on the panting foe,
Their thunder booms in dying-
Victory!
Terror has seized on the dastards all;
And their colors fall.
Victory!
Closed is the brunt of the glorious fight;
And the day, like a conqueror, bursts on the night.
Trumpet and fife swelling choral along,
The triumph already sweeps marching in song.

ACHILLES TO THE ENVOYS OF AGAMEMNON
-COWPER'S HOMER.
Agamemnon had sent envoys to Achilles to sue for a reconciliation.
I must with plainness speak my fixed resolve;
For I abhor the man,—not more the gates
Of hell itself !-whose words belie his heart.
So shall not mine! My judgment undisguised
Is this: that neither Agamemnon me
Nor all the Greeks shall move. For ceaseless toil
Wins here no thanks: one recompense awaits
The sedentary and the most alert.
The brave and base in equal honor stand,
And drones and heroes fall unwept alike.
I, after all my labors, who exposed
My life continual in the field, have earned
No very sumptuous prize. As the poor bird
Gives to her unfledged brood a morsel gained
After long search, though wanting it herself,
So I have worn out many sleepless nights,
And waded deep through many a bloody day
In battle for their wives. I have destroyed
Twelve cities with my fleet; and twelve save one,
On foot contending in the fields of Troy.
From all these cities precious spoil I took
Abundant, and to Agamemnon's hand
Gave all the treasure. He within his ships
Abode the while, and, having all received,
Little distributed, and much retained.

He gave, however, to the kings and chiefs
A portion; and they keep it. Me alone,
Of all the Grecian host, hath he despoiled.
My bride, my soul's delight, is in his hands.-
Tell him my reply;
And tell it him aloud, that other Greeks
May indignation feel like me, if, armed
Always in impudence, he seek to wrong
Them also. Let him not henceforth presume,
Canine and hard in aspect though he be,
To look me in the face. I will not share
His counsels, neither will I aid his works.
Let it suffice him, that he wronged me once,
Received me once: hence forth his glozing arts
Are lost on me. But, let him rot in peace,
Crazed as he is, and, by the stroke of Jove,
Infatuate! I detest his gifts; and him
So honor as the thing which most I scorn.
And would he give me twenty times the worth
Of this his offer,—all the treasured heaps
Which he possesses, or shall yet possess,
All that Orchomenos within her walls,
And all that opulent Egyptian Thebes
Receives,—the city with a hundred gates,
Whence twenty thousand chariots rush to war,
And would he give me riches as the sands,
And as the dust of earth,—no gifts from him
Should soothe me, till my soul were first avenged
For all the offensive license of his tongue.
I will not wed the daughter of your chief,-
Of Agamemnon. Could she vie in charms
With golden Venus,—had she all the skill
Of blue-eyed Pallas,-even so endowed,

HECTOR'S ATTACK ON THE GRECIAN FLEET
- COWPER'S HOMER.
So hung the war in balance,
Till Jove himself superior fame, at length,
To Priameian Hector gave, who sprang
First through the wall. In lofty sounds that reached
Their utmost ranks, he called on all his host:
“Now press them! Now, ye Trojans, steed-re-
nowned,
Rush on! Break through the Grecian rampart! Hurl
At once devouring flames into the fleet!"
Such was his exhortation. They, his voice
All hearing, with close-ordered ranks, direct
Bore on the barrier, and up-swarming showed
On the high battlement their glittering spears.
But Hector seized a stone, of ample base,
But tapering to a point; before the gate
It stood. No two men, mightiest of a land
(Such men as now are mighty), could with ease
Have heaved it from the earth up to a wain;
He swung it easily alone,—so light
The son of Saturn made it in his hand.
As in one hand with ease the shepherd bears
A ram's fleece home, nor toils beneath the weight,
So Hector, right toward the planks of those
Majestic folding-gates, close-jointed, firm
And solid, bore the stone. Two bars within
Their corresponding force combined transverse
Tn guard them, and one bolt secured the bars.

He stood fast by them, parting wide his feet
For 'vantage sake, and smote them in the midst.
He burst both hinges; inward fell the rock
Ponderous, and the portals roared; the bars
Endured not, and the planks, riven by the force
Of that huge mass, flew scattered on all sides.
In leaped the godlike hero at the breach,
Gloomy as night in aspect, but in arms
All-dazzling, and he grasped two quivering spears.
Him entering with a leap the gates no force
Whate'er of opposition had repressed,
Save the gods alone. Fire filled his eyes.
Turning, he bade the multitude without
Ascend the rampart. They his voice obeyed:
Part climbed the wall, part poured into the gate;
The Grecians to their hollow galleys flew,
Scattered; and tumult infinite arose.
CATO ON THE SOUL'S IMMORTALITY
-ADDISON.
The poet represents Cato as a philosopher debating with himself
whether he should follow the guidance of Plato, whose treatise he is
holding in his hand, or whether he should, after the fashion of the then
pagan world, end his "weariness" with the sword.
It must be so! Plato, thou reasonest well:
Else whence this fond desire, this pleasing hope,
This longing after immortality ?
Or whence this secret dread, and inward horror
Of falling into naught? Why shrinks the soul
Back on herself, and shudders at destruction ?
'Tis the divinity that stirs within us;
'Tis heaven itself that points out a hereafter,
And intimates eternity to man.-

Eternity! thou pleasing, dreadful thought!
Through what variety of untried being,
Through what new forms and changes must we
pass?
The wide, the unbounded prospect lies before me;
But shadows, clouds, and darkness rest upon it.
Here will I hold :-If there's a Power above,-
And that there is, all nature cries aloud
Through all her works,-He must delight in virtue;
And that which He delights in must be happy.
But when? or how? This world was made for
Caesar.
I'm weary of conjectures; this must end 'em!
(Taking up the sword.)
Thus am I doubly armed: my life and death,
My bane and antidote, are both before me.
This in a moment brings me to an end;
But this assures me I shall never die.
The soul, secure in her existence, smiles
At the drawn dagger, and defies its point.
The stars shall fade away, the sun himself
Grow dim with age, and nature sink in years,—
Thou still shalt flourish in eternal youth,
Unhurt amidst the war of elements,
The wreck of matter and the crush of worlds.

Pass sentence on me, if you will: from kings,
Lo, I appeal to time! Be just, my liege.
I found your kingdom rent with heresies,
And bristling with rebellion ;-lawless nobles
And breadless serfs;—England fomenting discord;
Austria, her clutch on your dominion; Spain
Forging the prodigal gold of either Ind
To armed thunderbolts. The arts lay dead;
Trade rotted in your marts; your armies mutinous;
Your treasury bankrupt. Would you now revoke
Your trust, so be it! and I leave you sole,
Supremest monarch of the mightiest realm,
From Ganges to the icebergs. Look without,-
No foe not humbled! Look within—the arts
Quit for our schools their old Hesperides,
The golden Italy, while throughout the veins
Of your vast empire flows in strengthening tides
Trade, the calm health of nations! Sire, I know
That men have called me cruel. I am not:
I am just. I found France rent asunder,
The rich men despots, and the poor banditti;
Sloth in the mart and schism within the temple;
Brawls festering to rebellion; and weak laws
Rotting away with rust in antique sheaths.
I have re-created France; and, from the ashes
Of the old feudal and decrepit carcass,
Civilization, on her luminous wings,
Soars, phoenix-like, to Jove. What was my art?
Genius, some say ;—some fortune;—witchcraft,
some.
Not so ;—my art was justice.

WILLIAM TELL ON SWITZERLAND
-KNOWLES.
Once Switzerland was free. With what a pride
I used to walk these hills, look up to heaven,
And bless God that it was so! It was free
From end to end, from cliff to lake 'twas free;-
Free as our torrents are, that leap our rocks
And plough our valleys without asking leave;
Or as our peaks, that wear their caps of snow
In very presence of the regal sun.
How happy was I in it then! I loved
Its very storms. Ay, often have I sat
In my boat at night, when midway o'er the lake,
The stars went out and down the mountain gorge
The wind came roaring, I have sat and eyed
The thunder breaking from his cloud, and smiled
To see him shake his lightnings o'er my head,
And think I had no master save his own.-
You know the jutting cliff, round which a track
Up thither winds, whose base is but the brow
To such another one, with scanty room
For two a-breast to pass ? O’ertaken there
By the mountain blast, I've laid me flat along;
And while gust followed gust more furiously,
As if to sweep me o'er the horrid brink,
And I have thought of other lands, whose storms
Are summer flaws to those of mine, and just
Have wished me there;—the thought that mine was
free
Has checked that wish, and I have raised my head,
And cried in thraldom to that furious wind:
Blow on! This is the land of liberty!

To show they still are free! Methinks I hear
A spirit in your echoes answer me,
And bid your tenant welcome to his home
Again !-0 sacred forms, how proud you look!
How high you lift your heads into the sky;
How huge you are! How mighty, and how free!
Ye are the things that tower, that shine, whose

Makes glad, whose frown is terrible, whose forms,
Robed or unrobed, do all the impress wear
Of awe divine. Ye guards of liberty,
I'm with you once again! I call to you
With all my voice! I hold my hands to you,
To show they still are free! I rush to you
As though I could embrace you !
Scaling yonder peak,
I saw an eagle wheeling near its brow
O'er the abyss.-His broad-expanded wings
Lay calm and motionless upon the air,
As if he floated there without their aid,
By the sole act of his unlorded will,
That buoyed him proudly up. Instinctively
I bent my bow; yet kept he rounding still
His airy circle, as in the delight
Of measuring the ample range beneath
And round about; absorbed, he heeded not
The death that threatened him. I could not shoot.
'Twas liberty !-I turned my bow aside,
And let him soar away.

COLLONA TO THE KING_SHEIL.
The favor that I ask is one, my liege,
That princes often find it hard to grant.
'Tis simply this: that you will hear the truth.
I see your courtiers here do stand amazed:
Of them I first would speak. There is not one
Of this wide troop of glittering parasites,
That circle you, as priests surround their god,
With sycophantic incense, but in soul
Is your base foe. These smilers here, my liege,
Whose dimples seem a sort of honey-comb,
Filled and o’erflowing with their suavity,
These soft, melodious flatterers, my liege,
That flourish on the flexibility
Of their soft countenances,—are the vermin
That haunt a prince's ear with the false buzz
Of villainous assentation. These are they,
Who from your mind have flouted every thought
Of the great weal of the people. These are they,
Who from your ears have shut the public cry.-
"Who dares complain of you ?" All dare com-
plain
Behind you; I, before you! Do not think,
Because you load your people with the weight
Of camels, they possess the camel's patience.
A deep groan labors in the nation's heart:
The very calm and stillness of the day
Gives augury of the earthquake. All without
Is as the marble smooth; and all within
Is rotten as the carcass it contains.
Though ruin knock not at the palace gate,
Yet will the palace gate unfold itself
To ruin's felt-shod tread.

Which the four quarters of the rifled world

Doth vanish with the shifter's magic hand,

To take their share with me. Ay, cluster there!
Cling to your master, judges, Romans, slaves !

You have my answer. Let my actions speak!

The nations round us bear a foreign yoke;
For they have yielded to the conqueror.
Nay, e'en within our frontiers may be found
Some that owe villein service to a lord,
A race of bonded serfs from sire to son.
But we, the genuine race of ancient Swiss,
Have kept our freedom, from the first till now.
Never to princes have we bowed the knee.
What said our fathers when the Emperor
Pronounced a judgment in the Abbey's favor,
Awarding lands beyond his jurisdiction?
What was their answer? This: “The grant is void;
No Emperor can bestow what is our own;
And if the Empire shall deny us justice,
We can, within our mountains right ourselves."
Thus spake our fathers; and, shall we endure
The shame and infamy of this new yoke;
And from the vassal brook what never king
Dared, in the fulness of his power, attempt?
This soil we have created for ourselves,
By the hard labor of our hands; we've changed
The giant forest, that was erst the haunt
Of savage bears, into a home for man;
Blasted the solid rock; o'er the abyss
Thrown the firm bridge for the way-faring man.
By the possession of a thousand years,
The soil is ours. And, shall an alien lord,
Himself a vassal, dare to venture here,
On our own hearth insult us, and attempt
To forge the chains of bondage for our hands,
And do us shame on our own proper soil?
Is there no help against such wrong as this?
Yet! there's a limit to the despot's power.

And that we hover on the verge of death.

And knows to steer with more than common skill.
How if we should avail ourselves of him,

Addressed me thus: “If thou wilt undertake
To bring us through this tempest safely, Tell,
I might consent to free thee from thy bonds."
I answered: “Yes, my lord, with God's assistance,
I'll see what can be done, and help us heaven!”

In whose quick eye you saw the subtle spirit,
Which suited you, and tempted it? He took
Your hint, and followed you to Mantua
Without his father's knowledge, his old father,

Man could not rob him of, and heaven would spare,
Blessed him one night, ere he lay down to sleep,
And, waking in the morning, found him gone.-

Of whom could read, write, speak, command a

Or rule a horse, with me. You gave me all,-

But you did find a use for me, and made
A slave, a profligate, a pander, of me.

I charge you keep your seat!-
Ten thousand ducats?
What, Duke! Is such your offer? Give me, Duke,
The eyes that looked upon my father's face,
The hands that helped my father to his wish,
The feet that flew to do my father's will,
The heart that bounded at my father's voice,-
And say that Mantua were built of ducats,
And I could be its Duke at cost of these,
I would not give them for it. Mark me, Duke!
I saw a new-made grave in Mantua,
And on the head-stone read my father's name.
To seek me, doubtless, hither he had come,-
To seek the child that had deserted him,-
And died here, ere he found me.
Heaven can tell how far he wandered else!
Upon that grave I knelt an altered man,
And, rising thence, I fled from Mantua; nor had
returned,
But tyrant hunger drove me back again,
To thee—to thee!—my body to relieve,
At cost of my dear soul. I have done thy work ;-
Do mine, and sign me that confession straight!
I'm in thy power, and I'll have thee in mine!
There is the dial, and the sun shines on it,-
The shadow on the very point of twelve!
My case is desperate. Your signature
Of vital moment is unto my peace.
My eye is on the dial. Pass the shadow
The point of noon, the breadth of but a hair,
As can my eye discern, and that unsigned,
The steel is in thy heart !-I speak no more!

WALLENSTEIN'S SOLILOQUY
--SCHILLER.
Is it possible?
Is't so? I can no longer what I would?
No longer draw back at my liking? I
Must do the deed because I thought of it,
And fed this heart here with a dream? Because
I did not scowl temptation from my presence,
Dallied with thoughts of possible fulfillment,
Commenced no movement, left all time uncertain,
And only kept the road, the access, open?
I but amused myself with thinking of it.
The free-will tempted me, the power to do
Or not to do it. Was it criminal
To make the fancy minister to hope,
To fill the mind with pretty toys of air,
And clutch fantastic sceptres moving toward me?
Was not the will kept free? Beheld I not
The road of duty close beside me,-but
One little step, and once more I was in it?
Where am I? Whither have I been transported ?
No road, no track behind me, but a wall,
Impenetrable, insurmountable,
Rises obedient to the spells I muttered,
And meant not,—my own doings tower behind me.
What is thy enterprise? thy aim ? thy object ?
Hast honestly confessed it to thyself?
Power seated on a quiet throne thou 'dst shake,
Power on an ancient consecrated throne,
Strong in possession, founded in all custom,
Power by a thousand tough and stringy roots,
Fixed to the people's pious nursery-faith.
This, this will be no strife of strength with strength.

Whom I can look on, fixing eye to eye,
Who, full himself of courage, kindles courage
In me, too. 'Tis a foe invisible
The which I fear,-a fearful enemy,
Which in the human heart opposes me,
By its coward fear alone made fearful to me.
Not that, which full of life, instinct with power,
Makes known its present being,—that is not
The true, the perilously formidable.
O no! It is the common, the quite common,
The thing of an eternal yesterday.

For of the wholly common is man made,
And custom is his nurse. Woe, then, to them
Who lay irreverent hands upon his old

From his forefathers! For time consecrates;

Of the unsteady planets. O! 'tis well

Veiled in thick darkness, brings for us?
This anguish will be wearied down, I know:
What pang is permanent with man? From the

He learns to wean himself; for the strong hours
Conquer him.—Yet I feel what I have lost
In him. The bloom is vanished from my life.
For oh! He stood beside me, like my youth-
Transformed for me the real to a dream,
Clothing the palpable and the familiar
With golden exhalations of the dawn.
Whatever fortunes wait my future toils,
The beautiful is vanished, and returns not.
PARRHASIUS AND THE CAPTIVE
-WILLIS.
"Parrhasius, a painter of Athens, among those Olynthian captives
Philip of Macedon brought home to sell, bought one very old man;
and
when he had him at his house, put him to death with extreme torture and
torment, the better by his example, to express the pains and passions of
his “Prometheus," whom he was then about to paint.
--Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy.
There stood an unsold captive in the mart,
A gray-haired and majestical old man,
Chained to a pillar. It was almost night,
And the last seller from his place had gone,
And not a sound was heard but of a dog,
Crunching beneath the stall a refuse bone,
Or the dull echo from the pavement rung,
As the faint captive changed his weary feet.

He had stood there since morning, and had borne
From every eye in Athens the cold gaze
Of curious scorn. The Jew had taunted him
For an Olynthian slave. The buyer came
And roughly struck his palm upon his breast,
And touched his unhealed wounds, and with a sneer
Passed on; and when, with weariness o'erspent,
He bowed his head in a forgetful sleep,
The inhuman soldier smote him, and, with threats
Of torture to his children, summoned back
The ebbing blood into his pallid face.-
'Twas evening, and the half-descended sun
Tipped with a golden fire the many domes
Of Athens, and a yellow atmosphere
Lay rich and dusky in the shaded street
Through which the captive gazed. He had borne up
With a stout heart that long and weary day,
Haughtily patient of his many wrongs;
But now he was alone, and from his nerves
The needless strength departed, and he leaned
Prone on his massy chain, and let his thoughts
Throng on him as they would.
Unmarked of him,
Parrhasius at the nearest pillar stood,
Gazing upon his grief. The Athenian's cheek
Flushed as he measured with a painter's eye
The moving picture. The abandoned limbs,
Stained with the oozing blood, were laced with veins
Swollen to purple fullness; the gray hair,
Thin and disordered, hung about his eyes;
And as a thought of wilder bitterness

And the fast workings of his bloodless face
Told what a tooth of fire was at his heart.

The golden light into the painter's room
Streamed richly, and the hidden colors stole
From the dark pictures radiantly forth,
And in the soft and dewy atmosphere
Like forms and landscapes magical they lay.
The walls were hung with armor, and about
In the dim corners stood the sculptured forms
Of Cythera, and Dian, and stern Jove;
And from the casement soberly away
Fell the grotesque long shadows, full and true,
And, like a vail of filmy mellowness,
The line-specks floated in the twilight air.
Parrhasius stood, gazing forgetfully
Upon his canvas. There Prometheus lay,
Chained to the cold rocks of Mount Caucasus,
The vulture at his vitals, and the links
Of the lame Lemnian festering in his flesh.
And as the painter's mind felt through the dim,
Rapt mystery, and plucked the shadows forth
With its far-reaching fancy, and with form
And color clad them, his fine, earnest eye,
Flashed with a passionate fire, and the thick curl
Of his thin nostril, and his quivering lip,
Were like the winged god's breathing from his flight.

Now-bend him to the rack!
Press down the poisoned links into his flesh!
And tear agape that healing wound afresh!
“So let him writhe! How long
Will he live thus? Quick, my good pencil, now !
What a fine agony works upon his brow!
Ha! gray-haired, and so strong!
How fearfully he stifles that short moan!
Gods! if I could but paint a dying groan!-
“ 'Pity' thee! So I do!
I pity the dumb victim at the altar,
But does the robed priest for his pity falter ?
I'd rack thee, though I knew
A thousand lives were perishing in thine:
What were ten thousand to a fame like mine?
“ 'Hereafter! Ay-hereafter!
A whip to keep a coward to his track!
What gave death ever from his kingdom back
To check the skeptic's laughter?
Come from the grave to-morrow with that story,
And I may take some softer path to glory.

Even as the flowers and we shall breathe away
Our life upon the chance wind, even as they.

How like a mounting devil in the heart
Rules the unreined ambition! Let it once
But play the monarch, and its haughty brow
Glows with a beauty that bewilders thought
And unthrones peace forever. Putting on
The very pomp of Lucifer, it turns
The heart to ashes, and with not a spring
Left in the bosom for the spirit's lip,
We look upon our splendor and forget
The thirst of which we perish. Yet hath life
Many a false idol. There are hopes
Promising well; and love touched dreams for some;
And passions, many a wild one; and fair schemes
For gold and pleasure—yet will only this
Balk not the soul; ambition only gives,
Even of bitterness, a beaker full.
Friendship is but a slow-awaking dream,
Troubled at best; love is a lamp unseen,
Burning to waste, or, if its light is found,
Nursed for an idle hour, then idly broken;
Gain is a groveling care, and folly tires,
And quiet is a hunger never fed;
And from love's very bosom, and from gain,
Or folly, or a friend, or from repose,-
From all but keen ambition, will the soul
Snatch the first moment of forgetfulness
To wander like a restless child away.

SOLILOQUY OF ARNOLD-JONES.
General Arnold, in command of the American forces at West Point,
had entered into a secret correspondence with Sir Henry Clinton, of
which Colonel Andre was bearer, and agreed to so station his troops that
the British could force them to surrender with little resistance. The
traitor's life of dissipation and extravagance had driven him to the
quest of gold, and he was willing to sell his country for it.
The plan is fixed: I fluctuate no more
Betwixt despair and hope. As leaves the shore
The hardy mariner, though adverse fate
May merge his bark, or cast him desolate
Upon a savage coast, so, wrought at last
Up to a frenzied purpose, I have passed
The Rubicon. Farewell my old renown!
Here I breathe mildew on my warrior crown;
Here honor parts from me, and base deceit
Steps to the usurper's throne. I cannot meet
The withering censure of the rebel band,
And, therefore, to the strong I yield this heart and
hand.

mysterious death of his beloved father, has filled the sensitive soul of

brevity of her mourning, and how loath he is to think of what followed.

His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! O God!

Seem to me all the uses of this world!
Fie on't! O fie! 'Tis an unweeded garden,

Possess it merely. That it should come to this!

Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!

By what it fed on:—and yet, within a month,-

Polonius, Lord Chamberlain to the king in “Hamlet," imparts a few

& protracted stay in France.
These few precepts in thy memory
Look thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar:
The friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
Of each new-hatched, unfledged comrade. Beware
Of entrance to a quarrel; but, being in,
Bear 't, that th' opposed may beware of thee.
Give every man thine ear, but few thy voice:
Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
But not expressed in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
For the apparel oft proclaims the man;
And they in France, of the best rank and station,
Are most select and generous, chief in that.
Neither a borrower,.nor a lender be;
For loan oft loses both itself and friend,

Bring with thee airs from heaven, or blasts from

Be thy intents wicked, or charitable;
Thou com'st in such a questionable shape,
That I will speak to thee. I'll call thee Hamlet,
King, Father, Royal Dane: O! answer me:
Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell,
Why thy canoniz'd bones, hearsed in death,
Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
Wherein we saw thee quietly in-urn'd,
Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
That thou, dead corse again in complete steel
Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
Making night hideous; and we, fools of nature,

With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?

HAMLET SWEARS TO HEED HIS
FATHER'S GHOST
ID., ACT I, SCENE 5.
The ghost has just commanded Hamlet to avenge his father's murder,
O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
And shall I couple hell? O fie! Hold, hold, my
heart;
And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
Yea, from the table of my memory
I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
That youth and observation copied there;
And thy commandment all alone shall live
Within the book and volume of my brain,
Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
O most pernicious woman!
O villain, villain, smiling, damnéd villain!
My tables,—meet it is I set it down,
That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
[Writing
So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me!'
I have sworn 't.
HAMLET BEWAILS HIS IRRESOLUTION
ID., ACT II, SCENE 2.
Thanks to the intelligence received from his father's ghost, the young
Dane more than suspects his uncle of his father's murder, but lacks
courage to avenge the crime. Besides, the story told by the ghost may
be false, hence Hamlet craves evidence more certain of his uncle's guilt.

O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
Is it not monstrous, that this player here,
But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
Could force his soul so to his own conceit,
That from her working all his visage wann'd;
Tears in his eyes, distraction in 's aspect,
A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
With forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!
For Hecuba!
What's Hecuba to him or he to Hecuba,
That he should weep for her? What would he do,
Had he the motive and the cue for passion,
That I have? He would drown the stage with tears,
And cleave the general ear with horrid speech;
Make mad the guilty, and appall the free,
Confound the ignorant, and amaze, indeed,
The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
Upon whose property and most dear life,
A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward ?
Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across ?
Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the
throat
As deep as to the lungs? Who does me this? Ha!
'Swounds! I should take it; for it cannot be
But I am pigeon-liver'd, and lack gall
To make oppression bitter, or ere this
I should have fatted all the region kites
With this slave's offal. Bloody, bawdy villain!
Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!

O, vengeance!
Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
Must, like a trull, unpack my heart with words,
And fall a cursing, like a very drab,
A scullion!
Fie upon 't! foh! About, my brain !—I've heard,
That guilty creatures, sitting at a play,
Have by the very cunning of the scene
Been struck so to the soul, that presently
They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
Play something like the murder of my father
Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
I know my course. The spirit, that I have seen,
May be the devil; and the devil hath power
T'assume a pleasing shape; yea, and, perhaps,
Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
As he is very potent with such spirits,
Abuses me to damn me. I'll have grounds
More relative than this: the play's the thing,
Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
HAMLET ON IMMORTALITY

The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them ?—To die,—to sleep,-
No more;-and, by a sleep, to say we end
The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to,-'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die,—to sleep,
To sleep, perchance to dream !ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life.
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
Th’ oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of th' unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,-
The undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
No traveller returns,-puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment,
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.

HAMLET'S ADVICE TO HIS PLAYERS
-ID., ACT III, SCENE 2.
Hamlet has engaged players to play something like the murder of
his father before his uncle, whose looks he will observe.
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it
to you, trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth
it, as many of your players do, I had as lief the
town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
too much with your hand, thus;—but use all gently;
for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and
beget a temperance that may give it smoothness,
0, it offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings; who,
for the most part, are capable of nothing but in-
explicable dumb-shows and noise. I would have such
a fellow whipped for o'er-doing Termagant; it out-
herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discre-
tion be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
word to the action, with this special observance, that
you o'erstep not the modesty of nature; for any
thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing,
whose end, both at the first and now, was and is,
to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to show
virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and
the very age and body of the time his form and
pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off,
though it make the unskillful laugh, cannot but make
the judicious grieve; the censure of which one must,
in your allowance, o'erweigh a whole theatre of
others. O, there be players, that I have seen play,-

and heard others praise, and that highly,—not to
speak it profanely, that, neither having the accent

HAMLET TO HORATIO
-ID., ACT III, SCENE 2.
Horatio is Hamlet's bosom friend and confidant. This beautiful
speech evinces Hamlet's sound philosophy.
Nay, do not think I flatter;
For what advancement may I hope from thee,
That no revenue hast, but thy good spirits,
To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be
flatter'd?
No; let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee,
Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice,
And could of men distinguish, her election
Hath seal'd thee for herself: for thou hast been
As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing;
A man, that fortune's buffets and rewards
Hath ta'en with equal thanks: and bless'd are those,
Whose blood and judgment are so well co-mingled,
That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
As I do thee. Something too much of this.-
There is a play to-night before the king:

One scene of it comes near the circumstance,
Which I have told thee, of my father's death:
I prithee, when thou seest that act a-foot,
Even with the very comment of thy soul
Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
It is a damnéd ghost that we have seen,
And my imaginations are as foul
As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
And, after, we will both our judgments join
In censure of his seeming.
THE KING'S DESPAIR

The king is Hamlet's uncle, the same that slew Hamlet's father to
marry Hamlet's mother.
O! my offense is rank, it smells to heaven;
It hath the primal eldest curse upon 't, -
A brother's murder !--Pray can I not,
Though inclination be as sharp as will:
My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
And, like a man to double business bound,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
And both neglect. What if this curséd hand
Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens,
To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy,
But to confront the visage of offense?
And what's in prayer, but this two-fold force,-
To be forestalled, ere we come to fall,
Or pardon'd, being down? Then, I'll look up:
My fault is past.—But, O! what form of prayer

Can serve my turn? Forgive me my foul murder?
That cannot be, since I am still possess'd
Of those effects for which I did the murder,-
My crown, mine own ambition, and my queen.
May one be pardon'd, and retain th' offense?
In the corrupted currents of this world,
Offense's gilded hand may shove by justice,
And oft 'tis seen, the wicked prize itself
Buys out the law; but 'tis not so above:
There is no shuffling, there the action lies
In his true nature; and we ourselves compellid,
Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
To give in evidence.—What then? what rests?
Try what repentance can: what can it not?
Yet what can it, when one can not repent?
O wretched state! O bosom, black as death!
O liméd soul, that struggling to be free
Art more engaged! Help, angels! make assay:
Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart, with strings of

Be soft as sinews of the new-born babe!

A combination and a form, indeed,
Where every god did seem to set his seal,
To give the world assurance of man:
This was your husband. Look you now, what follows.
Here is your husband: like a mildew'd ear,
Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes ?
You cannot call it love; for, at your age,
The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
And waits upon the judgment; and what judgment
Would stoop from this to this? Sense, sure, you
have,
Else could you not have motion; but, sure, that sense
Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrallid,
But it reserv'd some quantity of choice,
To serve in such a difference. What devil was't,
That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
Ears without hands or eyes, 'smelling sans all,
Or but a sickly part of one true sense
Could not so mope.
O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame,
When the compulsive ardor gives the charge,
Since frost itself as actively doth burn,
And reason panders will.

And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
If his chief good and market of his time,
Be but to sleep and feed? A beast: no more.

Looking before and after, gave us not
That capability and godlike reason,
To fust in us unus'd. Now, whether it be
Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
Of thinking too precisely on th' event,—
A thought, which, quarter'd, hath but one part

And ever three parts coward,-I do not know
Why yet I live to say, "This thing's to do,"
Sith I have cause, and will, and strength, and means,
To do't. Example, gross as earth, exhort me:
Witness this army, of such mass and charge,
Led by a delicate and tender prince,
Whose spirit, with divine ambition puff'd,
Makes mouths at the invisible event;
Exposing what is mortal and unsure
To all that fortune, death, and danger dare,
Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great,
Is not to stir without great argument,
But greatly to find quarrel in a straw,
When honor's at the stake. How stand I, then,

Strong both against the deed: then, as his host,
Who should against his murderer shut the door,
Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan

Accoutred as I was, I plunged in,
And bade him follow: so, indeed, he did.
The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside-
And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
But ere we could arrive the point propos’d,

A wretched creature, and must bend his body,
If Cæsar carelessly but nod on him.

And, when the fit was on him, I did mark
How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
His coward lips did from their color fly;
And that same eye, whose bend doth awe the world,
Did lose his lustre. I did hear him groan;

Mark him, and write his speeches in their books,
Alas! it cried, "Give me some drink, Titinius,"
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me,

So get the start of the majestic world,
And bear the palm alone. [Shout. Flourish.

That could be moved to smile at any thing.

Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,

Casca. I can as well be hanged as tell the man-
ner of it: it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I
saw Mark Antony offer him a crown;—yet 'twas
not a crown neither, 'twas one of these coronets;
and, as I told you, he put it by once: but, for all
that, to my thinking, he would fain have had it.
Then he offered it to him again; then he put it by
again: but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay
his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-
caps and uttered such a deal of stinking breath
because Caesar refused the crown that it had almost
choked Caesar; for he swooned and fell down at

it: and for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for
fear of opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
Cassius. But, soft, I pray you: what, did
Caesar swoon?
Casca. He fell down in the market-place, and
foamed at mouth, and was speechless.
Brutus. 'Tis very like: he hath the falling
sickness.
Cassius. No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
Casca. I know not what you mean by that; but,
I am sure, Caesar fell down. If the tagrag people
did not clap him and hiss him, according as he
pleased and displeased them, as they use to do the
players in the theatre, I am no true man.
Brutus. What said he when he came unto him-
self?
Casca. Marry, before he fell down, when he
perceived the common herd was glad he refused the
crown, he plucked me ope his doublet and offered
them his throat to cut. An I had been a man of
any occupation, if I would not have taken him at a
word, I would I might go to hell among the rogues.
And so he fell. When he came to himself again, he
said, if he had done or said any thing amiss, he
desired their worships to think it was his infirmity.
Three or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas,
good soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts:
but there's no heed to be taken of them; if Cæsar
had stabbed their mothers, they would have done
no less.
Brutus. And after that, he came, thus sad,
away?

Casca. Ay, he spoke Greek.
Cassius. To what effect?
Casca. Nay, an I tell you that, I'll ne'er look
you i' the face again: but those that understood him
smiled at one another and shook their heads; but,
for mine own part, it was Greek to me. I could tell
you more news too; Marullus and Flavius, for pull-
ing scarfs off Caesar's images, are put to silence.

BRUTUS' SOLILOQUY
-ID., ACT II, SCENE 1.
Reflecting on the mooted assassination of the ambitious Caesar by
the conspirators.
It must be by his death; and, for my part,
I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
But for the general. He would be crown'd:
How that might change his nature, there's the
question.
It is the bright day that brings forth the adder,
And that craves wary walking. Crown him?—that;
And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
That at his will he may do danger with.

Th' abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
Remorse from power; and, to speak truth of Cæsar,
I have not known when his affections sway'd
More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
But when he once attains the upmost round,
He then unto the ladder turns his back,
Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
By which he did ascend. So Cæsar may;
Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
Will bear no color for the thing he is,
Fashion it thus: that what he is, augmented,
Would run to these and these extremities;
And therefore think him as a serpent's egg,
Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischie-
vous,
And kill him in the shell.
BRUTUS' MANLY HONESTY
-ID., ACT II, SCENE 1.
Cassius has just urged Brutus and the other conspirators to assure
their fidelity to each other by "swearing their resolution.”
No, not on oath: if not the face of men,
The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse, -
If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
And every man hence to his idle bed;
So let high-spirited tyranny range on,
Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
To kindle cowards, and to steel with valor
The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,

What need we any spur but our own cause,
To prick us to redress? What other bond,
Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
And will not palter? And what other oath,
Than honesty to honesty engag'd,
That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
Swear priests, and cowards, and men cautelous,
Old feeble carrions, and such suffering souls
That welcome wrongs: unto bad causes swear
Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
The even virtue of our enterprise,
Nor th' insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
To think that or our cause or our performance
Did need an oath, when every drop of blood,
That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
Is guilty of a several bastardy,
If he do break the smallest particle
Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
BRUTUS AGAINST SLAYING ANTONY
--ID., ACT II, SCENE 1.
In reply to Cassius who has suggested that, along with Caesar,
Mark Antony, too, be slain by them.
Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
To cut the head off, and then hack the limbs,
Like wrath in death, and envy afterwards;
For Antony is but a limb of Cæsar.
Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
We all stand up against the spirit of Cæsar,
And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
0, that we then could come by Cæsar's spirit,
And not dismember Cæsar! But, alas!

Cæsar must bleed for it. And, gentle friends,
Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds :
And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
Our purpose necessary, and not envious;
Which so appearing to the common eyes,
We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
And for Mark Antony, think not of him,
For he can do no more than Cæsar's arm,
When Cæsar's head is off.
ANTONY OVER CÆSAR'S BODY

The assassination done, Mark Antony, the friend of Caesar, appears
on the scene in the presence of the conspiring assassins.

Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well!
I know not, gentlemen, what you intend [Rising
Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:
If I myself, there is no hour so fit
As Cæsar's death hour; nor no instrument
Of half that worth, as those your swords, made rich
With the most noble blood of all this world.
I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
I shall not find myself so apt to die;

ANTONY TO THE CONSPIRATORS
--ID., ACT III, SCENE 1.
The conspirators have just assured Antony that he, too, shall have a
share in the general welfare following upon Caesar's removal.
Alas, what shall I say?
My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
Either a coward or a flatterer.-
That I did love thee, Cæsar! O, 'tis true:
[Turning to the Body, and bending over it]
If, then, thy spirit look upon us now,
Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
To see thy Antony making his peace,
Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
It would become me better, than to close
In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave
hart;
Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy death.
O world, thou wast the forest to this hart:
And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
How like a deer, strucken by many princes,
Dost thou here lie!

ANTONY'S PROPHECY
-ID., ACT III, SCENE 1.
All the conspirators have departed from the scene of the assassination,
leaving Antony alone with the body of Caesar.
O! pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers.
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man,
That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,
Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue:
A curse shall light upon the loins of men;
Domestic fury and fierce civil strife,
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
And dreadful objects so familiar,
That mothers shall but smile, when they behold
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
All pity chok'd with custom of fell deeds;
And Cæsar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
With Ate by his side, come hot from hell,
Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
Cry "Havoc !" and let slip the dogs of war,
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men, groaning for burial.
DEMOCRACY OR MONARCHY-WHICH?
-ID., ACT III, SCENE 2.
Caesar has been assassinated. The people gather to hear what
"public reasons shall be rendered of Caesar's death." Note the variance
in the style of pleading of Brutus and Antony. Brutus was a philosopher,
hence the reading of his plea should be characterized by the manner of a
reasoner rather than that of an impassioned orator, such as Antony was.
Brutus' speech wins the people over to the cause of the conspirators so
completely, that to condemn the assassination of Caesar directly after

would have been to invite the most hostile opposition, if not personal
violence, of a liberty-crazed mob; yet the instant that Brutus leaves the
scene followed by the wild plaudits of the throng. Antony mounts the
rostrum and delivers what must be regarded as one of the rarest gems of
oratory in any literature, exemplifying. as it does, the orator's marvelous
power to enkindle the passions of men and to sway their will whitherso-
ever he lists.
Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng

And part the numbers.

Of Caesar's death.

swer:-Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I
loved Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were
living and die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead,
to live all free men ? As Caesar loved me, I weep
for him; as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he
was valiant I honor him: but, as he was ambitious,
I slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
fortune; honor for his valor; and death for his
ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman?
If any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is
here so vile that will not love his country? If any,

All. None, Brutus, none.
Brutus. Then none have I offended. I have
done no more to Caesar than you shall do to Brutus.

nor his offences enforced, for which he suffered
death.

of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself, when

Antony. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me
your ears;
I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interréd with their bones;
So let it be with Cæsar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest
For Brutus is an honorable man;
So are they all, all honorable men-
Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Caesar seem ambitious ?
When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff :
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
You all did see that on the Lupercal
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And, sure, he is an honorable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause:
What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?

Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.

speak.
Antony. But yesterday the word of Caesar might
Have stood against the world; now lies he there,
And none so poor to do him reverence.
O masters, if I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honorable men:
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
Than I will wrong such honorable men.
But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
Let but the commons hear this testament,

Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read-
And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
Unto their issue.

You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,
It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
For, if you should, O, what would come of it!

You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.

Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.

Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb’d;
And as he pluck'd his curséd steel away,
Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all;

Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
Sleep when he wakes, and creep into the jaundice
By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio,–
I love thee, and it is my love that speaks,
There are a sort of men, whose visages
Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
And do a wilful stillness entertain,
With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit;
As who should say, "I am sir Oracle,
And, when I ope my lips, let no dog bark !"
O! my Antonio, I do know of these,
That therefore only are reputed wise,
For saying nothing; when I am very sure,
If they should speak, would almost damn those

Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.

to the Indies; I understand moreover, upon the
Rialto, he hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for Eng-
land, and other ventures he hath, squandered abroad.
But ships are but boards, sailors but men: there be
land-rats and water-rats, water-thieves and land-
thieves, I mean pirates; and then there is the peril
of waters, winds, and rocks. The man is, notwith-
standing, sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think
I may take his bond.
Bassanio. Be assured you may.
Shylock. I will be assured I may; and, that I
may be assured, I will bethink me. May I speak
with Antonio?
Bassanio. If it please you to dine with us.
Shylock. Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habi-
tation which your prophet the Nazarite conjured the
devil into. I will buy with you, sell with you, talk

I will not eat with you, drink with you, nor pray
with you. What news on the Rialto? Who is he
comes here?
Enter ANTONIO
Bassanio. This is Signior Antonio.
Shylock (aside). How like a fawning publican
he looks!
I hate him for he is a Christian,
But more for that in low simplicity
He lends out money gratis and brings down
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
If I can catch him once upon the hip,
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,
Even there where merchants most do congregate,
On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift
Which he calls interest. Curséd be my tribe,
If I forgive him!
Bassanio. Shylock, do you hear?
Shylock. I am debating of my present store,
And, by the near guess of my memory,
I cannot instantly raise up the gross
Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
Do you desire? (To Antonio.) Rest you fair, good
Signior;
Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
Antonio. Shylock, although I neither lend nor
borrow
By taking nor by giving of excess,

Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd
How much ye would ?
Shylock. Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
Antonio. And for three months.
Shylock. I had forgot; three months; you told
me so.
Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;
Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
Upon advantage.
Antonio. I do never use it.
Shylock. When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's
sheep—
This Jacob from our holy Abram was,
As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
The third possessor; ay, he was the third-
Antonio. And what of him? did he take in-
terest?
Shylock. No, not take interest, not, as you would
say,
Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
When Laban and himself were compromised
That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
Should fall as Jacob's hire,
The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands
He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
Who then conceiving did in eaning time
Fall parti-color'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:
And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
Antonio. This was a venture, sir, that Jacob
served for;

A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
Was this inserted to make interest good?
Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
Shylock. I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
But note me, signior.
Antonio. Mark you this, Bassanio.
The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
An evil soul producing holy witness
Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
A goodly apple rotten at the heart:
O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
Shylock. Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good
round sum.
Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the
rate-
Antonio. Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding
to you?
Shylock. Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
On the Rialto you have rated me
About my money and my usances:
Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
And all for use of that which is mine own.
Well then, it now appears you need my help:
Go to, then; you come to me, and you say
'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;
You, that did void your rheum upon my beard
And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
Over your threshold: moneys is your suit.
What should I say to you? Should I not say

'Hath a dog money? is it possible
A cur can lend three thousand ducats ?' Or
Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,
With bated breath and whispering humbleness,
Say this:
'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
You spurn'd me such a day; another time
You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
I'll lend you thus much moneys'?
Antonio. I am as like to call thee so again,
To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
A breed for barren metal of his friend?
But lend it rather to thine enemy,
Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
Exact the penalty.
Shylock. Why look you, how you storm!
I would be friends with you and have your love,
Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,
Supply your present wants and take no doit
Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not liear me:
This is kind I offer.
Bassanio. This were kindness.
Shylock. This kindness will I show.
Go with me to a notary, seal me there
Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,
If you repay me not on such a day,
In such a place, such sum or sums as are
Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit
Be nominated for an equal pound
Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
In what part of your body pleaseth me.

Antonio. Content, in faith: I'll seal to such a
bond
And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
Bassanio. You shall not seal to such a bond
for me:
I'll rather dwell in my necessity.
Antonio. Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit
it:
Within these two months, that's a month before
This bond expires, I do expect return
Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
Shylock. O father Abram, what these Chris-
tians are,
Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;
If he should break his day, what should I gain
By the exaction of the forfeiture?
A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,
To buy his favor, I extend this friendship:
If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
Antonio. Yes, Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
Shylock. Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
Give him direction for this merry bond,
And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
See to my house, left in the fearful guard
Of an unthrifty knave, and presently
I will be with you.
Antonio. Hie thee, gentle Jew. [Exit Shylock.]
The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.

LAUNCELOT GOBBO'S SOLILOQUY
--ID., ACT II, SCENE 2.
Launcelot Gobbo, Shylock's youthful servant, a playful, ludicrous
simpleton, fussy and fidgety, bubbling over with delightful self-importance,
decides upon taking French leave of his master.
Certainly, my conscience will serve me to run
from this Jew, my master. The fiend is at mine
elbow, and tempts me, saying to me, “Gobbo, Laun-
celot Gobbo, good Launcelot," or "Good Gobbo," or
"good Launcelot Gobbo, use your legs, take the start,
run away." My conscience says, “No; take heed,
honest Launcelot; take heed, honest Gobbo;" or, as
aforesaid, "honest Launcelot Gobbo; do not run,
scorn running with thy heels." Well, the most cour-
ageous fiend bids me pack: "Via!” says the fiend;
“away!" says the fiend; "for the heavens, rouse up
a brave mind," says the fiend, "and run." Well, my
conscience, hanging about the neck of my heart,
says very wisely to me,—“My honest friend Laun-
celot, being an honest man's son,"—or rather an
honest woman's son ;-well, my conscience says,
"Launcelot, budge not." "Budge," says the fiend.
"Budge not," says my conscience. "Conscience," say
I, "you counsel well;" "fiend,” say I, "you counsel
well:" to be ruled by my conscience, I should stay
with the Jew my master, who (God bless the mark!)

is a kind of devil: and, to run away from the Jew, I
should be ruled by the fiend, who, saving your rev-
erence, is the devil himself. Certainly, the Jew is
the very devil incarnation; and, in my conscience,
my conscience is but a kind of hard conscience, to
offer to counsel me to stay with the Jew. The fiend
gives the more friendly counsel: I will run, fiend;
my heels are at your commandment; I will run.
SHYLOCK'S VICTORY TURNED TO DEFEAT
-ID., ACT IV, SCENE 1.
Antonio has signed a bond to forfeit a pound of flesh nearest his
heart, in case he fails to refund to Shylock, the Jewish usurer, a loan o
three thousand ducats within three months. The bond has fallen due, and
Shylock has come to court to claim the forfeiture. Portia, the youn:
wife of Bassanio, appears as special judge, with Nerissa, the young wife
of Gratiano, as her clerk. Both appear incognito to every one in the court
room.
Enter the DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO,
BASSANIO, GRATIANO, SALERIO, and others.
Duke. What, is Antonio here?
Antonio. Ready, so please your grace.
Duke. I am sorry for thee: thou art come to
answer
A stony adversary, and inhuman wretch
Uncapable of pity, void and empty
From any dram of mercy.
Antonio. I have heard
Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
And that no lawful means can carry me
Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
My patience to his fury, and am arm'd

To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
The very tyranny and rage of his.
Duke. Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
Salerio. He is ready at the door: he comes, my
lord.
Enter SHYLOCK
Duke. Make room, and let him stand before
our face.
Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
Forgive a moiety of the principal;
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
That have of late so huddled on his back,
Enough to press a royal merchant down
And pluck commiseration of his state
From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
To offices of tender courtesy.
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
Shylock. I have possess'd your grace of what
I purpose;
And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
If you deny it, let the danger light
Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have

A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
But, say, it is my humor: is it answer'd?
What if my house be troubled with a rat
And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?
Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
Now, for your answer:
As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?
Bassanio. This is no answer, thou unfeeling
man
To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
Shylock. I am not bound to please thee with
my answers.
Bassanio. Do all men kill the things they do
not love?
Shylock. Hates any man the thing he would
not kill?
Bassanio. Every offense is not a hate at first.
Shylock. What, wouldst thou have a serpent
sting thee twice?
Antonio. I pray you, think you question with
the Jew:
You may as well go stand upon the beach
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
You may as well use question with the wolf

Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
You may as well forbid the mountain pines
To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
You may as well do anything most hard,
As seek to soften that-than which what's harder?-
His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
Make no more offers, use no farther means,
But with all brief and plain conveniency
Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.
Bassanio. For thy three thousand ducats here
is six.
Shylock. If every ducat in six thousand ducats
Were in six parts and every part a ducat,
I would not draw them; I would have my bond.
Duke. How shalt thou hope for mercy, render-
ing none?
Shylock. What judgment shall I dread, doing
no wrong?
You have among you many a purchased slave,
Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
You use in abject and in slavish parts,
Because you bought them: shall I say to you,
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs ?
Why sweat they under burthens ? let their beds
Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
Be seasoned with such viands? You will answer
“The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:
The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
Is dearly bought; 'tis mine, and I will have
If you deny me, fie upon your law!
There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?

Duke. Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
Whom I have sent for to determine this,
Come here to-day.
Salerio. My lord, here stays without
A messenger with letters from the doctor,
New come from Padua.
Duke. Bring us the letters; call the messenger.
Bassanio. Good cheer, Antonio! What, man,
courage yet!
The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
Antonio. I am a tainted wether of the flock,
Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me:
You cannot better be employ’d, Bassanio,
Than to live still and write mine epitaph.
Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk.
Duke. Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
Nerissa. From both, my lord. Bellario greets
your grace. [Presenting a letter.]
Bassanio. Why dost thou whet thy knife so
earnestly?
Shylock. To cut the forfeiture from that bank-
rupt there.
Gratiano. Not on thy sole, but on thy soul,
harsh Jew,
Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,
No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
Shylock. No, none that thou hast wit enough to
make.

Gratiano. O, be thou damn’d, inexecrable dog!
And for thy life let justice be accused.
Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
That souls of animals infuse themselves
Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,
Infused itself in thee; for thy desires
Are wolvish, bloody, starved, and ravenous.
Shylock. Till thou canst rail the seal from off
my bond,
Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.
Duke. This letter from Bellario doth commend
A young and learned doctor to our court.
Where is he?
Nerissa. He attendeth here hard by,
To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.
Duke. With all my heart. Some three or four
of you
Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.
Clerk. [Reads] Your grace shall understand
that at the receipt of your letter I am very sick: but
in the instant that your messenger came, in loving
visitation was with me a young doctor of Rome; his
name is Balthasar. I acquainted him with the
cause in controversy between the Jew and Antonio,
the merchant: we turned o'er many books together:
he is furnished with my opinion; which, bettered

portunity, to fill up your grace's request in my
stead. I beseech you, let his lack of years be no
impediment to let him lack a reverend estimation;
for I never knew so young a body with so old a
head. I leave him to your gracious acceptance,
whose trial shall better publish his commendation.
Duke. You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he
writes :
And here, I take it, is the doctor come.

Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?
Portio. I did, my lord.
Duke. You are welcome: take your place.
Are you acquainted with the difference
That hol·ls this present question in the court?
Portia. I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?
Duke. Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
Portia. Is your name Shylock?
Shylock. Shylock is my name.
Portia. Of a strange nature is the suit you
follow;
Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
You stand within his danger, do you not?
Antonio. Ay, so he says.
Portia. Do you confess the bond?
Antonio. I do.
Portia. Then must the Jew be merciful.

that.

Portia. The quality of mercy is not strain’d,
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
It blesseth him that gives and him that takes :
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
The thronéd monarch better than his crown;
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
It is enthronéd in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
That, in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
Shylock. My deeds upon my head! I crave the
law,
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
Portia. Is he not able to discharge the money!
Bassanio. Yes, here I tender it for him in the
court;
Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
If this will not suffice, it must appear
That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,

Wrest once the law to your authority:
To do a great right, do a little wrong,
And curb this cruel devil of his will.
Portia. It must not be; there is no power in
Venice
Can alter a decree established:
'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
And many an error by the same example
Will rush into the state: it cannot be.
Shylock. A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a

Shylock. An oath, an oath, I have an oath in
heaven:
Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
No, not for Venice.
Portia. Why, this bond is forfeit;
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
Shylock. When it is paid according to the tenor.
It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
You know the law, your exposition
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,

Which here appeareth due upon the bond.

So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge ?
'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.

weigh
The flesh?

To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.

Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom: it is still her use
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
Of such misery doth she cut me off.
Commend me to your honorable wife;
Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
And he repents not that he pays your debt;
For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
I'll pay it presently with all my heart.
Bassanio. Antonio, I am married to a wife
Which is as dear to me as life itself;
But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:
I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
Here to this devil, to deliver you.
Portia. Your wife would give you little thanks
for that,
If she were by, to hear you make the offer.
Gratiano. I have a wife, whom, I protest, I
love:
I would she were in heaven, so she could
Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.

The wish would make else an unquiet house.

Would any of the stock of Barrabas
Had been her husband rather than a Christian!
We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.

The court awards it, and the law doth give it.

his breast:
The law allows it, and the court awards it.

The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
Unto the state of Venice.

Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
Or less than a just pound, be it but so much
As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
Or the division of the twentieth part
Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
But in the estimation of a hair,
Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.

Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.

feiture,
To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.

Portia. Tarry, Jew:
The law hath yet another hold on you.
It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
If it be proved against an alien
That by direct or indirect attempts
He seek the life of any citizen,
The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
Shall seize one-half his goods; the other half
Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
And the offender's life lies in the mercy
Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;
For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
That indirectly and directly too
Thou hast contrived against the very life
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
The danger formally by me rehearsed.
Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.
Gratiano. Beg that thou mayst have leave to
hang thyself :
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.
Duke. That thou shalt see the difference of our

I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
The other half comes to the general state,
Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.

TO THE RAGING ELEMENTS
SHAKESPEARE'S KING LEAR, ACT III, SCENE 2.
King Lear's two daughters, between whom he divided his whole king-
dom, have inhumanly driven him from their homes and left him helpless.
To him, broken with age and crazed with grief, the drenching rain in the
impenetrable darkness is as nothing beside the black ingratitude of his
heartless daughters.
Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
Till you have drenched our steeples, drown'd the
cocks;
You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,
Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunder-bolts,
Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world:
Crack nature's moulds, all germens spill at once,
That make ingrateful man!
Rumble thy bellyful! Spit fire! spout rain!
Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:
I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;
I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children;
You owe me no subscription: then, let fall
Your horrible pleasure; here I stand, your slave,
A poor, infirm, weak, and despis'd old man.
But yet I call you servile ministers,
That will with two pernicious daughters join
Your high-engender'd battles 'gainst a head
So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!

POWERS OF THE IMAGINATION
SHAKESPEARE'S MIDSUMMERNIGHT'S DREAM, ACT V, SCENE 1.
More strange than true: I never may believe
These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
More than cool reason ever comprehends.
The lunatic, the lover, and the poet,
Are of imagination all compact:
One sees more devils than vast hell can hold;
That is the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
The poet's eye, in a fine frenzy rolling,
Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to
heaven;
And, as imagination bodies forth
The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
Turns them to shapes, and gives to airy nothing
A local habitation and a name.
Such tricks hath strong imagination,
That, if it would but apprehend some joy,
It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
Or, in the night, imagining some fear,
How easy is a bush suppos'd a bear!

His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
Then, the whining school-boy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad
Made to his mistress' eye-brow. Then, a soldier,
Full of strange oaths and beared like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Even in the cannon's mouth. And then, the justice,
In fair round belly with good capon lin’d,
With eye severe and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange eventful history,
Is second childishness and mere oblivion;
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans every thing.

To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
It blots thy beauty, as frosts do bite the meads,
Confounds thy fame, as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
And in no sense is meet or amiable.
A woman mov'd is like a fountain troubled,
Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
And, while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
And for thy maintenance; commits his body
To painful labor, both by sea and land,
To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
And craves no other tribute at thy hands,
But love, fair looks, and true obedience,
Too little payment for so great a debt.
Such duty as the subject owes the prince,
Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
And when she's froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
And not obedient to his honest will,
What is she but a foul contending rebel
And graceless traitor to her loving lord?-
I am asham'd that women are so simple
To offer war where they should kneel for peace,
Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,
When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.
Why are our bodies soft, and weak, and smooth,
Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
But that our soft conditions and our hearts,
Should well agree with our external parts?
Come, come, you froward and unable worms,
My mind hath been as big as one of yours,

GAUNTS COMPLAINT
SHAKESPEARE'S KING RICHARD II, ACT II, SCENE 1.
John of Gaunt, the aged Duke of Lancaster, infeebled and tottering
with a fatal sickness, censures in the presence of the Duke of York the
conduct of young King Richard II.
Methinks, I am a prophet new inspir'd,
And thus, expiring, do foretell of him.
His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last
For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
Small showers last long, but sudden storms are
short;
He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,
This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
This other Eden demi-paradise;
This fortress, built by nature for herself,
Against infection, and the hand of war;

This precious stone set in the silver sea,

Against the envy of less happier lands;
This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this Eng-

Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,
Renowned for their deeds as far from home
For Christian service and true chivalry,
As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry
Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son:
This land of such dear souls, this dear, dear land,
Dear for her reputation through the world,
Is now leas'd out, I die pronouncing it
Like to a tenement or pelting farm.
England, bound in with the triumphant sea,
Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds :
That England, that was wont to conquer others,
Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
Ah! would the scandal vanish with my life,
How happy then were my ensuing death!

Let's choose executors, and talk of wills;-
And yet not so, for what can we bequeath,
Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
Our lands, our lives, and all are Bolingbroke's,
And nothing can we call our own but death
And that small model of the barren earth,
Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
For God's sake let us sit upon the ground,
And tell sad stories of the death of kings:
How some have been deposed, some slain in war,
Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed,
Some poison'd by their wives, some sleeping kill'd,
All murder'd; for within the hollow crown,
That rounds the mortal temples of a king,
Keeps Death his court, and there the antic sits,
Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp;
Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
To monarchize, be fear'd, and kill with looks,
Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
As if this flesh, which walls about our life,
Were brass impregnable; and, humor'd thus,
Comes at the last, and with a little pin
Bored through his castle wall, and–farewell king!
Cover your heads, and mock not flesh and blood
With solemn reverence: throw away respect,
Tradition, form, and ceremonious duty,
For you have but mistook me all this while:

Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
How can you say to me, I am a king ?

BISHOP OF CARLISLE OPPOSING
BOLINGBROKE
-ID., ACT IV, SCENE 1.
For a long time the treacherous Bolingbroke has sought to induce
Richard to yield the sceptre to him, and finally he is informed that the
king is willing to resign the crown. But Bolingbroke's words, “In God's
name, I'll ascend the throne,” is too much for the loyal bishop to hear.
Marry, God forbid !
Worst in this royal presence may I speak,
Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
Would God, that any in this noble presence
Were enough noble to be upright judge
Of noble Richard: then true noblesse would
Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
What subject can give sentence on his king ?
And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?
Thieves are not judg'd but they are by to hear,
Although apparent guilt be seen in them;
And shall the figure of God's majesty,
His captain, steward, deputy elect,
Anointed, crownéd, planted many years,
Be judg'd by subject and inferior breath,
And he not present! O! forefend it, God,
That in a Christian climate souls refin'd
Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king.
My lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,
Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king;
And if you crown him, let me prophesy,
The blood of English shall manure the ground,
And future ages groan for this foul act:

And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars

Bolingbroke, after prevailing upon King Richard II, to abdicate his
throne, has cast him into the dungeon of the castle.

This prison, where I live, unto the world:
And for because the world is populous,
And here is not a creature but myself,
I cannot do it: yet I'll hammer 't out.
My brain I'll prove the female to my soul;
My soul, the father: and these two beget
A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
And these same thoughts people this little world,
In humors like the people of this world,
For no thought is contented. The better sort,
As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
With scruples, and do set the word itself
Against the word;
As thus,-“Come, little ones;" and then again,-
"It is as hard to come, as for a camel
To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.”

Unlikely wonders: how these vain weak nails
May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls;
And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
Thoughts tending to contend flatter themselves,
That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars,
Who, sitting in the stocks, refuge their shame,
That many have, and others must sit there:
And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
Of such as have before endur'd the like.
Thus play I, in one person, many people,
And none contented: sometimes am I king;
Then, treason makes me wish myself a beggar,
And so I am: then, crushing penury
Persuades me I was better when a king:
Then, am I king'd again; and, by and by,
Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
And straight am nothing.–But whate'er I am,

But for the concord of my state and time,
Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.

Now, for the sound, that tells what hour it is,
Are clamorous groans, that strike upon my heart,
Which is the bell: so sighs, and tears, and groans,
Show minutes, times, and hours; but my time
Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.

My liege, I did deny no prisoners:
But, I remember, when the fight was done,
When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
Came there a certain lord, neat, trimly dress'd,
Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin, new reap'd,
Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home:
He was perfumed like a milliner,
And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
He gave his nose, and took 't away again;

And talk so like a waiting gentlewoman
Of guns, and drums, and wounds, (God save the

And telling me, the sovereign'st thing on earth
Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
And that it was great pity, so it was,
This villainous salt-petre should be digg'd
Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
So cowardly; and, but for these vile guns,

THE CARES OF A CROWNED HEAD
SHAKESPEARE'S SECOND PART OF KING HENRY IV.,
ACT III, SCENE 1.
King Henry has prepared to retire for the night.
How many thousand of my poorest subjects
Are at this hour asleep!-O sleep! O gentle sleep!
Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,
That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down,
And steep my senses in forgetfulness?
Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,
Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,

And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,
Than in the perfum'd chambers of the great,
Under high canopies of costly state
And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?
O, thou dull god! why liest thou with the vile
In loathsome beds, and leav'st the kingly couch
A watch-case or a common 'larum bell?
Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
Seal up the ship-boy's eyes and rock his brains
In cradle of the rude imperious surge
And in the visitation of the winds,
Who take the ruffian billows by the top,
Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
With deaf'ning clamor in the slippery clouds,
That with the hurly death itself awakes?
Canst thou, O partial sleep! give thy repose
To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude;
And in the calmest and most stillest night,
With all appliances and means to boot,
Deny it to a king ? Then, happy low, lie down!
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
THE VIRTUE OF SACK
-ID., ACT IV, SCENE 3.
Falstaff, a fat, jolly fellow finds Prince John, son of the king, not to
his liking. He's too serious, and all for lack of loving Falstaff's favorite
beverage, sack.
Good faith, this same young sober-blooded boy
doth not love me, nor a man cannot make him laugh;
but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine. There's
never any of these demure boys come to any proof;
for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood, and

of male green-sickness. They are generally fools and
cowards, which some of us should be too, but for
inflammation. A good sherris-sack hath a two-fold
operation in it: it ascends me into the brain; dries
me there all the foolish and dull and crudy vapors
which environ it: makes it apprehensive, quick, for-
getive, full of nimble, fiery, and delectable shapes;
which, deliver'd o'er to the voice, the tongue, which
is the birth, becomes excellent wit. The second
property of your excellent sherris is, the warming
of the blood; which, before cold and settled, left
the liver white and pale, which is the badge of
pusillanimity and cowardice: but the sherris warms
it, and makes it course from the inwards to the parts
extreme. It illumineth the face, which, as a beacon
gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,
man, to arm; and then the vital commoners, and
inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,
the heart, who, great, and puffed up with this
retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valor
comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is
nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and
learning, a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil till
sack commences it, and sets it in act and use. Here-
of comes it, that Prince Harry is valiant; for the
cold blood he did naturally inherit of his father,
he hath, like lean, sterile, and bare land, manured,
husbanded, and tilled, with excellent endeavor of
drinking good, and good store of fertile sherris, that
he is become very hot and valiant. If I had a thou-
sand sons, the first humane principle I would teach
them should be, to forswear thin potations, and to
addict themselves to sack.

PRINCE HENRY BESIDE THE SLEEPING KING
-ID., ACT IV, SCENE 5.
The king was subject to what is called, in the play, fits of apoplexy,
during which, it seems, he appeared as one bereft of life.
Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow
Being so troublesome a bedfellow?
O polish'd perturbation! golden care!
That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide
To many a watchful night, sleep with it now!
Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet,
As he, whose brow with homely biggin bound,
Snores out the watch of night. O majesty!
When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit
Like a rich armor worn in heat of day,
That scalds with safety-By his gates of breath
There lies a downy feather, which stirs not:
Did he suspire, that light and weightless down
Perforce must move.—My gracious lord! my father!
This sleep is sound indeed; this is a sleep,
That from this golden rigol hath divorc'd
So many English kings. Thy due from me
Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,
Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,
Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously:
My due from thee is this imperial crown,
Which, as immediate from thy place and blood,
Derives itself to me.—Lo! here it sits,
[Putting it on his head.
Which heaven shall guard; and put the world's whole
strength
Into one giant arm, it shall not force
This lineal honor from me. This from thee
Will I to mine leave as 'tis left to me.

KING HENRY V. RESENTING AN INSULT
SHAKESPEARE'S KING HENRY V., ACT I, SCENE 2.
The King had claimed certain dukedoms in France. The Dauphin of
France sent an insulting reply by ambassadors, saying:
"You savor too much of your youth,
.there's nought in France
That can be with a nimble galliard won."
This caustic taunt was made to burn all the deeper by the mocking
offer of tennis-balls instead of the dukedoms. How far he had underrated
the king's mettle is shown by the sequel in the play.
King Henry V. is, possibly, the noblest of all of Shapespeare's char-
acters.
We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us.
His present and your pains we thank you for:
When we have match'd our rackets to these balls,
We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set,
Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
Tell him, he hath made a match with such a wrangler
That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
With chases. And we understand him well,
How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,
Not measuring what use we made of them.
We never valu'd this poor seat of England,
And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
To barbarous license; as 'tis ever common,
That men are merriest when they are from home.
But tell the Dauphin, I will keep my state;
Be like a king, and show my soul of greatness,
When I do rouse me in my throne of France:
For here I have laid by my majesty,
And plodded like a man for working days,
But I will rise there with so full a glory,
That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
And tell the pleasant prince, this mock of his
Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul
Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance

That shall fly with them: for many a thousand
widows
Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;
Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;
And some are yet ungotten and unborn,
That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
But this lies all within the will of God,
To whom I do appeal; and in Whose name,
Tell you the Dauphin, I am coming on,
To venge me as I may, and to put forth
My rightful hand in a well hallow'd cause.
So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin,
His jest will savor but of shallow wit,
When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.

HENRY V. CRUSHES A CONSPIRACY
ID., ACT II, SCENE 2.
Three of the king's nobles had concocted the foul plot of accepting
French gold, and joining the French in the war against the English king.
The mercy that was quick in us but late,
By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:
You must not dare for shame to talk of mercy;
For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,
As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.-
See you, my princes and my noble peers,
These English monsters! My lord of Cambridge

To furnish him with all appertinents
Belonging to his honor; and this man

And sworn unto the practices of France,

This knight, no less for bounty bound to us
Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn.-But O!
What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,
Ingrateful, savage, and inhuman creature!
Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,

Wouldst thou have practis'd on me for thy use,
May it be possible, that foreign hire
Could out of thee extract one spark of evil,
That might annoy my finger? 'Tis so strange,
That, though the truth of it stands off as gross
As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.
Treason and murder ever kept together,
As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,
Working so grossly in a natural course,
That admiration did not whoop at them:
But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in
Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:
And whatsoever cunning fiend it was,
That wrought upon thee so preposterously,
Hath got the voice in hell for excellence;
And other devils, that suggest by treasons,
Do botch and bungle up damnation
With patches, colors, and with forms being fetch'd
From glistening semblances of piety:
But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,
Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.

Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,
He might return to vasty Tartar back,

Then imitate the action of the tiger:

Let it pry through the portage of the head
Like the brass cannon; let the brow o’erwhelm it

King Henry, during the bombardment of Harfluer, resolves on de-
manding the city's surrender.
How yet resolves the governor of the town?
This is the latest parle we will admit:
Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves,
Or, like to men proud of destruction,
Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,
A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
If I begin the battery once again,
I will not leave the half-achieved Harfluer
Till in her ashes she lie buried.
The gates of mercy shall be all shut up;
And the fleshed soldier, rough and hard of heart,
In liberty of bloody hand shall range
With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass
Your fresh fair virgins and your flowering infants.
What is it then to me, if impious war,
Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,
Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
Enlink'd to waste and desolation ?
What rein can hold licentious wickedness,
When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
We may as bootless spend our vain command
Upon th' enraged soldiers in their spoil,
As send precepts to the Leviathan
To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,
Take pity of your town and of your people,
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;
Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace

SOLILOQUY ON THE SORROWS OF KINGS

King Henry V. has just appeared in disguise among his soldiers to
cheer them. In their discouragement they have told him that he must
answer for the lives of soldiers, the losses sustained by wives, children,
etc., in the war. Left alone, the king soliloquizes as follows:
Upon the king ! let us our lives, our souls,
Our debts, our careful wives, our children, and
Our sins, lay on the king !—We must bear all.
O hard condition, twin-born with greatness,
Subject to the breath of every fool,
Whose sense no more can feel but his own wringing!
What infinite heart's ease must kings neglect,
That private men enjoy?
And what have kings, that privates have not too,
Save ceremony, save general ceremony?
And what art thou, thou idol ceremony?
What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more
Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers ?
What are thy rents? what are thy comings-in?
O ceremony, show me but thy worth!

Art thou aught else but place, degree, and form,

Wherein thou art less happy, being fear'd,

But poison'd flattery? O! be sick, great greatness,
And bid thy ceremony give thee cure.
Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out
With titles blown from adulation ?
Will it give place to flexure and low bending?
Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's
knee,
Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,
That play'd so subtly with a king's repose:
I am a king, that find thee; and I know
'Tis not the balm, the sceptre, and the ball,
The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,
The inter-tissued robe of gold and pearl,
The farced title running 'fore the king,
The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp
That beats upon the high shore of this world;
No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,
Not all these, laid in bed majestical,
Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,
Who, with a body fill'd and vacant mind,
Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distasteful bread;
Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,
But, like a lackey, from the rise to set,
Sweats in the eye of Phæbus, and all night

Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
Such outward things dwell not in my desires :
But, if it be a sin to covet honor,

No, 'faith, my coz, wish not a man from England.

The French, with overwhelming odds, have sent a messenger to King
Henry to surrender his army, which the king gallantly spurns to do.
I pray thee, bear my former answer back:
Bid them achieve me, and then sell my bones.
Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?
The man, that once did sell the lion's skin
While the beast liv'd, was kill'd with hunting him.
A many of our bodies shall, no doubt,
Find native graves, upon the which, I trust,
Shall witness live in brass of this day's work;
And those that leave their valiant bones in France,
Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,
They shall be fam’d: for there the sun shall greet
them
And draw their honors reeking up to heaven,
Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,
The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.

That, being dead, like to the bullet's grazing,
Break out into a second course of mischief,
Killing in reflex of mortality.

Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd
With rainy marching in the painful field;
There's not a piece of feather in our host,-

And see the cities and the towns defac'd
By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.
As looks the mother on her lovely babe,
When death doth close his tender dying eyes,
See, see the pining malady of France;
Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,
Which thou thyself hast given her woeful breast.
O! turn thy edged sword another way;
Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.

One drop of blood, drawn from thy country's bosom,
Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign
gore.
Return thee, therefore, with a flood of tears,
And wash away thy country's stainéd spots.
Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,
Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.
Whom join'st thou with, but with a lordly nation
That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?
When Talbot hath set footing once in France,
And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,
Who then but English Henry will be lord,
And thou be thrust out, like a fugitive?
Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,
Was not the duke of Orleans thy foe?
And was he not in England prisoner?
But, when they heard he was thine enemy,
They set him free, without his ransom paid,
In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.
See, then, thou figh'st against thy countrymen,
And join'st with them will be thy slaughter-men.
Come, come, return; return, thou wand'ring lord:
Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.
HENRY VI. A PEACEMAKER
-ID., ACT IV, SCENE 1.
The king allays a quarrel between the Duke of York and the Earl
of Somerset.
Come hither, you that would be combatants.
Henceforth, I charge you, as you love our favor,
Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
And you, my lords, remember where we are;
In France, amongst a fickle, wavering nation.

How will their grudging stomachs be prcvok'd
To wilful disobedience, and rebel!

DUKE OF YORK'S SOLILOQUY
SHAKESPEARE'S SECOND PART OF HENRY VI, ACT III, SCENE 1.
The duke harbors ambitions for the crown.
Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,
And change misdoubt to resolution:
Be that thou hop'st to be or what thou art
Resign to death; it is not worth the enjoying:
Let pale-fac'd fear keep with the mean-born man,
And find no harbor in a royal heart.
Faster than spring-time showers comes thought on

And not a thought but thinks on dignity.
My brain more busy than the laboring spider,
Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.
Well, nobles, well; 'tis politicly done,
To send me packing with an host of men:
I fear me you but warm the starved snake
Who, cherish'd in your breasts, will sting your
hearts.
'Twas men I lack'd, and you will give them me:
I take it kindly; yet, be well assur'd
You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.
Whiles I in Ireland march a mighty band,
I will stir up in England some black storm,
Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;
And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage

Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,
Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.
And, for a minister of my intent,
I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,
John Cade of Ashford,
To make commotion, as full well he can,
Under the title of John Mortimer.
In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
Oppose himself against a troop of kerns;
And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts
Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porcupine;
And, in the end being rescu'd, I have seen
Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,
Shaking the bloody darts, as he his bells.
Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,
Hath he conversed with the enemy,
And undiscover'd come to me again,
And given me notice of their villainies.
This devil here shall be my substitute
For that John Mortimer, which now is dead.
In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:
By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,
How they affect the house and claim of York.
Say he be taken, rack'd, and tortured,
I know no pain they can inflict upon him
Will make him say I mov'd him to those arms.
Say that he thrive as 'tis great like he will,
Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength
And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;
For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,
And Henry put apart, then next for me.

The Duke of York, a traitor in arms against the king, has slain Lord
Clifford, an adherent of the king, in personal combat.
Shame and confusion! all is on the rout;
Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds
Where it should guard. O war! thou son of hell,
Whom angry heavens do make their minister,
Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
Hot coals of vengeance !—Let no soldier fly:

Hath no self-love, nor he that loves himself
Hath not essentially but by circumstance

And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus
To die in ruffian battle?-Even at this sight,
My heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine,
It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;
No more will I their babes: tears virginal
Shall be to me even as the dew to fire,

YORK TO THE QUEEN BEFORE
HIS EXECUTION
SHAKESPEARE'S PART THIRD OF HENRY VI., ACT I, SCENE 4.
The Duke of York has been apprehended as
Margareth,
the English Queen, whom he assails, is a descendant of the houses of
Anjou and Naples.
She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of
France,
Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,
Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
But that thy face is, visor-like, unchanging,
Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
I would essay, proud queen, to make thee blush.
Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,
Of both the Sicils, and Jerusalem,
Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
Unless the adage must be verified,
That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small.
'Tis virtue that doth make them most admir'd;
The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at.
'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
The want thereof makes thee abominable.
Thou art as opposite to every good,
As the antipodes are unto us,
Or as the south to the septentrion.

O tiger's heart, wrapp'd in a woman's hide!
How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
Women are soft, mild, pitiful, and flexible;
Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.
Bid'st thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish;
Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will;
For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
And when the rage allays, the rain begins.

And every drop cries vengeance for his death,
'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false French-
woman.

Would not have stain'd the rose's hues with blood:

And I with tears do wash the blood away.

Yea, even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,
And say,—“Alas! it was a piteous deed."-

And in thy need such comfort come to thee,

JUSTICE OF THE EXECUTION OF THE
DUKE OF YORK
-ID., ACT II, SCENE 2.
The conscience of King Henry VI. is disquieted over the execution
of the Duke of York, the traitor, and Clifford seeks to allay his fears.
My gracious liege, this too much lenity
And harmful pity must be laid aside.
To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
Not his that spoils her young before her face.
Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
The smallest worm will turn, being trodden on,
And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
Ambitious York did level at thy crown,
Thou smiling, while he knit his angry brows;
He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
And raise his issue like a loving sire;
Thou, being a king, bless'd with a goodly son,
Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
Which argued thee a most unloving father.
Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
Which sometime they have us'd with fearful flight,
Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
Offering their own lives in their young's defence?
For shame, my liege! Make them your precedent.
Were it not pity that this goodly boy
Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
And long hereafter say unto his child:
"What my great-grandfather and grandsire got,

Ah! what a shame were this. Look on the boy:
And let his manly face, which promiseth
Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.
CLIFFORD'S SOLILOQUY
-ID., ACT II, SCENE 6.
Clifford, wounded in battle, bewails the yielding policy of King Henry
toward the traitors.
Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
Which, while it lasted, gave King Henry light.
0, Lancaster! I fear thy overthrow
More than my body's parting with my soul.
My love and fear glued many friends to thee;
And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.
Impairing Henry, strengthening mis-proud York,
The common people swarm like summer flies:
And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
That Phæton should check thy fiery steeds,
Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth;
And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
Or as thy father and his father did,
Giving no ground unto the house of York,
That never then had sprung like summer flies;
I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
Had left no mourning widows for our death,
And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air ?
And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;

No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:

For at their hands I have deserv'd no pity.

And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;

GLOSTER PLANS TREASON AND MURDER
SHAKESPEARE'S RICHARD III, ACT I, SCENE 1.
The Duke of Gloster, afterwords King Richard III, is brother to the
king, Edward IV., “the sun of justice," mentioned in the following
soliloquy. He is one of Shakespeare's bloodiest and most heartless char-
acters, a veritable cacodaemon.
Now is the winter of our discontent
Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
And all the clouds that lower'd upon our house,
In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
Our stern alarums chang’d to merry meetings,
Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
Grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
I, that am curtail'd thus of fair proportion,
Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
Deform'd, unfinish'd, sent before my time
Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
And that so lamely and unfashionable,
That dogs bark at me as I 'halt by them;
Why I, in this weak piping time of peace,
Have no delight to pass away the time,
Unless to see my shadow in the sun,
And descant on mine own deformity:

And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
I am determined to prove a villain
And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams,
To set my brother Clarence and the king,
In deadly hate the one against the other:
And if King Edward be as true and just,
As I am subtle, false, and treacherous,
This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
About a prophecy, which says—that G
Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
CLARENCE'S DREAM
-ID., ACT I, SCENE 4.
Clarence has been cast into the Tower by order of the king, his
brother, who, on grounds of merest superstition, fears that he might aspire
to the crown. He was afterwards foully slain in the same prison by the
hired assassins of his brother, the Duke of Gloster.
O! I have pass'd a miserable night,
So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend another such a night,
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
So full of dismal terror was the time.
Methought that I had broken from the Tower,
And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
And, in my company, my brother Gloster,
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches: thence we look'd toward England,
And cited up a thousand heavy times,
During the wars of York and Lancaster,

That had befall'n us. As we pac'd along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought that Gloster stumbled: and, in falling,
Struck me, that thought to stay him, over-board,
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
O Lord! methought what pain it was to drown!
What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
What sights of ugly death within mine eyes!
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
A thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
Some lay in dead men's skulls; and in the holes
Where eyes did once inhabit there were crept
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
That woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
O! then began the tempest to my soul !
I pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,
Who cried aloud, -"What scourge for perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence ?"
And so he vanish’d. Then came wandering by
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
Dabbled in blood; and he shriek'd out aloud,
"Clarence is come,--false, fleeting, perjur'd Clar-
ence,-
That stabbed me in the field by Tewksbury ;-
Seize on him, Furies ! take him unto torments !"

With that, methought, a legion of foul fiends

Albeit they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
Melted with tenderness and mild compassion,
Wept like two children in their death's sad story.
“Lo! thus," quoth Dighton, "lay the gentle babes,'
“Thus, thus," quoth Forrest, “girding one another
Within their alabaster innocent arms:
Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
Which once," quoth Forrest, “almost chang'd my
mind;
But O! the devil"—there the villain stopp'd;

Give me another horse!-bind up my wounds!

The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
What do I fear? myself? there's none else by:
Richard loves Richard ; that is, I am I.
Is there a murderer here? No;-yes; I am:
Then fly.—What, from myself? Great reason: why?
Lest I revenge. What! Myself upon myself?
Alack! I love myself. Wherefore? for any good
That I myself have done unto myself?
O! no: alas! I rather hate myself
For hateful deeds committed by myself.
I am a villain. Yet I lie; I am not.
Fool, of thyself speak well:--Fool, do not flatter.
My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
And every tongue brings in a several tale,
And every tale condemns me for a villain.
Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree;
Murder, stern murder, in the direst degree:
All several sins, all us'd in each degree,

Like high-rear'd bulwarks stand before our faces.
Richard except, those whom we fight against
Had rather have us win than him they follow.
For what is he they follow? Truly, gentlemen,
A bloody tyrant, and a homicide;
One rais'd in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
One that made means to come by what he hath,
And slaughter'd those that were the means to help
him;
A base foul stone, made precious by the foil
Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
One that hath ever been God's enemy:
Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
God will in justice ward you as his soldiers:
If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
If you do fight against your country's foes,

And, when he thinks,-good easy man, full surely

And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,
Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
This many summers in a sea of glory;
But far beyond my depth: my high blown pride
At length broke under me, and now has left me,
Weary and old with service, to the mercy
Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.

And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention
Of me more must be heard of, say I taught thee,

And sounded all the depths and shoals of honor,
Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;
A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.

Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition.
By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,
The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?

Ulysses, Nestor, Patroclus, Achilles and Ajax are Grecian commanders.
Ulysses graphically and passionately describes to Agamemnon, the Grecian
general (at war with the Trojans), to the aged Nestor and others, how
Patroclus, at the malicious instigation and to the hearty enjoyment of
Achilles, mocks and derisively mimics his superior officer, Agamemnon,
and his brother officer, Nestor. An excellent selection for impersonation.
The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
The sinew and the forehand of our host,
Having his ear full of his airy fame,
Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus
Upon a lazy bed the livelong day

And, like a strutting player, whose conceit
Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,-
Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,
'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,
Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd,
Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff
The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,
From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemmon just.
Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,
As he, being 'drest to some oration.
That's done, as near as the extremest ends
Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:
Yet good Achilles still cries Excellent!
'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
Arming to answer in a night alarm.
And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,
And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,
Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport
Sir Valor dies; cries o, enough, Patroclus;
Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
In pleasure of my spleen. And in this fashion,
All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
Severals and generals of grace exact,
Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,
Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.

TITUS ANDRONICUS GREETING ROME
SHAKESPEARE'S TITUS ANDRONICUS, ACT I, SUENE 2.
Titus Andronicus, a noble Roman, and general against all the Goths,
returns to Rome in triumph with Goths as prisoners.
Hail Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
Lo! as the bark that hath discharg'd her fraught
Returns with precious lading to the bay
From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,
Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,
To re-salute his country with his tears,
Tears of true joy for his return to Rome. S
Thou great defender of this Capitol,
Stand gracious to the rites that we intend !
Romans, of five-and-twenty valiant sons,
Half of the number that King Priam had,
Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!
These that survive let Rome reward with love;
These that I bring unto their latest home,
With burial amongst their ancestors:
Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my
sword.
Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,
Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,
To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
Make way to lay them by their brethern.
[The Tomb is opened.]
There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,
And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars !
O sacred receptacle of my joys,
Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
How many sons hast thou of mine in store,
That thou wilt never render to me more?

TAMORA PLEADS FOR HER VANQUISHED
SONS
-ID., ACT I, SCENE 2.
Tamora, Queen of the Goths, vanquished by Titus Andronicus, has
been brought to Rome, together with other prisoners. She pleads for her
sons on the occasion of the conqueror's triumphal entry into the city.
Her eldest son has been marked fo sacrifice to appease the gods.
Gracious conqueror,
Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,
A mother's tears in passion for her son;
And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
O! think my son to be as dear to me.
Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,
To beautify thy triumphs and return,
Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke;
But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets,
For valiant doings in their country's cause?
O! if to fight for king and common weal
Were piety in thine, it is in these.
Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood :
Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
Draw near them then in being merciful:
Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:
Thrice-noble Titus, spare my first-born son.
THE PRINCE OF VERONA BREAKS UP A FEUD
SHAKESPEARE'S ROMEO AND JULIET, ACT I, SCENE 1.
Two houses of Verona, those of Montague and Capulet, bear against
each other an ancient grudge, and the poet has opened his play with a
scene of one of these bloody encounters.
Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
Profaners of this neighbor-stained steel !
Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
That quench the fire of your pernicious rage

On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
Throw your mis-temper'd weapons to the ground,
And hear the sentence of your movéd prince.
Three civil brawls, bred of an angry word,
By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
And made Verona's ancient citizens
Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate.
If ever you disturb our streets again,
Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
For this time, all the rest depart away:
You, Capulet, shall go along with me;
And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
To know our farther pleaure in this case,
To old Free-town, our common judgment-place
Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
MERCUTIO ON DREAMS
-ID., ACT I, SCENE 4.
Mercutio, a boon companion of Romeo's,
becomes
facetious over
Romeo's faith in dreams, in a charming passage, in which he refers to
Queen Mab, designated in folk-lore as the mid-wife of the Fairies, since
it is her duty to deliver men of dreams during sleep by driving over
them in her chariot.
O! then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
She is the fairies' midwife; and she comes
In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
On the forefinger of an alderman,
Drawn with a team of little atomies
Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep:
Her wagon-spokes made of long spinners' legs,

The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers,
The traces, of the smallest spider's web,
The collars, of the moonshine's watery beams,
Her whip, of cricket's bone; the lash, of film,
Her waggoner, a small grey-coated gnat,
Not half so big as a round little worm
Pick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
Time out of mind the fairies' coach-makers.
And in this state she gallops night by night
Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies
straight;
O’er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees;
Sometime she gallops o'er a counsellor's nose,
And then dreams he of smelling out a suit:
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail,
Tickling a parson's nose as 'a lies asleep,
Then dreams he of another benefice.
Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
Of healths five fathom deep; and then anon
Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes;
And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two,
And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
That plats the manes of horses in the night,
And makes the elf-locks in foul sluttish hairs,
Which once untangled much misfortune bodes.

IAGO'S SUIT DENIED BY OTHELLO
SHAKESPEARE'S OTHELLO, ACT I, SCENE 1.
Iago has sued to be Othello's lieutenant, and bitterly resents his rejection.
Three great ones of the city,
In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
Off-capp'd to him; and, by the faith of man,
I know my price, I am worth no worse a place;
But he, as loving his own pride and purposes,
Evades them, with a bombast circumstance,
Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
And, in conclusion,
Nonsuits my mediators; for "Certes," says he,
“I have already chose my officer.” And what was
he?
Forsooth, a great arithmetician.
One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
That never set a squadron in the field,
Nor the division of a battle knows
More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
Wherein the togéd consuls can propose
As masterly as he: mere prattle without practice
Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had th' election;
And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
At Rhodes, at Cyprus, and on other grounds,
Christian and heathen must be be-lee'd and calm'd
By debitor and creditor; this counter-caster,
He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
And I, God bless the mark! his Moorship's ancient.

IAGO SWEARS REVENGE
-ID., ACT I, SCENE 1.
lago, Othello's Ancient or Standard-bearer, than whom there is no
blacker or more snaky villain in all Shakespeare, plans his foul treachery
against his master. Roderigo has just counselled lago not to be a follower
of Othello.
0, sir! content you;
I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
For nought but provender, and when he's old,
cashier'd.
Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
Who, learn'd in forms and usages of duty,
Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
their coats,
Do themselves homage: these fellows have some
soul;
And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
In following him, I follow but myself,-
Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
But seeming so, for my peculiar end;
For when my outward action doth demonstrate
The native act and figure of my heart
In compliment extern, 'tis not long after
But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.

OTHELLO'S DEFENSE
-ID. ACT I, SCENE 3.
Brabantio, the father of Desdemona, had accused Othello to the Duke
and Senators of Venice of beguiling his daughter into marriage.
Most potent, grave and reverend signiors,
My very noble and approv'd good masters,
That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
It is most true; true, I have married her:
The very head and front of my offending
Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace;
For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
Their dearest action in the tented field,
And little of this great world can I speak,
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
And, therefore, little shall I grace my cause,
In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious
patience,
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
Of my whole course of love: what drugs, what
charms,
What conjuration and what mighty magic,-
For such proceeding I am charged withal,-
I won his daughter with.
Her father lov’d me; oft invited me;
Still question’d me the story of my life,
From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
That I had pass’d.
I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
To the very moment that he bade me tell it:
Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,

Of moving accidents by flood and field,
Of hair-breadth scapes i' th' imminent deadly
breach,
Of being taken by the insolent foe
And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
And portance in my travels' history;
Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
Rough quarries, rocks, and hills whose heads touch
heaven,
It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;
And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
Would Desdemona seriously incline:
But still the house affairs would draw her thence;
Which ever as she could with haste despatch,
She'd come again, and with a greedy ear
Devour up my discourse; which I observing,
Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart,
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
But not intentively: I did consent,
And often did beguile her of her tears,
When I did speak of some distressful stroke,
That my youth suffered. My story being done,
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
She swore, in faith 'twas strange, 'twas passing
strange;
'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
She wished she had not heard it, yet she wished
That heaven had made her such a man: she thanked
me,

And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
I should but teach him how to tell my story,
And that would woo her. On this hint I spake;
She loved me for the dangers I had passed,
And I loved her, that she did pity them.
This only is the witchcraft I have used.
MARCIUS TO HIS SOLDIERS
SHAKESPEARE'S CORIOLANUS, ACT I, SCENE 4.
The intrepid Caius Marcius Coriolanus, enraged at seeing his Roman
troops beaten back by the Volscians, orders a bold attack on the foe.
All the contagion of the South light on you,
You shames of Rome! You heard of—Boils and
plagues
Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorred
Further than seen, and one infect another
Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe,
And make my wars on you. Look to 't: come on;
If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
As they us to our trenches. Follow me.
So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds;
'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.

COMINIUS FAVORING CORIOLANUS
-ID., ACT II, SCENE 2.
The Senators of Rome have assembled to confer the consulship on
Coriolanus, whose deeds of valor Cominius is called on to narrate.
The deeds of Coriolanus
Should not be uttered feebly. It is held
That valor is the chiefest virtue, and
Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
The man I speak of cannot in the world
Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
When with his Amazonian chin he drove
The bristled lips before him. He bestrid
An o'er-pressed Roman, and i' the consul's view
Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
And struck him on his knee. In that day's feats,
When he might act the woman in the scene,
He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil-age
Man-entered thus, he waxed like a sea;
And in the brunt of seventeen battles since,
He lurched all swords of the garland. For this last,
Before and in Corioli, let me say,
I cannot speak him home: he stopped the fliers,
And by his rare example made the coward
Turn terror into sport. As weeds before
A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
Where it did mark, it took : from face to foot
He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
Was timed with dying cries. Alone he enter'd

The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
And with a sudden reenforcement struck
Corioli like a planet. Now all's his;
When by and by the din of war 'gan pierce
His ready sense: then straight his doubled spirit
Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
And to the battle came he; where he did
Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
"Twere a perpetual spoil; and till we calld
Both field and city ours, he never stood
To ease his breast with panting.
CORIOLANUS TO AUFIDIUS, THE VOLSCIAN

Coriolanus has been banished from Rome, and now makes common
cause with the Volscians, the enemies of Rome.
My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
My surname, Coriolanus. The painful service,
The extreme dangers, and the drops of blood
Shed for my thankless country, are requited
But with that surname; a good memory,
And witness of the malice and displeasure
Which thou shouldst bear me. Only that name
remains:
The cruelty and envy of the people,
Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
And suffered me by the voice of slaves to be
Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
Hath brought me to thy hearth: not out of hope,

I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
I would have 'voided thee; but in mere spite,
To be full quit of those my banishers,
Stand I before thee here. Then, if thou hast
A heart of wreak in thee, that will revenge
Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee
straight,
And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
That my revengeful service may prove
As benefits to thee; for I will fight
Against my canker'd country with the spleen
Of all the under fiends. But if so be
Thou dar'st not this and that to prove more fortunes
Thou art tir'd; then, in a word, I also am
Longer to live most weary, and present
My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice:
Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
It be to do thee service.

And say,
'Tis true;" I'd not believe them more
Than thee, all noble Marcius.—Let me twine
Mine arms about that body, where against
My grained ash an hundred times hath broke,
And scarr'd the moon with splinters! Here I clip
The anvil of my sword, and do contest
As hotly and as nobly with thy love
As ever in ambitious strength I did
Contend against thy valor.
Why, thou Mars, I tell thee,
We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
Or lose mine arm for 't. Thou hast beat me out
Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me:
We have been down together in my sleep,
Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
And wak'd half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
Thou art thence banish’d, we would muster all
From twelve to seventy; and, pouring war
Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O! come: go in,
And take our friendly senators by the hands,
Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
Who am prepar'd against your territories,
Though not for Rome itself.
