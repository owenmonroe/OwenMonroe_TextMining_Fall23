INTRODUCTION.
Elocution is the art of expressing thought by speech.
Instruction in this branch properly begins with vocal cul
fure, and we find that systematic training and rigid practice
develop the voice, and make it strong, flexible and melo-
dious; just as athletic exercises give strength and pliability
of muscle and grace of movement.
The pugilist undergoes the most severe training for weeks
and months to prepare himself for a contest of strength.
And so, in ancient times, the gladiator exercised his muscles
until the “strength of brass was in his toughened sinews,"
and he could rend the lion as if it were a kid. And that old
oratorical gladiator, Demosthenes, practiced vocal gymnastics
by the roaring sea, and left no means untried to remedy de-
fects of voice and manner. Cicero studied oratory for thirty
years, and traveled all over Asia to hear models of eloquence
and to gain instruction.
Curran, stuttering Jack Curran, cultivated his voice so
industriously that he not only overcame the great defect, but
was actually noted for the clearness and perfection of his
articulation. He practiced before a mirror, and debated
questions as if he were in a lyceum.
But the development of the voice is only the beginning of
the work. The student must be trained in the great school
of nature He must listen to her voice as she speaks in her
children, and thus gather models for imitation. Rosa Bon.
heur has the unmistakable inspiration of genius, but she
studied the physiology and characteristics of animals long
and faithfully before she was able to paint her sheep and
oxen with such life-like fidelity. Garrick's acting was so

! INTRODUCTION.
natural that the countryman who visited the theater, for the
first time, and saw him in Hamlet, said, “if that little man is
not frightened, I never saw a man frightened in my life; why,
he acts just as I would if I were down there with a ghost.”
Booth, in Richelieu, does not seem to be acting the char-
acter. The bowed figure, the wrinkles and the voice of age
are there, and you can scarcely believe he is not the Car-
dinal.
And more wonderful still, Ristori, by the magic power of
voice, her expressive face and her natural gesture, moves an
audience to laughter or to tears at will, and all this, when
speaking in an unknown tongue.
The reader must be sympathetic, entering into the joy on
grief of others as if it were his own.
Mrs. Siddons once had a pupil who was practicing for the
stage. The lesson was upon the “part” of a young girl whose
lover had deserted her. The rendering did not please that
Queen of Tragedy, and she said, “ Think how you would feel
under the circumstances. What would you do if your lover
were to run off and leave you?” “I would look out for
, another one," said that philosophic young lady, and Mrs. Sid-
dons with a gesture of intense disgust cried out, “Leave me!"
and would never give her another lesson.
There must be a lively imagination combined with artistic
skill. The picture must not only be clear and distinct in the
mind of the reader, but he must be able to hold it up before
his audience as if it were on canvass. He must make the
principal parts stand out in high relief; then he must with
skillful fingers touch up the picture, showing a vivid light
here and a shadow there, until the chiaro-oscuro is perfect.
Such actors as Booth and Ristori, such readers as Fanny
Kemble and Murdoch, and such singers as Jenny Lind and
Parepa are really Raphaels and Michael Angelos. Their pic-
ture rannot be purchased by connoisseurs and hung in stately

nalls, but in the heart of every listener the gems of art are
hung, and memory forever after is enraptured as she gazes.
The judgment must be sound, else bombast may be mis.
taken for eloquence, and rant for the true expression of feel-
ing. And finally, in reading, as in everything else, common
sense is a valuable acquisition, and he who has it not, though
his voice may be, at his will, as strong as that of a lion or as
gentle as that of a dove, will never please.
In brief, the chief requisites of the reader are voice, imita.
sion, feeling, artistic skill and above all common sense.

I. ORTHOEPY.
Orthoepy is the correct pronunciation of words.
In order to fix habits of correct pronunciation and distinct
enunciation, it is well to drill the voice upon the elementary
sounds of the language.
A Tonic is an unobstructed vocal tone, which is capable of
indefinite prolongation.

II. QUALITY OF VOICE.
Quality is the kind or tone of voice used in expressing
sentiment. Nature has so wisely formed the human voice
and the human soul, that certain tones are associated with
certain emotions. We readily recognize the cry of pain or
fright, the language of joy or sorrow, command or entreaty,
though the words spoken are in an unknown tongue. Intelli-
gent animals and children obey tones rather than words; and,
as quality of voice is nature's own mode of giving us the key
to her mind, particular and early attention should be given to
this part of vocal culture.
Rubens could, by one stroke of his brush, convert a laugh.
ing into a weeping child; and we can color emotion with
qualities of voice so that the metamorphosis is not less sudden
or more complete.
1. Pure Quality is that used in common conversation, sim-
ple narrative or description.
If the voice is not really and technically pure, exercise in
vocal culture may make it so. Children's voices seem to be
naturally pure. It is the utterance of evil passion, with bad
reading and reciting in the schools, that makes the voice

sharp and disagreeable. The teacher should see that all the
exercises of the school are carried on in cheerful tones:
1.
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you,-
trippingly on the tongue; but if you mouth it, as many of our
players do, I had as lief the town-crier spake my lines. Nor
do not saw the air too much with your hand thus, but use all
gently; for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a
temperance, that may give it smoothness. Oh! it offends me
to the soul, to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow tear a
passion to tatters - to very rags — to split the ears of the
groundlings; who, for the most part, are capable of nothing
but inexplicable dumb show and noise. I would have such a
fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant: it out-herods Herod.
Pray you, avoid it.
Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion be
your tutor. Suit the action to the word; the word to the
action; with this special observance — that you o'erstep not
the modesty of nature: for anything so overdone is from the
purpose of playing; whose end, both at the first and now,
was, and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature;– to
show virtue her own feature; scorn her own image; and the
very age and body of the time, his form and pressure. Now
this, overdone or come tardy off, though it make the unskillful
laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the censure of
which one, must, in your allowance, o'erweigh a whole theater
of others. Oh! there be players, that I have seen play, and
heard others praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
that neither having the accent of Christians, nor the gait of
Christian, pagan, or man, have so strutted and bellowed, that
I have thought some of nature's journeymen had made men,
and not made them well, – they imitated humanity so abomi-
nably!
Shakspeare.

Because you flourish in worldly affairs,
Don't be haughty, and put on airs,
With insolent pride of station!
Don't be proud, and turn up your nose
At poorer people in plainer clothes,
But learn, for the sake of your mind's repose,
That wealth's a bubble that comes — and goes!
And that all proud flesh, wherever it grows,

. 2. 'The Orotund is used in expressing the language of
grandeur, sublimity, awe, reverence, courage, etc. It is round
and full, and may be said to be the maximum of pure quality.

Then lend to the eye a terrible aspect;
Aye, set the teeth and stretch the nostrils wide.

3. The Pectoral gives expression to deep-seated anger,
despair, great solemnity, etc. It has its resonance in the
chest; is low in pitch; is usually accompanied by slow time,
and is, indeed, a very low orotund:
1.
Oh! I have passed a miserable night,
So full of fearful dreams, of ugly sights,
That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
I would not spend another such a night,
Though 't were to buy a world of happy days,
So full of dismal terror was the time!
Macb. Methonght I heard a voice cry, Sleep no more
MACBETH doth murder sleep -- the innocent sleep --
Sleep that knits up the raveld sleeve of care,
The death of each day's life, sore labor's bath,
Balm of hurt minds, great natare's second course,
Chief nourisher in life's feast :-

4. The Guttural (from guttur, throat) is used to express
anger, hatred, contempt, loathing, etc. Its characteristic is
an explosive resonance in the throat.
How like a fawaing publican he looks !
I hate him for he is a Christian;
But more, for that, in low simplicity,
He lends out money gratis, and brings down

Oh! but to breathe the breath

With the sky above my head,
And the grass beneath my feet.
For only one short hour
To feel as I used to feel,

6. The Aspirate gives the whispered utterance of secrecy,
fear, etc. Its characteristic is distinctness — indeed, whatever
is lost in vocality is made up in distinctness. For this reason
exercise upon this quality is of great value in vocal culture.
The aspirate is usually combined with other qualities.

The human voice is to be considered as a musical instrument -
an organ; constructed by the hand of the Great Master of all Har-
mony. It has its bellows, its pipe, its mouth-piece; and when we
know the “stops" "it will discourse most eloquent music.” It has
its gamut, or scale of ascent and descent; it has its keys, or pitch, -
its tones, its semi-tones, its bass, its tenor, its alto, its melody,
its cadence. It can speak as gently as the lute, “like the sweet
south upon a bed of violets," or as shrilly as the trumpet; it can
tune the “silver sweet” note of love, and the iron throat of war;"
in fine, it may be modulated by art to any sound of softness or of
strength, of gentleness or harshness, of harmony or discord. And
the art that wins this music from the strings is ELOCUTION.

There are three classes of women.
First, domestic Drudges, who are wholly taken up in the material
details of their housekeeping, husband-keeping, child-keeping.
Their housekeeping is a trade, and no more; and, after they have
done that, there is no more which they can do. In New England
it is a small class, getting less every year.
Next, there are domestic Dolls, wholly taken up with the vain
show which delights the eye and the ear. They are ornaments of
the estate. Similar toys, I suppose, will one day be more cheaply
manufactured at Paris and Nurnberg, at Frankfort-on-the-Maine,
and other toy shops of Europe, out of wax and papier-mache, and
sold in Boston at the haberdasher's, by the dozen. These ask
gothing beyond their function as dolls, and bate all attempts to
elevate womankind.

2. Quick. The movement of joy, humor, etc.:
And seel she stirs !
She starts, — she moves, — she seems to feel
The thrill of life along her keel,
And, spurning with her foot the ground,
With one exulting, joyous bound,
She leaps into the ocean's arms !
Longfellow
3. Rapid. Used in expressing haste, fear, etc. :
Hurrah! the foes are moving. Hark to the mingled din,
Of fife, and steed, and trump, and druin, and roaring culverin.
The fiery duke is pricking fast across Saint Andre's plain,
With all the hireling chivalry of Guelders and Almayne.
Now by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of France,
Charge for the golden lilies — upon them with the lance!
A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest,
A thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow-white crest
And in they burst, and on they rushed, while, like a guiding star,
Amidst the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of Navarre.
Macaulay.
4. Slow. Used in the language of grandeur, sublimity
adoration, etc. :
And thou, O, silent mountain, sole and bare,
O, blacker than the darkness, all the night,
And visited all night by troops of stars, –
Or when they climb the sky, or when they sink,-
Companion of the morning star at dawn,
Thyself earth's rosy star, and of the dawn
Co-herald! wake, oh! wake, and utter praise !
Ye ice-falls ! ye that from your dizzy heights
Adown enormous ravines steeply slope, -.
Torrents, methinks, that heard a mighty noise,
And stopped at once amidst their maddest plunge!
Motionless torrents / silent cataracts !
Who made you glorious as the gates of heaven,
Beneath the keen full moon ? Who bade the sun

5. Very slow. The deepest emotion of horror, awe, gloom,
etc. :
I had a dream which was not all a dream,
The bright sun was extinguished; and the stars
Did wander darkling in the eterual space,
Rayless and pathless; and the icy earth
Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;
Morn came, and went, and came, and brought no day.

Then my heart it grew ashen and sober
As the leaves that were crisped and sere -
As the leaves that were withering and sere,
And I cried, "It was surely October,
On this very night of last year,
That I journeyed — I journeyed down here
That I brought a dread burden down here,
On this night of all nights in the year,
Ah, what demon hath tempted me here?
Well I know now this dim lake of Auber-
This misty mid region of Weir, —
Well I know now this dark tarn of Auber,
This ghoul-haunted woodland of Weir."
Ye're there, but yet I see you not! - forth draw each trusty

And let me hear your faithful steel clash once around my board I

And all I reniember is friends flocking round,
As I sate with his head 'twixt my knees on the ground;

Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent.

2. PAUSE OR GROUPING OF SPEECH.
“A pause is often more eloquent than words."
1. Sentential. Founded upon the syntactical structure of
the sentence and indicated by the marks of punctuation.
It is addressed to the eye, and may or may not be used as a
rest of the voice.
The old-school fashion of stopping invariably at the
comma long enough to count one, at a semicolon two, at a
colon three, etc., has, we hope, with other relics of school
barbarism, passed away.
“How did Garrick speak the soliloquy, last night?" – "Ol!
against all rule, my lord, most ungrammatically! Betwixt the sub-
stantive and the adjective, which should agree together in number,
case and gender, he made a breach thus — stopping, as if the point
wanted settling; and betwixt the nominative case, which, your
lordship knows, should govern the verb, he suspended his voice in
the epilogue a dozen times, three seconds and three-h(ths by a
stop-watch, my lord, each time.” “Admirable grammarian! -
But, in suspending his voice, — was the sense suspended ? – Did no
expression of attitude or countenance fill up the chasm? — Was the
eye silent? Did you narrowly look?” -“I looked only at the
stop-watch, my lord I” –“Excellent observer!"
Sterne's sketch of the critic at the theatre.
2. Rhetorical. Wholly dependent upon the sense and feel-
ing, and, while it rests the voice of the speaker, is addressed
to the ear of the listener.
We give a few examples covering the principal ground of
Rhetorical Pause.
1. (1.) After the subject of a sentence.
Intemperance | is a vice.
(2.) After the subjective phrase.
The pleasures of sin | are but for a season.
(3.) When the subject is inverted.
The meekest of menwas Moses.

2. After every emphatic word.

3. Before the prepositional phrase.
We are going | into the country.
4. Wherever an ellipsis occurs.
Bcy Britton, I only a lad, I a fair-haired boy, / sixteen, I
In his uniform.
Into the storm, into the roaring jaws of grim Fort Henry,
Boldly bears the Federal flotilla,
Into the battle storm.
5. In order to arrest the attention.
The sentence was | Death.
The student will locate rhetorical pauses in the following
examples, giving also names of authors:
It was a maxim of Raffaelle's that the artist's object was to make
things not as Nature makes them, but as she would make them; as
she ever tries to make them, but never succeeds, though her aim
may be deduced from a comparison of her effects; just as if a
number of archers had aimed unsuccessfully at a mark upon a wall,
and this mark were then removed, we could by the examination
of their arrow-marks point out the probable position of the spot
aimed at, with a certainty of being nearer to it than any of their
shots.
2.
I am not come
To stay: to bid farewell, farewell forever,
For this I come! 'Tis over! I must leare theel
Thekla, I must - must leave thee! Yet thy hatred
Let me not take with me. I pray thee, grant me
One look of sympathy, only one look.

V. MELODY.
1. PITCH
Pitch is the degree of the elevation or depression of sound.
In music, exactness can be reached in regard to pitch, while
in elocution, we can only use terms which are modified by dif.
ferent voices and gradations of emotion with different persons.
1. Middle. Used in conversational language:
1.
The first step towards becoming a good elocutionist, is a correct
articulation. A public speaker, possessed of only a moderate voice,
if he articulates correctly, will be better understood, and heard
with greater pleasure, than one who vociferates without judgment.
The voice of the latter may indeed extend to a considerable dis-
tance, but the sound is dissipated in confusion. Of the former
voice not the smallest vibration is wasted, every stroke is perceived
at the utmost distance to which it reaches; and hence it has often
the appearance of penetrating even farther than one which is loud,
but badly articulated.
Comstock.
2.
In slumbers of midnight, the sailor-boy lay;
His hammock swung loose at the sport of the wind;
But, watch-worn, and weary, his cares flew away;
And visions of happiness danc'd o'er his mind.
Dimond.

EXERCISES IN ELOCUTION.
2. High.
Indicates joy, grief, astonishment, etc.:
"The slogan's ceased — but hark! din ye no hear
The Campbell's pibrock swell upon the breeze !
They're coming, hark!” then falling on her knees,-
“ We're saved,” she cries, “ we're saved." Vander.hoff.
2.
Go ring the bells and fire the guns,
And fling the starry banners out;
Shout “FREEDOM" till your lisping cnes
tive back their cradle shout.
Whittier.
3. Low. Expresses grave, grand, solemn or reverential
feeling. The use of the low pitch is very effective in reading.
Ruskin says of painting, “ If you wish to express vivid light,
you must make the shadows sharp and visible," and this rule
will apply to word pictures as well.
It will not do to give any particular rendering for the voice-
effect alone, but if taste is not sacrificed, some shading will
only bring out the beauty of the picture :
And he hangs, he rocks between - and his nostrils curdle in,-
Toll slowly !
And he shivers head and hoof – and the flakes of foam fall off;
And his face grows fierce and thin,
And a look of human woe, from his staring eyes did go -
Toll slowly !
And a sharp cry uttered he, in a foretold agony
Of the headlong death below.
Mrs. Browning.
4. Transitions. It is very important that the student in vocal
culture be able to take any pitch at will, making sudden transi-
tions. Who has not suffered agonies untold, when listening to
a speaker whose voice was keyed upon and sustained, without
variableness or shadow of turning, upon the highest and
sharpest pitch possible? The minister who preaches upon
an even pitch, whether high or low, lulls his audience to sleep.
The high voice is at first offensive to the ear, but bye and bye

the sameness is found to be a fatal opiate. Nothing rests the
voice like transitions of pitch, time, force and quality.
2. MONOTONE.
Sameness of voice, indicating solemnity, power, reverence,
vastness, or a “dead level” in surface or sentiment.
1.
Deep in the wave is a coral grove,
Where the purple mullet and gold-fish rove,
Where the sea-flower spreads its leaves of blue,
That never are wet with falling dew,
But in bright and changeful beauty shine
Far down in the green and glassy brine.
Percival.

And the sun became black as sackcloth of hair, and the moon
became as blood; and the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even
as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a
mighty wind. And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is
rolled together; and every mountain and island were moved out of
their places.
Bible.
We must not confound monotony with the monotone,
Much of the school room reading is monotonous in the ex-
treme, and yet if the monotone would give the reading grand
effect, without doubt the pupil will read in his most lively manner.
The haste and monotony often exhibited in reading the
beautiful words of the church service is to be deplored. Some
one has said, that haste seems to be the only requisite of wor-
ship. The clerk of the Assembly may read the bills so that
no member can possibly know their import, but when the
magistrate adn.inisters the sublime oath —“Do you solemnly
swear in the presence of Almighty God, etc.," as if he were
reading an invoice of goods, and the person taking the oath
• kisses the Bible with as much solemnity as he would a walk-
ing stick,” the whole transaction seems like a sacrilegious farce.
3. DIATONE.
The progress of pitch through the interval of a whole tone,
used in expressing lively emotion, or in common conversation.

EXERCISES IV ELOCUTION.
Will the New Year come to-night, mamma? I'm tired of waiting so;
My stocking hung by the chimney side, full three long days ago.
I run to peep within the door by morning's early light,
'Tis empty still, oh! say, maninia, will the New Year come to-
night?
Miss Eager.
4. SEMITONE.
The progress of pitch through the interval of a half tone.
It is called also the Chromatic melody, because it paints pity
grief, remorse, etc. It may color a single word, or be contin
ued through an entire passage or selection:
The New Year comes to-night, mamma, “I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord ” — tell poor papa —“my soul to keep,
If I” — how cold it seems, how dark, kiss me, I cannot see,
The New Year comes to night, mamma, the old year dies with me.
Miss Eager.
The Semitone is very delicate, and must be produced by
the nature of the emotion. An excess, when the mood or lan-
guage does not warrant it, turns pathos into burlesque, and
the scale may be turned from the sublime to the ridiculous
by the weight of a hair. Strength, flexibility and melody of
voice are of little worth if the judgment and the taste are
defective.
When reading is considered and treated as a branch of
æsthetic culture, then, and not till then, will it be fully effective
When the beggar implores your alms, he knows full well that
he must bring to his aid the melody of the semitone. We
once passed four beggars upon Harlem bridge, the first said,
“Pity the blind!” the second, “ Have mercy on the blind!”
the third, “ Help the blind!" and the fourth, “ Give to the
poor blind man!” All had the same tune, made up of semi
tonic slides, but when a policeman ordered them away, th
melody was changed to diatonic imprecations.

VII. METHODS FOR SELF-CULTURE.
The living teacher, as a model, is better than all books of
rules upon elocution; yet, if the pupil cannot be drilled by a
master in the art, he may study carefully some good work
upon the subject, and if he is observing and has no serious
defect of voice, may still make much progress in self-culture.
The following table of exercises are recommended as helps for
developing and improving the voice:
1. Breathing deeply and slowly, rapidly and explosively.
2. Reading in a whisper so distinctly as to be readily heard
thronghout a large room.
3. Reading loudly in doors, out of doors, and when running up
bill.
4. Read slowly and rapidly alternately.
5. Read high and low alternately.
6. Read heavy and gentle alternately.
7. Increase and diminish in force alternately.
8. Read up and down the musical scale alternately.
SPECIFICS.
1. For strength of voice loud explosive exercises.
2. For distinct enunciation the whisper or an aspirated voice.
3. For smoothness the medium stress with slow time.
4. For flexibility as rapidly as possible.
5. For meeting with any measure of success, keep the eyes and
Aars open and practice, practice, practice.
VIII. METHODS FOR TEACHING READING.
Probably no other branch in our schools is so poorly taught
s that of reading. There are many reasons why this is so,
erhaps the principal ones are these :
1. Teachers cannot themselves read well.
Now, it is possible, without doubt, for a person who cannot sing
very well to teach others to make more music than he can himself,
2*


## p. 34 (#56) ##############################################

34
EXERCISES IN ELOCUTION.
and just so with reading, but if he is proficient in the practice as
well as the theory, how much better can he teach.
The teacher should be familiar with the lesson. He should have
a well-defined plan in his mind concerning the manner in which it
shall be taught. He should decide previously what questions ho
will ask to arouse attention - how he will fix the lesson in the
mind.
2. The matter of the lessons is often far beyond the compreher -
sion of the pupil.
Many a child blunders on over a dissertation upon the “Problems
of the Universe" or the “Grandeur of the Ocean" withcat an idea
concerning the meaning of a sentence. The name of the author of
“Easy Lessons” should be honored during all time. Before the
publication of this book, the child of six or seven years of age
spelled out his lesson in the Testament or English Reader. Let the
teacher make selections of those pieces which the child can under-
stand.
3. The children do not study.
The teacher should see that the lesson is well prepared before it
is read. The knowledge of the child should be tested by question-
ing, and he should be ready to deſine every word if necessary, and
tell the story in his own language.
4. The lesson is often too lengthy.
Pupils are sometimes allowed to read a half dozen pages at a
leason, and then only once over, hurrying through from preface to
fiuis as if an enemy were in full pursuit, and liable to overtake them
at any moment. This is all wrong; a page or two is almost always
sufficient for a lesson. Let the piece be read in sections and after-
ward reviewed.
5. Children read after the teacher in concert or otherwise, having
no more intellectual drill than if they were so many parrots.
The Pestilozzian rule — “Never tell a child any thing which he
can discover for himself,” should be rigorously followed in teaching
reading. Let them criticise each other — the teacher questioning
adroitly until the correct rendering is given.
The following order of exercises in conducting primary
classes has been successfully followed :

The Creeds of the Bells.
How sweet the chime of the Sabbath bells I
Each one its creed in music tells,
Ju tones that float upon the air,
As soft as song, as pure as prayer,
And I will put in simple rhyme
The language of the golden chime;
My happy heart with rapture swells
Responsive to the bells, sweet bells.
“In deeds of love excell excel !”
Chimed out from ivied towers a bell;
“ This is the church not built on sands,
Emblem of one not built with hands;
Its forms and sacred rites revere,
Come worship liere I come worship here !
In rituals and faith excel !"
Chimed out the Episcopalian bell.
“O heed the ancient landmarks well !"
In solemn tones exclaimed a bell;
“No progress made by mortal man
Can change the just eternal plan :
With God there can be nothing new;
Ignore the false, embrace the true,
While all is well ! is well ! is well !"
Pealed out the good old Dutch church bell.

“ Though faith alone in Christ can save,
Man must be plunged beneath the wave,
To show the world unfaltering faith

Pealed out the clear-toned Baptist bell
“Not faith alone, but works as well,
Must test the soul !” said a soft bell;
" Come here and cast aside your load,
And work your way along the road,
With faith in God, and faith in man,
And hope in Christ, where hope began :
Do well I do well I do well I do well 1%

In touching tones exclaimed a bell;
“Life is a boon, to mortals given,
To fit the soul for bliss in Heaven ;
Do not invoke the avenging rod,
Come here and learn the way to God;
Say to the world, Farewell ! farewell pas
Pealed forth the Presbyterian bell.
“ To all the truth, we tell ! we tell !"
Shouted in ecstacies a bell,
“Come all ye weary wanderers, see !

Ode on the Passions.
WIEN Music, Heavenly maid, was young,
While yet in early Greece she sung,
The Passions oft, to hear her shell,
Thronged around her magic cell;
Exulting, trembling, raging, fainting,
Possessed beyond the Muse's painting,
By turns, they felt the glowing mind
Disturbed, delighted, raised, refined;
Till once, 't is said, when all were fired,
Filled with fury, rapt, inspired,
From the supporting myrtles round
They snatched her instruments of sound;
And, as they oft had heard apart
Sweet lessons of her forceful art,
Each - for madness ruled the hour -
Would prove his own expressive power.
First, Fear his hand, its skill to try,
Amid the chords bewildered laid;
And back recoiled, he knew not why,
E'en at the sound himself had made.
· Next, Anger rushed, his eyes on fire,
In lightnings owned his secret stings:
In one rude clash he struck the lyre,
And swept, with hurried hands, the strinya
With woful measures, wan Despair -
Low sullen sounds! — his grief beguiled;
A solemn, strange, and mingled air;
'T was sad, by fits, — by starts, 't was wild
But thou, O Hope! with eyes so fair,
What was thy delighted measure ?
Still it whispered promised pleasure,
And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail !
Still would her touch the strain prolong;

And, from the rocks, the woods, the vale,
She called on Echo still through all her song;
And, where her sweetest theme she chose,
A soſt responsive voice was heard at every close;
And Hope, enchanted, smiled, and waved her golden bair.
And longer had she sung — but, with a frown,
Revenge impatient rose.
He threw his blood-stained sword in thunder down;
And, with a withering look,
The war-denouncing trumpet took,
And blew a blast, so loud and dread,
Were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe;
And, ever and anon, he beat,
The doubling drum with furious heat.
And though, sometimes, cach dreary pause between,
Dejected Pity, at his side,
Her soul-subduing voice applied,
Yet still he kept his wild unaltered mien;
While each strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his head.
Thy numbers, Jealousy, to naught were fixed;
Sad proof of thy distressful state!
Of different themes the veering song was mixed :
And now it courted Love - now, raving, called on Hate
With eyes upraised, as one inspired,
Pale Melancholy sat retired;
And, from her wild sequestered seat,
In notes, by distance made more sweet,
Poured through the mellow horn her pensive soul:
And, dashing soft, from rocks around,
Bubbling runnels joined the sound;
Througlı glades and glooms the mingled measure stole:
Or o'er some haunted streams, with fond delay -
Round a holy calm diffusing,
Love of peace and lonely musing
In hollow murmurs died away.

When Cheerfulness, a nymph of healthiest hue,
Her bow across her shoulder Nung,
Her buskins gemmed with morning dew
Blew an inspiring air, that dalc and thicket rung..
The hunter's cail, to Faun and Dryad known!
The oak-crowned sisters, and their chaste-eyed queen,
Satyrs, and sylvan boys, were seen,
Peeping from forth their alleys green;

And Sport leaped up, and seized his beechen spear.
Last came Jor's ecstatic trial :
He, with viny crown advancing,
First to the lively pipe his hand addressed;
But soon he saw the brisk, awakening viol,
Whose sweet entrancing voice he loved the best.
They would have thought, who heard the strain,
They saw, in Tempe's vale, her native maids,
Anidst the festal sounding shades,
To some unwearied minstrel dancing:
While, as his flying fingers kissed the strings,
Love framed with MIRTI, a gay fantastic round,
Loose were her tresses seen, her zone unbound:
And he, amidst his frolic play,
As if he would the charming air repay,
Shook thousand odors from his dewy wings.

The ringers ran by two, by three;

Men say it was a stolen tyde -
The Lord that sent it, He knows all;
But in myne ears doth still abide
The message that the bells let fall:
And there was naught of strange, beside
The flights of mews and peewits pied
By millions crouched on the old sea wall.
I sat and spun within the doore,
My thread brake off, I raised myne eyes;
The level sun, like ruddy ore,
Lay sinking in the barren skies;
And dark against day's golden death
She moved where Lindis wandereth,
My sonne's faire wife, Elizabeth.
“ Cusha! Cusha! Cusha l" calling,
Ere the early dews were falling,
Farre away I heard her song.
“ Cusha! Cusha!” all along;
Where the reedy Lindis floweth,
Floweth, floweth,
From the meads where melick groweth,
Faintly came her milking song.
“Cusha! Cusha! Cusha!” calling,
“For the dews will soone be falling;
Leave your meadow grasses mellow,
Mellow, mellow;
Quit your cowslips, cowslips yellow;
Come uppe Whitefoot, come uppe Lightfoot;
Quit the stalks of parsley hollow,
Hollow, hollow;

From the clovers liſt your head;

If it be long, aye, long ago,
When I beginne to think howe long,
Againe I hear the Lindis flow,
Swift as an arrowe, sharpe and strong,
And all the aire it seemeth mee
Bin full of floating bells (sayth skee),
That ring the tune of Enderby.
Alle fresh the level pasture lay,
And not a shadowe mote be seene,
Save where full fyve good miles away
The steeple towered from out the greene;
And lol the great bell farre and wide
Was heard in all the country side
That Saturday at eventide.
Then some looked uppe into the sky,
And all along where Lindis flows
To where the goodly vessels lie,
And where the lordly steeple shows.
They sayde, “And why should this thing be,
What danger lowers by land or sea ?
They ring the tune of Enderby!
“For evil news from Mablethorpe,
Of pyrate galleys warping down;
For shippes ashore beyond the scorpe,
They have not spared to wake the towne:
But while the west bin red to see,
And storms be none, and pyrates flee,
Why ring The Brides of Enderby?'”
I looked without, and lol my sonne
Came riding downe with might and main :
He raised a shout as he drew on,
Till all the welkin rang again,

With that he cried and beat his breast;
For lo! along the river's bed
A mighty eygre reared his crest,
And up the Lindis raging sped.
It swept with thunderous noises loud;
Shaped like a curling snow-white cloud,
Or like a demon in a shroud.
And rearing Lindis backward pressed,
Shook all her trembling bankes amaine;
Then madly at the eygre's breast
Flung uppe her weltering walls again.
Then bankes came down with ruin and rout.-
Then beaten foam flew round about -
Then all the mighty floods were out.
So farre, so fast the eygre drave,
The heart had hardly time to beat,
Before a shallow seething wave
Sobbed in the grasses at oure feet:
The feet had hardly time to flee
Before it brake against the knee,
And all the world was in the sea

The noise of bells went sweeping by:
I marked the loſty beacon light
Stream from the church tower, red and high-
A lurid mark and dread to see;
And aweso:ne bells they were to mee,
That in the dark rang “Enderby.”
They rang the sailor lads to guide
From roofe to roofe who fearless rowed;
And I — my sonne was at my side,
And yet the ruddy beacon glowed:
And yet he moaned beneath his breath,
"O come in life, or come in death!
O lost! my love, Elizabeth.”
And didst thou visit him no more?
Thou didst, thou didst, my daughter deare;
The waters laid thee at his doore,
Ere yet the carly dawn was clear.

The liſted sun shone on thy face,
Downe drifted to thy dwelling-place.

Gems from Ruskin.
It was a niaxim of Raffaelle's that the artist's object was to make
things not as Nature makes them, but as she would make them; as
she ever tries to make them, but never succeeds, though her aim
may be deduced from a comparison of her effects; just as iſ a
number of archers had aimed unsuccessfully at a mark upon a wall,
and this mark were then removed, we could by the examination of
their arrow-marks point out the probable position of the spot aime
at, with a certainty of being nearer to it than any of their shots.
We have most of us heard of original sin, and may perhaps, in
our modest moments, conjecture that we are not quite what God,
or Nature, would have us to be. Raffaelle had something to mend
in humanity : I should like to have seen him mending a daisy, or a
pease-blossom, or a moth, or a mustard-seed, or any other of God's
slightest work! If he had accomplished that, one might have found

· for him more respectable employment, to set the stars in better
order, perhaps (they seem grievously scattered as they are, and to
be of all manner of shapes and sizes, except the ideal shape, and
the proper size); or, to give iis a correcteit view of the ocean, that at
least seems a very irregular and improveable thing: the very fisher-
men do not know this day liow far it will reach, driven up before
the west wind. Perhaps some one else does, but that is not our
business. Let us go down and stand on the beach by the sea — the
great irregular sea, and count whether the thunder of it is not out
of time-one, — two:— here comes a well-formed wave at last,
trembling a little at the top, but on the whole, orderly. Sol Crash
among the shingle, and up as far as this gray pebble! Now, stand
by and watch. Another: - Ali, careless wavel why couldn't you
have kept your crest on? It is all gone away into spray, striking
up against the cliffs there — I thought as much — missed the mark
by a couple of feet! Another:- How now, impatient one! couldn't
you have waited till your friend's reflux was done with, instead of
rolling yourself up with it in that unseemly manner? You go for
nothing. A fourth, and a goodly one at last! What think we of
yonder slow rise, and crystalline hollow, without a flaw? Steady,
good wave! not so fast! not so fast! Where are you coming to ?
This is too bad; two yards over the mark, and ever so much of you
in our face besides; and a wave which we had some hope of, behind
there, broken all to pieces out at sea, and laying a great white
tablecloth of foam all the way to the shore, as if the marine gods
were to dine off it! Alas, for these unhappy “arrow-shots” of
Nature! She will never hit her mark with those unruly waves
of hers, nor get one of them into the ideal shape, if we wait for a
thousand years.
Go out some bright sunny day in winter, and look for a tree with
a broad trunk, having rather delicate boughs hanging down on the
sunny side, near the trunk. Stand four or five yards from it, with
your back to the sun. You will find that the boughs between you
and the trunk of the tree are very indistinct, that you confound
them in places with the trunk itself, and cannot possibly trace one
of them from its insertion to its extremity. But the shadows
which they cast upon the trunk, you will find clear, dark and dis-

tinct, perfectly traceable through their whole course, except when
they are interrupted by the crossing boughs. And if you retiro
backwards, you will come to a point where you cannot see the
intervening boughs at all, or only a fragment of them here and
there, but can still see their shadows perfectly plain. Now, this
may serve to show you the iminense prominence and importance
of shadows where there is anything like bright light. They are, in
fact, commonly far more conspicuous than the thing which casts
them, for being as large as the casting object, and altogether mado
up of a blackness deeper than the darkest part of the casting object
(while that object is also broken up with positive and reflected
lights), their large, broad, unbroken spaces, tell strongly on the eye,
especially as all form is rendered partially, often totally invisible
within them, and as they are suddenly terminated by the sharpest
lines which nature ever shows. For no outline of objects whatso-
ever is so sharp as the edge of a close shadow. Put your finger
over a piece of white paper in the sun, and observe the difference
between the softness of the outline of the finger itself and the deci-
sion of the cdge of the shadow. And note also the excessive gloom
of the latter. A piece of black cloth, laid in the light, will not
attain one-fourth of the blackness of the paper under the shadow,
Hence shadows are in reality, when the sun is shining, the most
conspicuous thing in a landscape, next to the highest lights. All
forms are understood and explained chiefly by their agency: the
roughness of the bark of a tree, for instance, is not seen in the
light, nor in the shade; it is only seen between the two, where
the shadows of the ridges explain it. And hence, if we have to
express vivid light, our very first aiin must be to get the shadows
sharp and visible.
The second point to which I wish at present to direct attention
has reference to the arrangement of light and shade. It is the con-
stant habit of Nature to use both her highest lights and deepest
shadows in exceedingly small quantity; always in points, never in
masses. She will give a large mass of tender light in sky or water,
impressive by its quantity, and a large mass of tender shadow
relieved against it, in foliage, or hill, or building; but the light is
always subdued if it be extensive — the shadow always feeble if it
be broad. She will then fill up all the rest of her picture with
middle tints and pale grays of some sort or another, and on this

quiet and harmonious whole, she will touch her high ligh's in spots
- the foam of an isolated ware - the sail of a solitary vessel — the
llash of the sun from a wet roof — the gleam of a single white-
washed cottage - or some such sources of local brilliancy, she will
use so vividly and delicately as to throw everything else into
definite shade by comparison. And then taking up the gloom, sho
will use the black hollows of some overhanging bank, or the black
iress of some shaded figure, or the depth of some sunless chink of
wall or window, so sharply as to throw everything else into definito
light by comparison; thus reducing the whole mass of her picture
to a delicate middle tint, approaching, of course, here to light and
there to gloom; but yet sharply separated from the utmost degrees
either of the one or the other. None are in the right road to real
excellence, but those who are struggling to render the simplicity,
purity, and inexhaustible variety of nature's own chiaroscuro in
open, cloudless daylight, giving the expanse of harmonious light
- the speaking, decisive shadow — and the exquisite grace, tender-
Dess, and grandeur of aerial opposition of local color and cqually
illuminated lines.

site snore, and are launched at once into the bustle ard novelties
of another world.
I hare said that at sea all is racancy. I should correct the
expression. To one given up to day-dreaming, and fond of losing
himself in reveries, a sea-voyage is full of subjects for meditation;
but then they are the wonders of the deep, and of the air, and
rather tend to abstract the mind from worldly theincs. I delighted
to loll over the quarter-railing, or climb to the main-top on a calm
day, and muse for hours together on the tranquil bosom of a sum-
mer's sea; or to gaze upon the piles of golden clouds just peering
above the horizon, fancy them some fairy realms, and people them
with a creation of my own; or to watch the gentle undulating bil-
lows rolling their silver volumes as if to die away on those happy
shores.
There was a delicious sensation of mingled security and awe,
with which I looked down from my giddy height on the monsters
of the deep at their uncouth gambols; shoals of porpoises tumbling
about the bow of the ship; the grampus slowly heaving his hugo
form above the surface; or the ravenous shark, darting like a
spectre through the blue waters. My imagination would conjure
up all that I had heard or read of the watery world bencath me;
of the finny herds that roam its fathomless valleys; of shapeless
monsters that lurk among the rery founçations of the earth; and
those wild phantasms that swell the tales of fishermen and sailors.
Sometimes a distant sail gliding along the edge of the ocean
would be another theme of idle speculation. How interesting this
fragment of a world hastening to rejoin the great mass of exis-
tence! What a glorious monument of human invention, that has
thus triumphed over wind and wave; has brought the ends of the
carth in communion; has established an interchange of blessings,
pouring into the sterile regions of the north all the luxuries of the
south; diffused the light of knowledge and the charities of culti-
rated life; and has thus bound together those scattered portions of
the human race, between which nature seemed to hare thrown an
insurmountable barrier!
We one day descried some shapeless object drifting at a distance.
At sea, ererything that breaks the monotony of the surrounding
expanse, attracts attention. It proved to be the mast of a ship
that must have been completely wrecked; for there were the

remains of handkerchiefs, by which some of the crew had fastened
themselves to this spar, to prevent their being washed off by the
waves. There was no trace by which the name of the ship could
be ascertained. The wreck had evidently drifted about for many
months, clusters of shell-fish had fastened about it, and long sea-
weeds flaunted at its sides. But where, thought I, is the crew ?
Their struggle has long been over; — they have gone down amidst
the roar of the tempest;— their bones lie whitening in the caverns
of the deep. Silence – oblivion — like the waves, have closed
over them; and no one can tell the story of their end.
What sighs have been waſted after that ship! what prayers
offered up at the deserted fire-side of home! How often has the
mistress, the wife, and the mother, pored over the daily news, to
catch some casual intelligence of this rover of the deep! How has
expectation darkened into anxiety — anxiety into dread — and
dread into despair! Alas! not one memento shall ever return for
love to cherish. All that shall ever be known is, that she sailed
from her port, “and was never heard of more."
Washington Irving.
Bible - St. John, chapter IX.
And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from
bis birth.
And his disciples asked him, saying, Master, who did sin, this
man, or his parents, that he was born blind?
Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents:
but that the works of God should be made manifest in him.
I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day:
the night cometh, when no man can work.
As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world.
When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made
clay of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind man with
the clay.
And said unto him, Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is
by interpretation, Sent). He went his way, therefore, and washed,
and came seeing
The neighbors, therefore, and they which before had seen him
that he was blind, said, Is not this he that sut and begged ?

Sume said, This is he others said, He is like him: but he said,
I am he.
Therefore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened ?
He answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made a
clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool
of Siloam, and wash: and I went and washed, and I received sight
Then said they unto him, Where is he? He said, I know
pot.
They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind.
And it was the Sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, anı!
opened his eyes.
Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received
his sight. He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I
washed, and do see.
Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God,
because he keepeth not the Sabbath day. Others said, How can a
man that is a sinner do such miracles? And there was a division
among them.
They say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of him,
that he liath opened thine eyes ? Ile said, He is a prophet.
But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been
blind, and received his sight, until they called the parents of him
that had received his sight.
And then asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say
was born blind ? how then doth he now see?
His parents answered them and said, We know that this is
our son, and that he was born blind:
But by wliat means le now seeth, we know not; or who hath
opened his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall
speak for himself.
These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews:
for the Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that
he was Christ, he should be put out of the synagogue.
Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him.
Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto
him, Give God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner.
He answered and said, Whether he be a sinner or no, I know
not one thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see.

Death of Morris.
Vivid Narrative, exemplifying, after the introductory sentence, Sym.
pathetic Horror, then successively, Terror, Scorn, Revenge, Horror
and Awe.
It was under the burning influence of revenge that the wife of
Macgregor commanded that the hostage, exchanged for her hus-
band's safety, should be brought into her presence. I believe her
sons had kept this unfortunate wretch out of her sight, for fear of
the consequences; but if it was so, their humane precaution only
postponed his fate. They dragged forward, at her summons, a
wretch, already half dead with terror, in whose agonized features,
I recognized, to my horror and astonislıment, my old acquaintance
Jſorris.
He fell prostrate before the ſemale chief with an effort to clasp
her knees, from which she drew back, as if his touch had been pol-
lution, so that all he could do in token of the extremity of his
humiliation, was to kiss the hem of her plaid. I never heard
entreaties for life poured forth with such agony of spirit. Tha
ecstasy of fear was such, that, instead of paralyzing his tongue, as
on ordinary occasions, it eren rendered him eloquent; and, with
checks as pale as ashes, hands compressed in agony, eyes that
seemed to be taking their last look of all mortal objects, he pro-
tested, with the deepest oaths, his total ignorance of any design on
the life of Rob Roy, whom he swore he loved and honored as his
own soul. In the inconsistency of his terror, he said he was but
the agent of others, and he muttered the name of Rashleigh. He
prayed but for life — for life he would give all lie had in the world;
- it was but life he asked — liſe, if it were to be prolonged under
tortures and privations, — he asked only breath though it should
be drawn in the damps of the lowest caverns of their hills.
It is impossible to describe the scorn, the loathing, and contempt,
with which the wife of Macgregor regarded this wretched petitioner
for the poor boon of existence.
"I could have bid you live," she said, “had life been to you the
same weary and wasting burden that it is to me — that it is to
every noble and generous mind. But you — wretch! you could
creep through the world unaffected by its various disgraces, its
ineffable miseries, its constantly accumulating masses of crime and
sorrow, - you could live and enjoy yourself, while the noble-minded

are betrayed, — while nameless and birthless villains tread on the
neck of the brave and long-descended, — you could enjoy yourself,
like a bitcher's dog in the shambles, battening on garbage, while
the slaughter of the brave went on around you! This enjoyment
you shall not live to partake of; you shall die, base dog, and that
Lefore yon cloud has passed over the sun."
She gave a brief command, in Gaelic, to her attendants, two of
whom seized upon the prostrate suppliant, and liurried him to the
brink of a cliff which orerhung the flood. Ile set up the most
piercing and dreadful cries that fear ever uttered — I may well term
them dreadful; for they haunted my sleep for years afterwards.
As the murderers, or cxecutioners, call them as you will, dragged
lim along, le recognized me even in that moment of liorror, and
exclaimed, in the last articulate words I ever heard him utter, "O,
Mr. Osbaldistone, save me! — sare mo!".
I was so much mored by this horrid spectacle, that, although in
momentary expectation of sharing his fate, I did attempt to speak
in his behalf, but, as might have been expected, my interference
was stern'y disregarded. The victim was held fast by some, while
others, binding a large heavy stone in a plaid, tied it around his
neck, and others again eagerly stripped him of some part of
his dress. Half naked, and thus manacled, they hurried him into
the lake, there about twelve feet deep, drowning his last death-
shriek with a loud halloo of vindictive triumplı, over which,
however, the yell of mortal agony was distinctly heard. The heavy
burden splashed in the dark blue waters of the lake; and the High-
landers, with their pole-axes and swords, watched an instant, to
guard, lest, extricating himself from the load to which he was
attached, he might have struggled to regain the shore. But the
knot had been securely bound; the victim sunk without effort;
the waters, which his fall had disturbed, settled calmly over him;
and the unit of that life for which he had pleaded so strongly, was
forever withdrawn from the sum of human existence.

the man is ubiquitous. Wherever I go with my cousin Prudence
we stumble across him, or he follows her like her shadow. Do we
takt a boating? So does Jones. Do we wander on the beach ? So

Beadle's Dime Speaker.
The Front and Side Doors.
Every person's feelings have a front-door and a side-door by
which they may be entered. The front-door is on the street. Some
keep it always open; some keep it latched; some, locked ; some,
bolted,—with a chain that will let you peep in, but not get in ;
and some nail it up, so that nothing can pass its threshold. This
front-door leads into a passage which opens into an ante-room,
and this into the interior apartments. The side-dour opens at
once into the sacred chambers.
There is almost always at least one key to this side-door. This
is carried for years hidden in a mother's bosom. Fathers, bro-
thers, sisters, and friends, often, but by no means so vniversely,
have duplicates of it.

It was one day more of smoke and roar,
And then it would all be done.
There was one of us, a corporal's wife,
A fair young gentle thing,
Wasted with fever in the siege,
And her mind was wandering.
She lay on the ground, in her Scottish plaid,
And I took her head on my knee;
“When my father comes hame frae the pleugh,” she said,
“Oh! please then waken me.”
She slept like a child on her father's floor,
In the flecking of woodbine shade,
When the house dog sprawls by the half open door,
And the mother's wheel is stayed.
It was smoke and roar and powder stench,
And hopeless waiting for death;
But the soldier's wife, like a full tired child,
Seemed scarce to draw her breath.
I sank to sleep and I had my dream
Of an English village lane
And wall and garden — till a sudden scream
Brought me back to the rear again.
There Jessie Brown stood listening,
And then a broad gladness broke
All over her face, and she took my hand,
And drew me near and spoke:
"The Highlanders! 01 dinna ye hear

Tt is the grandest of thein a'. .

We 're sared! we 're saved !" she cried;
And fell on her knees, and thanks to God
Poured forth, like a full food tide.
Along the battery line her cry
Had fallen among the men ;
And they started; for they were there to die,
Was life so near them then ?
They listened, for life, and the rattling lire
Far off, and the far off roar
Were all, - and the colonel shook his head,
And they turned to their guns once more.
Then Jessie said, “The slogan's dune,
But can ye no hear them, noo ?
The Campbells are comin! It's nac a dream,
Our succors hae broken through !"
We heard the roar and the rattle afar,
But the pipers we could not hear;
So the men plied their work of hopeless war,
And knew that the end was near.
It was not long cre it must be heard,
A shrilling, ceaseless sound;
It was no noise of the striſe afar,
Or the sappers under ground.
It was the pipe of the Highlanders,
And now they played “Auld Lang Syne;"
It came to our men like the voice of God;
And they shouted along the line.
And they wept and shook each other's hands,
And the women sobbed in a crowd ;

And every one knelt down where we stood,
And we all thanked God aloud.
That happy day, when we welcomed them iu,
Our men put Jessie first;
And the General took her hand; and cheers
From the men like a volley burst.
And the pipers' ribbons and tartan streamed,
Marching round and round our line;
And our joyful cheers were broken with tears,
And the pipers played “ Auld Lang Syne."

Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.

O hark, O hear! how thin and clear,
And thinner, clearer, farther going;
O swcet and far, from cliff and scar,
The horns of Ell-land faintly blowing!
Blow; let us hear the purple glens replying;
Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.

O love, they die in yon rich sky,
They faint on field, on hill, on river;
Our echoes roll from soul to soul,
And grow ſorever and forever.
Blow, bugle, blow; set the wild echoes flying,
And answer, echoes, answer dying, dying, dying.

Roll Call.
"Corporal Green !" the Orderly cried;
"Here!" was the answer, loud and clear
From the lips of the soldier who stood ncar,-
And “Here!" was the word the next replied.
“Cyrus Drew!"— then a silence fell,
This time no answer followed the call;
Only his rear-man had seen him fall,
Killed or wounded, he could not tell.
There they stood in the failing light,
These men of battle, with grave, dark looks,
As plain to be read as open books,
While slowly gathered the shades of night.
The fern on the hill-sides was splashed with blood,
And down in the corn where the poppies grew
Were redder stains than the poppies knew;
And crimson-dyed was the river's llood.
For the foe had crossed from the other side
That day, in the face of a murderous firo
That swept them down in its terrible ire;
And their life-blood went to color the title.
“Herbert Kline!" At the call there came
Two stalwart soldiers into the line,
Bearing between them this IIerbert Kline,
Wounded and bleeding, to answer his name.
“Ezra Kerr!” — and a voice answered, “Here!"
"Hiram Kerr!” – but no man replied.
They were brothers, these two, the sad winds sighed,
And a shudder crept through the cornfield near.
“Ephraim Deane!" — then a soldier spoke:
“Deane carried our Regiment's colors,” he said;
“Where our Ensign was shot, I left him dead,
Just after the enemy wavered and broke."

Pyramus and Thisbe.
This tragical tale, which, they say, is a true one,
Is old; but the manner is wholly a new one.
One Ovid, a writer of some reputation,
Has told it before in a tedious narration:
In a style, to be sure, of remarkable fullness,
But which nobody reads on account of its dullness
Young PETER PYRAMUS — I call him Peter,
Not for the sake of the rhyme or the meter;
But merely to make the name completer —
For Peter lived in the olden times,
And in one of the worst of pagan climes
That flourish now in classical fame,
Long before either noble or boor
Had such a thing as a Christian name-
Young Peter, then, was a nice young beau
As any young lady would wish to know:
In years, I ween, he was rather green,
That is to say, he was just eighteen -
A trifle too short, a shaving too lean,
But "a nice young man" as ever was seen,
And fit to dance with a May-day queen !
Now Peter loved a beautiful girl
As ever ensnared the heart of an earl,

In the magical trap of an auburn curl, -.
A little Miss Thisbe, who lived next door,
(They lived, in fact, on the very same floor,
With a wall between them and nothing more, -
Those double dwellings were common of yore,)
And they loved each other, the legends say,
In that very beautiful, bountiful way,
That every young maid and every young blade
Are wont to do before they grow staid,
And learn to love by the laws of trade.
But (a-lack-a-day, for the girl and boy !)
A little impediment checked their joy,
And gave them awhile, the deepest annoy,
For some good reason, which history cloaks,
The match didn't happen to please the old folks!
So Thisbe's father and Peter's mother
Began the young couple to worry and bother,
And tried their innocent passion to smother,
By keeping the lovers from seeing each other!
But who ever heard of a marriage deterred
Or even deferred
By any contrivance so very absurd
As scolding the boy, and caging the bird ?
Now, Peter, who was not discouraged at all
By obstacles such as the timid appal,
Contrived to discover a hole in the wall,
Which wasn't so thick but removing a brick
Made a passage — though rather provokingly small.
Through this little chink the lover could greet her,
And secrecy made their courting the sweeter,
While Peter kissed Thisbe, and Thisbe kissed Peter --
For kisses, like folks with diminutive souls,
Will manage to creep through the smallest of holes !
'T was here that the lovers, intent upon love,
Laid a nice little plot to meet at a spot
Near a mulberry-tree in a neighboring grove;

For the plan was all laid by the youth and the maid,
Whose hearts, it would seem, were uncommonly bold oem
To run off and get married in spite of the old ones.
In the shadows of evening, as still as a mouse,
The beautiful maiden slipped out of the house,
The mulberry-tree impatient to find;
While Peter, the vigilant matrons to blind,
Strolled leisurely out, some minutes behind.
While waiting alone by the trysting tree,
A terrible lion as e'er you set eye on,
Came roaring along quite horrid to see,
And caused the young maiden in terror to flee,
(A lion's a creature whose regular trade is
Blood — and " a terrible thing among ladies,")
And losing her veil as she ran from the wood,
The monster bedabbled it over with blood.
Now Peter arriving, and seeing the veil
All covered o'er and reeking with gore,
Turned, all of a sudden, exceedingly pale,
And sat himself down to weep and to wail,
For, soon as he saw the garment, poor Peter,
Made up his mind in very short meter,
That Thisbe was dead, and the lion had eat her!
So breathing a prayer, lre determined to share
The fate of his darling, “ the loved and the lost,"
And fell on his dagger, and gave up the ghost!
Now Thisbe returning, and viewing her beau,
Lying dead by her veil (which she happened to know)
She guessed in a moment the cause of his erring;
And seizing the knife that had taken his life,
In less than a jiffy was dead as a herring.
MORAL.
Young gentleman l-pray recollect, if you please,
Not to make appointments near mulberry-trees.

Evening at the Farm.
Over the bill the farm-boy goes,
His shadow lengthens along the land,
A giant staff in a giant hand;
In the poplar-tree, above the spring,
The katy-did begins to sing ;
The early dews are falling ;-
Into the stone-heap darts the mink;
The swallows skim the river's brink;
And home to the woodland fly the crows,
When over the hill the farm-boy goes,
Cheerily calling,
“Co', boss! co', boss! co’! co'l co']"
Farther, farther, over the hill,
Faintly calling, calling still,
“ Co', boss ! co', boss! co'l co?!”
.
Now to her task the milkmaid goes.
The cattle come crowding through the gate,
Looing, pushing, little and great;
About the trough, by the farm-yard pump,
The frolicsome yearlings frisk and jump,
While the pleasant dews are falling ;--
The new milch heifer is quick and shy,
But the old cow waits with tranquil eye,
And the white stream into the bright pail flows,
When to her task the milkmaid goes,
Soothingly calling.
." So, boss ! so, boss 1 801 sol so ?"

The cheerful milkmaid takes her stool, .
And sits and milks in the twilight cool,
Saying, “So I so, boss! sol so !"
To supper at last the farmer goes.
The apples are pared, the paper read,
The stories are told, then all to bed.
Without, the crickets' ceaseless song
Makes shrill the silence all night long;
The heavy dews are falling.
The housewife's hand has turned the lock;
Drowsily ticks the kitchen clock;
The household sinks to deep repose,
But still in sleep the farm-boy goes
Singing, calling,–
“Co', boss! co', boss! co'l co'l co?!”
And oft the milkmaid, in her dreams,
Drums in the pail with the flashing streams,
Murmuring, “So, boss ! so!”

Putting up Stoves.
'Obers who has had considerable experience in the work of put-
ting up stoves says the first step to be taken is to put on a very
old and ragged coat, under the impression that when he gets his
mouth full of plaster it will keep his shirt bosom clean. Next he
gets his hands inside the place where the pipe ought to go, and
blacks his fingers, and then he carefully makes a black mark down
one side of his nose. It is impossible to make any headway, in
doing this work, until this mark is made down the side of the nose.
Having got his face properly marked, the victim is ready to begin
the ceremony. The head of the family—who is the big goose of the
sacrifice--grasps one side of the bottom of the stove, and his wife
and the hired girl take hold of the other side. In this way the load
is started from the wood-shed toward the parlor. Going through
the door the head of the family will carefully swing his side of the
stove around, and jam his thumb-nail against the door-post. This
part of the ceremony is never omitted. Having got the stove

comfortably in place, the next thing is to find the legs. Two of
these are left inside the stove since the spring before. The other
two must be hunted after for twenty-five minutes. They are
usually found under the coal. Then the head of the family holds
up one side of the stove while his wife puts two of the legs in
place, and next he holds up the other side while the other two is
fixed, and one of the first two falls out. By the time the stove is
on its legs he gets reckless, and takes off his old coat regardless
of his linen. Then he goes off for the pipe, and gets a cinder in
his eye. It don't make any difference how well the pipe was put
up last ycar, it will be found a little too short or a little too long.
The head of the family jams his bat over his eyes, and, taking a
pipe under each arm, goes to the tin shop to have it fixed. When
ne gets back he steps upon one of the best parlor chairs to see if
the pipe fits, and his wife makes him get down for fear he will
scratch the varnish off from the chair with the nails in his boot-
heel. In getting down he will surely step on the cat, and may
thank his stars if it is not the baby. Then he gets an old chair,
and climbs up to the chimney again, to find that in cutting the
pipe off, the end bas been left too big for the hole in the chimney.
So he goes to the wood-shed, and splits one side of the end of the
pipe with an old axe, and squeezes it in his hands to make it
smaller. Finally he gets the pipe in shape, and finds that the
stove does not stand true. Then himself and wife and the hired
girl move the stove to the left, and the legs fall out again. Next
it is to move to the right. More difficulty with the legs Moved
to the front a little. Elbow not even with the hole in the chimney,
and he goes to the wood-shed after some little blocks. While
putting the blocks under the legs, the pipe comes out of the
chimney. That remedied, the elbow keeps tipping over to the
great alarm of the wife. Head of the family gets the dinner-table
out, puts the old chair on it, gets his wife to hold the chair, and
balances himself on it to drive some nails into the ceiling. Drops
the hammer on to wife's head. At last gets the nails driven,
makes a wire-swing to hold the pipe, hammers a little here, pulls
a little there, takes a long breath, and announces the ceremony
completed.
Job never put up any stoves. It would have rui..ed his reputa-
tion if he had.

Tribute to Water.
Paul Denton, a Methodist preacher in Texas, advertised a barbecue
with better liquor than is usually furnished. When the people were as.
sembled, a desperado in the crowd walked up to him, and cried out:
“ Mr. Denton, your reverence has lied. You promised not only a good
barbecue, but better liquor. Where's the liquor ?"
"THERE!" answered the preacher, in tones of thunder, and pointing
nis motionless finger at a spring gushing up in two strong columns, with
a sound like a shout of joy, from the bosom of the earth.
" THERE!” he repeated, with a look terrible as lightning, while
his enemy actually trembled at his feet; "there is the liquor which
God, the Eternal, brews for all His children. Not in the simmering
still, over smoky fires, choked with poisonous gases, surrounded
with the stench of sickening odors and corruptions, doth your
Father in heaven prepare the precious essence of life--pure, cold
water; but in the green glade and grassy dell, where the red deer
wanders, and the child loves to play, there God brews it; and down
low down in the deepest valleys, were the fountain murmurs and
the rills sing; and high upon the mountain tops, where the naked
granite glitters like gold in the sun, where the storm-cloud broods
and the thunder-storms crash; and far out on the wide, wild sea,
where the hurricane howls music, and the big wave rolls the chorus,
sweeping the march of God—there He brews it, that beverage of
life-health-giving water.
“And everywhere it is a thing of life and beauty-gleaming in
the dew-drop; singing in the summer rain; shining in the ice-gem,
till the trees all seem turned to living jewels; spreading a golden
Teil over the setting sun, or a white gauze around the midnight
moon; sporting in the glacier; folding its bright snow-curtain softly
about the wintery world; and weaving the many-colored bow, that
seraph's zone of the siren-whose warp is the rain-drops of earth,
whose woof is the sunbeam of heaven, all checked over with celes-
tial flowers, by the mystic hand of refraction.
“Still always it is beautiful—that blessed life-water! No
poisonous bubbles are on its brink; its foam brings cot madness and
murder; no blood stains its liquid glass; pale widows and starving
cophans weep not burning tears in its depths; no drunkard's shrink-
ing ghost, from the grave, curses it in the worlds of eternal despair!
Speak out, my friends: would you exchange it for the demon's
drink, AL.COHOL ?" A shout, like the rour of a tempest, answered,
“No!"

Claribel's Prayer.
The day, with cold, gray feet, clung shivering to the hills,
· While o'er the valley still night's rain-fringed curtains fell;
But waking Blue Eyes smiled, “ 'Tis ever as God wills;
He knoweth best; and be it rain or shine, 'tis well.
Praise God l” cried always little Claribel.
Then sank she on her knees, with eager, lifted hands;
Her rosy lips made haste some dear request to tell:
“O Father smile, and save this fairest of all lands,
And make her free, whatever hearts rebel.
Amen! Praise God I” cried little Claribel.
“And, Father,': —still arose another pleading prayer,-
“O, save my brother, in the rain of shot and shell;
Let not the death-bolt, with its horrid, streaming hair
Dash light from those sweet eyes I love so well.
"But, Father, grant that when the glorious fight is done,
And up the crimson sky the shouts of Freedom swell,
Grant that there be no nobler victor 'neath the sun
Than he whose golden hair I love so well.
Amen! Praise Godl” cried little Claribel.
When the gray and dreary day shook hands with grayer night,
The heavy air was filled with clangor of a bell.
"O, shoutl" the herald cried, his worn eyes brimmed with light;
“'Tis victory! O, what glorious news to tell I ”
“ Praise God! He heard my prayer," cried Claribel.
“But, pray you, soldier, was my brother in the fight?
And in the fiery rain? O, fought he brave and well ?”
“Dear child," the herald cried, “there was no braver sight
Than his young form, so grand 'mid shot and shell.”
“Praise Godl" cried trembling little Claribel.
“And rides he now with victor's plumes of red,
While trumpets' golden throats his coming steps foretell P"
The herald dropped a tear. “ Dear child,” he softly said,
“Thy brother evermore with conquerors shall dwell."
“Praise God! He heard my prayer," cried Claribel.

“ With vietors wearing crowns and bearing palms," he said,
A snow of sudden fear upon the rose lips fell.
“O, sweetest herald, say my brother lives," she plead.
“Dear child, he walks with angels, who in strength excel
Praise God, who gave this glory, Ciaribel."
The cold, gray day died sobbing on the weary hills,
While bitter mourning on the night wind rose and fell.
“O, child," —the herald wept,"'tis as the dear Lord wills:
He knoweth best, and, be it life or death, 'tis well."
" Amen! Praise God!" sobbed little Claribel.

The Skeleton in Armor
This poem was suggested by the Round Tower at Newport, DOW
claimed by the Danes, as a work of their ancestors.
“Speak! speak! thou fearful guest !
Who, with thy hollow breast
Stiil in rude armor drest
Comest to daunt me!
Wrapt not in Eastern balms,
But with thy fleshless palms
Stretched, as if asking alms,
Why dost thou haunt me?"
Then, from those cavernous eyes
Pale flashes seemed to rise,
As when the Northern skies
Gleam in December;
And, like the water's flow
Under December's snow,
Came a dull voice of woe
From the heart's chamber.

No Scald in song has told,
No Saga taught thee!

I must give you portraits of all my flock of children; who now,
having enjoyed their evening meal, are laid to rest upon their soft
pillows. Ahl if I had only a really good portrait - I mean a
painted one of my Henrik, my first born, my summer child, as I
call him — because he was born on a midsummer-day, in the sum-
:er hours both of my life and my fortune; but only the pencil of
a Correggio could represent those beautiful, kind, blue eyes, those
golden locks, that loving mouth, and that all so pure and beautiful
countenance! Goodness and joyfulness beam out from his whole
being; even although his buoyant animal life, which seldom allows
his arms or legs to be quiet, often expresses itself in not the most
agreeable manner. My eleven-years-old boy is, alas! very — his
father says — very unmanageable. Still, notwithstanding all his
wildness, he is possessed of a deep and restless fund of sentiment,
which makes me often tremble for his future happiness. Gail

this child; and on that very account I will now pass on from

Behold then the little Louise, our eldest daughter, just turned ten
years old; and you will see a grave, fair girl, not handsome, but
with a round, sensible face; from which I hope, by degrees, to
remove a certain ill-tempered expression. She is uncommonly
industrious, and kind toward her younger sisters, although very
much disposed to lecture them; nor will she allow any opportunity
to pass in which her importance as "eldest sister" is not observed;
on which account the little ones give her already the title of “ Your
Majesty," and “Mrs. Judge.” The little Louise appears to me one
of those who will always be still and sure; and who, on this account,
will go fortunately through the world.

Nos. 3 and 4 ought not properly to come together. Poor Lenore
had a sickly childhood, and this rather, I believe, than nature, has
given to her an unsteady and violent temper, and has unhappily
sown the seeds of envy, toward her more fortunate sisters. She
is not deficient in deep feeling, but the understanding is sluggish,
and it is extremely difficult for her to learn anything. All this
promises no pleasure; rather the very opposite. The expression
of her mouth, even in the uncomfortable time of teething, seemed
to speak, “Let me be quiet!" It is hardly possible that she can be
other than plain, but, with God's help, I hope to make her good
and happy.
“My beloved, plain child !" say I sometimes to her as I clasp her
tenderly in my arms, for I would willingly reconcile her early to
her fate.

But whatever will fate do with the nose of my Petrea ? This
nose is at present the most remarkable thing about her; and if it
were not so large, she really would be a pretty child. We hope,
however, that it will moderate itself in her growth.
Petrea is a little lively girl, with a turn for almost everything,
whether good or bad, and with a dangerous desire to make herself
remarkable, and to excite an interest. Her activity shows itself in
destructiveness; yet she is good-hearted and most generous. In
every kind of foolery she is a most willing ally with Henrik and
Eva, whenever they will grant her so much favor; and if these
three be heard whispering together, one may be quite sure that
some roguery or other is on foot. There exists already, however,
80 much unquiet in her, that I fear her whole life will be such; but
I will early teach her to turn herself to that which can change
unrest into rest.

And now to the pet child of the house — for the youngest, the
loveliest, the so-called "little one" – to her who with her white
hands puts the sugar into the father's and mother's cup - the coffee
without that would not taste good — to her whose little bed is not
yet removed from the chamber of the parents, and who, every
morning, creeping out of her own bed, lays her bright, curly little
head on her father's shoulder, and sleeps again.
Could you only see the little two-years-old Gabriele, with her
large, ser.ous brown eyes; her refined, somewhat pale, but indes-
cribably lovely countenance; her bewitching little gestures; you
would be just as much taken with her as the rest, you would find
it difficult, as we all do, not to show preference to her. She is a
quiet little child, but very unlike her eldest sister. A predominating
characteristic of Gabriele is love of the beautiful; she shows a
decided aversion to what is ugly and inconvenient, and as decided
a love for what is attractive. A most winning little gentility in
appearance and manners, has occasioned the brother and sisters to
call her “the little young lady," or “the little princess." Henrik
is really in love with his little sister, kisses her small white hands
with devotion, and in return she loves him with her whole heart.
Towards the others she is very often somewhat ungracious, and our
good friend the Assessor calls her frequently “the little gracious
one," and frequently also “ the little ungracious one," but then he
has for her especially so many names; my wish is that in the end
she may deserve the surname of "the amiable.”
Peace be with my young ones! There is not one of them which
is not possessed of the material of peculiar virtue and excellence,
and yet not also at the same time of the seed of some dangerous
vice, which may ruin the good growth of God in them. May the
endeavors both of their father and me be blessed in training these
plants of heaven aright!

The Face against the Pana
Mabel, little Mabel,
With her face against the pane,
Looks out across the night,
A trembling in the rain.
She hears the sea bird screech,
And the breakers on the beach
Making moan, making moan,
And the wind about the eaves
Of the cottage sobs and grieves,
And the willow tree is blown
To and fro, to and fro,
Till it seems like some old crone
Standing out there all alone with her woe,
Wringing as she stands
Her gaunt and palsied hands;
While Mabel, timid Mabel,
With her face against the pane,
Looks out across the night
And sees the beacon light
A trembling in the rain.
Set the table, maiden Mabel,
And make the cabin warm,
Your little fisher lover
Is out there in the storm;
And your father, you are weeping.
O, Mabel, timid Mabel,
Go spread the supper table,
And set the tea a steeping;
Your lover's heart is brave,
His boat is staunch and tight,
And your father knows
The perilous reef,
That makes the water white.
But Mabel, Mabel darling,

With her face against the pane,
Looks out across the night
At the beacon in the rain.
The heavens are veined with fire!
And the thunder how it rolls !
In the lullings of the storm
The solemn church bell tolls
For lost souls !
But no sexton sounds the knell ;
In that belfry old and high,
Unseen fingers sway the bell
As the wind goes tearing by!
How it tolls, for the souls
Of the sailors on the sea.
God pity them! God pity them!
Wherever they may be.
God pity wives and sweethearts
Who wait and wait in vain,
And pity little Mabel,
With her face against the pane!
A boom! the light house gun,
How it echoes, rolls and rolls,
'Tis to warn home bound ships
: Off the shoals.
See, a rocket cleaves the sky
From the fort, a shaft of light!
See, it fades, and fading leaves
Golden furrows on the night!
What makes Mabel's cheek so pale ?
What makes Mabel's lips so white?
Did she see the helpless sail
That tossing here aud there
Like a feather in the air,
Went down and out of sight,
Down, down and out of sight?

O, watch no more, no more,
With face against the pane -
You cannot see the men that drown
By the beacon in the rain |
From a shoal of richest rubies
Breaks the morning clear and cold,
And the angel on the village spire,
Frost touched, is bright as gold.
Four ancient fishermen
In the pleasant autumn air,
Come toiling up the sands,
With something in their hands.
Two bodies stark and white,
Ahl so ghastly in the light,
With sea weed in their hair.
O, ancient fishermen
Go up to yonder cot!
You'll find a little child
With face against the pane,
Who looks toward the beach
And looking sees it not.
She will never watch again,
Never watch and wake at nighty
For those pretty saintly eyes
Look beyond the stormy skies,
And they see the beacon light.

And one of them shot in the west by the sea.

But this woman, this, who is agonized here,
The east sea, and the west sea rhyme on in her head
Forever instead!
What 's art for a woman? To hold on her knees
Both darlings) to feel all their arms round her throat
Cling, strangle a littlel to sew by degrees,
And 'broider the long clothes and neat little coat;
To dream and to dote.
To teach them. It stings there: I made them, indeed,
Speak plain the word country, - I taught them, no doubt,
That a country's a thing men should die for at need.
I prated of liberty, rights, and about
The tyrant turned out.
And when their eyes flashed. O, my beautiful eyes !
I exulted! Nay, let them go forth at the wheels
Of the guns, and denied not. But then the surprise
When one sits quite alone! then one weeps, then one kneels |
– God I how the house feels !
At first happy news came, in gay letters moiled
With my kisses, of camp life and glory, and how
They both loved me, and soon, coming home to be spoiled,
In return would fan off every fly from my brow
With their green laurel bough.
Then was triumph at Turin, Ancona was free,
And some one came out of the cheers in the street,
With a face pale as stone, to say something to me.
My Guido was dead! I fell down at his feet
While they cheered in the street.
I bore it I friends soothed me; my grief looked sublime
As the ransom of Italy. One boy yet remained
To be leant on, and walked with, recalling the time
When the first grew immortal, while both of us strained
To the height he had gained.

Anil letters still came, shorter, sadder, more strong,
Writ now but in one hand. I was not to faint.
One loved me for two; would be with me ere long:
And “Viva Italia” he died for, our saint,
“Who forbids our complaint.”
My Nanni would add he“ was safe, and aware
Of a presence that turned off the balls, was imprest
It was Guido himself who knew what I could bear
And how 'twas impossible, quite dispossessed
To live on for the rest."
On which without pause up the telegraph line
Swept smoothly the next news from Gaeta:
Shot. Tell his mother. Ah! ah! “his,” “their” mother, not“mine ·
No voice says my mother again to me. What!
You think Guido forgot ?
Are souls straight so happy that, dizzy with Heaven,
They drop earth's affections, conceive not of woe?
I think not. Themselves were too lately forgiven
Through that love and that sorrow that reconciles so
The Above and Below.
O Christ of the seven wounds, who look'st thro' the dark
To the face of thy mother! consider I pray,
How we common mothers stand desolate, mark,
Whose sons not being Christ's, die with eyes turned away,
And no last word to say |
Both boys dead! but that's out of nature. We all
Flave been patriots, yet each house must always keep one.
'Twere imbecile hewing out roads to a wall.
And, when Italy's made, for what end is it done
If we have not a son?
Ahl ahl ahl when Gaeta's taken, what then?
When the fair wicked queen sits no more at her sport

Of the fire-balls of death, crashing souls out of men,
When the guns of Cavalli with final retort,
Have cut the game short.
When Venice and Rome keep their new jubilee,
When your flag takes all heaven for its green white and red,
When you have a country from mountain to sea,
When King Victor has Italy's crown on his head,
And I have my dead.
What then? Do not mock me. Ah! ring your bells low,
And burn your lights faintly. My country is there,
Above the star pricked by the last peak of snow;
My Italy's there, with my brave civic pair,
To disfranchise despair.
Deadl one of them shot by the sea in the west,
And one of them shot in the east by the sea.
Both! both my boys! If in keeping the feast
You want a great song for your Italy free,
Let none look at me.

May Days.
In sweet May time, so long ago,
I stood by the big wheel spinning tow,
Buzz, buzz, so very slow;
Derk, rough logs from the ancient trees,
Fire-place wide for the children's glees.
Above the smoky boards and beams,
Down through the crevice poured golden gleams,
Till the wheel dust glimmered like diamond dreams ;
Mother busy with household care,
Baby playing with upturned chairs,
Old clock telling how fast time wears.
These within. Out under the sky
Flecked mists were sailing, birds flitting by
Joyous children playing “I spy."
Up from the earth curled leaves were coming,
Bees in the morning sunshine humming,
Away in the woods the partridge drumming.

EXERCISES IN ELOCUTION.
O, how I longed to burst away
From my dull task to the outer day;
But we were poor and I must stay.
So buzz! buzz 1 — 'twas very slow,
Drawing threads from the shining tow,
When the heart was dancing so.
Then hope went spinning a brighter thread,
On, on, through life's long lane it led,
A path my feet should one day tread.
So pleasant thoughts would time beguile,
Till my mother said, with beaming smile,
“My child may rest, I will reel awhile."
Rest! 'twas the rest that childhood takes.
Off over fences and fragrant brakes,
To the wilds, where the earliest woodland Alings
Spring of the year, and life's sweet spring,
Words are poor for the thoughts ye bring.
But ye come together to me no more,
Your twin steps rest on the field of yore,
Ye are mine on yonder immortal shore.
'Twas hard to leave those bright May days,
The mossy path, and leafy maze
For common work, and humdrum ways.
But my steps were turned, I was up the lane,
Back to the buzzing wheel again,
My yarn had finished the ten knot skein;
And my gentle mother stroked my head,
“Your yarn is very nice," she said,
“It will make a beautiful tablespread."
"You are my good girl to work so well,”
Great thoughts my childish heart would swell,
'Till the happy tears like rain drops fell.
I would toil for her, I would gather lore,
From many books a mighty store,
And pay her kindness o'er and o'er.

She should work no more at wheel or loom,
My earnings should give her a cozy room,
Bright and warm for the winter's gloom,
A soft arm chair for her weary hours,
Books and music, pictures, flowers.
So the sweet dream ran, as the wheel buzzed on,
'Till the golden gleams of light were gone,
And the chilling rain came dripping down,
Ah! my heart has it e'er been so,
Cold clouds shading life's sunniest glow,
Warm hopes drowned in the cold wave's flow.
In the same low room iny mother pressed,
Each child to her softly heaving breast,
And closed her eyes and went to rest.
The old walls crumbled long ago,
Hushed the big wheel's buzzing slow,
Worn to shreds is the shining tow.
Yet with the bursting leaves and flowers,
The gushing songs and pearly showers,
Life brightens as in childhood's hours,
And hope this golden morn in May
Spins golden threads that float away
To a heavenly home that is bright for aye.
Scrooge and Marley.
MARLEY was dead to begin with. There is no doubt whatever
about that. The register of his burial was signed by the clergy.
man, the clerk, the undertaker, and the chief mourner. Scrooge
signed it: and Scrooge's name was good upon 'Change, for any-

door-nail.
Mind! I don't mean to say that I know, of my own knowledge,
what there is particularly dead about a door-nail. I might have
been inclined, myself, to regard a coffin-nail as the deadest piece
of ironmongery in the trade. But the wisdom of our ancestors is

in the simile; and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it, or the
Country's done for. You will therefore permit me to repeat,
emphatically, that Marley was as dead as a door-nail.
Scrooge knew he was dead? Of course he did. How could it
be otherwise ? Scrooge and he were partners for I don't know
how many years. Scrooge was is sole executor, his sole adminis-
trator his sole assign, his sole residuary legatee, his sole friend, and
sole mourner. And even Scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by
the sad event, but that he was an excellent man of business on the
very day of the funeral, and solemnized it with an undoubted liar-
gain.
Scrooge never painted out old Marley's name. There it stood,
years afterwards, above the warehouse door: Scrooge and Marley.
The firm was known as Scrooge and Marley. Sometimes people
new to the business called Scrooge Scrooge, and sometimes Marley,
but he answered to both names: it was all the same to him.
Oh! But he was a tight-fisted hand at the grindstone, Scrooge!
& squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping, clutching, covetous old
sinner! Hard and sharp as flint, from which no steel had ever
struck out generous fire; secret and self-contained, and solitary as
an oyster. The cold within him froze his old features, nipped his
pointed nose, shriveled his check, stiffened his gait; made his eyes
red, his thin lips blue; and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice.
A frosty rime was on his head, and on his eyebrows, and his wiry
chin. He carried his own low temperature always about with
him; he iced his office in the dog-days; and didn't thaw it one
degree at Christmas.
External heat and cold had little influence on Scrooge. No
warmth could warm, nor wintry weather chill him. No wind that
blew was bitterer than he, no falling snow was more intent upon
its purpose, no pelting rain less oper. to entreaty. Foul weather
didn't know where to have him. The heaviest rain, and snow,
and hail, and sleet, could boast of the advantage over him in only
one respect. They often “came down" handsomely, and Scrooge
never did.
Nobody ever stopped him in the street to say, with gladsome
looks, “My dear Scrooge, how are you? when will you come to
see me?" No beggars implored him to bestow a trifle, no children

asked him what it was o'clock, no man or woman ever once in all
his life inquired the way to such and such a place, of Scrooge.
Even the blind-men's dogs appeared to know him; and when they
saw him coming on, would tug their owners into doorways and up
courts; and then would wag their tails as though they said, “no
eye at all is better than an evil eye, dark master!”.
But what did Scrooge care? It was the very thing he liked.
To edge his way along the crowded paths of life, warning all
ciman sympathy to keep its distance, was what the knowing ones
call “ nuts" to Scrooge.

Passing Away.
I.
Was it the chime of a tiny bell,
That came so sweet to my dreaming ear,
Like the silvery tones of a fairy's shell,
That he winds on the beach so mellow and clear,
When the winds and the waves lie together asleep,
And the moon and the fairy are watching the deep,
She dispensing her silvery light,
And he his notes as silvery quite,
While the boatman listens and ships his oar,
To catch the music that comes from the shore ?---
Hark! the notes on my ear that play,
Are set to words: as they float, they say,
“Passing away! passing away!"
II.
But, no; it was not a fairy's shell,
Blown on the beach so mellow and clear:
Nor was it the tongue of a silver bell
Striking the hours that fell on my ear,
As I lay in my dream: yet was it a chime
That told of the flow of the stream of Time;
For a beautiful clock from the ceiling hung,
And a plump little girl for a pendulum, swung:

(As you've sometimes seen, in a little ring
That hangs in his cage, a canary bird swing;)
And she held to her bosom a budding bouquet,
And as she enjoyed it, she seemed to say,
“Passing away! passing away !"
III.
Oh, how bright were the whcels, that told
Of the lapse of time as they moved round slow!
And the hands as they swept o'er the dial of gold
Seemed to point to the girl below.
And lo! she had changed; — in a few short hours,
Her bouquet had become a garland of flowers,
That she held in her outstretched hands, and flung
This way and that, as she, dancing, swung
In the fullness of grace and womanly pride,
That told me she soon was to be a bride;
Yet then, when expecting her happiest day,
In the same sweet voice I heard her say,
“ Passing away! passing away !".
IV.
While I gazed on that fair one's cheek, a shade
Of thought, or care, stole softly over,
Like that by a cloud in a summer's day made,
Looking down on a field of blosso.ning clover.
The rose yet lay on her cheek, but its flush
Had something lost of its brilliant blush;
And the light in her eye, and the light on the wheels,
That marched so calmly round above her,
Was a little dimmed — as when evening steals
Upon noon's hot face:- yet one couldn't but love her;
For she looked like a mother whose first babe lay
Rocked on her breast, as she swung all day;
And she seemed in the same silver tone to say,
“Passing away! passing away !"

While yet I looked, what a change there came!
Her eye was quenched, and he: cheek was wan;
Stooping and staffed was her withered frame,
Yet just as busily swung she on:
The garland beneath her had fallen to dust;
The wheels above her were eaten with rust;
The hands, that over the dial swept,
Grew crook'd and tarnished, but on they kept;
And still there came that silver tone
From the shriveled lips of the toothless crone,
(Let me never forget, to my dying day,
The tone or the burden of that lay) –
“PASSING AWAY! PASSING AWAYI".

Telling the battle was on once more,
And Sheridan - twenty miles away.

And wilder still those billows of war
Thundered along the horizon's bar,
And louder yet into Winchester rolled
The roar of that red sea uncontrolled,

And Sheridan - twenty miles away.

And there, through the flush of the morning light,
A steed, as black as the steeds of night,
Was seen to pass as with eagle flight-
As if he knew the terrible need,
He stretched away with the utmost speed;
Hilis rose and ſell — but his heart was gay,
With Sheridan fifteen miles away.

Still sprung from these swift hoofs, thundering South,
The dust, like the smoke from the cannon's mouth,
Or the trail of a comet sweeping faster and faster,
Foreboding to traitors the doom of disaster;
The heart of the steed and the heart of the master
Were beating like prisoners assaulting their walls,
linpatient to be where the battle-field calls;
Every nerve of the charger was strained to full play
With Sheridan only ten miles away.
Under his spurning feet, the road
Like an arrowy Alpine river flowed,
And the landscape sped away behind
Like an ocean flying before the wind;
And the steed, like a bark fed with furnace ire,
Swept on with his wild eyes full of fire.
But lo! he is nearing his heart's desire -
He is snuſling the smoke of the roaring fray,
With Sheridan only five miles away.

The first that the General saw were the groups
Of stragglers, and then the retreating troops; -
What was done — what to do- a glance told him both,
Then striking his spurs with a muttereid oath,
He dashed down the line 'mid a storm of huzzahs,
And the wave of retreat checked its course there because
The sight of the master compelled it to pause.

BRIEF EXTRACTS.
The Nature of True Eloquence.
True eloquence does not consist in speech. It cannot be brought
from far. Labor and Icarning may toil for it, but they will toil in
vain. Words and phrases may be marshaled in every way, but
they cannot compass it. It must exist in the man, in the subject,
and in the occasion. Affected passion, intense expression, the
pomp of declamation, all may aspire after it,—they cannot reach
it. It comes, if it come at all, like the outbreaking of a fountain
from the earth, or the bursting forth of volcanic fires, with spon-
taneous, original, native force. The graces taught in the schools,
the costly ornaments and studied contrivances of speech, shock
and disgust men, when their own lives, and the fate of their wives,
their children, and their country hang on the decision of the hour.
Then words have lost their power, rhetoric is vain, and all elabo-
rate oratory contemptible. Even gerius itself then feels rebuked
and subdued, as in the presence of higher qualities. Then patriot-
ism is eloquent; then self-devotion is eloquent. The clear con-
ception, outrunning the deductions of logic, the high purpose, the
firm resolve, the dauntless spirit, speaking on the tongue, beaming
from the eye, informing every feature, and urging the whole man
onward, right onward, to his object,this, this is eloqucnce; or,
rather, it is something greater and higher than all eloquence: it is
action, noble, sublime, God-like action.
Darvel Webster.
Self-Reliance.
Insist on yourself; never imitate. Your own gift : Ju can pre-
sent every moment with the cumulative force of a whole life's
cultivation ; but of the adopted talent of another yı u have only
an extemporaneous, half possession. That which each can do
best, nono but his Maker can teach him. No mau yet knows
what it is, nor can, till that person has exhibited it. Where is
the master who could have taught Shakspeare? Pere is the
master who could have instructed Franklin, or Waaington, or
Bacon, or Newton ? Every great man is a unique.

The Brain.
Our brains are seventy-year clocks. The Angel of Life winde
them up once for all, then closes the case, and gives the key into
the hands of the Angel of the Resurrection.
Tic-tac ! tic-tac! go the wheels of thought; our will cannot
stop them; they cannot stop themselves; sleep cannot still them;
madness only makes them go faster; death alone can break into
the case, and, seizing the ever-swinging pendulum, which we call
the heart, silence at last the clicking of the terrible escapement
we have carried so long beneath our wrinkled foreheads.

The Burning Prairie.
L
The prairie stretched as smooth as a floor,
As far as the eye could see,
And the settler sat at luis cabin door,
With his little girl on his knee;
Striving her letters to repeat -
And pulling her apron over her feet.
His face was wrinkled but not old,
For he bore an upright form,
And his shirt sleeves back to the elbow rolled,
They showed a brawny arm.
And near in the grass with toes upturned,
Was a pair of old shoes cracked and burned.

Now and then snapping his tar black jaws,
At the fly that buzzed in his ear.
And near was the cow-pen made of rails,
And a bench that held two milking pails.

In the open door an ox yoke lay,
The mother's odd redoubt,
To keep the little one at her play
On the floor from falling out,
While she swept the hearth with a turkey wing,
And filled her tea kettle at the spring.
The little girl on her father's knee,
With eyes so bright and blue,
From A, B, C, to X, Y, Z,
Had said her lesson through.
When a wind came over the prairie land,
And caught the primer out of her hand.

The watch dog whined, the cattle lowed,
And tossed their horns about,
The air grow gray as if it snowed,
" There will be a storm no doubt,"
So to himself the settler said,
“ But, father, why is the sky so red

The little girl slid off his knee,
And all of a tremble stood.
“Good wife," he cried, " come out and see,
The skies are as red as blood."
“God save us !” cried the settler's wife,
“ The prairie's 8-fire, we must run for life!"

She caught the baby up, “Come,
Are ye mad? to your heels my man.
He followed terror stricken, dumb,
And so they ran and ran,
Close upon them was the snort and swing,
Of buffaloes madly galloping.

The wild winds like a sower sows,
The ground with sparkles red,
And the flapping wings of bats and crows,
And the ashes orerhead;
And the bellowing deer, and the hissing snako,
What a swirl of terrible sounds they make.
No gleam of the river water yet,
And the flames leap on and on,
A crash and a fiercer whirl and jet,
And the settler's house is gone.
The air grows hot; “this fluttering curl,
Would burn like flax," said the little girl.

A pleasanter spot you never spied;
But, when begins my ditty,
Almost five hundred years ago,
To see the townsfolk suffer so
From vermin, was a pity.
Rats!
They fought the dogs, and killed the cats,
And bit the babies in the cradles,
And ate the cheeses out of the vats,
And licked the soup from the cook's own ladles,
Split open the kegs of salted sprats,
Made nests inside men's Sunday hats,
And even spoiled the women's chats,
By drowning their speaking
With shrieking and squeaking
In fifty different sharps and flats.
At last the people in a body
To the Town Hall came flocking:
"'T is clear,” cried they, “our Mayor's a noddy ;
And as for our Corporation, — shocking
To think we buy gowns lined with ermine
For dolts that can't or won't determine
What's best to rid us of our vermin!
You hope, because you're old and obese,
To find in the furry civic robe ease ?
Rouse up, Sirs! Give your brains a racking
To find the remedy we're lacking,
Or, sure as fate, we'll send you packing !"
At this the Mayor and Corporation
Quaked with a mighty consternation.
An hour they sat in council,
At length the Mayor broke silence;
"For a guilder I'd my ermine gown sell;
I wish I were a mile hence!
It's easy to bid one rack one's brain,
I'm sure my poor head aches again,
I've scratched it so, and all in vain.

O for a trap, a trap, a trap!"
Just as he said this, what should hap
At the chamber door, but a gentle tap!
“Bless us,” cried the Mayor, “what's that?
Anything like the sound of a rat
Makes my heart go pit a pat!"
“Come in l" the Mayor cried, looking bigger:
And in did come the strangest figure;
His queer, long coat from heels to head
Was half of yellow and half of red;
And he himself was tall and thin,
With sharp blue eyes, each like a pin,
And light, loose hair, yet swarthy skin,
No tuft on cheek nor beard on chin,
But lips where smiles went out and in,
There was no guessing his kith or kin;
And nobody could enough admire
The tall man and his quaint attire ;
Quoth one: “It's as my great-grand-sire,
Starting up at the Trump of Doom's tone,
Had walked this way from his painted tomb stone !"
He advanced to the council-table:
And, “Please your honors," said he, “I'm able,
By means of a secret charm, to draw
All creatures living beneath the sun,
That creep, or swim, or fly, or run,
After me so as you never saw !
And I chiefly use my charm
On creatures that do people harm,
The mole, and toad, and newt, and viper;
And people call me the Pied Piper,"
“Yet," said he, “poor piper as I am,
In Tartary I freed the Cham
Last June from his huge swarms of gnats;
I eased in Asia the Nizam
Of a monstrous brood of vampyre-bats:
And, as for what your brain bewilders,
If I can rid your town of rats
Will you give me a thousand guilders ?"

"One ? fifty thousand I” — was the exclamation
Of the astonished Mayor and Corporation.
Into the street the Piper stept,
Smiling first a little smile,
As if he knew what magic slept
In his quiet pipe the while;
And ere three shrill notes the pipe uttered,
You heard as if an army muttered;
And the muttering grew to a grumbling;
And the grumbling grew to a mighty rumbling,
And out of the houses the rats came tumbling,
Great rats, small rats, lean rats, brawny rats,
Brown rats, black rats, gray rats, tawny rats,
Grave old plodders, gray young friskers,
Fathers, mothers, uncles, cousius,
Families by tens and dozens,
Brothers, sisters, husbands, wives -
Followed the piper for their lives.
From street to street he piped advancing,
And step for step they followed dancing,
Until they came to the river Weser
Wherein all plunged and perished.
You should have heard the Hamelin people
Ringing the bells till they rocked the steeple;
“Go," cried the Mayor, "and get long poles !
Poke out the nests and block up the holes !
Consult with carpenters and builders,
And leave in our town not even a trace
Of the rats I" — when suddenly up the face
Of the Piper perked in the market-place,
With, "first, if you please, my thousand guilders."
A thousand guilders; the Mayor looked blue
And so did the corporation too,
“Beside," quoth the Mayor, with a knowing wink,
“Our business was done at the river brink,
We saw with our eyes the vermin sink,
And what's dead can't come to life, I think.
A thousand guilders! Come take fifty"

The Piper's face fell, and he cried,
“No trifling! Folks who put me in a passion
May find me pipe to another fashion.”
Once more he stept into the street;
And to his lips again
Laid his long pipe of smooth straight cane;
And cre he blew three notes,
There was a rustling, that seemed like a bustling
of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling,
Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,
Little hands clapping, and little tongues chattering,
And, like fowls in a farm-yard when barley is scattering,
Out came the children running.
All the little boys and girls,
With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,
And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,
Tripping and skipping, ran merrily after
The wonderful music with shouting and laughter.
When lol as they reached the mountain's side,
A wondrous portal opened wide,
As if a cavern was suddenly hollowed;
And the Piper advanced and the children followed,
And when all were in to the very last,
The door in the mountain side shut fast,
Alas! alas for Hamelin!
There came into many a burgher's pate
A text which says, that Heaven's Gate
Opes to the Rich at as easy rate
As the needle's eye takes a camel in!
The Mayor sent East, West, North and South
To offer the Piper by word of mouth,
Wherever it was men's lot to find him,
Silver and gold to his heart's content,
If he'd only return the way he went,
And bring the children behind him.
But soon they saw 't was a lost endeavor,
And Piper and dancers were gone forever.

And the better in memory to fix
The.place of the Children's last retreat,
They called it, the Pied Piper's Street, -
Where any one playing on pipe or tabor
Was sure for the future to lose his labor.
And opposite the place of the cavern
They wrote the story on a column,
And on the Great Church Window painted
The same, to make the world acquainted
How their children were stolen away;
And there it stands to this very day.

Psalm xc.
LORD, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.
Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlast-
ing, thou art God.
Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children
of men.
For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it
is past, and as a watch in the night.
Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep;
in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.
In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening
it is cut down, and withereth.
For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we
troubled.
Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the
light of thy countenance.
For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our
years as a tale that is told.
The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and it
ày reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their strength
labor and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly away.
Wno knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy
fear, so is thy wrath.
So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts
unto wisdom.

To fight for His own holy name, and Henry of Navarre.

He lonked upon his people, and a tear was in his eye,
He looked upon the traitors, and his glance was stern and high.

Down all our line, a deafening shout, God save our lord the King?
“And if my standard-bearer fall, as fall full well he may -
For nerer I saw promise yet of such a bloody fray-
Press where ye see my white plume shine amidst the ranks of war.

Of fife, and steed, and trump, and drum, and roaring culverin.
The fiery duke is pricking fast across Saint Andre's plain,
With all the hireling chivalry of Guelders and Almayne.
Now by the lips of those ye love, fair gentlemen of France,
Charge for the golden lilies — upon them with the lance!
A thousand spurs are striking deep, a thousand spears in rest,
A thousand knights are pressing close behind the snow-white crest;
And in they burst, and on they rushed, while, like a guiding star,
Amidst the thickest carnage blazed the helmet of Navarre.
Now, God be praised, the day is ours: Mayenne hath turned his
rein;
D'Aumale hath cried for quarter; the Flemish count is slain;
Their ranks are breaking like thin clouds before a Biscay gale;
The field is heaped with bleeding steeds, and Nags, and cloven mail.
And then we thought on vengeance, and, all along our van,
Remember Saint Bartholomew! was passed from man to man.
But out spake gentle Henry — “No Frenchman is my foc:
Down, down with every foreigner, but let your brethren go".
Oh! was there ever such a knight, in friendship or in war,
As our sovereign lord, King Henry, the soldier of Navarre ?
Right well fought all the Frenchmen who fought for France to-day;
And many a lordly banner God gave them for a prey.
But we of the religion have borne us best in fight;
And the good Lord of Rosny hath ta'en the cornet white — .
Our own true Maximilian the cornet white hath ta'en,
The cornet white with crosses black, the flag of false Lorraine.

Scenes from the Lights and Shadows of Scottish Life.
The rite of baptism had not been performed for several months at
the kirk of Lanark. It was now the hottest time of persecution;
and the inhabitants of that parish found other places in which to
worship God, and celebrate the ordinances of religion. It was the
Sablath day,—and a small congregation, of about a hundred souls,
had met for divine service in a place of worship more magnificent
than any temple that human hands had ever built to Deity. Here,
tuo, were three children about to be baptized. The congregation
had not assembled at the toll of the bell; but each heart knew the
hour and observed it; for there are a hundred sun-dials among
the hills, woods, moors and fields, and the shepherds and the peas-
ants see the hours passing by them in sunshine and shadow.
The church in which they were assembled was hewn by God's
hand out of the eternal rocks. A river rolled its way through a
mighty chasm of cliffs, several hundred feet high, of which one side
presented enormous masses, and the other corresponding recesses,
as if the great stone girdle had been rent by a convulsion. The
channel was overspread with prodigious fragments of rocks or large
loose stones, some of them smooth and bare, others containing soil
and verdure in their rents and fissures, and here and there crowned
with shrubs and trees.
The eye could at once command a long stretching vista, seem-
ingly closed and shut up at both extremities, by the coalescing cliffs.
This majestic reach of river contained pools, streams, rushing shelves,
and waterfalls innumerable; and when the water was low, which it
now was in the common drought, it was easy to walk up this scene
with the calm blue sky overhead, an utter and sublime solitude.
On looking up, the soul was bowed down by the feeling of that
prodigious heighth of unscalable and often overhanging cliffs. Winged
creatures alone could inhabit this region. The fox and wild-ca
chose more accessible haunts. Yet, here came the persecuted
Christians, and worshiped God, whose hand hung over their heads
those magnificent pillars and arches, scooped out those galleries
from the solid rock, and laid at their feet the calm water in its
transparent beauty, in which they could see themselves sitting in
reflected groups, with their Bibles in their hands.

The rite of baptism was over, and the religious service of the day
closed by a psalm. The mighty rocks hemmed in the holy sound,
and sent it, in more compacted volume, clear, sweet, and strong, up
to heaven. When the psalm ceased, an echo, like a spirit's voice,
Was heard dying away high up among the magnificent architecture
of the cliffs, and once more might be noticed in the silence the
reviving voice of the waterfall.
Just then a large stone fell from the top of the cliff into the pool,
a loud voice was heard, and a plaid hung over on the point of a
shepherd's staff. Their watchful sentinel had descried danger, and
this was his warning. Forth with the congregation rose. There
were pathis dangerous to unpracticed feet, along the ledges of the
rocks, leading up to several caves and places of concealment. The
more active and young assisted the elder, more especially the old
pastor, and the women with infants; and many minutes had not
elapsed till not a living creature was visible in the channel of the
stream, but all of them hidden, or nearly so, in the clefts of
the caverns.
The shepherd who had given the alarm had laid down again in
his plaid instantly on the green sward upon the summit of these
precipices. A party of soldiers were immediately upon him. and
demanded what signals he had been making, and to whom; when
one of them, looking over the edge of the cliff, exclaimed, “See,
see! Humphrey, we have caught the whole tabernacle of the Lord
in a net at last. There they are, praising God among the stones of
the river Mouss. These are the Cartland Craigs. By my soul's
salvation, a noble cathedral!” “Fling the lying sentinel over the
cliffs. Here is a canting covenanter for you, deceiving honest sol-
diers on the very Sabbath day. Over with him, over with him;
out of the gallery into the pit.”
But the shepherd had vanished like a shadow; and, mixing with
the tall green broom and bushes, was making his unseen way
toward a wood. “Satan has saved his servant; but come, my lads,
follow me; I know the way down into the bed of the stream-and
the steps up to Wallace's Cave. They are called the ‘Kittle Nine
Stanes.' The hunt's up. We'll all be in at the death. Halloo, my
boys, halloo !”

The soldiers dashed down a less precipitous part of the wooded
bank, a little below the “craigs," and hurried up the channel. But
when they reached the altar where the old gray-haired minister had
been seen standing, and the rocks that had been covered with
people, all were silent and solitary; not a creature to be seen.
“Here is a Bible dropped by some of them," cried a soldier, and, with
his foot, spun it away into the pool. “A bonnet, a bonnet,” cried
.nother; "now for the pretty sanctified face that rolled its demure
yes below it."
But after a few jests and oaths, the soldiers stood still, eying
with a kind of mysterious dread the black and silent walls of the
rock that hemmed them in, and hearing only the small voice of
the stream that sent a profounder stillness through the heart of that
majestic solitude. “Curse these cowardly covenanters—what if
they tumble down upon our heads pieces of rock from their hiding-
places ? Advance? or retreat ?"
There was no reply. For a slight fear was upon every man;
musket or bayonet could be of little use to men obliged to clamber
up rocks, along slender paths, leading, they knew not where; and
they were aware that armed men, now-a-days, worshiped God-
men of iron hearts, who feared not the glitter of the soldier's arms,
neither barrel nor bayonet-men of long stride, firm step, and broad
breast, who, on the open field, would have overthrown the mar-
shalled line, and gone first and foremost, if a city had to be taken
by storm.
As the soldiers were standing together irresolute, a noise came
upon their ears like distant thunder, but even more appalling; and
a slight current of air, as if propelled by it, passed whispering along
the sweet-briars, and the broom, and the tresses of the birch trees.
It came deepening, and rolling, and roaring on, and the very Cart-
land Craigs shook to their foundation, as if with an earthquake
“ The Lord have mercy upon us—what is this?" And down fell
many of the miserable wretches on their knees, and some on their
faces, upon the sharp-pointed rocks. Now, it was like the sound
of many myriads of chariots rolling on their iron axles down the
stony channel of the torrent.
The old gray-haired minister issued from the mouth of Wallace's
Cave, and said, with a loud voice, " The Lord God terrible reign

eth.” A water-spout had burst up among the moor-lands, and the
river in its power was at hand. There it came, tumbling along into
that long reach of cliffs, and in a moment filled it with one mass of
waves. Huge, agitated clouds of foam rode on the surface of a
blood-red torrent. An arıny must have been swept off by that
flood. The soldiers perished in a moment; but high up in the
cliffs, above the sweep of destruction, were the covenanters-men,
women, and children, uttering prayers to God, unheard by then-
selves in that raging thunder.

What on the hill-top shines in flowing?
“See you the foeman's banners waving ?
“We see the foeman's banners waving !"
“God be with your children and wife !"
Hark to the music—the drum and fife-
How they ring through the ranks, which they rcuse to the strife!
Thrilling they sound, with their glorious tone,
Thrilling they go through the marrow and bone!
Brothers, God grant, when this life is o'er,
To the life to come that we meet once more!

See the smoke, how the lightning is cleaving asunder!
Hark! the guns, peal on peal, how they boom in their thunder.
From host to host with kindling sound,
The shouted signal circles round;
Freer already breathes the breath!
The war is waging, slaughter raging,
And heavy through the reeking pall
The iron death-dice fall !
Nearer they close-foes upon foes-
“ Ready!”—from square to square it goes.
They kneel as one man from flank to flank,
And the fire comes sharp from the foremost rank.
Many a soldier to earth is sent,
Many a gap by ball is rent;
O'er the corpse before springs the hindest man,
That the line may not fall to the fearless var.
To the right, to the left, and around and around,
Death whirls in its dance on the bloody ground.
God's sunlight is quenched in the fiery fighty
Over the hosts falls a brooding night!
Brothers, God grant, when this life is o'er,
In the life to come we may meet once more.
The dead men are bathed in the weltering blood
And the living are blent in the slippery flood,
And the feet, as they reeling and sliding go,
Stumble still on the corpse that sleeps below.
“What? Francis!"_“Give Charlotte my last farewell.
As the dying man murmurs, the thunders swell-
“I'll give-0 God! are the guns so near?
Hol comrades -yon volley 1-look sharp to the rear!
I'll give to thy Charlotte thy last farewell!
Sleep soft I where death thickest descendeth in rain,
The friend thou forsaketh thy side may regain!"
Hitherward, thitherward reels the fight;
Dark and more darkly day glooms into night.
Brethren, God grant, when this life is o'er,
In the life to come that we meet once more!

Hark to the hoofs that galloping go!
The adjutants flying-
The horsemen press hard on the panting foe,
Their thunder booms in dying-
· Victory!
Tremor has seized on the dastards all,
And their leaders fall!
Victory!
Closed is the brunt of the glorious fight;
And the day, like a conqueror, bursts on the night!
Trumpet and fife swelling choral along,
The triumph already sweeps marching in song.
Farewell, fallen brothers; though this life be o'er,
There's another, in which we shall meet you once more!
Translated from Schiller by Bulwer,
Over the River.
Over the river they beckon to me-
Loved ones who've crossed to the further side;
The gleam of their snowy robes I see,
But their voices are drowned in the rushing tide.
There's one with ringlets of sunny gold,
And eyes, the reflection of heaven's own blue;
He crossed in the twilight, gray and cold,
And the pale mist hid him from mortal view.
We saw not the angels who met him there;
The gates of the city we could not see;
Over the river, over the river,
My brother stands waiting to welcome mel
Over the river, the boatman pale
Carried another—the household pet;
Her brown curls waved in the gentle gale-
Darling Minniel I see her yet.
She crossed on her bosom her dimpled hands,
And fearlessly entered the phantom bark;
We watched it glide from the silver sands,
And all our sunshine grew strangely dark.

We know she is safe on the further side,
Where all the ransomed and angels be;
Over the river, the mystic river,
My childhood's idol is waiting for me.
For none return from those quiet shores,
Who cross with the boatman cold and pale;
We hear the dip of the golden oars,
And catch a gleam of the snowy sail, -
And lol they have passed from our yearning heart; .
They cross the stream, and are gone for aye;
We may not sunder the veil apart
That hides from our vision the gates of day;
We only know that their bark no more
May sail with us over life's stormy sea;
Yet somewhere, I know, on the unseen shore,
They watch, and beckon, and wait for me.
And I sit and think, when the sunset's gold
Is flushing river, and hill, and shore,
I shall one day stand by the water cold,
And list for the sound of the boatman's oar;
I shall watch for a gleam of the flapping sail;
I shall hear the boat as it gains the strand,
I shall pass from sight with the boatman pale,
To the better shore of the spirit land;
I shall know the loved who have gone before,
And joyfully sweet will the ineeting be,
When over the river, the peaceful river,
The Angel of Death shall carry me.

The Wonderful "One-Hoss Shay."
A LOGICAL STORY.
Have you heard of the wonderful one-hoss shay,
That was built in such a logical way
It ran a hundred years to a day,
And then, of a sudden, it- Ah, but stay,

I'll tell you what happened, without delay-
Scaring the parson into fits,
Frightening people out of their wits-
Have you ever heard of that, I say?
Seventeen hundred and fifty-five,
Georgius Secundus was then alive
Snuffy old drone from the German hive!
That was the year when Lisbon town
Saw the earth open and gulp her down,
And Braddock's army was done so brown,
Left without a scalp to its crown.
It was on the terrible Earthquake-day
That the Deacon finished the one-hoss shay.
Now, in building of chaises, I tell you whaty
There is always, somewhere, a weakest spot-
In hub, tire, felloe, in spring or thill,
In panel or cross-bar, or floor, or sill,
In screw, bolt, thorough-brace-lurking still,
Find it somewhere you must and will
Above or below, or within or without-
And that's the reason, beyond a doubt,
A. chaise breaks down, but doesn't wear out.
But the Deacon sworem(as Deacons do,
With an “I dew vum” or an “I tell yeou”)—
He would build one shay to beat the taown
'N' the keounty 'n' all the kentry raoun';
It should be so built that it couldn' break daown:-
“Fur," said the Deacon, "'t's mighty plain
Thut the weakes place must stan' the strain;
'N' the way t' fix it, uz I maintain,
Is only jest
T' make that place uz strong uz the rest."
So the Deacon inquired of the village folk
Where he could find the strongest oak,
That couldn't be split, nor bent, nor broke-
That was for spokes, and floor, and sills;

He sent for lancewood, to make the thills;
The cross-bars were ash, from the straightest trees;
The panels of white-wood, that cuts like cheese,
But lasts like iron for things like these;
The hubs from logs from the “Setler's ellum"-
Last of its timber—they couldn't sell 'em-
Never ar axe had seen their chips,
And the wedges flew from between their lips,
Their blunt ends frizzled like celery-tips;
Step and prop-iron, bolt and screw,
Spring, tire, axle, and linchpin too,
Steel of the finest, bright and blue;
Thoroughbrace bison-skin, thick and wide;
Boot, top, dasher, from tough old hide,
Found in the pit where the tanner died.
That was the way he “put her through."
“Therel" said the Deacon, “naow she'll dew"
Do! I tell you, I rather guess
She was a wonder, and nothing less !
Colts grew horses, beards turned gray,
Deacon and deaconess dropped away,
Children and grandchildren-where were they?
But there stood the stout old one-hoss shay,
As fresh as on Lisbon-earthquake-day!
EIGHTEEN HUNDRED—it came, and found
The Deacon's masterpiece strong and sound.
Eighteen hundred, increased by ten-
“Hahnsum kerridge” they called it then.
Eighteen hundred and twenty came;-
Running as usual-much the same.
Thirty and forty at last arrive;
And then came fifty-and FIFTY-FIVE.
Little of all we value here
Wakes on the morn of its hundredth year
Without both feeling and looking queer.
In fact, there's nothing that keeps its youth,

So far as I know, but a tree and truth.
(This is a moral that runs at large:
Take it-You're welcome.--No extra charge.)
First or NOVEMBER—the Earthquake-day.--
There are traces of age in the one-hoss shay,
A general flavor of mild decay-
But nothing local, as one may say.
There couldn't be—for the Deacon's art
Had made it so like in every part
That there wasn't a chance for one to start.
For the wheels were just as strong as the thills
And the floor was just as strong as the sills,
And the panels just as strong as the floor,
And the whippletree neither less nor more,
And the back crosabar as strong as the fore,
And spring, and axle, and hub encore.
And yet, as a whole, it is past a doubt
In another hour it will be worn out!
First of November, 'Fifty-five!
This morning the parson takes a drive.
Now, emall boys, get out of the way!
Here comes the wonderful one-hoss shay,
Drawn by a rat-tailed, ewe-necked bay.
"Hud up!" said the parson.—Of went they.
The parson was working his Sunday text-
Had got to fifthly, and stoppcà perplexed
At what the Moses, was coming next.
All at once the horse stood still,
Close by the meet'n' house on the hill.
-First a shiver, and then a thrill,
Then something decidedly like a spill-
And the parson was sitting upon a rock,
At half-past nine by the meet'n'-house clock-
Just the hour of the earthquake shock!
What do you think the parson found,
When he got up and stared around ?

As if it had been to the mill and ground!
You see, of course, if you're not a dunce,
How it went to pieces all at once-
All at once, and nothing first-
Just as bubbles do when they burst.-
End of the wonderful one-hoss shay.

Will ye give it up to slaves ?
Will ye look for greener graves ?
Hope ye mercy still ?
What's the mercy despots feel ?
Hear it in that battle peal,
Read it on yon bristling steel,
Ask it, ye who will !
Fear ye foes who kill for hire ?
Will ye to your homes retire ?
Look behind you I they're a-fire!
And before you, see
Who have done it IFrom the vale
On they comel and will ye quail ? —
Leaden rain and iron hail
Let their welcome be!
In the God of battles trust!
Die we may—and die we must;
But, oh, where can dust to dust
Be consigned so well,
As where heaven its dews shall shed
On the martyred patriot's bed,
And the rocks shall raise their head,
Of his deeds to tell ?

A Psalm of Life.
Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
Life is but an empty dream!
For the soul is dead that slumbers ;
And things are not what they seem.
Life is real! Life is earnest !
And the grave is not its goal;
“ Dust thou art, to dust returnest,"
Was not spoken of the soul.
Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,
Is our destined end or way;
But to act that each to-morrow
Find us farther than to-day.
Art is long, and time is fleeting;
And our hearts, though stout and brave
Still, like muffled drums, are beating
Funeral marches to the grave.
In the world's broad field of battle,
In the bivouac of life,
Be not like dumb, driven cattle!
Be a hero in the strife.
Trust no future, howe'er pleasant 1
Let the dead past bury its dead I
Act,-act in the living present!
Heart within, and God o'erhead 1
Lives of great men all remind us
We can make our lives sublime,
And, departing, leave behind us
Footprints on the sands of time;
Footprints, that perhaps another,
Sailing o'er life's solemn main,
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
Seeing, shall take heart again

A gain to the battle, Achaians !
Our hearts bid the tyrants defiance;
Our land—the first garden of Liberty's tree
It has been, and shall yet be, the land of the free:
For the cross of our faith is replanted,
The pale dying crescent is daunted,
And we march that the footprints of Mahomet's slaves
May be washed out in blood from our forefathers' graves
Their spirits are hovering o'er us,
And the sword shall to glory restore us.
Ah! what though no succor advances,
Nor Christendom's chivalrous lances
Are stretched in our aid ? Be the combat our own!
And we'll perish or conquer more proudly alone;
For we've sworn by our country's assaulters,
By the virgins they've dragged from our altars,
By our massacred patriots, our children in chains,
By our heroes of old, and their blood in our veins,
That, living, we will be victorious,
Or that, dying, our deaths shall be glorious.

A breath of submission we breathe not:
The sword we have drawn we will sheathe not!

The broken harps around whose strings the dull sea-monsters glide !
Mother and nursling sweet, reft from their household throng.
There's bitter weeping in the nest where breathed the soul of song.

perpetuates the remembrance of men on earth ; in the recorded
proofs of their own great actions, in the offspring of their intellect,
in the deep engraved lines of public gratitude, and in the respect
and homage of mankind. They live in their example; and they
live, emphatically, and will live, in the influence which their lives
and efforts, their principles and opinions, now exercise, and will
continue to exercise, on the affairs of men, not only in their own
country, but throughout the civilized world.
A superior and commanding human intellect, a truly great man.
when Heaven vouchsafes so rare a gift, is not a temporary flame,
burning bright for a while, and then expiring, giving place to
returning darkness. It is rather a spark of fervent heat, as well as
radiant light, with power to enkindle the cornmon mass of human
mind; so that, when it glimmers, in its own decay, and finally goes
out in death, no night follows; but it leaves the world all light, all
on fire, from the potent contact of its own spirit.
Bacon died; but the human understanding, roused by the touch
of his miraculous wand to a perception of the true philosophy and
the just mode of inquiring after truth, has kept on its course suc-
cessfully and gloriously. Newton died; yet the courses of the
spheres are still known, and they yet move on, in the orbits which
he saw and described for them, in the infinity of space.
No two men now live-perhaps it may be doubted whether any
two men have ever lived in one age-who, more than those we now
commemorate, have impressed their own sentiments, in regard to
politics and government, on mankind, infused their own opinions
more deeply into the opinions of others, or given a more lasting
direction to the current of human thought. Their work doth not
perish with them. The tree which they assisted to plant will
flourish, although they water it and protect it no longer; for it has
struck its roots deep; it has sent them to the very center; no storm,
not of force to burst the orb, can overturn it; its branches spread
wide; they stretch their protecting arms broader and broader, and
its top is destined to reach the heavens.
We are not deceived. There is no delusion here. No age will

Dash to earth the oppressor's rod.

Grasp the sword !-its edge is keen,
Seize the gun -its ball is true :
Sweep your land from tyrant clean,-
Haste, and scour it through and through!
Onward, onward! Freedom cries,
Rush to arms, - the tyrant flies.
By the souls of patriots gone,
Wake,-arise, -your fetters break,

Rise, and front the despot czar,

Think of what your sires have been,-
Onward, onwardl strong and steady,–
Drive the tyrant to his den.
On, and let the watchwords be,
Country, home, and liberty !

The Boys
This selection is a poem addressed to the class of 1829, in Harvard
College, some thirty years after their graduation.
Has there any old fellow got mixed with the boys ?
If there has, take him out, without making a noise.
Hang the almanac's cheat and the catalogue's spite !
Old Time is a liar; we're twenty to-night.
We're twenty! We're twenty! Who says we are more ?
He's tipsey,—young jackanapes !-show him the door!
“Gray temples at twenty ?”—Yes! white if we please;
Where the snow-flakes fall thickest there's nothing can freeze!
Was it snowing I spoke of ? Excuse the mistake!
Look close,—you will see not a sign of a flake!
We want some new garlands for those we have shed,
And these are white roses in place of the red.
We've a trick, we young fellows, you may have been told,
Of talking (in public) as if we were old;
That boy we call “Doctor" and this we call “ Judge" !
It's a neat little fiction,-of course it's all fudge.
That fellow 's the “Speaker,” the one on the right;
“Mr. Mayor," my young one, how are you to-night?
That 's our “ Member of Congress," we say when we chaff ;
There's the "Reverend”—what 's his name?—don't make me laugh.
That boy with the grave mathematical look
Made believe he had written a wonderful book,
And the Royal Society thought it was true!
So they chose him right in,-a good joke it was, too!
There 's a boy, we pretend, with a three-decker brain,.
That could harness a team with a logical chain;
When he spoke for our manhood in syllabled fire,
We called him “The Justice," but now he's the “Squire."
And there's a nice youngster of excellent pith;
Fate tried to conceal him by naming him Smith;
But he shouted a song for the brave and the free,
Just read on his medal, “My country," "of thee"!

You hear that boy laughing? You think he's all fun;
But the angels laugh, too, at the good he has done;
The children laugh loud as they troop to his call,
And the pyör man that knows him laughs loudest of all.

And I sometimes have asked, Shall we ever be men?
Shall we always he youthful, and laughing, and gay,

Then here's to our boyhood, its gold and its yray!
The stars of its winter, the dews of its May!
And when we have done with our life-lasting toys,
Dear Father, take care of Thy children, THE BOYS !

An Order for a Picture.
0, good painter, tell me true,
Has your hand the cunning to draw
Shapes of things that you never saw ?
Aye? Well, here is an order for you.
Woods and cornfields a little brown,-
The picture must not be over-bright,-
Yet all in the golden and gracious light,
Of a cloud when the summer sun is down.
Alway and alway, night and morn,
Woods upon woods, with fields of corn
Lying between them, not quite sere,
And not in the full, thick, leafy bloom,
When the wind can hardly find breathing room
Under their tassels, --cattle near,
Biting shorter the shoit green grass,
And a hedge of sumacli and sassafras,
With bluebirds twittering all around, -
Ah, good painter, you can't paint sound!
These and the little house where I was born,
Low and little and black and old,

With children, many as it can hold,
All at the windows, open wide, -
Heads and shoulders clear outside,
And fair young faces all ablush ;
Perhaps you may have seen, some day,
Roses crowding the self-same way,
Out of a wilding, way-side bush.
Listen closer. When you have done
With woods and cornfields and grazing herda
A lady, the loveliest ever the sun
Looked down upon, you must paint for me;
Oh, if I only could make you see
The clear blue eyes, the tender smile,
The sovereign sweetness, the gentle grace,
The woinan's soul and the angel's face
That are beaming on me all the while!
I need not speak these foolish words:
Yet one word tells you all I would say,-.
She is my mother: you will agree
That all the rest may be thrown away.
Two little urchins at her knee
You must paint, sir; one like me,
The other with a clearer brow,
And the light of his adventurous eyes
Flashing with boldest enterprise :
At ten years old he went to sea,
God knoweth if he be living now,-
He sailed in the good ship “Commodore," —
Nobody ever crossed her track
To bring us news, and she never came back.
Ah, 'tis twenty long years and more
Since that old ship went out of the bay
With my great-hearted brother on her deck:
I watched him till he shrank to a speck,
And his face was toward me all the way.

Bright his hair was, a golden brown,
The time we stood at our mother's knee;
That beauteous head, if it did go down,
Carried sunshine into the sea!
Out in the fields one summer night
We were together, half afraid,
of the corn-leares' rustling, and of the shade
Of the high hills, stretching so still and far,-
Loitering till after the low little light
Of the candle shone through the open door,
And, over the hay-stack's pointed top,
All of a tremble, and ready to drop
The first half-hour, the great yellow star
That we, with staring, ignorant eyes,
Had often and often watched to see
Propped and held in its place in the skies
By the fork of a tall red mulberry tree,
Which close in the edge of our fax-field grew,-
Dead at the top,-just one branch full
Of leaves, notched round, and lined with wool,
From which it tenderly shook the dew
0.:er our head, when we came to play
In its handbreadth of shadow, day after day,
Afraid to go home, sir; for one of us bore
A nest full of speckled and thin-shelled eggs, –
The other, a bird, held fast by the legs,
Not so big as a straw of wheat:
The berries we gave her she wouldn't eat,
But cried and cried, till we held her bill,
So slim and shining, to keep her still.
At last we stood at our mother's knee.
Do you think, sir, if you try,
You can paint the look of a lie ?
If you can, pray have the grace
To put it solely in the face
Of the urchin that is likest me;
I think 'twas solely mine, indeed:

But that's no matter,-paint it so;
The eyes of our mother—(take good heed) -
Looking not on the nest-full of eggs,
Nor the fluttering bird, held so fast by the legs,
But straight through our faces, down to our lies,
And oh, with such injured, reproachful surprise,
I felt my heart bleed where that glance went, as though
A sharp blade struck through it.
You, sir, know,
That you on the canvas are to repeat
Things that are fairest, things most sweet,-
Woods and cornfields and mulberry tree,
The mother,—the lads, with their birds, at her knee,
But, oh that look of reproachful woe!
High as the heavens your name I'll shout, ..
If you paint me the picture, and leave that out.

Scene from the Merchant of Venice.
Belmont. A Room in Portia's House.
Por. By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of this great
world.
Ner. You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in the
same abundance as your good fortunes are; and yet, for aught I
see, they are as sick that surfeit with too much as they that starve
with nothing. It is no mean happiness, therefore, to be seated in
the mean; superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but competency
lives longer.
Por. Good sentences and well pronounced.
Ner. They would be better if well followed.
Por. If to do were as easy as to know what were good to do
chapels had been churches, and poor men's cottages princes' palaces
It is a good divine that follows his own instructions. I can easier
teach twenty what were good to be done than be one of the twenty
to follow niine own teaching. The brain may devise laws for the
ploud; but a hot temper leaps orer a cold decree; such a hare

husband. O mel the word choose! I may neither choose whom ]
would, nor refuse whom I dislike; so is the will of a living daughter
curbed by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard, Nerissa, that )
cannot choose one, nor refuse none ?
Ner. Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their death
have good inspirations; therefore the lottery that he hath devised in
these three chests of gold, silver, and lead (whereof who chooses
his meaning, chooses you), will, no doubt, never be chosen by any
rightly, but one whom you shall rightly love. But what warmth is
there in your affection toward any of these princely suitors that
are already come ?
Por. I pray thee overname them; and as thou namest them, I
will describe them; and according to my description, level at my
affection.
Ner. First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
Por. Ay, that's a colt, indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of his
horse; and he makes it a great appropriation to his own good parts
that he can shoe him himself.
Ner. Then, is there the county Palatine.
Por. He doth nothing but frown; as who should say, “And you
will not have me choose;" he hears merry tales and smiles not,
I fear he will prove the weeping philosopher, when he grows old,
being so full of unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather
be married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth, than to
either of these. God defend me from these two!
Ner. How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon ?
Por. God made him, and therefore let himn pass for a man. In
truth, I know it is a sin to be mocker; but, hel why he hath a
horse better than the Neapolitan's; a better bad habit of frowning
than the count Palatine. He is every man in no man; if a throstle
sing he falls straight a capering; he will fence with his own shadow.
If I should marry him I should marry twenty husbands. If he
would despise me, I would forgive him ; for if he love me to mad.
ness, I should never requite him.
Ner. What say you then to Faulconbridge, the young baron of
England ?
Por. You know I say nothing to him, for he understands not me
nor I him; he hath neither Latin, French, nor Italian ; and you

will come into the court and swear that I have a poor penny worta
in the English. He is a proper man's picture; but, alas! who can
converse with a dumb show? How oddly he is suited; I think he
bought liis doublet in Italy, his round-hose in France, his bonnet in
Germany and his behavior everywhere.
Ner. What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbor ?
Por. That he hath neighborly charity in him, for he borrowed a
ox of the ear, of the Englishman, and swore he would pay him
gain when he was able. I think the Frenchman became his surety,
and sealed under for another.
Ner. How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's
nephew ?
Por. Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober; and most
rilely in the afternoon when he is drunk; when he is best, he is a
little worse than a man; and when he is worst, he is little better
than a beast. And the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall make
shift to go without him.
Ner. If he should make offer to choose, and choose the right casket,
you would refuse to perform your father's will if you should refuse
to accept him.
Por. Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee set a deep glass
of Rhenish wine on the contrary casket : for if the devil be within,
and that temptation without, I know he will choose it. I will do
any thing, Nerissa, ere I will be married to a sponge.
Ner. You need not fear, lady, the having any of these lords; they
have acquainted me with their determinations; which is, indeed, to
return to their home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless
you may be won by some other sort than your father's imposi-
tion, depending on the caskets.
Por. If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as chaste as
Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner of my father's will. I
am glad this parcel of wooers are so reasonable; for there is not
one among them but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God
grant them a fair departure.
Ner. Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time a Vene-
tian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither in company of the
Marquis of Montferrat ?
Por. Yes, yes; it was Bassanio; as I think, so he was called

Ner. True, madam; he, of all the men that ever my foolish eyes
looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
Por. I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of thy
praise. How now! Whai news?
Servant. The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take their
leave; and there is a forerunner come from a fifth, the prince of
Morocco, who brings word, the prince, his master, will be here
tr.night
Por. If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a heart
as I can bid the other four farewell, I should be glad of his approach;
if he have the condition of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I
had rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come, Nerissa.
Sirrah, go before. Whiles we shut the gate upon one wooer,
another knocks at the door.
Shakspeare.
The National Ensign.
Sir, I must detain you no longer. I have said enough, and more
than enough, to manifest the spirit in which this flag is now com-
mitted to your charge. It is the national ensign, pure and simple;
dearer to all our hearts at this moment, as we liſt it to the gale, and
see no other sign of hope upon the storm cloud which rolls and
rattles above it, save that which is reflected from its own radiant
hues; dearer, a thousand-fold dearer to us all, than ever it was
before, while gilded by the sunshine of prosperity, and playing with
the zephyrs of peace. It will speak for itself far more eloquently
than I can speak for it.
Behold it! Listen to it! Every star has a tongue; every stripe
is articulate. There is no language or speech where their voices
are not heard. There's magic in the web of it. It has an answer
for every question of duty. It has a solution for every doubt and
perplexity. It has a word of good cheer for every hour of glooin
or of despondency.
Behold it! Listen to it! It speaks of earlier and of later strug-
gles. It speaks of victories, and sometimes of reverses, on the sca
and on the land. It speaks of patriots and heroes among the living
and the dead : and of him the first and greatest of them all, around
whose consecrated asł.es this unnatural and abhorrent strife has so

The Song of the Camp.
“Give us a song !" the soldiers cried,
The outer trenches guarding,
When the heated guns of the camps allied
Grew weary of bombarding.
The dark Redan, in silent scoff,
Lay, grim and threatening, under;
And the tawny mound of the Malakoff
No longer belched its thunder.
There was a pause. A guardsman said:
“We storm the forts to-morrow;
Sing while we may, another day
Will bring enough of sorrow."
They lay along the battery's side,
Below the smoking cannon :
Brave hearts, from Severn and from Clyde,
And from the banks of Shannon.
They sang of love, and not of fame;
Forgot was Britain's glory:
Each heart recalled a different name,
But all sang “ Annie Lawrie.''
Voice after voice caught up the song,
Until its tender passion
Rose like an anthem, rich and strong,–
Their battle-eve confession.

The bloody sunset's embers,
While the Crimean valleys learned
How English love remembers.
And once again a fire of hell
Rained on the Russian quarters,
With scream of shot, and burst of shell,
And bellowing of the mortars !
And Irish Nora's eyes are dim
For a singer, dumb and gory;
And English Mary mourns for him
Who sang of“ Annie Lawric."

For they will criticise then in a different shape;
You're ahead of your means, or your tailor's unpaid;
But mind your own business, there's nought to be made
For people will talk, etc.
They'll talk fine before you; but then at your back,
Of venom and slander there's never a lack;
How kind and polite in all that they say,
But bitter as gall when you are away.
For people will talk, etc.
The best way to do is to do as you pleasc,
For your mind (if you have one) will then be at ease;
Of course you will meet with all sorts of abuse,
But don't think to stop them, it isn't any use,
For people will talk, you know, people will talk,

Wounded by bayonets, shells and balls,
Somebody's darling was borne one day.
Somebody's darling, so young and so brave,
Wearing yet on his pale, sweet face,
Soon to be hid by the dust of the grave,
The lingering light of his boyhood grace.
Matted and damp are the curls of gold,
Kissing the snow of that fair young brow;
Pale are the lips, cf delicate mold-
Somebody's darling is dying now.
Back from his beautiful blue-veined brow,
Brush all the wandering waves of gold;
Cross his hands on his bosom now,
Somebody's darling is stiff and cold.
Kiss him once for somebody's sake,
Murmur a prayer, soft and low;
One bright curl from its fair mates take,
They were somebody's pride you know.
Somebody's hand hath rested there;
Was it a mother's, soft and white ?
And have the lips of a sister fair
Been baptized in the waves of light?
God knows best! He was somebody's love,
Somebody's heart enslırined him there;
Somebody wafted his name above,
Night and noon on the wirgs of prayer.
Somebody wept when he marched away,
Looking so handsome, brave and grand
Somebody's kiss on his forehead lay,
Somebody clung to his parting hand.
Somebody's waiting and watching for him,
Yearning to hold him again to their heart,
And there he lies, with his blue eyes dim,
And the smiling, child-like lips apart.

War Lyrics of the South,
Zenobia's Ambition
I amn charged with pride and ambition. The charge is true, and
Iglory in its truth. Who ever achieved any thing great in letters,
arts or arms, who was not ambitious ? Cæsar was not more ambi-
tious than Cicero. It was but in another way. All greatness is
born of ambition. Let the ambition be a noble one, and who shall
tlame it? I confess I did once aspire to be queen, not only of
Palmyra, but of the East. That I am. I now aspire to remain so.
Is it not an honorable ambition ? Does it not become a descendant
of the Ptolemies and of Cleopatra ? I am applauded by you all
for what I have already done. You would not it should have been
less.
But why pause here? Is so much ambition praiseworthy, and
more criminal? Is it fixed in nature that the limits of this empire
should be Egypt on the one hand, the Hellespont and the Euxine
on the other? Were not Suez and Armenia more natural limits?
Or hath empire no natural liinit, but is broad as the genius that can
devise, and the power that can win ? Rome has the West. Let
Palmyra possess the East. Not that nature prescribes this and no
more. The gods prospering, and I swear not that the Mediterra-
nean shall hem me in upon the west, or Persia on the east. Longi-
nus is right-I would that the world were mine. I feel, within, the
will and the power to bless it were it so.
Are not my people happy? 1.'-k upon the past and the present,
upon my nearer and remoter subjects, ind ask nor fear the answer.
Whom have I wronged ?—what province have I oppressed ?—what
city pillaged ?—what region drained with taxes ?-whose life have
I unjustly taken, or estates coveted or robbed ?—whose honor have
I wantonly assailed ?—whose rights, though of the weakest and
poorest, have I trenched upon ?-I dwell, where I would ever
dwell, ir: the hearts of my people. It is written in your faces, that

I reign not more over you than within you. The foundation of my
throne is not more power than love.
Suppose now my ambition add another province to our realm.
Is it an evil? The kingdoms already bound to us by the joint acts
of ourself and the late royal Odenatus, we found discordant and at
war. They are now united and at peace. One harmonious wholo
has grown out of hostile and sundered parts. At niy hands they
receive a common justice and equal benefits. The channels of their
commerce have I opened, and dug them deep and sure. Prosperity
and plenty are in all their borders. The streets of our capital bear
istimony to the distant and various industry which here seeks its
market,
This is no vain boasting; receive it not so, good friends. It is
but truth. He who traduces himself, sins with him who traduces
another. He who is unjust to himself, or less than just, breaks a
law, as well as he who hurts his neighbor. I tell you what I am,
and what I have done, that your trust for the future may not rest
upon ignorant grounds. If I am more than just to myself, rebuke
me. If I have overstepped the modesty that became ine, I am open
to your censure, and will bear it.
But I have spoken that you may know your queen, not only by
her acts, but by her admitted principles. I tell you then that I am
ambitious, that I crave dominion, and while I live will reign.
Sprung from a line of kings, a throne is my natural seat. I love it.
But I strive, too, you can bear me witness that I do, that it shall be,
while I sit upon it, an honored, unpolluted seat. If I can, I will
hang a yet brighter glory around it.

Portia's Speech on Mercy.
The quality of mercy is not strained,
It droppeth as the gentle rain from Heaven
Upon the place beneath. It is twice blessed
It blesseth him that gives and him that takos.
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown.

His scepter shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,
Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings
But mercy is above this sceptered sway,
It is enthroned in the heart of kings-
It is an attribute to God himself.
And earthly power doth then show likest God's,
When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
That, in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation. We do pray for mercy,
And that same prayer doth teach us all
To render the deeds of mercy.

Hear the sledges with the bells,
Silver bells !
What a world of merriment their melody foretells !
How they tinkle, tinkle, tinkle,
In the icy air of night!
While the stars, that oversprinkle
All the heavens, seem to twinkle
With a crystalline delight;
Keeping time,
In a sort of Runic rhyme,
To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells
From the bells,
From the jingling and the tinkling of the bells.
Hear the mellow wedding bells,
Golden bells !
What a world of happiness their harmony foretolle!
Through the balmy air of nighty
How they ring out their delight!
From the molten golden notes,
And all in tune,
What a liquid ditty floats

On the moon!
Oh! from out the sounding cells,
What a gush of euphony voluminously wells,
How it swells !
How it dwells !
On the future!-how it tells
Of the rapture that impels
To the swinging and the ringing
Of the bells,
T'o the rhyming and the chiming of the bells 1
Hear the loud alarum bells,
Brazen bells !
What a tale of terror, now, their turbulency tells
In the startled ear of night
How they scream out their affright!
Too much horrified to speak,
They can only shriek, shriek,
Out of tune,
In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire,
In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire,
Leaping higher, higher, higher,
With a desperate desire,
And a resolute endeavor
Now—now to sit, or never,
By the side of the pale-faced moon.
Oh! the bells !
What a tale their terror tells
of despair 1
How they clang, and clash, and roar!
What a horror they outpour
On the bosom of the palpitating air!
Yet the ear it fully knows,
By the twanging
And the clanging,
How the danger ebbs and flows;

What a world of solemn thought their monody compels !
In the silence of the night,
How we shiver with affright
At the melancholy menace of their tone!
For every sound that floats
From the rust within their throats,
Is a groan.
And the people-ahl the people!
They that dwell up in the steeple,
All alone,
And who, tolling, tolling, tolling,
In that mumed monotone,
Feel a glory in so rolling,
On the human heart a stone:
They are neither man nor woman,
They are neither brute nor human;
They are ghouls;
And their king it is who tolls;
And he rolls,
A pæan from the bells!
And his merry bosom swells
With the pæan of the bells!
And he dances, and he yells;

But soft! What light through yonder window breaks !

Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
Who is already sick and pale with grief,
That thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.
“It is my lady; Oh! it is my love:
“Oh, that she knew she were !"
She speaks, yet she says nothing: what of that ?
Her eye discourses: I will answer it.
I am too bold. Oh, were those eyes in heaven,
They would through the airy region stream so bright,
That birds would sing, and think it were the morn.
See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand,
That I might touch that cheek!

And sails upon the bosom of the air,

Of that tongue's uttering, yet I know the sound!
Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague ?
Rom. Neither, fair saint, if either thee displease.
Jul. How cam'st thou hither ?—tell me—and for what?
The orchard walls are high, and hard to climb;
And the place, death, considering who thou art,
If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
Rom. With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls,
For stony limits cannot hold love out;
And what love can do, that dares love attempt;
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me.
Jul. If they do see thee here, they'll murder theo.
Rom. Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye,
Than twenty of their swords I look thou but sweet,
And I am proof against their enmity.
Jul. I would not, for the world, they saw thee here.
By whose direction found'st thou out this place ?
Rom. By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;

He lent me counsel, and I lent him eyes.
I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
As that vast shore washed with the furthest sea,
I would adventure for such merchandise.
Jul. Thcu know'st, the mask of night is on my face,
Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek,
For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
Fain would I dwell on form; fain, fain deny
What I have spoke! But farewell compliment!
Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say-Ay,
And I will take thy word! yet, if thou swear'st,
Thou may'st prove false ; at lovers' perjuries,
They say, Jove laughs. Oh, gentle Romeo,
If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully!
Or, if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
I'll frown, and be perverse, and say thee nay,
So thou wilt wool but else, not for the world.
In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond: ,
And therefore thou may'st think my 'haviour light!
But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
I should have been more strange, I must confess
But that thou overheard'st, ere I was 'ware,
My true love's passion; therefore, pardon me,
And not impute this yielding to light love,
Which the dark night has so discovered.
Rom. Lady, by yonder blessed moon I vow-
Jul. Ohl swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon
That monthly changes in her circled orb;
Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
Rom. What shall I swear by ?
Jul. Do not swear at all;
Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
Which is the god of my idolatry,
And I'll believe thee.
Rom. If my true heart's love-
Jul. Well, do not swear! Although I joy in thos,
I have no joy of this contract to-night;

Good night, good night !-as sweet repose and rest
Come to thy heart, as that within my breast !
Rom. Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?
Jul. What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
Rom. The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
JW. I gave thee mine, before thou didst request it:
And yet I would it were to give again.
Rom. Would'st thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love ?
Jul. But to be frank, and give it thee again.
My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
The more I have; for both are infinite,
I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu!

Eating a Christmas pie;
He put in his thumb
And pulled out a plum,
And said, “What a great boy am I.""
Ah! the world has many a Horner,
Who, seated in his corner,
Finds a Christmas pie provided for his thumb,
And cries out with exultation,
When successful exploration

Little Jack outgrows his tire,
And becometh John, Esquire,
And he finds a monstrous pastry ready-made,
Stuffed with notes and bonds and bales,
With invoices and sales,
And all the mixed ingredients of trade.
And again it is his luck,
To be just in time to pluck,
By a "clever operation," from the pie
An unexpected plum ;
So he glorifies his thumb,
And says, proudly, “ What a mighty man am I."

In the dish of politics;

While he writes himself the “Honorable John. "

In the spiced and sugared mass,
One may compass (don't they call it so ?) a catch;
And the gratulation given,
Seems as if the very heaven
Had outdone itself in making such a match.
Oh, the world keeps Christirias day
In a queer perpetual way;
Shouting always, “What a great, big boy anı Il"

And all its accidental honors liſing high,
Have really more than Jack, .
With all their lucky knack,

Apple and peach-trees fruited deep,
Fair as a garden of the Lord,
To the eyes of the famished Rebel horde.
On that pleasant day of the early fall,
When Lee marched over the mountain wall,
Over the mountains winding down,
Horse and foot into Frederick town,
Forty flags with the silvery stars,
Forty flags with their crimson bars,
Flapped in the morning wind; the sun
Of noon looked down and saw not one.
Up rose old Barbara Frietchie then,
Bowed with her fourscore years and ten,
Bravest of all in Frederick town,
She took up the flag the men hauled down.
In her attic window the staff she set,
To show that one heart was loyal yet.
Up the street came the Rebel tread,
Stonewall Jackson riding ahead.
Under his slouched hat left and right
Ile glanced; the old flag met his sight.
“Halt!"—the dust-brown ranks stood fast
"Fire !"-out blazed the rifle blast;
It shivered the window, pane, and sash,
It rent the banner with seam and gash.
Quick, as it fell from the broken staff,
Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf;
She leaned far out on the window-sill,
And shook it forth with a royal will.
“Shoot, if you must, this gray old head,
But spare your country's flag,” she said.
A shade of sadness, a blush of shame,
Over the face of the leader came;
The noble nature within him stirred
To life at Barbara's deed and word:

“Who touches a hair of yon gray head,
Dies like a dog! March on!" he said.
All lay long through Frederick street,
Sounded the tread of marching feet,
All day long that free flag tossed
Over the heads of the Rebel host;
Ever its torn fulds rose and fell
On the loyal winds that lured it well;
And, through the hill-gaps, sunset light
Shone over it with a warm good-night.
Barbara Frietchie's work is o'er,
And the Rebel rides on his raids no more;
Honor to her! and let a tear
Fall, for her sake, on Stonewall's bier.
Over Barbara Frietchie's grave,
Flag of Freedom and Union wave!
Peace and order and beauty draw
Round thy symbol of light and law;
And ever the stars above look down
On thy stars below at Frederick town.

One child to me for aye is given.”
I looked at John's old garments worn,
I thought of all that John had borne .
Of poverty, and work and care,
Which I, though willing, could not sparel
Of seven hungry mouths to ſeed,
Of seven little children's need,
And then of this.
“Come, John," said to
“We'll choose among them as they lie
Asleep;" so walking hand in hand,
Dear John and I surveyed our band.
First to the cradle lightly stepped,
Where Lilian, the baby, slept;
Her damp curls lay like gold aliglit,
A glory 'gainst the pillow white,
Softly her father stooped to lay
His rough hand down in loving way.
When dream or whisper made her stir,
And huskily he said, “Not her— not her."
We stooped beside the trundle-bed,
And one long ray of lamp-light shed
Athwart the boyish faces there
In sleep so pitiſul and fair;
I saw on Jamie's rough, red cheek
A tear undried. Ere John could speak,
“He's but a baby, too,” said I,
And kissed him as we hurried by.
Pale, patient Robby's angel face
Still in his sleep bore suffering's trace.
“No, for a thousand crowns, not him,"
He whispered, while our eyes were dim,

Only a mother's heart can be
Patient enough for such as he;
And so," said John, “ I would not dare
To send him from her bedside prayer."
Then stole we softly up above,
And knelt by Mary, child of lore,
“Perhaps for her 'twould better be,”
I said to John. Quite silently
He lifted up a curl that lay
Across her cheek in willful way.
And shook his head. “Nay, love, not thee,"
The while my heart beat audibly,
Only one more, our eldest lad,
Trusty and truthful, good and glad
So like his father. “No, John, no-
I cannot, will not, let him go!"
And so we wrote, in courteous way,
We could not give one child away;
And afterward toil lighter seemed,
Thinking of that of which we dreamed.
Happy in truth that not one face
We missed from its accustomed place;
Thankful to work for all the seven,
Trusting then to One in Heaven!
The Power of Habits
I remember once riding from Buffalo to the Niagara Falls. I said
to a gentleman, “ What river is that, sir?".
“That,” said he, “is Niagara river."
“Well, it is a beautiful stream,” said I; “bright, and fair, and
Glassy. How far off are the rapids ?"
“Only a mile or two," was the reply.
"Is it possible that only a mile from us, we shall fired the water in
We turbulence which it must show near the Falls ?"

“ You will find it so, sir.” And so I found it; and the first sigh:
of Niagara I shall never forget.
Now, launch your bark on that Niagara river; it is brighh
sniooth, beautiful and glassy. There is a ripple at the bow; the
silver wake you leave behind, adds to your enjoyment. Down the
stream you glide, oars, sails, and helm in proper trim, and you set
out on your pleasure excursion.
Suildenly, some one cries out from the bank, “ Young, men,

“ What is it ?"
“ The rapids are below you !"
"Ha! ha! we have heard of the rapids; but we are not such
fools as to get there. If we go too fast, then we shall up with the
helm, and steer to the shore; we will set the mast in the socket,
hoist the sail, and speed to the land. Then on, boys; don't be
alarmed, there is no danger.”
“ Young men, ahoy there!"
“What is it?"
“The rapids are below you !".
“Ha! ha! we will laugh and quaff; all things delight us. What
care we for the future! No man ever saw it. Sufficient for the
day is the evil thereof. We will enjoy life while we may, wil!
catch pleasure as it flies. This is enjoyment; time enough to steer
out of danger when we are sailing swiftly with the current." .
“ YOUNG MEN, AHOY!"
“ What is it?"
“ BEWARE! BEWARE! THE RAPIDS ARE BELOW YOU!"
“Now you see the water foaming all around. See how fast you
pass that point! Up with the helm! Now turn! Pull hard !
Quick! quick! quick! pull for your lives! pull till the blood starts
from your nostrils, and the veins stand like whip-cords upon your
brow! Set the mast in the socket! hoist the sail ! Ah! ahl it i
too late! Shrieking, howling, blaspheming; over they go.”
Thousands go over the rapids of intemperance every year, through
the power of habit, crying all the while, “ When I find out that it is
injuring me, I will give it up!"

From Ivanhoe
Following with wonderful promptitude the directions of Ivanhoe,
and availing herself of the protection of the large ancient shield,
which she placed against the lower part of the window, Rebecca,
with tolerable security to herself, could witness part of what was
passing without the castle, and report to Ivanhoe the preparations
which the assailants were making for the storm.
“The skirts of the wood seem lined with archers, although only
a few are advanced from its dark shadow."
“Under what banner ?” asked Ivanhoe.
“ Under uo ensign of war which I can observe," answered Ro-
becca.
“A singular novelty," muttered the knight, “ to advance to storm
such a castle without pennon or banner displayed! Seest thou who
they be that act as leaders ?”
"A knight, clad in sable armor, is the most conspicuous," said
the Jewess; "he alone is armed from head to heel, and seems to
assume the direction of all around him."
“What device does he bear on his shield ?" replied Ivanhoe.
'Something resembling a bar of iron, and a padlock painted blue
on the black shield.”
“A fetterlock and shacklebolt azure," said Ivanhoe; “I know
not who may bear the device, but well I ween it might now be
mine own. Canst thou not see the motto?"
“Scarce the device itself, at this distance," replied Rebecca ; “but
when the sun glances fair upon his shield, it shows as I tell you."
"Seem there no other leaders ? " exclaimed the anxious inquirer.
“None of mark and distinction that I can behold from this sta-
tion," said Rebecca; “but, doubtless, the other side of the castle is
also assailed. They appear even now preparing to advance."
Her description was here suddenly interrupted by the signal for
assault, which was given by the blast of a shrill bugle, and at once
answered by a flourish of the Norman trumpets from the battle-
ments.
* And I must lie here like a bedridden monk,” exclaimed Ivan-
luoe, “while the game that gives me freedom or death is played out
by the hand of others! Look from the window once again, kind

maiden, but beware that you are not marked by the archers be
neath, look out once more, and tell me if they yet advance to the
storm."
With patient courage, strengthened by the interval which she
had employed in mental devotion, Rebecca again took post at the
lattice, sheltering herself, however, so as not to be visible from
beneath.
“What dost thou see, Rebecca ?” again demanded the wounded
night.
“Nothing but the cloud of arrows flying so thick as to dazzle
mine eyes, and to hide the bowmen who shoot them."
“That cannot endure,” said Ivanhoe; “if they press not right
on to carry the castle by pure force of arms, the archery may avail
but little against stone walls and bulwarks. Look for the Knight
of the Fetterlock, fair Rebecca, and see how he bears himself; for,
as the leader is, so will his followers be."
“I see him not,” said Rebecca.
"Foul craven !” exclaimed Ivanhoe ; "does he blench from the
helm when the wind blows highest ?”
"He blenches not! he blenches not!” said Rebecca; "I see him
now; he leads a body of men close under the outer barrier of the
barbican. They pull down the piles and palisades; they hew down
the barriers with axes. His high black plume floats abroad over the
throng, like a raven over the field of the slain. They have made a
breach in the barriers — they rush in— they are tiirust back!
Front-de-Boeuf heads the defenders; I see his gigantic form above
the press. They throng again to the breach, and the pass is dis-
puted hand to hand, and man to man. It is the meeting of two
fierce tides — the conflict of two oceans, moved by adverse winds!"
She turned her head from the lattice, as if unable longer to endure
a sight so terrible.
“Look forth again, Rebecca," said Ivanhoe, mistaking the cause
of her retiring; "the archery must in some degree have ceased
since they are now fighting hand to hand. Look again; there is
now less danger."
Rebecca again looked forth, and almost immediately exclaimed:
"Front-de-Boeuf and the Black Knight fight hand to hand on the
breach, amid the roar of their followers, who watch the progress

of the strife. Hearen strike with the cause of the oppressed, and
of the captive!”.
She then uttered a loud shriek, and exclaimed:
“ He is down!- he is down!"
“Who is down?” cried Ivanhoe. “For our dear lady's sake,
tell me which has fallen ?”
"The Black Knight," answered Rebecca, faintly; then instantly
again shouted, with joyful eagerness, “But no- but nol - he is
or. foot again, and fights as if there were twenty men's strength in
his single armn - his sword is broken — he snatches an axe from a
yeoman - he presses Front-de-Boeuf with blow on blow - the
giant stoops and totters, like an oak under the steel of the wood-
man — he falls — he falls! ".
"Front-de-Boeuf?” exclaimed Ivanhoe.
"Front-de-Boeuf !" answered the Jewess. “His men rush to
the rescue, headed by the haughty Templar.- their united force
compels the champion to pause -- they drag Front-de-Boeuf within
the walls."
“The assailants have won the barriers, have they not?” said
Ivanhoe,
“They have — they have!” exclaimed Rebecca, “and they press
the beseiged hard upon the outer wall; some plant ladders, some
swarm like bees, and endeavor to ascend upon the shoulders of each
other - down go stones, beams, and trunks of trees upon their
heads; and as fast as they bear the wounded men to the rear, fresh
men supply their place in the assault. Great God l hast thou given
men thine own image, that it should be thus cruelly defaced by the
hands of their brethren!"
“Think not of that,” said Ivanhoe; “this is no time for such
thoughts. Who yield ?—who push their way?”.
“The ladders are thrown down," replied Rebecca, shuddering.
“ The soldiers lie groveling under them like crushed reptiles — the
besieged have the better!"
“Saint George strike for us!" exclaimed the knight; “do the
false yeomen give way?"
“No!" exclaimed Rebecca; "they bear themselves right yeo-
manly – the Black Knight approaches the postern with his huge
axe — the thundering blows which he deals, you may hear them

above all the din and shouts of the battle — stones and beams are
hailed down on the bold champion - he regards them no more than
if they were thistledown or feathers ! ”
“By Saint Jolin of Acre!” said Ivanhoe, raising himself joy-
fully on his couch; "methought there was but one man in England
that might do such a deed!”
"The postern gate shakes," continued Rebecca; “it crashes-
it is splintered by his blows — they rush in — the outwork is won –
they hurl the defenders from the battlements — they throw them
into the moat! Oh, men — if ye be indeed•men - spare them that
can resist no longer!”
“The bridge, the bridge which communicates with the castle,
hare they won that pass ? " exclaimed Ivanhoe.
"No," replied Rebecca; “ the Templar has destroyed the plank
on which they crossed — few of the defenders escaped with him
into the castle--the shrieks and cries which you hear, tell the fate
of the others! Alas! I see it is still more difficult to look upon
victory than upon battle! "
“What do they now, maiden ? " said Ivanhoe; “look forth yet
again — this is no time to faint at bloodshed.”
“It is over for the time," answered Rebecca. “Our friends
strengthen themselves within the outwork which they have mas-
tered, and it affords them so good a shelter from the foeman's shot,
that the garrison only bestow a few bolts on it, from interral to
interval, as if rather to disquiet than effectually to injure them.".

Rip Van Winkle
He now hurried forth, and hastened to his old resort, the village
inn — but it too was gone. A large rickety wooden building stood
its place, with great gaping windows, some of them broken and
mended with old hats and petticoats, and over the door was painted,
“ The Union Hotel, by Jonathan Doolittle.” Instead of the great
tree that used to shelter the quiet little Dutch inn of yore, there
now was reared a tall, naked pole, with something on the top that
looked like a red night-cap, and from it was fluttering a fag, on

which was a singular assemblage of stars and stripes — all tl.is was
strange and incomprehensible. He recognized on the sign, how-
ever, the ruby face of King George, under which he had smoked so
many a peaceful pipe; but even this was singularly metamorphosed.
The red coat was changed for one of blue and buff, a sword was
held in the hand instead of a scepter, the head was decorated with
a cocked hat, and underneath was painted in large characters,
GENERAL WASHINGTON.
There was, as usual, a crowd of folk about the door, but none
that Rip recollected. The very character of the people seemed
changed. There was a busy, bustling, disputatious tone about it,
instead of the accustomed phlegm and drowsy tranquillity. He
looked in rain for the sage Nicholas Vedder, with his broad face,
double chin, and fair long pipe, uttering clouds of tobacco smoke
instead of idle speeches; or Van Bummel, the schoolmaster, doling
forth the contents of an ancient newspaper. In place of these, a
lean, bilious-looking fellow, with his pockets full of handbills, way
haranguing vehemently about rights of citizens - elections — mem-
bers of Congress - liberty - Bunker's Hill — heroes of seventy-
six — and other words, which were a perfect Babylonish jargon to
the bewildered Van Winkle.
The appearance of Rip, with his long grizzled beard, his rusty
fowling-piece, his uncouth dress, and an army of women and child-
ren at his heels, soon attracted the attention of the tavern politicians.
They crowded around hiin, eying him from head to foot with great
curiosity. The orator bustled up to him, and, drawing him partly
aside, inquired “on which side he voted ?" Rip stared in vacant
stupidity. Another short but busy little fellow pulled him by the
arm, and, rising on tiptoe, inquired in his ear, “whether he was
Federal or Democrat?” Rip was equally at a loss to comprehend
the question; whep a knowing, self-important old gentleman, in a
sharp cocked hat, made his way through the crowd, putting them
to the right and left with his elbows as he passed, and planting
himself before Van Winkle, with one arm akimbo, the other resting
on his cane, his keen eyes and sharp hat penetrating, as it were,
into his very soul, demanded, in an austere tonc, “what brought
him to the election with a gun on his shoulder, and a mob at his
heels, and whether he meant to breed a riot in the village ?”.

“Alas! gentlemen,” cried Rip, somewhat dismayed, “I am a poor
quiet man, a native of the place, and a loyal subject of the king,
God bless liim!"
llere a general shout burst from the bystanders—"A tory! a
tory! a spyl a refugeel hustlé him! away with him!” It was
with great difficulty that the self-important man in the cocked hat
restored order; and, having assuined a tenfold austerity of brow,
demanded again of the unknown culprit, what he came there for
and whom he was seeking? The poor man humbly assured hin
that lie meant no harm, but merely came there in search of some
of his neighbors, who used to keep about the tavern.
"Well, who are they? Name them."
“ Rip bethought himself a moment, and inquired, “Where's
Nicholas Vedder?".
There was a silence for a little while, when an old man replied,
in a thin, piping voice, “Nicholas Vedder! why, he is dead and
gone these eighteen years! There was a wooden tombstone in the
clıurchyard that used to tell all about him, but that's rotten and
gone too."
“Where's Brom Dutcher ? "
"Oh, he went off to the army in the beginning of the war; some
say he was killed at the storming of Stony Point-others say he
was drowned in a squall at the foot of Antony's Nose. I don't

“He went off to the wars too, was a great militia general, and is
now in Congress,"
Rip's heart died away at hearing of these sad changes in his home
and friends, and finding himself thus alone in the world. Every
answer puzzled him too, by treating of such enormous lapses of
time, and of matters which he could not understand: war-Con-
gress-Stony Point; he had no courage to ask after any more
friends, but cried out in despair, “Does nobody here know Rip Van
Winkle?”
“Oh, Rip Van Winkle!” exclaimed two or three, “Oh, to be
surel that's Rip Van Winkle yonder, leaning against the tree.”
Rip looked, and beheld a precise counterpart of himself, as he
went up the mountain : apparently as lazy, and certainly as ragged

The poor fellow was now completely confounded. He doubted his
own identity, and whether he was himself or another man. In the
inidst of his bewilderment, the man in the cocked hat demanded
who he was, and what was his name?
"God knows,” exclaimed he, at his wit's end; “I'm not myself –
I'm somebody else—that's me yonder-no—that's somebody else
got into my shoes—I was myself last night, but I fell aslcep on the
mountain, and they've changed my gun, and every thing's changed,
and I'm changed, and I can't tell what's my name, or who I am!”
The by-standers began now to look at each other, nod, wink
significantly, and tap their fingers against their foreheads. There
was a whisper, also, about securin; the gun, and keeping the old
fellow from doing mischief, at the very suggestion of which the
self-important man in the cocked hat retired with some precipitation
At this critical moment a fresh, comely woman pressed through the
throng to get a peep at the gray-bearded man. She had a chubby
child in her arms, which, friglitened at his looks, began to cry
“ Ilush, Rip,” cried she, “hush, you little fool; the old man won't
hurt you." The name of the child, the air of the mother, the tone
of hier voice, all awakened a train of recollections in his mind.
What is your name, my good woman ?" asked he.
“Judith Gardenier."
“And your father's name ?"
“Ah! poor man, Rip Van Winkle was his name, but it's twenty
years since he went away from home with his gun, and never has
been heard of since—his dog came home without him; but whether
he shot himself, or was carried away by the Indians, nobody can
tell. I was then but a little girl.”
Rip had but one question more to ask; but he put it with a fal-
tering voice:
“Where's your mother?".
“Oh, she too had died but a short time since; she broke a bloud-
vessel in a fit of passion at a New England peddler."
There was a drop of comfort, at least, in this intelligence. The
honest man could contain himself no longer. He cauglit his daugh-
ter and her child in his arms. “I am your father!” cried he
“Young Rip Van Winkle once-old Rip Van Winkle now! Does
nobody know poor Rip Van Winkle ?”

All stood amazed, until an old woman, tottering out from among
the crowd, put her hand to her brow, and peering under it in his
face for a moment, exclaimed, “Sure enough! it is Rip Van Win-
kle—it is himself! Welcome home again, old neighbor. Why,
where have you been these twenty long years ?”
Rip's story was soon told, for the whole twenty long years had
been to liiin but as one night.
To make a long story short, the company broke up, and returned
to the more important concerns of the election. Rip's daughter
took him home to live with her; she had a snug, well-furnished
house, and a stout, cheery farmer for a husband, whom Rip recol.
lected for one of the urchins that used to climb upon his back.
The old Dutch inhabitants almost universally gave it full credit.
Even to this day they never hear a thunder-storm of a summer
afternoon about the Kaatskill, but they say Hendrick Hudson and
his crew are at their game of nine-pins; and it is a common wish
of all hen-pecked husbands in the neighborhood, when life bangg
heavy on their hands, that they might have a quieting draught out
of Rip Van Winkle's flagon.

Are the Children at Home ?
Each day when the glow of sunset
Fades in the western sky,
And the wee ones, tired of playing,
Go tripping lightly by,
I steal away from my husband,
Asleep in his easy-chair,
And watch from the open doorway
Their faces fresh and fair.
Alone in the dear old homestead
That once was full of life,
Ringing with girlish laughter,
Echoing with hoyish strife,
We two are waiting together;
And oft, as the shadows come,
With tremulous voice he calls me,
"It is night! are the children home?"

“Yes, love!" I answer him gently,
“They're all home long ago;"
And sing, in my quivering treble,
A song so soft and low,
Till the old man drops to slumber,
With his head upon his hand,
And I tell to myself the number
Home in the better land
Home, where never a sorrow
Shall dim their eyes with tears!
Where the smile of God is on them
Through all the summer years !
I knowl-yet my arms are empty,
That ſondly folded seven,
And the mother heart within me
Is almost starved for heaven.
Sometimes, in the dusk of evening,
I only shut my eyes,
And the children are all about me
A vision from the skies ;
The babes whose dimpled fingers
Lost the way to my breast,
And the beautiful ones, the angels,
Passed to the world of the blessed.
With never a cloud upon them,
I see their radiant brows;
My boys that I gave to freedoms-
The red sword sealed their vows!
In a tangled Southern forest,
Twin brothers, bold and brave,
They fell; and the flag they died for,
Thank Godl floats o'er their grave.
A breath, and the vision is lifted
Away on the wings of light,
And again we two are together,
All alone in the night;

But I smile at idle fears;
He is only back with the children,
In the dear and peaceful years.
And still as the summer sunset
Fades away in the west,
And the wee ones, tired of playing,
Go trooping home to rest,
My husband calls from his corner,

And I answer, with eyes uplifted,
“ Yes, dear, they are all at home !"

Lady Teazle. Sir Peter, Sir Peter, you may bear it or not, as you

what's more, I will too. What I though I was educated in the
country, I know very well that women of fashion in London are
accountable to nobody after they are married.
Sir P. Very well, ma'am, very well—so a husband is to have no
influence, no authority ?
Lady T. Authority! No, to be sure: if you wanted authority over
me you should have adopted me, and not married me. I am sure
you were old enough.
Sir P. Old enough l-ay—there it is. Well, well, Lady Teazle,

ruined by your extravagance.
Lady T. My extravagance! I am sure I am not more extrava-

Sir P. Zounds! Madam; if you had been born to this, I should
not wonder at your talking thus; but you forget what your situa-
tion was when I married you.
Lady T. No, no, I don't; 'twas a very disagreeable one — or I
should never have married you.
Sir P. Yes, yes, madam, you were then in a somewhat humbler
style—the daughter of a plain country squire. Recollect, Lady
Teazle, when I saw you first sitting at your tambour, in a pretty
figured linen gown, with a bunch of keys at your side; your hair
combed smooth over a roll, and your apartment hung round with
fruits in worsted of your own working.
Lady T. Oh yes! I remember it very well, and a curious life I
led—my daily occupation to inspect the dairy, superintend the
poultry, make extracts from the family receipt-book, and comb my
aunt Deborah's lap-dog.
Sir P. Yes, yes, ma'am 'twas so indeed.
Lady T. And then, you know, my evening amusements, to draw
patterns for rumes, which I had not the materials to make up; to
play Pope Joan with the curate; to read a novel to my aunt; or to
be stuck down to an old spinnet to strum my father to sleep after a
fox chase.
Sir P. I am glad you have so good a memory. Yes, madam
these were the recreations I took you from; but now you must
have your coach-vis-a-vis—and three powdered footmen before
your chair; and, in summer, a pair of white cats to draw you to
Kensington Gardens. No recollection, I suppose, when you were
content to ride double behind the butler, on a docked coach-horse.
Lady T. No-I never did that; I deny the butler ard the
coach-horse.
Sir P This, madam, was your situation; and what have I done
for you? I have made you a woman of fashion, of fortune, of rank;
in short, I have made you my wife.
Lady T. Well then; and there is but one thing more you can
make me, to add to the obligation, and that is
Sir P. My widow, I suppose.

your ill conduct may disturb my peace of mind, it shall never break
my heart, I promise you. However, I am equally obliged to you
for the hint.
Lady T. Then why will you endeavor to thwart me in every little
expense, and make yourself so disagreeable to me?
Sir P. Had you any of these little elegant expenses when you
married me?
Lady T. Sir Peter, would you have me out of the fashion ?
Sir P. The fashion, indeed! What had you to do with the fashion
before you married me?
Lady T. For my part, I should think you would like to have your
wife thought a woman of taste.
Sir P. Ay; there again-taste. Zounds! Madam, you had no
taste when you married me!
Lady T. That's very true, indeed, Sir Peter; and having married
you, I should never pretend to taste again, I allow. But now, Sir
Peter, since we have finished our daily jangle, I presume I may go
to my engagement at Lady Sneerwell's.
Sir P. Ay, there's another precious circumstance-a charming set
of acquaintances you have made there.
Lady T. Nay, Sir Peter, they are all people of rank and fortune,
and remarkably tenacious of reputation.
Sir P. Yes, they are tenacious of reputation with a vengeance;
for they don't choose any body should have a character but them-
selves! Such a crew! Ah! many a poor wretch has rid on a
hurdle who has done less mischief than these utterers of forged
tales, coiners of scandal, and clippers of reputation.
Lady T. What! would your restrain the freedom of speech?
Sir P. Ahl they have made you as bad as any one of the society.
Lady T. Why, I believe I do bear a part with a tolerable grace.
Sir P. Grace, indeed!
Lady T. But I declare I bear no malice against the people I abuse
When I say an ill-natured thing, 'tis out of pure good humor; and
take it for granted, they deal exactly so with me. But, Sir Peter,
you know you promised to come to Lady Sneerwell's too.

Sir P. So–I have gained much by my intended expostulation;
yet with what a charming air she contradicts every thing I say, and
how pleasingly she shows her contempt for my authority! Well,
I can't make her love me, but there is a satisfaction in quarreling
with her; and I think she never appears to such advantage as when
ahe is doing every thing in her power to plague me.
SCENE II.
Lady T. Sir Peter, I hope you haven't been quarreling with
Maria ? It is not using me well to be ill-humored when I am not

Sir P. Ah! Lady Teazle, you might have the power to make me
good-humored at all times.
Lady T. I am sure I wish I had; for I want you to be in charm-
ing sweet temper at this moment. Do be good-humored now, and
let me have two hundred pounds, will you?
Sir P. Two hundred pounds! WhatI ain't I to be in a good
humor without paying for it? But speak to me thus, and i' faith
there's nothing I could refuse you. You shall have it; but seal me
a bond of re-payment.
Lady T. Oh, no; there—my note of hand will do as well. (Of-
fering her hand.)
Sir P. And you shall no longer reproach me with not giving you
an independent settlement. I mean shortly to surprise you; but
shall we always live thus, hey?
Lady T.—If you please. I'm sure I don't care how soon we
leave off quarreling, provided you'll own you're tired out first.
Sir P. Wel?; then let our future contest be, who shall be most
obliging.
Lady T. I assure you, Sir Peter, good nature becomes you; you
look now as you did before we were married, when you used to
walk with me under the elms, and tell me stories of what a gallant
you were in your youth, and chuck me under the chin, you would;

There was tumult in the city,
In the quaint old Quaker town,
And the streets were rife with people
Pacing restless up and down;
People gathering at corners,
Where they whispered each to each,
And the sweat stood on their temples,
With the earnestness of speech.
As the bleak Atlantic currents
Lash the wild Newfoundland shore.
So they beat against the State House,
So they surged against the door;

And the mingling of their voices
Made a harmony profound,
Till the quiet street of Chestnut
Was all turbulent with sound.
“ Will they do it?” “Dare they do it?”
“Who is speaking ?” “What's the news?
" What of Adams ?” “What of Sherman ?"
“Oh! God grant they won't refuse; '
“Make some way there!” “Let me nearor / "
“I am stilling." "Stifle, then!
When a nation's life's at hazard,
We've no time to think of men.”
So they beat against the portal,
Man and woman, maid and child;
And the July sun in heaven
On the scene looked down and smileri
The same sun that saw the Spartan
Shed his patriot blood in vain,
Now beheld the soul of freedom,
All unconquered rise again.
Seel seel the dense crowd quivers
Through all its lengthy line,
As the boy beside the portal
Looks forth to give the sign; .
With his little hands uplifted,
Breezes dallying with his hair,
Hark! with deep, clear intonation
Breaks his young voice on the air.
Hushed the people's swelling murmur,
List the boy's exulting cry!
“Ring!" he shouts, “ring! grandpa,
Ring! oh, ring for LIBERTY !"
Quickly at the given signal
The old bellman lifts his hand,
Forth he sends the good news, making
Iron music through the land.

How the old bell shook the air, i
Till the clang cf freedom ruffled
The calmly gliding Delaware.
How the bonfires and the torches
Lighted up the night's repose,
And from flames, like fabled Phønix,
Our glorious liberty arose.
That old State House bell is silenty
Hushed is now its clamorous tongue;
But the spirit it awakened
Still is living-ever young;
And when we greet the smiling sunlight,
On the fourth of each July,
We will ne'er forget the bellman,
Who, betwixt the earth and sky,
Rang out loudly “INDEPENDENCE,"
Which, please God, shall never die.

Have you not heard the poets tell
How came the dainty Babie Bell
Into this world of ours ?
The gates of heaven were left ajar:
With folded hands and dreamy eyes,
Wandering out of Paredise,
She saw this planet, like a star,
Hung in the glittering depths of even,
Its bridges, running to and fro,

O'er which the white-winged angels go,
Bearing the holy dead to heaven!
She touched a bridge of flowers, those feet,
So light they did not bend the bells
Of the celestial asphodels!
They fell like dew upon tl.e flowers,
Then all the air grew strangely sweet;
And thus came dainty Babie Bell
Into this world of ours.
II.
Bhe came and brought delicious May,
The swallow's built beneath the eaves;
Like sunlight in and out the leaves,
The robins went, the livelong day;
The lily swung its noiseless bell,
And o'er the porch the trembling vine
Seemed bursting with its veins of wino;
How sweetly, softly, twilight fell !
Oh, earth was full of singing birds,
And opening spring-tide flowers,
When the dainty Babie Bell
Came to this world of ours !
III.
O Babie, dainty Babie Bell,
How fair she grew from day to day!
What woman-nature filled her eyor,
What poetry within them lay!
Those deep and tender twilight eyes,
So full of meaning, pure and bright,
As if she yet stood in the light
Of those opened gates of paradise!
And so we loved her more and more;
Ah, never in our hearts before
Was love so lovely born;
We felt we had a link between
This real world and that unseen,
The land beyond the morn“

and for the love of those dear eyes
For love of her whom God led forth
(The mother's being ceased on earth
When Babie came from Paradise )-
For love of him who smote our lives,
And woke the chords of joy and pain,
We said, “Dear Christ!” our hearts bent down
Like violets after rain.
IV.
And now the orchards, which were white
And red with blossoms when she came,
Were rich in autumn's mellow prime,
The clustered apples burnt like flame,
The soft-cheeked peaches blushed and fell,
The ivory chestnut burst its shell,
· The grape hung purpling in the grange,
And time wrought just as rich a change
In little Babie Bell.
Her lissome form more perfect grew,
And in her features we could trace,
In soſtened curves, her mother's face,
Her angel-nature ripened too,
We thought her lovely when she came,
But she was holy, saintly now,
Around her pale angelic brow
We saw a slender ring of flamel
V.
God's hand had taken away the seal
That held the portals of her speech;
And oft she said a few strange words,
Whose meaning lay beyond our reach.
She never was a child to us,
We never held her being's key;
We could not teach her holy things,
She was Christ's self in purity.

It came upon us by degrees,
We saw its shadow 'ere it fell,
The knowledge that our God had sent
llis messenger for Babie Bell.
We shuddered with unlanguaged pain,
And all our thoughts ran into tears,
Like sunshine into rain.
We cried aloud in our belief,
“Oh, smite us gently, gently, God!
Teach us to bend and kiss the rod,
And perfect grow through grief,"
Ah, how we loved her, God can tell;
Her heart was folded deep i: ours;
Our hearts are broken Babie Bell.

At last he came, the messenger,
The messenger from unseen lands,
And what did dainty Babie Bell?
She only crossed her hands,
She only looked more meek and fair!
We parted back her silken hair;
We wove the roses round her brow,
White buds, the summer's drifted snow,
Wrapped her from head to foot in flowers,
And thus went dainty Babie Bell
Out of this world of ours !

But never a tear drop welled up to her eye.

From Atalanta in Calydon.
Before the beginning of years
There came to the making of man,
Time, with a gift of tears;
Grief, with a glass that ran;
Pleasure, with pain for leaven;
Summer, with flowers that fell;
Remembrance fallen from Heaven,
And madness risen from hell;
Strength without hands to smite;
Love that endures for a breath;
Night, the shadow of light,
And liſe, the shadow of death.
And the high gods took in hand
Fire, and the falling of tears,
And a measure of sliding sand
From under the feet of the years;
And froth and driſt of the sea;
And dust of the laboring earth;
And bodies of things to be
In the houses of death and of birth;
And wrought with weeping and laughter,
And fashioned with loathing and love,
With life before and after,
And death beneath and abore,
For a day and a night and a morrow,
That his strength might endure for a spau
With travail and heavy sorrow,
The holy spirit of man.
From the winds of the north and the south
They gathered as unto strife;
They breathed upon his mouth,
They filled his body with life;
Eyesight and speech they wrought
For the veils of the soul therein.

A time for labor and thought,
A time to serve and to sin;
They gave him light in his ways,
And love and a space for delight,
And beauty and length of days,
And night, and sleep in the night.
His speech is a burning fire;
With his lips he travaileth;
In his heart is a blind desire,
In his eyes foreknowledge of death;
He weaves, and is clothed with derision;
Sows, and he shall not reap;
His life is a watch or a vision
Between a sleep and a sleep.
Algernon Chas. Swinburn
Darius Green and his Flying Machine.
If ever there lived a Yankee lad,
Wise or otherwise, good or bad,
Who, seeing the birds fly, did n't jump
With flapping arms from stake or stump,
Or spreading the tail
Of his coat for a sail,
Take a soaring leap from post or rail,
And wonder why
He could n't fly,
And flap and flutter and wish and try, -
If ever you knew a country dunce
Who did n't try that as often as once,
All I can say is, that's a sign
He never would do for a hero of mine.
An aspiring genius was D. Green:
The son of a farmer, — age fourteen;
His body was long and lank and lean,
Just right for flying, as will be seen;

He had two eyes as bright as a bean,
And a freckled nose that grew between,
A little awry, — for I must mention
That he had riveted his attention
Upon his wonderful invention,
Twisting his tongue as be twisted the strings,
And working his face as he worked the wings,
And with every turn of gimlet and screw
Turning and screwing his mouth round too,
Till his nose seemed bent
To catch the scent,
Around some corner, of new-baked pies,
And his wrinkled cheeks and squinting eyes
Grew puckered into a queer grimace,
That made him look very droll in the face,
And also very wise.
And wise he must have been, to do more
Than ever a genius did before,
Excepting Dædalus of yore,
And his son Icarus, who wore
Upon their backs
Those wings of wax
He had read of in the the old almanacka
Darius was clearly of the opinion,
That the air is also man's dominion,
And that, with paddle, or fin or pinion,
We soon or late
Shall navigate
The azure as now we sail the sea.
The thing looks simple enough to mo;
And if you doubt it,
Hear how Darius reasoned about it.
“The birds can ily,
An' why can't I?
Must we give in,"

“That the bluebird an' phoebe
Are smarter 'n we be ?

An' blackbird an' catbird beat us holler ?

No bigger 'n my thumb, know more than men 1
Jest show me that?

He argued further: "Nor I can't see

Fur to git a livin' with, more 'n to me; -

And he said to himself, as he tinkered and plarned:
“But I ain't goin' to show my hand
To nummies that never can understand
The fust idee that's big an' grand.”
So he kept his secret from all the rest,
Safely buttoned within his vest;
And in the loft above the shed
Himself he locks, with thimble and thread,
And wax and hammer and buckles and screws,
And all such things as geniuses use; -
Two bats for patterns, curious fellows!

Some wire, and several old umbrellas;
A carriage-cover for tail and wings;
A piece of a harness; and straps and strings;
And a big strong box,
In which he locks
These and a hundred other things.
His grinning brothers, Reuben and Burke
And Nathan and Jotham and Solomon, lurk
Around the corner to see him work, –
Sitting cross-legged, like a Turk,
Drawing the waxed-end through with a jerk,
And boring the holes with a comical quirk
Of his wise old head, and a knowing smirk.
But vainly they mounted each other's backs,
And poked through knot-boles and pried through cracks,
With wood from the pile and straw from the stacks
He plugged the knot-holes and calked the cracks;
And a dipper of water, which one would think
He had brought up into the loft to drink
When he chanced to be dry,
Stood always nigh,
For Darius was sly!
And whenever at work he happened to spy
At chink or crevice a blinking eye,
He let the dipper of water iy.
So day after day
He stitched and tinkered and hammered away,
Till at last 't was done, -
The greatest invention under the sun!
An' now," says Darius,“ hooray fur some fun !"

And the weather was dry,
And not a cloud was on all the sky,
Save a few light Heeces, which here and there,

Just as lovely a morning as ever was seen
For a nice little trip in a flying-machine.
Thought cunning Darius: “Now I sha'n't go

I'll say I've got sich a terrible cough!
An' then, when the folks 'ave all gone off,
I'll have full swing

“Ain't goin' to see the celebration ?".
Says brother Nate. “No; botheration!

My gracious! - feel's though I should ay !"
Said Jctham, "'Sho!

But Darius said, “No!
Should n't wonder 'f you might see me, though,
'Long 'bout noon, ef I get red
O’ this jumpin', thumpin' pain 'n my head.”
For all the while to himself he said :-
“I tell ye what!

To see how't seems, tnen soon 's I've got
The hang o' the thing, ez likely 's not,
I'll astonish the nation,
An' all creation,
By flyin' over the celebration!
Over their heads I'll sail like an eagle;

He crept from his bed;
And seeing the others were gone, he said,

And away he sped,
To open the wonderful box in the shed.
His brothers had walked but a little way,
When Jotham to Nathan chanced to say,
" What is the ſeller up to, hey?".
“Don'o', - the's suthin' ur other to pay,

Then Sol, the little one, spoke :
“Le's hurry back an' hide ’n the barn,

“Agreed !" Through the crchard they creep back,
Along by the fences, behind the stack,
And one by orie, through a hole in the wall,
In under the dusty barn they crawl,
Dressed in their Sunday garments all;
And a very astonishing sight was that,
When each in his cobwebbed coat and hat
Came up through the floor like an ancient rat.
And there they hid;
And Reuben slid
The fastenings back, and the door undid.

“While I squint an' see what the' is to see."

As knights of old put on their mail,—
From head to foot
An iron suit,
Iron jacket and iron boot,
Iron breeches, and on the head
No hat, but an iron pot instead,
And under the chin the bail,
(I believe they called the thing a helm,)
Then sallied forth to overwhelm
The dragons and pagans that plagued the realm,-
So this modern knight,
Prepared for flight,
Put on his wings and strapped them tighty-
Jointed and jaunty, strong and light-
Buckled them fast to shoulder and hip,-
Ten feet they measured from tip to tip!
And a helm had he, but that he wore,
Not on his head, like those of yore,
But more like the helm of a ship.

As a demon is hurled by an angel's spear
Heels over head, to his proper sphere, -
Heels over head, and head over heels,
Dizzily down the abyss he wheels,
So fell Darius. Upon his crown,
In the midst of the barn-yard, he came down,
In a wonderful whirl of tangled strings,
Broken braces and broken springs,
Broken tail and broken wings,
Shooting-stars, and various things,
Barn-yard litter of straw and chaff,
And much that was n't so nice by half.
Away with a bellow fled the calf,
And what was that? Did the gosling laugh ?
'Tis a merry roar
From the old barn-door,
And be hears the voice of Jotham crying,
“Say, D’rius! how do you like flyin' P"
Slowly, ruefully, where he lay,
Darius just turned and looked that way,
As he stanched his sorrowful nose with his cut.

MORAL,

And this is the moral, — Stick to your sphere.

No Sect in Heaven.
Talking of sects till late one eve,
Of the various doctrines the saints believe,
That night I stood in a troubled dream,
By the side of a darkly-flowing stream.
And a “Churchman” down to the river came,
When I heard a strange voice call his name,
“Good father, stop; when you cross this tide,
You must leave your robes on the other side.”
But the aged father did not mind,
And his long gown floated out behind,
As down to the stream his way he took,
His pale hands clasping a gilt-edged book.
“I'm bound for Heaven, and when I'm there.
I shall want my book of Common Prayer;
And though I put on a starry crown,
I should feel quite lost without my gown.” .
Then he fixed his eyes on the shining track,
But his gown was heavy, and held him back;
And the poor old father tried in vain,
A single step in the flood to gain.
I saw him again on the other side,
But his silk gown floated on the tide ;
And no one asked in that blissful spot,
Whether he belonged to “ the Church " or not.

When down to the river a Quaker strayed,
His dress of a sober hue was made;
"My coat and hat must be all gray,
I cannot go any other way.”
Then he buttoned his coat straight up to his chin,
And staidly, solemnly, waded in,
And his brcad-brimmed hat he pulled down tight
Over his forehead, so cold and white.
But a strong wind carried away his hat;
A moment he silently sighed over that,
And then, as he gazed on the farther shore,
The coat, slipped off, and was seen no more.
As he entered Heaven, his suit of gray
Went quietly sailing away, away,
And none of the angels questioned him
About the width of his beaver's brim.
Next came Dr. Watts with a bundle of Psalms,
Tied nicely up in his aged arms,
And hymns as many, a very wise thing,
That the people in Heaven, “ all round,” might sing.
But I thought that he heaved an anxious sigh,
As he saw that the river ran broad and bigh,
And looked rather surprised as, one by one
The Psalms and Hymns in the wave went down.
And after him with his MSS.,
Came Wesley, the pattern of godliness;
But he cried, “Dear me, what shall I do?
The water has soaked them through and through'
And there on the river, far and wide,
Away they went down the swollen tide,
And the saint astonished passed through alone,
Without his manuscripts up to the throne.

Then gravely walking, two saints by name,
Down to the stream together came;
But as they stopped at the river's brink,
I saw one saint from the other shrink.
· Sprinkled or plunged, may I ask you, friend,
How you attained to life's great end ?”
“ Thus, with a few drops on my brow,"
“But I have been dipped, as you'll see me now
“ And I really think it will hardly do,
As I'm close communion,' to cross with you;
You're bound, I know, to the realms of bliss,
But you must go that way, and I'll go this."
Then straightway plunging with all his might,
Away to the left — his friend at the right,
Apart they went from this world of sin,
But at last together they entered in.
And, now, when the river is rolling on,
A Presbyterian Church went down;
Of women there seemed an innumerable throng,
But the men I could count as they passed along
And concerning the road, they could never agree,
The old or the new way, which it could be,
Nor even a moment paused to think
That both would lead to the river's brink.
And a sound of murinuring long and loud
Came ever up from the moving crowd,
“ You're in the old way, and I'm in the new
That is the false, and this is the true;"
Or, “I'm in the old way, and you're in the new,
That is the false, and this is the true.”
But the brethren only seemed to speak,
Modest the sisters walked, and meek,

What troubles she met with on the way,
How she longed to pass to the other side,
Nor feared to cross over the swelling tide,
A voice arose from the brethren then:
“Let no one speak but the "holy men;'
For have ye not heard the words of Paul
O let the women keep silence all ?'"
I watched them long in my curious dream,
Till they stood by the borders of the stream,
Then, just as I thought, the two ways mety
But all the brethren were talking yet,
And would talk on, till the heaving tide
Carried them over side by side;
Side by side, for the way was one,
The toilsome journey of life was done,
And all who in Christ the Saviour died
Come out alike on the other side;
No forins, or crosses, or books had they,
No gowns of silk, or suits of gray,
No creeds to guide them, or MSS.,
For all had put on Christ's righteousness.

Poetry
I consider Poetry in a twofold view, as a spirit and a manifestat un. Perhaps
the poetic spirit has never been more justly defined, than by Byron in his
Prophecy or Dante, - a crcation
“From overfeeling good or ill, an aim
At an external life beyond our fate."
This spirit may be manifested by language, metrical or prose, ly declamation,
by musical sounds, by expression, by gesture, by motion, and by i nitating forms,
colors and shades; so that literature, oratory, music, physiognomy, acting, and
the arts of painting and sculpture may all have their poetry; but that peculiar
spirit, which alone gives the great life and charm to all the efforts of genius,
is as distinct from the mcasure and rhyme of poetical composition, as from the
scientific priuciples of drawing and perspective.
The world is full of poetry; - the air
Is living with its spirit; and the waves
Dance to the music of its melodies,
And sparkle in its brightness. Earth is veiled
And mantled with its beauty; and the walls
That close the universe with crystal in,

Are eloquent with voices, that proclaim
The unseen glories of immensity,
In harmonies, too perfect, and too high,
For aught but beings of celestial mould,
And speak to man in one eternal hymn,
Unfading beauty, and unyielding power.
The year leads round the seasons, in a choir
For ever charming, and for ever new,
Blending the grand, the beautiful, the gay,
The mournful, and the tender, in one strain,
Which steals into the heart, like sounds that riso
Far off, in moonlight evenings, on the shore
Of the wide ocean resting after storms;
Or tones that wind around the vaulted roof,
And pointed arches, and retiring aisles
Of some old, lonely minster, where the hand,
Skillful, and moved with passionate love of art,
Plays o'er the higher keys, and bears aloft
The peals of bursting thunder, and then calls,
By mellow toucnes, from the softer tubes,
Voices of melting tenderness, that blend
With pure and gentle musings, till the soul,
Commingling with the melody, is borne,
Rapt, and dissolved in ecstasy, to Heaven.
'T is not the chime and flow of words, that move
In measured file, and metrical array;
T is not the union of returning sounds,
Nor all the pleasing artifice of rhyme,
And quantity, and accent, that can give
This all-pervading spirit to the ear,
Or blend it with the movings of the soul.
'T is a mysterious feeling, which combines
Man with the world around him, in a chain
Woven of flowers, and dipped in sweetness, till

With all existences, in earth and Heaven,

'T' is not the noisy babbler, who displays,
In studied phrase, and ornate epithet,
And rounded period, poor and vapid thoughts,
Which peep from out the cumbrous ornaments
That overload their littleness. Its words
Are few, but deep and solemn; and they break
Fresh from the fount of feeling, and are full
Of all that passion, which, on Carmel, fired
The holy prophet, when his lips were coals,
His language winged with terror, as when bolts
Leap from the brooding tempest, armed with wrath,
Commissioned to affright us and destroy.
Well I remember, in my boyish days,
How deep the feeling when my eye looked forth
On Nature, in her loveliness, and storms.
How my heart gladdened, as the light of spring
Came from the sun, with zephyrs, and with showers,
Waking the earth to beauty, and the woods
To music, and the atmosphere to blow,
Sweetly and calmly, with its breath of balm.
O, how I gazed upon the dazzling blue
Of summer's Heaven of glory, and the waves,
That rolled, in kending gold, o'er hill and plain;
And on the tempest, when it issued forth,
In folds of blackness, from the northern sky,
And stocd above the mountains, silent, dark,
Frowning, and terrible; then sent abroad
The lightning, as its herald, and the peal,
That rolled in deep, deep volleys, round the hills,
The warning of its coming, and the sound
That ushered in its elementa! war!
And, oh! I stood, in breathless longing fixed,
Trembling, and yet not fearful, as the clouds
Heaved their dark billows on the roaring winds,
That sent, from mountain top, and bending wood,
A long hoarse murmer, like the rush of waves,
That burst, in foam and fury, on the shore.

Nor less the swelling of my heart, when high
Rose the blue arch of antumn, cloudless, pure
As Nature, at her dawning, when she sprang
Fresh from the hand that wrought her; where the oyo
Caught not a speck upon the soft serene,
To stain its deep cerulean, but the cloud,
That floated, like a lonely spirit, there,
White as the snow of Zemla, or the foam
That on the mid-sea tosses, cinctured round,
In easy undulations, with a belt,
Woven of bright Apollo's golden hair.
Nor, when that arch, in winter's clearest night,
Mantled in ebon darkness, strewed with stars
Its canopy, that seemed to swell, and swelt
The higher, as I gazed upon it, till,
Sphere after sphere, evolving, on the height
Of heaven, the everlasting throne shone through,
In glory's full effulgence, and a wave,
Intensely bright, rolled, like a fountain, forth
Beneath its sapphire pedestal, and streamed
Down the long galaxy, a flood of snow,
Bathing the heavens in light, the spring that gushed,
In overflowing richness, from the breast
Of all-maternal nature. These I saw,
And felt to madness; but my full heart gave
No utterance to the ineffable within.
Words were too weak; they were unknown, but still
The feeling was most poignant: it has gone,
And all the deepest flow of sounds, that e'er
Poured, in a torrent fullness, from the tongue
Rich with the wealth of ancient bards, and stored
With all the patriarchs of British song
Hallowed and rendered glorious, cannot tell
Thúse feelings, which have died, to live no more.

l[cre we stop for the night. You are shown into a room that
has not been opened since its occupant left it, and is unsavory and
untidy to the last degree. An appeal to the gentlemanly clerk
secures a change for the better; but there is a hole by the fireplace
in Number Two that looks suspicious. You cross-examine the
porter, who assures you that it has no significance whatever. A
inouse in that room is an event of which history gives no record
Nevertheless, you take the precaution to stuff the hole with an ol
New York Herald, and are awakened at midnight by the dreadful
rustling of paper. A dreadful gnawing succeeds the dreadful rust-
ling, and away goes a boot in the direction of the sound. There is
a pause broken only by heart throbs! Then another gnawing, fol-
lowed by a boot till the supply is exhausted. Then you begin on
the pillows. A longer pause gives rise to the hope that order is
about to reign in Warsaw, and you are just falling asleep again,
when a smart scratching close to your ear, shoots you to the other
side of the room with the conviction that the mouse is running up
the folds of the curtain at the head of your bed. In a frenzy you
ring violently, and ask through the door for a chambermaid.
“Can't have no chambermaid this time o' night," drawls the
porter slcepily.
“Then send up a mouse-trap."
" Aint no mouse-trap in the house."
“Then bring a cat !”.
“Dunno nothin' about it," and he scuffs his slippered feet down
the long gallery, growling audibly, poor fellow, half suspecting
evidently that he is the victim of a joke; but alas! it is no joke.
You mount sentry on the foot of the bed, facing the enemy. He
emerges from the curtain, runs up and down the slats of the blind
in innocent glee, flaunts across the window-seat, flashing every now
and then into obscurity; and this is the worst of all. When you
see him he is in one place, but when you do not see him he is every-
where. You hold fast your umbrella, and from time to time make
vigorous raps on the floor to keep him out of your immediate
vicinity, and so the night wears wearily away. Your refreshing
sleep turns into a campaign against a mouse, for which agreeable
entertainment you pay in the morning three dollars and a half; and

the gentlemanly clerk, with a pitying smile, informs you, 'O, we
cannot help that! There are mice all over the house!”
Moral reflection: If ever the education of a soaring human boy
be intrusted to my care, I will endeavor to model his manners on
those of a clerk in a hotel. For conscious superiority, tempered
with benevolence and swathed in suavity; for perfect self-posses-
sion; for high-bred condescension to the ignorance and toleration
of the weakness of others; for absolute equality to circumstances,
nd a certain grace, assurance, and flourish of bearing, - give me a
clerk in a hotel. We may see generals, poets and philosophers,
indistinguishable from the common herd; but a true hotel clerk
wears on his beauteous brow, and in his noble nien, the indubitable
sign of greatness.
From Albany to Niagara is a pleasant day's journey, and the
Niagara mice are not quite so large, nor quite so lively, as those of
Eastern New York. They do not appear till the second day.
Then, resting quietly after a walk, you see a mouse creep timidly
from under the bureau. You improvise a sort of pontoon bridge to
the bell, out of your chairs and tables, and, as it is day-time, secure
a chambermaid and superintend a mouse hunt. She whisks about
the room enthusiastically, peers under all the furniture, assuring you
the while that it is four years now she has been in the house and
never saw a mouse in the chambers, though she confesses to having
seen them in the kitchen, and, being hard pressed, well, she has
seen them in the passages; but in the chambers, no! never! and
you are led to believe that, though a mouse might stand shivering
on the brink of your room, he would fear to step foot over the
threshold. No, there is no mouse here, not a sign of a mouse.
“No sign of a mouse, except the mouse itself," you suggest.
“Ah! but you must have been mistaken. It was a shadow.
Why" (with a grand flourish of the valance with her right hand,
and in the air with her left), "you can see for yourself there is no
mouse here," -- and she thinks she has made her point.
You look at her, debating within yourself whether it is worth
while to attempt to acquaint her with the true province of nega-
tives, the proper disposition of the burden of proof, and the sophis-
try of an undue assuinption of the major premise, and decide that it
is not.

A Legend of Bregenz
Girt round with rugged mountains,
The fair Lake Constance lies;
In her blue heart reflected
Shine back the starry skies;
And, watching each white cloudlet
Float silently and slow,
You think a piece of Heaven
Lies on our earth below!
Midnight is there: and Silence,
Enthroned in Heaven, looks down
Upon her own calm mirror,
Upon a sleeping town:
For Bregenz, that quaint city
Upon the Tyrol shore,
Has stood above Lake Constance
A thousand years and more.
Her battlements and towers,
From off their rocky steep,
Have cast their trembling shadow
For ages on the deep:
Mountain, and lake, and valley,
A sacred legend know,
Of how the town was saved, one night,
Three hundred years ago.
Far from her home and kindred,
A Tyrol maid had fled,
To serre in the Swiss valleys,
And toil for daily bread;
And every year that fleeted
So silently and fast,
Seemed to bear farther from her
The memory of the Past.

She served kind, gentle masters,
Nor asked for rest or change;
Her friends seemed no more new ones,
Their speech seemed no more strange;
And when she led her cattle
To pasture every day,
She ceased to look and wonder
On which side Bregenz lay.
She spoke no more of Bregenz,
With longing and with tears;
Her Tyrol home seemeil faded
In a deep mist of years;
She heeded not the rumors
Of Austrian war and strife;
Each day she rose contented,
To the calın toils of life.
Yet, when her master's children
Would clustering round her stand,
She sang them ancient ballads
Of her own native land;
And when at morn and evening
She knelt before God's throne,
The accents of her childhood
Rose to her lips alone.
And so she dwelt: the valley
More peaceful year by year;
When suddenly strange portents
Of some great deed seemed near.
The golden corn was bending
Upon its fragile stalk,
While farmers, heedless of their fields,
Paced up and down in talk.
The men seemed stern and altered,
With looks cast on the ground;
With anxious faces, one by one,
The women gathered round;

All talk of flax, or spinning,
Or work, was put away;
The very children seemed afraid
To go alone to play.
One day, out in the meadow
With strangers from the town,
Some secret plan discussing,
The men walked up and down.
Yet now and then seemed watchic 6
A strange uncertain gleam,
That looked like lances 'mid the treos
That stood below the stream.
At eve they all assembled,
Then care and doubt were fled:
With jovial laugh they feasted;
The board was nobly spread.
The elder of the village
Rose up, his glass in hand,
And cried, “We drink the downfall
Of an accursed land !
“The night is growing darker,
Ere one more day is flown,
Bregenz, our foemens' stronghold,
Bregenz shall be our own!"
The women shrank in terror
(Yet Pride, too, had her part),
But one poor Tyrol maiden
Felt death within her heart.
Before her stood fair Bregenz;
Once more her towers arose;
What were the friends beside her ?
Only her country's foes !
The faces of her kinsfolk,
The days of childhood flown,
The echoes of her mountains,
Reclaimed her as their own.

Nothing she heard around her
(Though shouts rang forth again),
Gone were the green Swiss valleys,
The pasture, and the plain;
Before her eyes one vision,
And in her heart one cry,
That said, “Go forth, save Bregenz,
And then, if need be, die!"
With trembling haste and breathless,
With noiseless step, she sped;
Horses and weary cattle
Were standing in the shed;
She loosed the strong, white charger,
That fed from out her hand,
She mounted, and she turned his head
Toward her native land.
Out-out into the darkness
Faster, and still more fast;
The smooth grass flies behind her,
The chestnut wood is past;
She looks up; clouds are heavy;
Why is her steed so slow? —
Scarcely the wind beside them
Can pass them as they go.
" Faster!” she cries, “O faster! ”
Eleven the church-bells chime:
"O God," she cries, “help Bregens,
And bring me there in timel"
But louder than bells' ringing,
Or lowing of the kine,
Grows nearer in the midnight
The rushing of the Rhine.
Shall not the roaring waters
Their headlong gallop check ?
The steed draws back in terror,-

To watch the flowing darkness;
The bank is high and steep;
One pause - he staggers forward,
And plunges in the deep.
She strives to pierce the blackness,
And looser throws the rein;
Her steed must breast the waters
That dash above his mane.
How gallantly, how nobly,
He struggles through the foam,
And see in the far distance
Shine out the lights of home!
Up the steep bank he bears !:er,
And now, they rush again
Towards the heights of Bregenz,
That tower above the plain.
They reach the gate of Bregenz
Just as the midnight rings,
And out come serf and soldier
To meet the news she brings.
Bregenz is saved! Ere daylight
Her battlements are manned;
Defiance greets the army
That marches on the land.
And if to deeds heroic
Should endless fame be paid,
Bregenz does well to honor
The noble Tyrol maid.
Three hundred years are vanished,
And yet upon the hill
An old stone gateway rises,
To do her honor still.
And there, when Bregenz women
Sit spinning in the shade,
They see in quaint old carving
The Charger and the Maid.

By gateway, street and tower,

When midnight pauses in the skies,
He calls the maiden's name!

The Grandmother's Apology.
And Willy, my eldest born, is gone, you say, little Annie?
Ruddy and white, and strong on his legs, he looks like a man.
And Willy's wife has written: she never was overwise,
Never the wife for Willy : he wouldn't take my advice.
For, Annie, you see, her father was not the man to save;
Hadn't a head to manage, and drank himself into his grave.
Pretty enough, very pretty! but I was against it for one.
Ehl--but he wouldn't hear me - and Willy, you say, is gone.
Why do you look at me, Annie? you think I am hard and cold;
But all my children have gone before me, I am so old:
I cannot weep for Willy, nor can I weep for the rest;
Only at your age, Annie, I could have wept with the best.
For I remember a quarrel I had with your father, my dear,
All for a slanderous story, that cost me many a tear.
I mean your grandfather, Annie: it cost me a world of woe,
Seventy years ago, my darling, seventy years ago.
Willy had not been down to the farm for a week and a day;
And all things look'd half-dead, tho' it was the middle of May.
Jenny, to slander me, who knew what Jenny had been!
But soiling another, Annie, will never make oneself clean.
And I cried myself well-nigh blind, and all of an evening late
climb’d to the top of the garth, and stood by the road at the gate
The moon like a rick on fire was rising over the dale,
And whit, whit, whit, in the bush beside me, chirrupt the night-
ingale.

All of a sudden he stopt: there past by the gate of the farm,
Willy, — he didn't see me, - and Jenny hung on his arm.
Out into the road I started, and spoke I scarce knew how;
Ah, there's no fool like the old one - it makes me angry now.
Willy stood up like a man, and look'd the thing that he meant;
Jenny, the viper, made me a mocking courtesy and went.
And I said, “Let us part: in a hundred years it'll all be the same,
You cannot love me at all, if you love not my good name."
and he turn'd, and I saw his eyes all wet, in the sweet moonshine:
“Sweetheart, I love you so well inat your good name is mine.
And what do I care for Jane, let her speak of you well or ill;
But marry me out of hand: we two shall be happy still.”
'Marry you, Willy!” said I, “but I needs must speak my mind,
I fear you will listen to tales, be jealous and hard and unkind.”
But he turn'd and claspt me in his arms, and answer'd, “No,
love, no; "
Seventy years ago, my darling, seventy years ago.
So Willy and I were wedded: I wore a lilac gown;
And the ringers rang with a will, and he gave the ringers a crown.
Never jealous - not he: we had many a happy year;
And he died, and I could not weep - my own time seem'd so near.
But I wish'd it had been God's will that I, too, then could have
died:
I began to be tired a little, and fain had slept at his side.
And that was ten years back, or more, if I don't forget:
But as to the children, Annie, they're all about me yet.
Pattering over the boards, my Annie who left me at two,
Patter she goes, my own little Annie, an Annie like you:
Pattering over the boards, she comes and goes at her will,
While Harry is in the five-acre and Charlie ploughing the hill,
And Harry and Charlie, I hear them too — they sing to their team;
Often they come to the door in a pleasant kind of a dream;
They come and sit by my chair, they hover about my bed –
· I am not always certain if they be alive or dead.

And yet I know for a truth, there's none of them left alive;
For Harry went at sixty, your father at sixty-five,
And Willy, my eldest born, at nigh threescore and ten;
I knew them all as babies, and now they're elderly men.
So Willy has gone, my beauty, my eldest-born, my flower;
But how can I weep for Willy, he has but gone for an hour, -
Gone for a minute, my son, from this room into the next;
( too, shall go in a minute. What time have I to be vext?
And Willy's wife has written, she never was overwise.
Get me my glasses, Annie: thank God that I keep my eyes,
There is but a trifle left you, when I shall have past away.
But stay with the old woman now: you cannot have long to stay.

The shadow of an arrant naught;
A flower that blossoms for a day,
Dying next morrow;
A stream that hurries on its way,
Singing of sorrow;
The last drop of a bootless shower,
Shed on a sere and leafless bower;
A rose, stuck in a dead man's breast -
This is the World's fame at the best!
What is Fame? and wbat is Glory?
A dream,— a jester's lying story,
To tickle fools withal, or be
A theme for second infancy;
A joke scrawled on an epitaph;
A grin at Death's own ghastly laugh;
A visioning that tempts the eye,
But mocks the touch - nonentity;

Where shaggy forms o'er ice-built mountains roam,

To cheer the shivering native's dull abode.

She deigns to hear the savage youth repeat,
In loose numbers wildly sweet,
Their leather-cinctured chiefs, and dusky loves.

Th' unconquerable Mind, and freedom's holy flamo.

Murmur'd deep a solemn sound:

Gilliatt ascended to the summit of the Great Douvre.
From hence he could see around the horizon.
The western side was appalling. A wall of cloud spread across
it, barring the wide expanse from side to side, and ascending
slowly from the horizon towards the zenith. This wall, straight-
lined, vertical, without a crevice in its height, without a rent
in its structure, seemed built by the square, and measured by
the plumb-line. It was cloud in the likeness of granite. Its
escarpment, completely perpendicular at the southern extremity,
curved a little towards the north, like a bent sheet of iron, pre-
senting the stoep, slippery face of an inclined plane. The dark
wall enlarged and grew; but its entablature never ceased for
a moment to be parallel with the horizon line, which was almost
indistinguishable in the gathering darkness. Silently, and alto-
gether, the airy battlements ascended. No undulation, no wrinkle,
no projection changed its shape or moved its place. The aspect of
this immobility in movement was impressive. The sun, pale in the
midst of a strange, sickly transparence, lighted up this outline of
the Apocalypse. Already the cloudy bank had blotted out once
half the space of the sky, shelving like the fearful tatus of the
abyss. It was the uprising of a dark mountain between eartlı and
heaven.
It was night falling suddenly upon midday.
There was a heat in the air as from an ovendoor, coming from
that mysterious mass on mass. The sky, which from blue nad be-

come white, was now turning from white to a slaty gray. The sca
beneath, leaden-hued and dull. No breath, no wave, no noise.
Far as eye could reach, the desert ocean. No sail was visible on
any side. The birds had disappeared. Some monstrous treason
seemed abroad.
The wall of cloud grew visibly larger.
This moving mountain of vapors, which was approaching the
Douvres, was one of those which might be called the clouds of
battle Sinister appearances; some strange, furtive glance seemed
cast upon the beholder through that obscure mass up-pilei.
Ti:e approach was terrible.
Gilliatt observed it closely, and muttered to himself, “I am
thristy enough, but you will give me plenty to drink.”
He stood there motionless a few moments, his eye fixed upon
the cloud-bank, as if mentally taking a sounding of the tempest.
His galérienne was in the pocket of his jacket; he took it out
and placed it on his head. Then he fetched from the cave, which
had so long served him for a sleeping-place, a few things which be
had kept there in reserve; he put on his overalls, and attired him-
self in his water-proof overcoat, like a knight who puts on his
armour at the moment of battle. He had no shoes, but his naked
feet had become hardened to the rocks.
This preparation for the storm being completed, he looked down
upon his breakwater, grasped the knotted cord hurriedly, descended
from the plateau of the Douvre, stepped on to the rocks below,
and hastened to his store cavern. A few moments later he was at
work. The vast silent cloud might have heard the strokes of his
hammer. With the nails, ropes, and beams which still remained,
he constructed for the eastern gullet a second frame, which he suc-
ceeded in fixing at ten or twelve feet from the other.
The silence was still profound. The blades of grass between the
cracks of the cocks were not stirred.
The sun disappeared suddenly. Gilliatt looked up.
The rising cloud had just reached it. It was like the blotting
out of day, succeeded by a mingled pale reflection.
The immense wall of cloud had changed its appearance. It no
longer retained its unity. It had curved on reaching the zenith,
whence it spread horizontally over the rest of the heavens. It

had now its various stages. The tempest formation was visible,
like the strata in the side of a trench. It was possible to distin-
guish the layers of the rain from the beds of hail. There was no
lightning, but a horrible, diffused glare; for the idea of horror may
be attached to light. The vague breathing of the storm was audi-
ble; the silence was broken by an obscure palpitation. Gilliatt,
silent, also, watched the giant blocks of vapor grouping them-
selves overhead, forming the shapeless mass of clouds. Upon th:9
horizon brooded and lengthened out a band of mist of ashen hue;
in the zenith, another band of lead color. Pale, raggcu fragments
of cloud hung from the great mass above upon the mist below. The
pile of cloud which formed the background was wan, vlull, gloomy.
A thin, whitish, transverse cloud, coming no one could tell whither,
cut the liigh dark wall obliquely from north to south. One of the
extremities of this cloud trailed along the surface of the sea. At
the point where it touched the waters a dense red vapor was
visible in the midst of the darkness. Below it, smaller clouds,
quite black and very low, were flying as if bewildered or moved
by opposite currents of air. The immense cloud behind increased
from all points at once, darkened the eclipse, and continued to
spread its somber pall. In the east, behind Gilliatt, there was only
one clear porch in the heavens, which was rapidly being closed.
Without any feeling of wind abroad, a strange Right of gray downy
particles seemed to pass; they were fine, and scattered as if some
gigantic bird had been plucked of its plumage behind the bank of
cloud. A dark, compact roof had gradually formed itself, which
on the verge of the horizon touched the sea, and mingled in dark-
ness with it. The beholder had a vague sense of somethico
adrancing steadily towards him. It was vast, heavy, o:ninous.
Suddenly an immense peal of thunder burst upon the air.
Gilliatt himself felt the shock. The rude reality in the midst of
that visionary region has something in it terrific. The listene: fan-
cies that he hears something falling in the chamber of giants. No
electric flash accompanied the report. It was a blind peal. The
silence was profound again. There was an interval, as when com-
batants take up their position. Then appeared slowly, one after
the other, great shapeless flashes; these flashes were silent. The
wall of cloud was now a vast cavern, with roofs and arches. Out-

lines of forms were traceable aniong them; monstrous heads were
raguely shadowed forth; rocks seemed to stretch out; elephants
bearing turrets, seen for a moment, vanished. A column of rapor,
straight, round, and dark, and surmounted by a white mist, siinu-
lated the form of a colossal steam-vessel engulfed and hissing and
smoking beneath the waves. Sheets of cloud undulated like folds
of giant Nags. In the center, under a thick purple pall, a nucleus
of dense fog sunk motionless, inert, impenetrable by the electric
fires: a sort of hidcous fætus in the bosom of the tempest.
Suddenly Gilliatt felt a breath moving his liair. Two or three
large drops of rain fell heavily around him on the rock. Then
there was a second thunder-clap. The wind was rising.
The terror of darkness was at its highest point. The first peal of
thunder had shaken the sea; the second rent the wall of cloud from
top to base; a breach was visible; the pent-up deluge rushed to-
wards it; the rent became like a gulf filled with rain. The out-
pouring of the tempest had begun.
The moment was terrible.
Rain, wind, lightnings, thunder, waves swirling upwards to the
clouds, foam, hoarse noises, whistlings, mingled together, like mon-
sters suddenly unloosened.
For a solitary man, imprisoned with an overloaded bark between
two dangerous rocks in mid-ocean, no crisis could have been more
menacing. The danger of the tide, over which he had triumphed,
was nothing compared with the danger of the tempest.

Some hours passed.
The sun rose in an unclouded sky.
Its first ray shone upon a motionless form upon the Great
Douvre. It was Gilliatt.
He was still outstretched upon the rock.
Ile was naked, cold, and stiff, but he did not shiver. His closed
eyelids were wan. It would have been difficult for a beholder to
say whether the form before him was a corpse.
The sun seemed to look upon him.
If he were not dead, he was already so near death that tho
slight cold would have sufficed to extinguish life.

The wind began to breathe, warm and animating - the opening
breath of May.
Jeanwhile the sun ascended in the deep blue sky; its rays, less
horizontal, fushed the sky. Its light became warmth. It cn-
veloped the slumbering form.
Gilliatt moved not. If he breathed, it was only that feeble
respiration which could scarcely tarnish the surface of a mirror,
The sun continued its ascent, its rays striking less and less
obliquely upon the naked man. The gentle breeze, which had
been merely tepid, became hot.
The rigid and naked body remained still without movement, but
the skin seemed less livid.
The sun, approaching the zenith, shone almost perpendicularly
upon the plateau of the Douvres. A flood of light descended from
the hearens; the vast reflection from the glassy sea increased its
splendor: and the rock itself imbibed the rays and warmed the
sleeper.
A sigh raised his breast.
He lived.
The sun continued its gentle offices. The wind, which was
already the breath of summer and of noon, approached him like
loying lips that brcathed upon him softly.
Gilliatt mored.
The peaceful calm upon the sea was perfect. Its murmur was
like the droning of the nurse beside the sleeping infant. The rock
seemed cradled in the waves.
The sea-birds, who knew that form, fluttered above it; not with
their old, wild astonishment, but with a sort of fraternal tender-
ness. They uttered plaintive cries — they seemed to be calling to
him. A sea-mew, who no doubt knew him, was tame enough to
come near him. It began to caw as if speaking to him. The
sleeper seemed not to hear. The bird hopped upon his shoulder,
and pocked his lips softly.
Gilliatt opened his eyes.
The birds dispersed, chattering wildly.
Gilliatt arose, stretched himself like a roused lion, ran to the
edge of the platform, and looked down into the space between the
two Douvres.

The sloop was there, intact; the stoppage had held out; the sea
had probably disturbed it but little.
All was saved.
He was no longer weary. His powers had returned. His swoon
had ended in a deep sleep.
He descended and baled out the sloop, emptied the hold, raised
the leakage above the water-line, dressed himself, ate, drank some
water, and was joyful.
The gap in the side of his vessel, examined in broad daylight,
proved to require more labor than he had thought. It was a
serious fracture. The entire day was too long for its repair.
At daybreak on the morrow, after removing the barrier and re-
opening the entrance to the defile, dressed in the tattered clothing
which had served to stop the leak, having about him Clubin's girdle
and the seventy-five thousand francs, standing erect in the sloop,
now repaired, by the side of the machinery which he had rescued,
with a favorable breeze and a good sea, Gilliatt pushed off from the
Douvres.
He put the sloop's head for Guernsey.

had been there might have heard him singing in an undertone the

And most glorious wings;
She can neither strive nor labor:

Up the hill and down the valleys,

Else you sing in vain.
“Sing until the deaf ones listen --
Sing and win a name;
Sing till human hearts, awakened,
Yield you all you claim; -
Sing and make the worldlings wonder,
Angel, sing for Fame!
Prithee sing for Fame!”
Then she tried a simple measure,
Faint and quivering;
But her sweet voice failed and tremblea
Till, poor timid thing!
All the wise ones sneered and whispered,
And she would not sing,
No, she would not sing.
Then I said, “ We two are friendless,
Poor and unconsoled;
I am growing sad and hungry,
Weary, faint, and cold;
Since you will not sing for Glory,
Angel, sing for Gold,
Prithee sing for Gold I”.
So the throng stood still and listened
With expectant ears;
But the sweet-voiced singer faltered,
Full of doubts and fears,
And the soul-enchanting music
Failed in sobs and tears,-

“Fairer than a morning blossom,
Gentler than a dove,
Purer than the sky when Hesper
Bears his brow above,-
Since you crave not Gold nor Glory,
Angel, sing for Love, -
Prithee sing for Love!"
Then she sang, O most divinely!
With no pause or fear,-
Sang until the best and proudest
Lent an eager ear:
But the true soul of her music
Only one can hear,-
One alone can hear!

Dannecker.
“ I grow old," said he, looking from his work to the bust of the
late queen, which stood opposite. “I have carved the effigies of
three generations of poets, and as many of princes. Twenty years
ago I was at work on the tomb of the Duke of Oldenburg, and now
I am at work upon hers who gave me that order. All die away:
soon I shall be left alone. Of my early friends none remain but
Goethe. I shall die before him, and perhaps he will write my
epitaph.” He spoke with a smile, not foreseeing that he would be
the survivor.
Three years after, I again paid Dannecker a visit, but a change
had come over him; his feeble, trembling hand could no longer grasp
the mallet or guide the chisel; his eyes were dim; his fine benevo-
lent countenance wore a childish, vacant smile, now and then
cocosed by a gleam of awakened memory or thought — and yet be
secmed so perfectly happy! He walked backwards and forwards,
from his Christ to his bust of Schiller, with an unwearied self-com-
placency, in which there was something mournful, and yet delight-
fuil. While I sat looking at the magnificent head of Schiller, the
original of the multifarious casts and copies which are dispersed
through all Germany, he sat down beside me, and taking my hands

between his own, which trembled with age and nervous emotion,
he began to speak of his friend. "Nous etions amis des l'enfance;
aussi j'y ai travaille avec amour, avec douleur - on ne peut pas
plus faire.” He then went on _“When Schiller came to Louisberg,
he sent to tell me that he was very ill — that he should not lire very
long, and that he wished me to execute his bust. It was the first
wish of my heart. I went inmediately. When I entered the house,
I found a lady sitting on the canapé - it was Schiller's wife, and
I did not know her, but she knew me. She said, 'Ah! you are
Darinçcker 1 - Schiller expects you;' then she ran into the next
roum, where Schiller was lying down on a couch, and in a moment
after he came in, exclaiming as he entered, 'Where is he? where is
Dannecker !' That was the moment - the expression I caught-
you see it here - the head raised, the countenance full of inspira-
tion, and affection, and bright hope! I told him that to keep up
this expression he must have some of his best friends to converse
with him while I took the model, for I could not talk and work
too. O if I could but remember what glorious things then fell
from those lips! Sometimes I stopped in my work — I could not
go on — I could only listen.” And here the old man wept; then
suddenly changing his mood, he said — “But I must cut off that
long hair ; he never wore it so; it is not in the fashion, you know!”
I begged him for Heaven's sake not to touch it; he then, with a
sad smile, turned up the sleeve of his coat and showed me his wrist,
swelled with the continual use of his implements –"You see I can-
not/" And I could not help wishing, at the moment, that while
his mind was thus enſeebled, no transient return of physical strength
might enable him to put his wild threat in execution. What a
noble bequest to posterity is the effigy of a great man, when exe-
cuted in such a spirit as this of Schiller! I assure you I could not
look at it without feeling my heart "overflow in silent worship" of
moral and intellectual power, till the deification of great men in
old times appeared to me rather religion than idolatry. I have
been affected in the same manner by the busts of Goethe, Scott,
llomer, Milton, Howard, Newton; never by the painted portraits
of the same men however perfect in resenıblance and admirable in
execution.

The Vision of Sir Launfal.
And what is so rare as a day in June ?
Then, if ever, come perfect days;
Then Heaven tries the earth iſ it be in tune,
And over it softly her warm ear lays;
Whether we look, or whether we listen,
We hear life murmur, or see it glisten,
Every clod feels a stir of might,
An instinct within it that reaches and towers,
And, groping blindly above it for light,
Climbs to a soul in grass and flowers;
The flush of life may weil be seen
Thrilling back over hills and valleys;
The cowslip startles in meadows green; .
The buttercup catches the sun in its chalice,
And there's never a leaf nor a blade too mean
To be some happy creature's palace;
The little bird sits at his door in the sun,
Atilt like a blossom among the leaves,
And lets his illumined being o'errun
With the deluge of summer it receives,
His mate feels the eggs beneath her wings,
And the heart in her dumb breast flutters and sings;
He sings to the wide world, and she to her nest, -
In the nice ear of Nature which song is the best !
Joy comes, grief goes, we know not how;
Every thing is happy now,
Every thing is upward striving;
'Tis as easy now for the heart to be true
As for grass to be green or skies to be blue, -
'Tis the natural way of living:
What wonder if Sir Launfal now
Remembered the keeping of his vow.
“My golden spurs now bring to me,
And bring to me my richest mail,
For to-morrow I go over land and sea
In search of the Holy Grail ;

Shall never a bed for me be spread,
Nor shall a pillow be under my head,
Till I begin my vow to keep;
Here on the rushes will I sleep,
And perchance there may come a vision true
Ere day create the world anew.".
Slowly Sir Launfal's eyes grew dim,
Slumber fell like a cloud on him,
And into his soul the vision ſlew.
The crows flapped over by twos and threes,
In the pool drowsed the cattle up to their knees,
The little birds sang as if it were
The one day of summer in all the year,
And the very leaves seemed to sing on the trees;
The castle alone in the landscape lay
Like an outpost of winter, dull and gray;
'Twas the proudest hall in the North Countree,
And never its gates might opened be,
Save to lord or lady of high degree;
Summer besieged it on every side,
But the churlish stone her assaults defied;
She could not scale the chilly wall,
Though round it for leagues her pavilions tall
Stretched left and right,
Over the hills and out of sight;
Green and broad was every tent,
And out of each a murmur went
Till the breeze fell off at night.
The drawbridge dropped with a surly clang,
And through the dark arch a charger sprang,
Bearing Sir Launfal, the maiden knight,
In his gilded mail, that flamed so bright
It seemed the dark castle had gathered all
Those shafts the fierce sun had shot over its wall
In his siege of three hundred summers long,
And, binding them all in one blazing sheaf,
Had cast them forth : so, young and strong,
And lightsome as a locust-leaf,
Sir Launfal flashed forth in his unscarred mail,
To seek in all climes for the Holy Grail.

As Sir Launfal made morn through the darksome gate,
He was 'ware of a leper, crouched by the same,
Who begged with his hand and moaned as he sate;
And a loathing over Sir Launfal came;
The sunshine went out of his soul with a thrill,
The flesh 'neath his armour 'gan shrink and crawl
And midway its leap his heart stood still
Like a frozen waterfall;
For this man, so foul and bert of stature,
Rasped harshly against his dainty nature,
And seemed the one blot on the summer morn, -
So he tossed him a piece of gold in scorn.
The leper raised not the gold from the dust:
“Better to me the poor man's crust,
Better the blessing of the poor,
Though I turn me empty from his door;
That is no true alms which the hand can hold;
He gives nothing but worthless gold
Who gives from a sense of duty;
But he who gives a slender mite,
And gives to that which is out of sight,
That thread of the all-sustaining Beauty
Which runs through all and doth all unite, -
The hand cannot clasp the whole of his alms,
The heart outstretches its eager palms,
For a god goes with it and makes it store
To the soul that was starving in darkness before."
Within the hall are song and laughter,
The cheeks of Christmas glow red and jolly,
And sprouting in every corbel and rafter
With lightsome green of ivy and holly.
But the wind without was eager and sharp,
Of Sir Launfal's gray hair it makes a harp,
And rattles and wrings
The icy strings,

Singing, in dreary monotone,
A Christmas carol of its own,
Whose burden still, as he might guess,
Was — "Shelterless, shelterless, shelterless! "
Sir Launfal turned from his own hard gate,
For another heir in his earldom sate;
An old, bent man, worn out and frail,
He came back from seeking the Holy Grail;
Little he wrecked of his earldom's loss,
No more on his surcoat was blazoned the cross,
But deep in his soul the sign he wore,
The badge of the suffering and the poor.
Sir Launfal's raiment thin and spare
Was idle mail 'gainst the barbed air,
For it was just at the Christmas time;
So he mused, as he sat, of a sunnier clime,
And sought for a shelter from cold and snow
In the light and warmth of long ago;
He sees the snake-like caravan crawl
O'er the edge of the desert, black and small,
Then nearer and nearer, till, one by one,
He can count the camels in the sun,
As over the red-hot sands they pass
To where, in its slender necklace of grass,
The little spring laughed and leapt in the shade,
And waved its signal of palms.
“For Christ's sweet sake, I beg an alms;”
The happy camels may reach the spring,
But Sir Launfal sees only the grewsome thing,
The leper, lank as the rain-blanched bone,
That cowers beside him, a thing as lone
And white as the ice-isles of Northern seas
In the desolate horror of his disease.
And Sir Launfal said, "I behold in thee
An image of him who died on the tree;
Thou also has had thy crown of thorns,
Thou also hast had the world's buffets and scorns,

And to thy life were not denied
The wounds in the hands and feet and side:
Mild Mary's Son, acknowledge me;
Behold, through him I give to thee!”
Then the soul of the leper stood up in his eyes
And looked at Sir Launfal, and straightway he
Remembered in what a haughtier guise
He had flung an alms to leprosie,
When he girt his young liſe up in gilded mail
And set forth in search of the Holy Grail.
The heart within him was ashes and dust;
He parted in twain his single crust,
He broke the ice on the streamlet's brink,
And gave the leper to eat and drink,
'Twas a moulily crust of coarse brown bread,
'Twas water out of a wooden bowl,—
Yet with fine wheaten bread was the leper fed,
And was red wine he drank with his thirsty soul.
As Sir Launfal mused with a downcast face,
A light shone round about the place;
The leper no longer crouched at his side,
But stood before him glorified,
Shining and tall and fair and straight
As the pillar that stood by the Beautiful Gate,-
Himself the Gate whereby men can
Enter the temple of God in Man.
His words were shed softer than leaves from the pine,
And they fell on Sir Launfal as snows on the brine,
Which mingle their softness and quiet in one
With the shaggy unrest they float down upon;
And the voice that was calmer than silence said,
“Lo it is I, be not afraid !
In many climes, without avail,
Thou hast spent thy life for the Holy Grail;
Behold it is here,- this cup which thou
Didst fill at the streamlet for me but now;
This crust is my body broken for thee,

This water his blood that died on the tree;
The Holy Supper is kept, indeed,
In whatso we share with another's need;
Not what we give, but what we share, —
For the gift without the giver is bare;
Who gives himself with his alms feeds threc,-
Himself, his hungering neighbor, and me.”
Sir Launfal awoke as from a swound:-
“The Grail in my castle here is found!
Hang my idle armor up on the wall,
Let it be the spider's banquet hall;
He must be fenced with stronger mail
Who would seek and find the Holy Grail.”
The castle gate stands open now,
And the wanderer is welcome to the hall
As the hangbird is to the elm-tree bough;
No longer scowl the turrets tall,
The Summer's long siege at last is o'er;
When the first poor outcast went in at the door
She entered with him in disguise,
And mastered the fortress by surprise;
There is no spot she loves so well on ground,
She lingers and smiles there the whole year round
The meanest serf on Sir Launfal's land
Has hall and bower at his command;
And there is no poor man in the North Countree
But is lord of the earldom as much as he.
NOTE. - According to the mythology of the Romancers, the San Grenl, or
Toly Grail, was the cup out of which Jesus partook of the last supper with lig
disciples. It was brought into England by Joseph of Arimathea, and remained
there, an object of pilgrimage and adoration, for many years in the keeping of
bis lineal descendants. It was incumbent upon those who had charge or it to
be chaste in thought, word, and deed; but one of the keepers having broken
this condition, the Holy Grail disappeared. From that time it was a favorite
enterprise of the knights of Arthur's court to go in search of it.

Pan.
What was he doing, the great god Pan,
Down in the reeds by the river ?
Spreading ruin and scattering ban,
Splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat,
And breaking the golden lilies afloat
With the dragon-fly on the river.
II.
He tore out a reed, the great god Pan,
From the deep cool bed of the river:
The limpid water turbidly ran,
And the broken lilies a-dying lay,
And the dragon-lly had fled away,
Ere he brought it out of the river.
III.
High on the shore sate the great god Pan,
While turbidly flowed the river;
And hacked and hewed as a great god can,
With his hard bleak steel at the patient reed,
Till there was not a sign of a leaf indeed
To prore it fresh from the river.
IV.
He cut it short, did the great god Pan,
(How tall it stood in the river !)
Then drew the pith, like the heart of a man,
Steadily from the outside ring,
And notched the poor dry empty thing
In holes, as he sate by the river.
V.
“This is the way," laughed the great god Pan,
(Laughed while he sate by the river,)
“The only way, since gods began
To make sweet music, they could succeed."
Then, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed,
He blew in power by the river.

Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan!
Piercing sweet by the river !
Blinding sweet, O great god Pan!
The sun on the hill forgot to die,
And the lilies revived, and the dragon-iy
Came back to dream on the river.
VII.
Yet half a beast is the great god Pan,
To laugh as he sits by the river,
Making a poet out of a man:
The true gods sigh for the cost and pain,-.
For the reed which grows nevermore again
As a reed with the reeds in the river.

Footsteps on the Other Side.
Sitting in my humble doorway,
Gazing out into the night,
Listening to the stormy tumult
With a kind of sad delight-
Wait I for the loved who comes not,
One whose step I long to hear;
One who, though he lingers from me,
Still is dearest of the dear.
Soft! he comes -- now heart be quick -
Leaping in triuniphant pride!
Oh! it is a stranger footstep,
Gone by on the other side.
All the night seems filled with wecping,
Winds are wailing mournfully;
And the rain-tears together
Journey to the restless sea.
I can fancy, sea, your murmur,
As they with your waters flow,
Like the griefs of single beings,
Making up a nation's woe!

Branches, bid your guests be silent;
Hush a moment, fretful rain;
Breeze, stop sighing - let me listen,
God grant not again in vain!
In my cheek the blood is rosy,
Like the blushes of a bride.

Goes on by the other side.
Ah! how many wait forever
For the steps that do not come!
Wait until the pitying angels
Bear them to a peaceful home!

Death of Little Nell.
From “ The Old Curiosity Shop.”
By little and little, the old man drew back towards the inner
chamber, while these words were spoken. He pointed there, as he
replied, with trembling lips,-
“You plot among you to wean my heart from her. You will
never do that — nerer while I have life. I have no relative or
friend but her — I never had — I never will have. She is all in all
to me. It is too late to part us now.”
Waving them off with his hand, and calling softly to her as he
went, he stole into the room. They who were left behind drew
close together, and after a few whispered words, — not unbroken
by emotion, or easily uttered, — followed bim. They moved so
gently, that their footsteps made no noise, but there were cobs
from among the group, and sounds of grief and mourning.
For she was dead. There, upon her little bed, she lay at resto
The solemn stillness was no marvel now.
She was dead. No sleep so beautiful and calm, so free from trace
of pain, so fair to look upon. She seemed a creature fresh from
the hand of God, and waiting for the breath of life; not one who
had lived and suffered death.

Her couch was dressed with, here and there, some winter berries
and green leaves, gathered in a spot she had been used to favor.
“When I die, put near me something that has loved the light, and
had the sky above it always.' These were her words.
Sl.e was dead. Dear, gentle, patient, noble Nell was dead. IIer
little bird — a poor slight thing the pressure of a finger would have
crushed — was stii ring ninıbly in its cage; and the strong heart of
its child-mistress was mute and motionless forever.
Where were the traces of her early cares, her sufferings and
latigues? All gone. This was the true death before their weeping
eyes. Sorrow was dead indeed in her, but peace and perfect bap-
piness were born; imaged in her tranquil beauty and profound
repose
And still her former self lay there, unaltered in this change.
Yes. The old fireside had smiled on that same sweet face; it had
passed like a dream through haunts of misery and care; at the
door of the poor schoolmaster on the summer evening, before the
ſurnace fire upon the cold, wet night, at the still, dying boy, there
had been the same mild, lovely look. So shall we know the angels
in their majesty, after death.
The old man held one languid arm in his, and kept the small hand
tight folded to his breast, for warmth. It was the hand she had
stretched out to him with her last smile — the hand that had led
him on through all their wanderings. Ever and anon he passed it
to his lips; then hugged it to his breast again, murmuring that it
was warmer now; and as he said it, he looked, in agony, to those
who stood around, as if imploring them to help her.
She was dead and past all help, or need of it. The ancient rooms
she had seemed to fill with life, even while her own was ebbing fast
- the garden she had tended — the eyes she had gladdened - the
noiseless haunts of many a thoughtless hour — the paths she had
trodden as if it were but yesterday — could know her no more.
“It is nat," said the schoolmaster, as he bent down to kiss her
op her cheek, and give his tears free vent — “it is not in this world
that Heaven's justice ends. Think what it is compared with the
world to which her young spirit has winged its early fight, and
say, if one deliberate wish expressed in solemn terms above this
hed could call her back to life, which of us would utter it!"

Auction Extraordinary.
I dreamed a dream in the midst of my slumbers,
And as fast as I dreamed it, it caine into numbers;
My thoughts ran along in such beautiful meter,
I'ın sure I ne'er saw any poetry sweeter:
It seemed that a law had been recently made,
That a tax on old bachelors' pates should be laid;
And in order to make them all willing to marry,
The tax was as large as a man could well carry,
The bachelors grumbled and said 'twas no use -
'Twas horrid injustice and horrid abuse,
And declared that to save their own heart's blood from spilling
Of such a vile tax they would not pay a shilling.
But the rulers determined them still to pursue,
So they set all the old bachelors up at vendue:
A crier was sent through the town to and fro,
To rattle his bell and a trumpet to blow,
And to call out to all he might meet in his way,
"Hol forty old bachelors sold here to day:"
And presently all the old maids in the town,
Each in her very best bonnet and gown,
From thirty to sixty, fair, plain, red, and pale,
Of every description, all flocked to the sale.
The auctioneer then in his labor began,
And called out aloud, as he held up a man,
" How much for a bachelor ? who wants to buy?
In a twink, every maiden responded, “I-I."
In short, at a highly extravagant price,
The bachelors all were sold off in a trice:
And forty old maidens, some younger, some older,
Each lugged an old bachelor home on her shoulder.

By people expert in the trade

But there is n't a man of them knows

She knows how to weep and to sigh

But her weeping is all in my eye, -
Not that of the cunning Coquettel
In short, she's a greature of art
(O hush 1 — said the frowning Lisette),
With merely the ghost of a heart,-
Enough for a thorough Coquette.
And yet I could easily prove

I heard you tell papa last night, his son must have a sled

I prayed for just those things, mamma, O, I shall be full of glee,
And the orphan boys in the village school will all be envying me;

And won't you let me go, mamma, upon the New Year's day,
And carry something nice and warm to poor old widow Gray ?

Of all the toys I wished so much, the story-book and sled:
But while I wondered what it meant, you came with tearful joy
And said, “Thou'lt find the New Year first; God calleth thee my

But now he'll know that I forgive, as then I tried to do.
And, if you please, mamma, I'd like the story-book and slate,

And, dear mainma, you won't forget, upon the New Year day,
The basket full of something nice for poor old widow Gray.
The New Year comes to-night, mamma, it seems so very soon,
I think God did n't hear me ask for just another June;
I know I've been a thoughtless boy, and made you too much care,
And may be for your sake, mamma, He does n't hear my prayer.
It cannot be; but you will keep the summer flowers green,
And plant a few - don't cry, mamma - a very few I mean,
When I'm asleep, I'd sleep so sweet beneath the apple tree,
Where you and robin, in the morn, may come and sing to me.
The New Year comes-good-night, mamma —“I lay me down to

I pray the Lord” - tell poor papa —“my soul to keep;

The New Year comes to-night, mamma, the old year—dies with me.

Gone, like the breeze o'er the billow that bloweth;
Gone, like the rill to the ocean that floweth;
Gone, as the day from the gray mountain goeth,
Darkness behind thee, but glory before.
Peace to thee, Marion, Marion Moore,
Peace which the queens of the earth cannot borrow,
Peace from a kingdom that crowned thee with sorrow,

The Well of St. Keyno.
There is a well in Cornwall, the water of which possesses rare virtues.
I the husband driuks first after the marriage, he gets the mastery for
Jfe, and vice versa.
A well there is in the west country,
And a clearer one never was seen;
There's not a wife in the west country
But has heard of the well of St. Keyne.
A traveler came to the well of St. Keyne;
Joyfully he drew nigh,
For from cock-crow he had been traveling,
And there was not a cloud in the sky.

He drank of the water, so cold and clear,
For thirsty and hot was he;
And he sat down upon the bank
Under the willow tree.
There came a man from the house hard by,
At the well to fill his pail;
On the well side he rested it,
And he bade the stranger hail.
“Art thou a bachelor, stranger ?" quoth he;
“For an' if thou hast a wife,
The happiest draught thou hast drank this day
That ever thou didst in thy life.
“Or hast thy good woman, if one thou hast,
Ever here in Cornwall been?
For an' if she have, I'll venture my life
She has drank of the well of St. Keyne."
“I have a good woman who never was here,”
The stranger made reply;
“But why should she be the better for that,
I pray you, answer why?".
“St. Keyne," quoth the Cornish-man, “many a time
Drank of this crystal well,
And before the angel summoned her,
She laid on the water a spell.
“If the husband of this gifted well
Shall drink before his wife,
A happy man henceforth is he,
For he shall be master for life.
‘But if the wife should drink of it first,
God help the husband then;"
The stranger stoop'd to the well of St. Keyne,
And drank of the water again.

Flags of truce to sin and crror,
Clasping lands, mute with terror,

Flashing back the day :

Through Death to Life.
Have you licard the tale of the Aloe plant,
Away in the sunny clime ?
By lumiile growth of a hundred years
It reaches its blooming time;
And then a wondrous bud at its crown
Breaks into a thousand flowers;
This floral queen, in its blooming scen,
Is the pride of the tropical bowers.
But the plant to the flower is a sacrifice,
For it blooms but once, and in blooming dies.
Fare you further leard of this Aloe plant
That grows in the sunny clime,
IIow cvery one of its thousand flowers,
As they drop in the blooming time,
Is an infant plant that fastens its roots
In tlic place where it falls on the ground;
And, fast as they drop from the dying stcm,
Groir lively and lovely around ?
By dying it liveth a thousand-fold
In the young that spring from the death of thc old.
Ilave you heard the tale of the Pelican,
The Arab's Gimel el Bahr,
That lives in the African solitudes,
Where the birds that live lonely are ?

And cares and toils for their good ?
It brings them water from ſountains afar,
And fishes the scas for their food.

The blood of its bosom, and feeding them dies.
Have you heard thc tale they tell of the swan,
Thc snow-white bird of the lake?
It noiselessly floats on the silvery wave,
It silently sits in the brake;
For it saves its song till the end of life,
And then, in tlic soft, still even,
'Mid the golden light of the setting sun,
It sings as it soars into heaven !
And the blesscd notes fall back from the skies ;
'Tis its only song, for in singing it dies.
You have heard these tales ; shall I tell you one
A greater and better than all ?
Have you heard of Ilim wliom the heavens adore,
Before whom the hosts of them fall ?
How IIc left the choirs and anthems above,
For carth in its wailings and woes,
To suffer the shame and pain of the cross,

The harvest was ower, an' yellow the leaf,
When Mary, my daughter, was smitten wi' grief;
0, little thought I my dear Mary wad dee,
An' leave as a blessing wee Minnie to me.
Her hair's like the lang wrailing tresses o' night;
Her face is the dawn o' day, rosy and bright;
Sae bashfu', sae thoughtfu', yet cheery an' free;
She just is a wonder my Minnie to me.
Her smile is sae sweet, an' sae glancin' her een,
They bring back the face o' my ain bonny Jean,
Hair clear than the linties that sing on the tree
Is the voice o' my Minnie when singing to me.
For mony long years I'd been doiting alane,
When Minnie reveal’d the old feelings again;
In the barn or the byre, on the hill or the lean
My bonnie wee Minnie is seldom frae me.
Wherever she moves she lets slip a wee crumb,
To beasties or birdies, the helpless and dumb;
How she feeds them, and leads, it's bonny to see;
Oh! a lesson o' loving is Minnie to me.
Whenever she hears my slow step on the floor,
She stands wi' her han' on the sneck o' the door,
An' welcomes me ben wi' a face fu' o' glee,
O nane are sae happy as Minnie an' me.
She trots to the corner, an' sets me a chair,
She plays wi' my haffets, and cames down my hair;
Or keeks through my speck, as she sits on my knee;
O were 't not for Minnie, I think I wad dee.
But I 'll nae talk o' deeing while work 's to be done,
But potter about, or sit still in the sun;
Till Providence pleases my spirit to free,
Obl nae power shall sever my Minnie frae me.

My Darling's Shoes.
God bless the little feet that can never go astray,
For the little shoes are empty in the closet laid away;
Sometimes I take one in my hand, forgetting till I see,
It is a little half-worn shoe not large enough for me;
And all at once I feel a sense of bitter loss and pain,
As sharp as when, two years ago, it cut my heart in twain,
O little feet, that wearied not, I wait for them no more,
For I am drifting on the tide, but they have reached the shore;
And while the blinding tear-drops wet these little shoes so old,
They walk unsandalled in the streets that pearly gates enfold:
And so I lay them down again, but always turn to say,
“God bless the little feet that now surely cannot stray.”
And while I am thus standing, I almost seem to see
Two little forms beside me, just as they used to be,-
Two little faces liſted, with their sweet and tender eyes,
Ah, me! I might have known that look was born of Paradise.
I reach my arms out fondly, but they clasp the empty air;
There 's nothing of my darlings but the shoes they used to wear
Oh! the bitterness of parting can ne'er be done away
Till I see my darlings walking where their feet can never stray.
When I no more am drifting upon the surging tide,
But with them safely landed upon the river side;
Be patient, heart, while waiting to see their shining way,
For the little feet, in the golden street, can never go astray.
Unwritten Music.
There is unwritten music. The world is full of it. I hear it
every hour that I wake; and my waking sense is surpassed some-
times by my sleeping, though that is a mystery. There is no sound
of simple nature that is not music. It is all God's work, and so
harmony. You may mingle, and divide, and strengthen the pass-
ages of its great anthem; and it is still melody,—melody.
The low winds of summer blow over the waterfalls and the
brooks, and bring their voices to your ear, as if their sweetness
were linked by an accurate finger; yet the wind is but a fitful

player; and you may go out when the tempest is up, and hear the
strong trees moaning as they lean before it, and the long grass biss-
ing as it sweeps throngh, and its own solemn monotony over all;
and the dimple of that same brook, and the waterfall's umaltered
burss shall still reach you, in the intervals of its power, as much in
harinony as before, and as much a part of its perfect and perpetual
hymn.
There is no accident of nature's causing which can bring in
discord. The loosened rock may fall into the abyss, and the over:
blown tree rush down through the branches of the wood, and the
thunder peal awfully in the sky; and sudden and violent as these
changes seem, their tumult goes up with the sound of wind and
Waters, and the exquisite car of the musician can detect no jar.
I bare read somewhere of a custom in the Highlands, which, in
connection with the principle it involves, is exceedingly beautilul.
It is believed that, to the ear of the dying (which, just before death
becomes always exquisitely acute), the perfect harmony of the
voices of nature is so ravishing, as to make him forget his suffering,
and die gently, like one in a pleasant trince. And so, when the
last moinent approaches, they take liim froin the close shieling, and
bear lim out into the open sky, that he may hear the familiar rusla-
ing of the streams. I can believe that it is not superstition. I do
not think we know how exquisitely nature's many voices are
attuned to harmony, and to each other.
The old philosopher we read of might not have been dreaming
when he discovered that the order of the sky was like a scroll of
written music, and that two stars (which are said to have appeared
centuries after liis death, in the very places he mentionel) were
wanting to complete the harmony. We know how wonderful are
the phenomena of color; low strangely like consummate art the
strongest dyes are blended in the plumage of birds, and in the cups
of lowers; so that, to the practiced eye of the painter, the harmony
is inimitably perfect. It is natural to suppose every part of the
universe equally perfect; and it is a glorious and elevating thought,
that the stars of heaven are moving on continnally to music, and
that the sounds we daily listen to are but part of a melody that
reaches to the very center of God's illimitable spheres.

The Wrock of the Hesperus
It was the schooner Hesperus,
That sailed the wintry sea;
And the skipper had taken his little daughter
To bear him company.
Blue were her eyes as the fairy flax,
Her cheeks like the dawn of day;
Her bosom white as the hawthorn buds,
That ope in the month of May.
The skipper he stood beside the helm
His pipe was in his mouth,
And he watched how the veering ilaw did blow
The smoke, now west, now south.
Then up and spake an old sailor,
Had sailed the Spanish main; -
“I pray thee put into yonder port
For I fear the hurricane."
“Last night the moon had a golden ring,
And to-night no moon we see."
But the skipper he blew a whiff from his pipe,
And a scornful laugh laughed he.
Colder and louder blew the wind
A gale from the northeast,
The snow fell hissing in the brine,
And the billows frothed like yeast.
Down came the storm and smote amaia
The vessel in its strength;
She shuddered and paused like a frightened steed,
Then leaped her cable's length.
“Come hither! come hither; my little daughter
And do not tremble so;
For I can weather the roughest gale
That ever wind did tlow."

Against the stinging blast,
He cut a rope from a broken spar
And bound her to the mast.
"O father! I hear the church bells ring
O say1 what may it be?”.
“ 'Tis a fog bell on a rock-bound coast,"
And he steered for the open sea.
“O father! I hear the sound of guns,
O say! what may it be?”
“Some ship in distress that cannot live
In such an angry sea."
“O father, I see a gleaming light;
O say what may it be?'
But the father answered never a word,
A frozen corpse was he.
Lashed to the helm all stiff and stark,
With his face turned to the skies,
The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow
On his fixed and glassy eyes.
Then the maiden clasped her hands and prayed
That saved she might be
And she thought of Christ who stilled the war
On the Lake of Galilee.
And fast through the midnight dark and drear,
Through the whistling sleet and snow,
Like a sheeted ghost the vessel swept,
Toward the reef of Norman's Woe.
And ever the fitful gusts between
A sound came from the land,
It was the sound of the trampling surf
On the rocks and the hard sea sand.
The breakers were right beneath her bows,
She drifted a dreary wreck,
And a whooping billow swept the crew
Like icicles from the deck.

Looked soft as carded wool,
But the cruel rocks, they gored her sides
Like the horns of an angry bull.

With the masts went by the board;
Like a vessel of glass, she stove—and sanky
· Ho! Ho!” the breakers roared.
At day-break on a bleak sea beach,
A fisherman stood aghast,
To see the form of a maiden fair-
Lashed close to a drifting mast.
The salt sea was frozen on her breast
The salt tears in her cyes;
And he saw her hair like the brown sea weed
Om the billows fall and rise.
Such was the wreck of the Hesperus,
In the midnight and the snow;
Christ save us all from a death like this,
On the reef of Norman's Woe.

Unchanged through time's all-devastating flight;

In its sublime research, philosophy
May measure out the ocean deep- may count
The sands or the sun's rays — but God I for Thee
There is no weight nor measure;-none can mount
Up to Thy mysteries. Reason's brightest spark,
Though kindled by Thy light, in vain would try
To trace Thy counsels, infinite and dark;
And thought is lost ere thought can soar so high-
E'en like past moments in eternity.
Thcu from primeval nothingness didst call,
First chaos, then existence; — Lordl on Thee
Eternity had its foundation; — all
Sprung forth from Thee; - of light, joy, harmony,
Sole origin; — all life, all beauty, Thine.
Thy word created all, and doth create;
Thy splendor Gills all space with rays divine;
Thou art, and wert, and shalt be! Glorious,
Light-giving, life-sustaining Potentate!
Thy chains the unmeasured universe surround;
Upheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with breath!
Thou the beginning with the end hast bound,
And beautifully mingled life and death!
As sparks mount upward from the fiery blaze,
So suns are born, so worlds spring forth from Thee,
And as the spangles in the sunny rays
Shine around the silver snow, the pageantry
Of heaven's bright army glitters in Thy praise.
A million torches lighted by Thy hant
Wander unwearied through the blue aby.us;
They own Thy power, accomplish Thy command,
All gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.
What shall we call them? Pyres of crystal light -
A glorious company of golden streams-
Lamps of celestial ether burning bright-
Suns lighting systems with their joyful beams?
But Thou to these art as the noon to night.
Yes! as a drop of water in the sea,
All this magnificence in Thee is lost; -
What are ten thousand worlds compared to Thee?

Aunt Kindly.
Miss Kindly is aunt to every body, and has been so long that
none remember to the contrary. The little children love her; she
helped their grandmothers to bridal ornaments three-score years
ago. Nay, this boy's grandfather found his way to college through
her pocket. Generations not her own rise up and call her blessed.
To this man's father her patient toil gave the first start in life.
That great fortune — when it was a seed she carried it in her hand,
That wide rirer of reputation ran out of the cup her bounty filled.
Now she is old; very old. The little children, who cling about her,
with open mouth and great round eyes, wonder that anybody
should ever be so old; or that Aunt Kindly ever had a mother to
kiss her inouth. To them she is coeval with the sun, and, like that,
an institution of the country. At Christmas they think she is the
wife of Saint Nicholas himself, such an advent of blessings is there
from her hand. She has helped to lay a blessing in many a poor
man's crib.
Now these things are passed by. No, they are not passed by;
they are remembered in the memory of the dear God, and every
good deed she has done is treasured in her own heart. The bulb
shuts up the summer in its breast which in winter will come out a
fragrant hyacinth. Stratum after stratum her good works are laid
up, imperishable in the geology of her character.
It is near noon. She is alone. She has been thoughtful all day,
talking inwardly to herself. The family notice it, and say nothing.

In a chamber, from a private drawer, she takes a little casket, and
from thence a book, gilt-citgred and clasped; but the clasp is worn,
the gilding is olu, the binding is faded by long use. ller hands
tremble as she opens it. First slie reads her own name on the fly-
leaf; only her Christian name, “ Agnes," and the date. Sixty-eight
years ago this day it was written there, in a clear, youthful, clerkly
hanil - with a little tremble in it, as if the lieart beat over it quick.
It is a very well worn, dear old Bible. It opens of its own accord
a: the fourteenth chapter of John. There is a little folded piece of
paper there; it touches the first verse and the twenty-serenth.
She sees neither; she reads both out of her soul; “Let not your
heart be troubled; ye believe in God; believe also in me.” “Peace
I leave with you. My peace give I unto you. Not as the world
givetlı give I unto you.” She opens the paper. There is a litile'
brown dust in it; perhaps the remnant of a Rower. She takes the
precious relic in her hand, made cold by emotion. She drops a
tear on it, and the dust is transfigured before her cyes; it is a red
rose of the spring, not quite half blown, dewy fresh. She is old
no longer. It is not Aunt Kindly now; it is sweet Agnes, as the
maiden of eighteen was eight-and-sixty years ago, one day in May,
when all nature was woosome and winning, and every flower-bell
rung in the marriage of the year. Her lover had just put that red
rose of the spring into her hand, and the good God another in her
check, not quite half-blown, dewy fresh. The young man's arm is
round her; her brown curls fall on his shoulder; she feels his
breath on lier face, his cheek on hers; their lips join, and, like two
morning dew-drops in that rose, their two loves rush into one.
But the youth must wander to a far land. They will think of each
other as they look at the North Star. She bids liim take her Bible.
Ile saw the North Star bang over the turrets of many a foreign
town. IIis soul went to God - there is as straight a road from
India as from any other spot - and his Bible came back to her --
the divine love in it, without the human lover; the leaf turned
down at the blessed words of John, first and twenty-seventh of :he
fourteenth chapter. She put the rose there to note the spot; what
marks the thought holds now the symbol of their youthful love.
Now to-clay her soul is with him, her maiden soul with his angel
soul; and one day the two, like two dew-drops, will rush into one
immortal wedlock, and the old age of earth shall become eternal
youth in the Kingdom of Heaven.

With tramp of thronging feet,
All flying to the city's wall ?

And every hand a sword could hold !
And every arm could bend a bow!

Between whose lips there swung
So grand a tongue!

And let him stand confest.

There 'll be wild work. Dost hear old Chewton roar
It's brewing up, down westward; and look there!
One of those sea gulls/ ay, there goes a pair;
And such a sudden thaw! If rain comes on
As threats, the water will be out anon.
That path by the ford is a nasty bit of way,
Best let the young ones bide from school to-day.
The children join in this request; but the mother resolves that
they shall set out — the two girls, Lizzie and Jenny, the one five,
the other seven. As the dame's will was law, so —
One last fond kiss —
“God bless my little maids," the father said,
And cheerily went his way to win their bread.
Prepared for their journey they depart, with the mother's adro-
nition to the elder-
“Now, mind and bring
Jenny safe home," the mother said. “Don't stay

To pull a bough or berry by the way;
And when you come to cross the ſord, hold fast
Your little sister's land till you're quite past;
That plank is so crazy, and so slippery,
If not overflowed the stepping stones will be;
But you're good children — steady as old folk,
I'd trust ye anywhere." Then Lizzie's cloak
(A good gray dume) lovingly she tied,
And amply little Jenny's lack supplied
With her own warmest shawl. "Be sure," said she,
"To wrap it round, and knot it carefully,
(Like this) when you come home - just leaving free
One hand to hold by. Now, make haste away -
Good will to school and then good right to play."
The mother watches them with foreboding, though she knows
not why. In a little while the threatened storm sets in. Night
comes, and with it comes the father from his daily toil - There's a
treasure hidden in his hat -
A plaything for his young ones, he has found —
A dormouse nest; the living ball coil'd round
For its long winter sleep; all his thought
As he trudged stoutly homeward, was of naught
But the glad wonderment in Jenny's eyes,
And graver Lizzie's quieter surprise,
When he should yield, by guess and kiss and prayer,
Hard won, the frozen captive to their care.
No little faces greet him as wont at the threshold; and to his
hurried question -
“Are they come ?”— t'was “no,"
To throw his tools down, hastily unhook
The old crack'd lantern from its dusty nook
And, while he lit it, speak a cheering word
That almost choked him, and was scarcely heard, -
Was but a moment's act, and he was gone
To where a fearful foresight led him on.
A neighbor goes with him, and the faithful dog follows the
children's tracks.

“Hold the light
Low down, he's making for the water. Hark!
I know that whine; the old dog's found them, Mark;"
So speaking, breathlessly he hurried on
Toward the old crazy foot bridge. It was gone!
And all his dull contracted light could show
Was the black, roid, and dark swollen stream below;
“Yet there's liſe somewhere - more than Tinker's whine -
That's sure," said Mark. “So, let the lantern shine
Down yonder. There's the dog — and hark!".
"O dear!"
And a low sob come faintly on the ear,
Mocked by the sobbing gust. Down quick as thought,
Into the stream leaped Ambrose, where he caught
Fast lold of something- a dark huddled heap –
Half in the water, where 'twas scarce knee deep
For a tall man; and half above it propped
By some old ragged side-piles that had stop't
Endways the broken plank when it gave way
With the two little ones, that luckless day!
“Dy babes ! my lambkins!” was the father's cry,
One little voice made answer, “Here am I;"
'Twas Lizzy's. There she crouched with face as white,
More glastly, by the flickering lantern light,
Than sheeted corpse. The pale blue lips drawn tighty
Wide parled, showing all the pearly teeth,
And eyes on some dark object underneath,
Washed by the turbid waters, fix'd like stone -
One arm and hand stretched out, and rigid grown,
Grasping, as in the death-gripe, Jenny's frock.
There she lay drown'd.
They liſted her from out her watery bed —
Its covering gone, the lovely little head
Idung like a broken snowdrop all aside,
And one small hand. The mother's shawl was tied
Leaving that frec about the child's small form,
As was her last injunction — “fast and warm,”
Too well obeyed — too fast! A fatal hcld,

Affording to the scrag, by a thick fold
That caught and pinned her to the river's bed.
· While through the reckless water overhead,
Her life breath bubbled up.
“She might have lived,
Struggling like Lizzy," was the thought that rived
The wretched mother's heart when she heard all,
“But for my foolishness about that shawl."
Who says I forgot ? .
Blother! indeed, indeed I kept fast hold,
And tied the shawl quite close — she
Can't be cold —
But she won't move - we slept - I don't know how -
But I held on, and I'm so weary now -
And its so dark and coldOh dearl oh dear!
And she won't move-if father were but here !"
All night long from side to side she turn'd,
Piteously plaining like a wounded dove,
With now and then the murmur “She won't move,"
And lol when morning, as in mockery, bright
Shone on that pillow — passing strange the sight,
The young head's raven hair was streaked with white!
Mrs. Southey
The Suliote Mother.
She stood upon the loftiest peak,
A midst the clear blue sky;
A bitter smile was on her cheek,
And a dark flash in her eye.
“ Dost thou see them, boy ?-through the dusky pines ?
Dost thou see where the foeman's armor shines ?
Hast thou caught the gleam of the conqueror's crest ?
My babe, that I cradled on my breast!
Wouldst thou spring from my mother's arms with joy ?

For in the rocky strait beneath,
Lay Suliote sire and son;
They had heap'd high the piles of death
Before the pass was won.
"They have cross'd the torrent, and on they come
Woe for the mountain hearth and home!
There, where the hunter laid by his spear,
There, where the lyre hath been sweet to hear,
There, where I sang thee, fair babel to sleep,
Naught but the blood-stain our trace shall keep !"
And now the horn's loud blast was heard,
And now the cymbal's clang,
Till even the upper air was stirr'd,
As cliff and hollow rang.
“Hark! they bring music, my joyous child!
What saith the trumpet to Suli's wild I
Doth it light thine eye with so quick a fire
As if at a glance of thine armed sire ?-
Still I be thou still I — there are brave men low-
Thou wouldst not smile couldst thou see him now !
But nearer came the clash of steel,
And louder swell'd the horn,
And farther yet the tambour's peal
Through the dark pass was borne.
“ Hear'st thou the sound of their savage mirth ?
Boy! thou wert free when I gave thee birth,
Free, and how cherish'd, my warrior's son!
He, too, hath bless'd thee, as I have done !
Aye, and unchain'd must his loved ones be —
Freedom, young Suliotel for thee and me!"
And from the arrowy peak she sprung,
And fast the fair child bore ;-
A veil upon the wind was flung,
A cry — and all was o'er!

Sandalphon.
Have you read in the Talmud of old,
In the Legends the Rabbins have told,
of the limitless realms of the air,-
Hare you read it, - the marvelous story
Of Sandalphon, the angel of Glory,
Sandalphon, the angel of Prayer?
How crect, at the outermost gates
Of the City Celestial, he waits,
With his feet on the ladder of light,
That, crowded with angels unnumbered,
By Jacob was seen, as he slumbered
Alone in the desert at night ?
The Angels of Wind and of Fire
Chant only one hymn, and expire
With the song's irresistible stress;
Expire in their rapture and wonder,
As harp strings are broken asunder
By music they throb to express.
But serene in the rapturous throng,
Unmoved by the rush of the song,
With eyes unimpassioned and slow,
Among the dead angels, the deathless
Sandalphon stands listening breathless
To sounds that ascend from below;-
From the spirits on earth that adore,
From the souls that entreat and implore,
In the ferver and passion of prayer;
From the hearts that are broken with lossess
And weary with dragging the crosses
Too heavy for mortals to bear.
And he gathers the prayers as he stands,
And they change into flowers in his hands,
Into garlands of purple and red;
And beneath the great arch of the portal,
Through the streets of the City Immortal,
Is waſted the fragrance they shed.

It is but a legend I know,-
A fable, a phantom, a show,
Of the ancient Rabbinical lore;
Yet the old mediæval tradition,
The beautiful strange superstition,
But haunts me and holds me the more.
When I look from my window at night,
And the welkin above is all white,
All throbbing and panting with stars,
Among them majestic is standing,
Sandalphon, the angel, expanding
His pinions in nebulous bars.
And the legend, I feel, is a part
Of the hunger and thirst of the heart,
The frenzy and fire of the brain,
That grasps at the fruitage forbidden,
The golden pomegranates of Eden,
To quiet its fever and pain.

Arranged by Mr. C. W. Sanders for the Union Fifth Reader.
"I thought, Mr. Allan, when I gave my Bennie to his country,
that not a father in all this broad land made so precious a gift,—no,
not one. The dear boy only slept a minute, just one little minute,
at his post; I know that was all, for Bennie never dozed over a
duty. How prompt and reliable he was! I know he only fell
asleep one little second;—he was so young, and not strong, that
boy of mine! Why, he was as tall as I, and only eighteen 1 and
now they shoot him because he was found asleep when doing sen-
tinel duty! Twenty-four hours, the telegram said, - only twenty-
fo'ir hours. Where is Bennie now ?"
“We will hope with his heavenly Father," said Mr. Allan,
soothingly.
“Yes, yes; let us hope; God is very merciful!
"I should be ashamed, father!' Bennie said, 'when I am a man,
to think I never used this great right arm,' — and he held it out 80

proudly before me,—'for my country, when it needed it! Patsy it
rather than keep it at the plow!'
“Go, then, go, my boy,' I said, 'and God keep you!' God has
kept him, I think, Mr. Allan !” and the farmer repeated these last
words slowly, as iſ, in spite of his reason, his heart doubted them.
“Like the apple of his eyc, Mr. Owen, doubt it not!"
Blossom sat near them listening, with blanched cheek. She had
cot shed a tear. IIer anxiety had been so concealed that no one
ad noticed it. She had occupied herself mechanically in the
nou sehold cares. Now she answered a gentle tap at the kitchen
door, opening it to receive from a neighbor's hand a letter. " It is
from him," was all she said.
It was like a message from the dead! Mr. Owen took the letter
but could not break the envelope, on account of his trembling
fingers, and held it toward Mr. Allan, with the helplessness of a
chilil.
The ininister opened it, and read as follows:-
“Dear Father:-When this reaches you, I shall be in cternity.
At first, it seemed awful to me; but I have thought about it so
much now, that it has no terror. They say they will not bind me,
nor blind me; but that I may meet my death like a man. I thought,
father, it might have been on the battle-field, for my country, and
that, when I fell, it would be fighting gloriously; but to be shot
down like a dog for nearly betraying it, -to die for neglect of duty !
O, father, I wonder the very thought does not kill me! But I shall
not disgrace you. I am going to write you all about it; and when
I am gone, you may tell my comrades. I can not now.
"You know I promised Jemmie Carr's mother, I would look
after her boy; and, when he fell sick, I did all I could for him. He
was not strong when he was ordered back into the ranks, and the
day before that night, I carried all his luggage, besides my own, on
our march. Toward night we went in on double-quick, and though
the luggage began to feel very heavy, erery body else was tired
too; and as for Jemmie, if I had not lent him an arm now and then,
he would have dropped by the way. I was all tired out when we
came into camp, and then it was Jenmie's turn to be sentry, and I
would take his place; but I was too tired, father. I could not rare

- "God be tha:iked I” interrupted Mr. Owen, reverently. “I
knew Bennie was not the boy to sleep carelessly at his post.”
"They tell me to-day that I have a short reprieve,-given to me
by circumstances,— time to write to you,' our good Colonel says.
Forgive him, father, he only does his duty; he would gladly save
me if he could; and do not lay my death up against Jemmie. The
poor boy is broken-hearted, and does nothing but beg and entreat
thern to let him die in my stead.
"I can't bear to think of mother and Blossom. Comfort then,
ſather! Tell them I die as a brave boy should, and that, when the
war is over, they will not be ashamed of me, as they must be now.
God help me; it is very hard to bear! Good-by, father! God
seems near and dear to me; not at all as if He wished me to perisha
orever, but as if He felt sorry for his poor, sinful, broken-hearted
child, and would take me to be with Him and my Savior in a
better - better life.”
A deep sigh burst from Mr. Owen's heart. “Amen,” lie said
sulemnly, -- "Amen."
“To-night, in the early twilight, I shall see the cows all coming
home from pasture, and precious little Blossom stand on the back
stoop, waiting for me, – but I shall never, never come! God bless
you all! Forgive your poor Bennie."
Late that night the door of the “back stoop" opened softly, and
a little ligure glided out, and down the foot-path that led to the
road by the mill. She seemed rather Lying than walking, turning
her head neither to the right nor the left, looking only now and
then to IIcaven, and folding her hands, as if in prayer. Two hours
later, the same young girl stood at the Mill Depot, watching the
coming of the night train; and the conductor, as he reached down
to liſt her into the car, wondered at the tear-stained face that was
upturned toward the dim lantern he held in his hand. A few
questions and ready answers told him all; and no father could have
cared more tenderly for his only child, than he for our little Blossoin

York, and the conductor hurried hier on to Washington. Every

minute, now, might be the means of saving her brother's life. And
80, in an incredibly short time, Blossom reached the Capital, and
hastened immediately to the White House.
The President had but just seated himself to his morning's task,
of overlooking and signing important papers, when, without one
word of announcement, the door softly opened, and Blossom, with
downcast eyes, and folded hands, stood before him.
“Well, my child,” he said in his pleasant, cheerful tones, “what
lo you want so bright and early in the morning ?”
"Bennie's life, please, sir," faltered Blossom.
“Bennie? Who is Bennie ?"
“My brother, sir. They are going to shoot him for sleeping at
his post.”
“Oh, yes," and Mr. Lincoln ran his eye over the papers before
him. “I remember! It was a fatal sleep. You see, child, it was
at a time of special danger. Thousands of lives might have been
lost for his culpable negligence.”
“So my father said,” replied Blossom gravely, “but poor Bennie
was so tired, sir, and Jemmie so weak. He did the work of two,
sir, and it was Jemmie's night, not his; but Jemmie was too tired,
and Bennie never thought about himself, that he was tired too."
“What is this you say, child ? Come here; I do not understand,"
and the kind man caught eagerly, as ever, at what seemed to be a
justification of an offense.
Blossom went to him: he put his hand tenderly on her shoulder,
and turned up the pale, anxious face toward his. How tall he
seemed, and he was President of the United States too! A dim
thought of this kind passed for a moment through Blossom's mind;
but she told her simple and straightforward story, and handed Mr.
Lincoln Bennie's letter to read.
He read it carefully; then, taking up his pen, wrote a few hasty
lines, and rang his bell.
Blossom heard this order given: "SEND TOIS DISPATCI AT ONCE."
The President then turned to the girl and said: “Go home, my
chili, and tell that father of yours, who could approve his country's
sentence, even when it took the life of a child like that, that Abraham
Lincoln thinks the life far too precious to be lost. Go back, or -
wait until to-morrow; Bennie will need a change after he has so
bravely faced death; he shall go with you."

“God bless you, sir," said Blossom; and who shall doubt that
God heard and registered the request ?
Two days after this interview, the young soldier came to the
White House with his little sister. He was called into the Presi-
dent's private room, and a strap fastened “upon the shoulder.”
Mr. Lincoln then said: “The soldier that could carry a sick com-
rade's baggage, and die for the act so uncomplainingły, deserveg
well of his country." Then Bennie and Blessom took their way to
their Green Mountain home. A crowd gathered at the Mill Depot
to welcome them back; and, as farmer Owen's hand grasped tl:at
of his boy, tears flowed down his cheeks, and he was heard to say
fervently, “Tue LORD BE PRAISED!”

The Cynic.
The Cynic is one who never sees a good quality in a mari, and
never fails to see a bad one. He is tlie human owl, vigilant in
darkness and blind to light, mousing for vermin, and never seeing
noble game.
The Cynic puts all human actions into only two classes — openly
bad, and secretly bad. All virtue, and generosity, and disinter-
estedness, are merely the appearance of good, but selfish at the
bottom. He holds that no man does a good thing except for profit.
The effect of his conversation upon your feelings is to chill and sear
them; to send you away sour and morose.
His criticisms and innuendoes fall indiscriminately upon every
lovely thing, like frost upon the flowers. If Mr. A. is pronounced
a religious man, he will reply: yes, on Sundays. Mr. B. has just
joined the church: certainly; the elections are coming on. The
minister of the gospel is called an example of diligence: it iy his
trade. Such a man is generous: of other men's money. This
man is obliging: to lull suspicion and cheat you. That man is
upright: because he is green.
Thus his eye strains out every good quality, and takes in only
the bad. To him religion is hypocrisy, honesty a preparation for
fraud, virtue only a want of opportunity, and undeniable purity,
asceticism. The livelong day he will coolly sit with sneering lif,
transfixing every character that is presented.

It is impossible to indulge in such habitual severity of opinion
upon our fellow-men, withont injuring the tenilerness and delicacy
of our own feelings. A man will be what liis most cherished
feelings are. If he encourage a noble generosity, every ſeeling will
be enriched by it; if he nurse bitter and envenomed thoughts, his
own spirit will absorb the poison, and he will crawl among men as
a burnisheil adder, whose life is mischief, and whose errand is
death.

The Drummer's Bride.
Hollow-eyed and pale at the window of a jail,
Thro' her soſt disheveled hair, a maniac did stare, stare, stare!
At a distance, down the street, making music with their feet,
Came the soldiers from the wars, all embellished with their scars,
To the tapping of a drum, of a drum;
To the pounding and the sounding of a drum!
Of a drum, of a drum, of a drum! drum, drum, drum!
The woman heaves a sigh, and a fire fills her eye.
When she hears the distant drum, she cries, “Here they come!
here they coine!”
Then, clutching fast the grating, with eager, nervous waiting,
See, she looks into the air, through her long and silky hair,
For the echo of a drum, of a drum;
For the cheering and the hearing of a drum!
Of a drum, of a drum, of a drum! drum, drum, drum!
Ard nearer, ncarer, ncarer, comes, more distinct and clearer,
Tire rattle of the drumming; shrieks the woman, “IIc is coming,
Ile is coming now to me; quick, drummer, quick, till I sec!"
And her eye is glassy bright, while she beats in mad delight
To the echo of a drum, of a drum;
To the rapping, tapping, tapping of a drum!
Of a drum, of a drum, of a drum! drum, drum, drum!

Now she sees them, in the street, march along with dusty feet,
As she looks through the spaces, gazing madly in their faces;
And she reaches out her hand, screaming wildly to the band;
Biit lier words, like her lover, are lost beyond recorer,
'Mid the beating of a drum, of a drum;
Mid the clanging and the banging of a drum !
Of a dram, of a drum, of a drum! drum, drun, drum!
So the pagcant passes by, and the woman's flashing eye
Quickly loses all its stare, and fills with a tear, with a tear;
As, sinking from her place, with her hands upon her face,
“Hoar!" she weeps and sobs as wild as a disappointed child;
Sobbing “He will nerer come, never come!
Now nor ever, nerer, never, will he come
With his drum, with his drum, with his drum! drum, drum, drum."
Still the drummer, up the street, beats his distant, dying beat,
And she shouts, within her cell, “ Hal they're marching down to hell,
And the devils dance and wait at the open iron gate:
Hark! it is the dying sound, as they march into the ground,
To the sighing and the dying of the drum!
To the throbbing and the sobbing of the drum 1
Of a drum, of a drum, of a drum! drum, drum, drum!"
The Isle of Long Ago.
O, a wonderful stream is the river Time,
As it runs through the realm of tears,
With a faultless rhythm and a musical rhyme,
And å boundless sweep and a surge sublime,
As it blends with the Ocean of Years.
Ilow the winters are drifting, like flakes of snow,
And the summers, like buds between;
And the year in the sheaf- so they come and they go,
On the river's breast, with its ebb and flow,
As it glides in the shadow and shcen.
There 's a magical islc up the rirer of Time,
Where the softest of airs are playing;
There 's a cloudless sky and a tropical clime,
And a song as sweet as a vesper chime,
And the Junes with the roses are staying.

And the name of that Isle is the Long Ago,
And we bury our treasures there;
There are brows of beauty and bosoms of snow-
There are heaps of dust — but we loved them so I -
There are trinkets and tresses of hair;
There are fragments of song that nobody sings,
And a part of an infant's prayer;
There 's a lute unswept, and a harp without strings
There are broken vows and pieces of rings,
And the garments that she used to wear.
There are hands that are waved, when the fairy shoro
By the mirage is liſted in air;
And we sometimes hear, through the turbulent roar,
Sweet voices we heard in the days gone before,
When the wind down the river is fair.

All the day of our life till night -
When the evening comes with its beautiful smile,
And our eyes are closing to slumber :while,
May that “Greenwood” of Soul be in sight!

The shades of night were falling fast,
As through an Alpine village passed
A youth, who bore, 'mid snow and ice,
A banner with the strange device,
“Excelsior!”.
His brow was sad; his eye, beneath,
Flashed like a falchion from its sheath
And like a silver clarion rung
The accents of that unknown tongue,
“Excelsior!”
In happy homes he saw the light
Of household fires gleam warm and bright:
Above, the spectral glaciers shone;
And from his lips escaped a groan,
“Excelsior!”

"Try not the pass!" the old man said,
“ Dark lowers the tempest overhead;
The roaring torrent's deep and wide!"
And loud that clarion voice replied,
“Excelsior!”
“Ohl stay,” the maiden said, “and rest
Thy weary head upon this breast!”-
A tear stood in his bright blue eye;
But still he answered, with a sigb,
“Excelsior !"
“Beware the pine-tree's withered branch!
Beware the awful avalanche!”.
This was the peasant's last good-night;-
A voice replied, far up the height,
“Excelsior 1”.
At break of day, as heavenward
The pious monks of Saint Bernard
Uttered the oft-repeated prayer,
A voice cried through the startled air,
“Excelsior!”
A traveler, by the faithful hound,
Half buried in the snow was found,
Still grasping in his hand of ice
That banner with the strange device,
“Excelsior!"
There, in the twilight cold and gray,
Lifeless, but beautiful, he lay;
And from the sky, serene and far,
A voice ſell, like a falling star -

Poor Little Jim.
The cottage was a thatched one, the outside old and mean,
But all within that little cot was wondrous ncat ard clean ;
The night was dark and stormy, the wind was howling wild,
As a patient mother sat beside the death-bed of her child:
A little worn-out creature, his once bright eyes grown dim:
It was a collier's wife and child, they called him little Jim.
And oh I to see the briny tears fast hurrying down her cheek,
As she offered up the prayer, in thought, she was afraid to speak,
Lest slie might waken one she loved far better than her liſe;
For she had all a mother's heart, had that poor collier's wiſe.
With hands uplifted, sec, she kneels beside the sufferer's bed,
And prays that He would spare lier boy, and take herself instead.
She gets her answer irom the child: soft fall the words from him,
“Mother, the angels do so smile, and beckon little Jim,
I have no pain, dear mother, now, but O! I am so dry,
Just moisten poor Jim's lips again, and, mother, don't you cry.".
With gevtle, trembling haste she held the liquid to his lip:
He smilel to thank her, as he took each little, tiny sip.
“Tell father, when he comes from work, I said good-night to him,
And, mother, now I'll go to sleep." Alas! poor little Jim!
She knew that he was dying; that the child she loved so dear,
Had uttered the last words she might ever hope to hear.
The cottage door is opened, the collier's step is heard,
The father and the mother meet, yet neither speak a word
He felt that all was over, he knew his child was dead,

His quivering lips gava token of the grief he'd ſain conceal,
And see, his wife has joined him — the stricken couple kneel:
Witli hearts bowed down by sadness, they humbly ask of Him,
In heaven once more to meet again their own poor little Jim.

The Dawn of Redemption.
See them go forth like the foods to the occan,
Gathering might from each mountain and glen,-
Wider and deeper the tide of devotion
Rolls up to God from the bosoms of men:
LIcar the great multitude, mingling in chorus,
Groan, as they gaze from their crimes to the sky:-
“ Father the midnight of death gathers o'er us,
When will the dawn of redemption draw nigh pás
“Look on us, wanderers, sinſul and lowly,
Struggling with grief and temptation below;
Thine is the goodness o'er every thing holy, -
Thinc is the mercy to pity our woe,
Thine is the power to cleanse and restore us,
Spotless and pure as the angels on high:-
Father! the midnight of death gathers o'er us,
When will the dawn of redemption draw nighpon
Gray hair and golden youth, matron and maiden,
Lovers of mammon, and followers of faine,
All with the same solemn burden are laden,
Liſting their souls to that one mighty name:-
“Wild is the pathway that surges before us,
On the broad waters the black shadows lie, -
Father! the midnight of death gathers o'er us,
When will the dawn of redemption draw nigh?'
Lol the vast depths of futurity's ocean
Heave with Jehovah's mysterious breath;
Why should we shrink from the billows' com motivu.
Jesus is walking the waters of death.
Angels are mingling with men in the chorus,
Rising, like incense, from earth to the sky :-
“Father! the billows grow brighter before us,
Heaven with its mansions eternal draws nigh."

The Bell.
A selection of prose poetry, written during the Inte war.
The Roman knight who rode, “all accoutred as he was," into tho
gull, and the hungry forum closed upon him, and was satisfied,
slew, in his own dying, that great Philistine, Oblivion, which,
sooner or later, will conquer is all.
We never thought, when we used to read his story, that the
grand classic tragedy of patriotic devotion would be a thousand
times repeated in our own day and presence; that the face of the
neighbor, who had walked by our side all the while, should be
transfigured, in the twinkling of an eye, like the face of an angel;
that the old gods, who thundered in Greek and lightened in Latin,
should stand aside while common men, of plain English speech,
upon whose shoulders we had laid a familiar hand, should keep in
motion the machinery of the grandest èpic of the world - the war
for the American Union.
But there is an old story that always charmed us more:
In some strange land and time — for so the story runs — they
were about to found a bell for a midnight tower— a hollow, starless
heaven of iron. It should toll for dead monarchs, “The king is
dead;" and make glad clamor for the new prince, “Long live the
king." It should proclaim so great a passion or so grand a pride
that either would be worship, or wanting these, forever hold its
peace. Now this bell was not to be dug out of the cold mountains:
it was to be made of something that had been warmed by a human
touch and loved with a human love; and so the people came, like
pilgrims to a shrine, and cast their offerings into the furnace, and
went away. There were links of chains that bondsınen had worn
bright, and fragments of swords that had broken in heroes' lands;
there were crosses and rings and bracelets of fine gold; trinkets of
silver and toys of poor red copper. They even brought things that
were licked up in an instant by the red tongues of flame, good words
they had written and flowers they had cherished, perishable things
that could never be heard in the rich tone and volume of the bell.
And by and by, the bell was alone in its chamber, and its four windows
looked forth to the four quarters of heaven. For many a day it
hung dumb. The winds came and went, but they only set it sigh-
ing; the birds came and sang under its eaves, but it was an iroc

275
horizon of dead melody still: all the meaner strifes and passions of
men rippled on below it; they outgroped the ants and outwrought
the bees and outwatched the shepherds of Cialdea, but the cham-
bers of the bell were as dumb as the care of Macpelah.
At last there came a time when men grew grand for right and
truth, and stood shoulder to shoulder over all the land, and went
down like reapers to the harvest of death; looked in the graves of
them that slept, and believed there was something grander than
living; glanced on into the far future, and discovered there was
something bitterer than dying; and so, standing between the quick
and the dead, they acquitted themselves like men. Then the bell
awoke in its chamber, and the great waves of its music rolled
gloriously out and broke along the blue walls of the world like an
anthem; and every tone in it was familiar as an household word to
somebody, and he heard it and knew it with a solemn joy. Poured
into that fiery heart together, the humblest gifts were blent in one
great wealth, and accents, feeble as a sparrow's song, grew eloquent
and strong; and lol a people's stately soul heaved on the waves of
a mighty voice.
We thank God, in this our day, for the furnace and the fire; for
the offerings of gold, and the trinkets of silver, and the broken links
of iron; for the good sword and the true word; for the great triumph
and the little song. We thank God for the loyal Ruths, who have
taken up the words of their elder sister and said to the Naomi of a
later time, “Where thou goest I will go; thy people shall be my
people, and thy God my God.” By the memory of the Ramah, into
which rebellion has turned the land; for the love of the Rachels
now lamenting within it; for the honor of heaven and the hope of
mankind, let us who stand here - past and present, clasping hands
over our heads, the broad age dwindled to a line beneath our feet,
and bridged with the graves of dead martyrs — let us declare before
God and these witnesses
We will finish the work that the fathers began;
Then those to their sleeping,
And these to their weeping,
And one faith and one flag, for the Federal Union.
B. F. Taylor.

Declaration of Independence.
Then, in the course of inuman erents, it becomes necessary for
one people to dissolve thie political bands which have connected
them with anothier, and to assume among the powers of the earth
the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of
nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of man-
kind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them
to the separation.
We hold these truths to be self-crident: that all men are created
cqual; that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalien.
aule riglats; that, among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness. That, to secure these rights, governments are instituted
among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the
gorerned; that, whenever any form of government becomes des-
tructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or
abolish it, and to institute a new government, laying its foundation
on such principles, and organizing its powers in such form, as to
them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established,
should not be changed for light and transient causes; and, accords
ingly, all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed
to suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by
abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But, when a
lòng train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same
object, evinces a design to reduce thein under absolute despotism,
it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and
to provide new guards for their future security.
Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies, and such
is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former
systems of government. The history of the present sing of Great
Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all liaving,
in direct object, the establishment of an absolute tyranny over
these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid
world:
He has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and neces-
sary for the public good.
He has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and
pressing importance, unless suspended in their operatiou till his

neglected to attend to them.
lle has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of
large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the
right of representation in the legi-lature; a right inestimable to
them, and formidable to tyrants only.
Ile las called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncom-
fortable, and distant from the depository of their public records,
for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his
mcasures.
IIc has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing,
with manly firmness, bis invasions on the rights of the people.
He has refused for a long time after such dissolutions to cause
others to be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of
annihilation, have returned to tlie people at large for their exercise;
the state remaining, in the meantime, exposed to all the danger of
invasion from without, and convulsions within.
Ile has endeavored to prevent the population of these states;
for that purpose, obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreign-
ers; refusing to pass others to encourage their migration hither,
and raising the conditions of new appropriations of lands.
He has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his
assent to laws for establishing judiciary powers.
He has made judges dependent on his will alone, for the terure
of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.
He has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither
swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.
He has kept among us, in times of peace, standing armies with-
out the consent of our legislature.
He has affected to render the military independent of, and
superior to, the civil power.
He has combined, with others, to subject us to a jurisdiction
Coreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws;
giving his assent to their acts of pretended legislation;
Foi quartering large bodies of armed troops among us;
For protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment, for any
murders which they should commit on the inhabitants of these
states;

For cutting off our trade with all parts of the world;
For imposing taxes on us without our consent;
For depriving us, in many cases, of the benefits of trial by jury;
For transporting us beyond seas to be tried for pretended
offenses;
For abolishing the free system of English laws in a neighboring
province, establishing therein an arbitrary government, and enlarge
ing its boundaries, so as to render it at once an example and fit
instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these
colonies;
For taking away our charters, abolishing our most valuable laws,
and altering, fundamentally, the powers of our governments;
For suspending our own legislatures, and declaring themselves
invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.
He has abdicated government here, by declaring us out of his
protection and waging war against us.
He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns,

He is, at this time, transporting large armies of foreign merce-
naries to complete the works of death, desulation, and tyranny,
already begun, with circumstances of cruelty and perfidy scarcely
paralleled in the inost barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the
head of a civilized nation.
He has constrained our fellow-citizens, taken captive on the high
seas, to bear arms against their country, to become the executioners
of their friends and brethren, or to fall themselves, by their hands.
He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has
endeavored to bring, on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merci-

We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and
settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and
magnanimity, and we have conjured them, by the ties of our com-
mon kindred, to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably
interrupt our connections and correspondence. They, too, have
been deaf to the voice of justice and consanguinity. We must,
therefore, acquiesce in the necessity which denounces our separa-
tion, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, enemies in
war, in peace, friends.
Wc, therefore, the representatives of the United States of
America, in general congress assembled, appealing to the Supreme
Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the
name and by the authority of the good people of these colonies,
solemnly publish and declare, That these United Colonies are, and
of right ought to be, Free and Independent States; that they are
absolved from all allegiance to the British crown, and that all poli-
tical connection between them and the State of Great Britain is,
and ought to be, totally dissolved; and that, as Free and Independ-
ent States, they have full power to levy war, conclude peace, con-
tract alliances, establish commerce, and to do all other acts and
things which Independent States may of right do. And for the
support of this declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection
of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our lives,
our fortunes, and our sacred honor.
The Burial of Moses.
“And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against Beth-peor ;
but no mau knoweth of his sepulcher to this day."-Deut. XXXIV: 6.
By Nebo's lonely mountain,
On this side Jordan's wave,
In a vale in the land of Moab,
There lies a lonely grave;
But no man dug that sepulcher,
And no man saw it e'er,
For the angels of God upturned the sod,
And laid the dead man there

That was the grandest funeral
That cver passed on earth;
But no man heard the trainping,
Or saw the train go furth;
Noiselessly as the day-light
Comes when the night is done,
And the crimson streak on ocean's cheek
Grows into the great sun,-
Noiselessly as the spring-time
Her crown of verdure weaves,
And all the trees on all the hills
Open their thousand leaves, –
So, without sound of music
Or voice of them that wept,
Silently down from the mountain crown
The great procession swept.
Perchance the bald old eagle,
On grey Beth-peor's height,
Out of his rocky eyrie,
Looked on the wondrous sight;
Perchance the lion, stalking,
Still shuns the hallowed spot:
For beast and bird have seen and heard
That which man knoweth not.
Lo when the warrior dieth,
His comrades in the war,
With arms reversed and mumed drum,
Follow the funeral car.
They sl:ow the banners taken,
They tell his battles won,
And after him lead his masterless steeds
While peals the minute gun.
Amid the noblest of the land
Men lay the sage to rest,
And give the bard an honored place,

In the great minster transept,
Where lights like glories fall,
And the choir sings and the organ rings
Along the emblazoned wall.
This was the bravest warrior
That ever buckled sword;
This the most gifted poet
That ever breathed a word;
And never earth's philosopher
Traced, with his golden pen,
On the leathless page, truths half so sage
As he wrote down for men.
And had he not high honor ?
The hill side for his pall;
To lie in state while angels wait
With stars for tapers tall;
And the dark rock pines, like tossing plumes,
Over his bier to wave;
And God's own hand in that lonely land,
To lay him in the grave, -
In that deep grave, without a name,
Whence his uncollined clay
Shall break again - wondrous thought I -
Before the judgment day,
And stand with glory wrapped around
On the hills he never trou,
And speak of the striſe that won our life
With the incarnate Son of God.
O lonely tomb in Moab's land,
O dark Beth-peor's hill,
Speak to these curious hearts of ours,
And teach them to be still.
God hath his mysteries of grace, -
Ways that we cannot tell;
He hides them deep, like the secret sleep
Of him he loved so well.

Meet with no lagging frost to kill their sweetness. —

Taste first the wholesome bitter of the cup,

From long gazing on the sky,

But with bands outstretched to those angela

One may bear, and yet not die.
To lift our faint hearts upward

When He dwelt beneath the sky;
To make us drop all earth props

The Inchcape Rock
No stir in the air, no stir in the sea,
The ship was still as she could be;
Her sails from heaven received no motion,
Her keel was steady in the ocean.
Without either sign or sound of their shock,
The waves fowed over the Inchcape Rock;
So little they rose, so little they fell,
They did not move the Inchcape Bell.
The Abbot of Aberbrothock
Had placed that bell on the Inchcape Rock;
On a buoy in the storm it floated and swung,
And over the waves its warning rung.
When the rock was hid by the surge's swelt
The mariners heard the warning bell;
And then they knew the perilous rock,
And blessed the Abbot of Aberbrothock.
The sun in heaven was shining gay;
All things were joyful on that day;
The sea-birds screamed as they wheeled ro'ind
And there was joyance in their sound.
The buoy of the Inchcape Bell was seen,
A darker speck on the ocean green;
Sir Ralph the Rover walked his deck,
And he fixed his eye on the darker speck
He felt the cheering power of spring;
It made him whistle, it made him sing;
His heart was mirthful to excess,
But the Rover's mirth was wickedness.
His eye was on the Inchcape float;
Quoth he, “My men, put out the boab,
And row me to the Inchcape Rock,
And I'll plague the Abbot of Aberbrothock."

The boat is lowered, the boatmen row,
And to the Inchcape Rock they go;
Sir Ralph bent over from the boat,
And he cut the bell from the Inchcape floats
Down sunk the bell with a gurgling sound;
The bubbles rose and burst around;
Quoth Sir Ralph, “The next who comes to the rock,
Won't bless the Abbot of Aberbrothock.”
Sir Ralph the Rover sailed away;
He scoured the seas for many a day;
And now, grown rich with plundered store,
He steers his course for Scotland's shore.
So thick a haze o'erspreads the sky,
They cannot see the sun on high;
The wind hath blown a gale all day;
At evening it hath died away.
On the deck the Rover takes his stand;
So dark it is they see no land.
Quoth Sir Ralph, “It will be lighter soon,
For there is the dawn of the rising moon."
“Canst hear,” said one, “the breaker's roar ?
For methinks we should be near the shore."
“Now where we are I cannot tell,
But I wish I could hear the Inchcape Bell."
They hear no sound; the swell is strong;

“Oh God! it is the Inchcape Rock!”
Sir Ralph the Rover tore his hair;
He cursed himself in his despair;
The waves rush in on every side;
The ship is sinking beneath the tide.

A LAY MADE ABOUT TIE YEAR OF THE CITY OCOLX.
Lars Porsena of Clusium
By the Nine Gods he swore
That the great house of Tarquin
Should suffer wrong no more.
By the Nine Gods he swore it,
And named a trysting day,
And bade his messengers ride forth,
East and west and south and north,
To summon his array.
East and west and south and north
The messengers ride fast,
And tower and town and cottage
Have heard the trumpet's blast.
Shame on the false Etruscan
Who lingers in his home
When Porsena of Clusium
Is on the march for Rome.
But by the yellow Tiber
Was tumult and allright:
From all the spacious champaign
To Rome men took their flight.
A mile around the city,
The throng stopped up the ways;
A fearful sight it was to see
Through two long nights and days
Now from the rock Tarpeian,
Could the wan burghers spy
The line of blazing villages
Red in the midnight sky.

The Fathers of the City,
They sat all night and day,
For erery hour some liorseman caine
With tidings of dismay.
They held a council standing
Before the River-gate;
Short time was there, ye well may guess,
For musing or debate.
Out spake the Consul roundly:
“The bridge must straight go down;
For, since Janiculum is lost,
Naught else can save the town.”
Just then a scout came flying,
All wild with haste and fear:
“To arms! to arms! Sir Consul;
Lars Porsena is here."
On the low hills to westward
The Consul fixed his eye,
And saw the swarthy storm of dust
Rise fast along the sky.
Fast by the royal standard,
O'erlooking all the war,
Lars Porsena of Clusium
Sat in his irory car.
By the right wheel rode Mamilius,
Prince of the Latian name;
And by the left false Sextus,
That wrought the deed of shame.
But when the face of Sextus
Was seen among the foes,
A yell that rent the firmament
From all the town arose.
On the house-tops was no woman
But spat toward him and hissed;
No child but screamed out curses,
And shook its little fist.

But the Consul's brow was sad,
And the Consul's speech was low,
And darkly looked he at the wall,
And darkly at the foe.
" Their van will be upon us
Before the bridge goes down;
And if they once may win the bridge
What hope to save the town?"
Then out spake brave Horatius,
The Captain of the gate:
“To every man upon this earth
Death cometh soon or late.
And how can man die better
Than facing fearful odds,
For the ashes of his fathers
And the temples of his Gods.
“ And for the tender mother
Who dandled him to rest,
And for the wiſe who nurses
His baby at her breast,
And for the holy maidens
Who feed the eternal flame,
To save them from false Sextus
That wrought the deed of shame?
“Hew down the bridge, Sir Consul,
With all the speed ye may;
I, with two more to help me,
Will hold the foe in play.
In yon strait path a thousand
May well be stopped by three.
Now who will stand on either hand,
And keep the bridge with me?"
Then out spake Spurius Lartius;
A Ramnian proud was he:
“Lo, I will stand at thy right hand,
And keep the bridge with thee."

And out spake strong Herminius;
Of Titian blood was he:
“I will abide on thy left side,
And keep the bridge with thee."
“ Horatius," quoth the Consul,
“As thou sayest, so let it be.'
And straight against that great array
Forth went the dauntless Three.
For Romans in Rome's quarrel
Spared neither land nor gold,
Nor son nor wiſe, nor limb nor life,
In the brave days of old.
Meanwhile the Tuscan army,
Right glorious to behold,
Came flashing back the noonday light,
Rank behind rank, like surges bright .
Of a broad sea of gold.
Four hundred trumpets sounded
A peal of warlike glee,
As that great host, with measured tread,
And spears advanced, and ensigns spread,
Rolled slowly toward the bridge's head,
Where stood the dauntless Three.
The Three stood calm and silent
And looked upon the foes,
And a great shout of laughter
From all the vanguard rose:
And forth three chiefs came spurring
Before that deep array;
To earth they sprang, their swords they drow,
And lifted high their shields, and flew
To win the narrow way;
Herminius smote down Aruns :
Lartius laid Ocnus low:
Right to the heart of Lausulus
Horatius sent a blow.

No more, aghast and pale,
From Ostia's walls the crowd shall mark
The track of thy destroying bark.
No more Campania's hinds shall fiy
To woods and carerns when they spy
Thy thrice accursed sail.”
But now no sound of laughter
Was heard among the foes.
A wild and wrathful clamor
From all the vanguard rose.
Six spears' length from the entrance
Halted that deep array,
And for a space no man came fortb
To win the narrow way.
Yet one man for one moment
Strode out before the crowd ;
Well known was he to all the Three,
And they gave him greeting loud.
“Now welcome, welcome, Sextus!
Now welcome to thy home!
Why dost thou stay, and turn away?
Lere lies the road to Rome."
But meanwhile axe and lever
Have manfully been plied,
And now the bridge hangs tottering
Above the boiling tide.
"Come back, come back, Horatius!"
Loud cried the Fathers all.
“Back, Lartius! back, Herminius!
Back, ere the ruin fall I".
Back darted Spurius Lartius;
Herminius darted back:
And, as they passed, beneath their feed
They felt the timbers crack.
But when they turned their faces,
And on the farther shore
Saw brave Horatius stand alone,
They would have crossed once more.

But with a crash like thunder
Fell every loosened beam,
And, like a dam, the mighty wreck
Lay right ath wart the stream:
And a long shout of triumph
Rose from the walls of Rome,
As to the highest turret-tops
Was splashed the yellow foam.
Alone stood brave Horatius,
But constant still in mind;
Thrice thirty thousand foes before,
And the broad flood behind.
“Down with him!” cried false Sextrs,
With a smile on his pale face.
“Noir yield thee," cried Lars Porsena,
“Now yield thee to our grace.”
Round turned he, as not deigning
Those craven ranks to see;
Naugnt spake he to Lars Porsena,
To Sextus naught spake he:
But he saw on Palatinus
The white porch of his home;
And he spake to the noble river
That rolls by the towers of Rome.
“Oh, Tiber! Father Tiber!
To whom the Romans pray,
A Roman's life, a Roman's arms,
Take thou in charge this day ! ”
So he spake, and, speaking, sheathed
The good sword by his side,
And with his harness on his back,
Plunged headlong in the tide.
No sound of joy or sorrow
Was heard from either bank;
But friends and foes in dumb surprise,
With parted lips and straining eyes,
Stood gazing where he sank;

And when above the surges
They saw his crest appear,
All Rome sent forth a rapturous cry,
And even the ranks of Tuscany
Could scarce forbear to cheer.
“ Curse on him ! " quoth false Sextus:
" Will not the villain drown?
But for this stay, ere close of day
We should have sacked the town ! ".
“Heaven help himl" quoth Lars Porsena,
“And bring him safe to shore;
For such a gallant feat of arms
Was never seen before."
And now he feels the bottom;
Now on dry earth he stands;
Now round him throng the Fathers
To press his gory hands;
And now, with shouts and clapping,
And noise of weeping loud,
He enters through the River-Gate,
Borne by the joyous crowd.
They gave him of the corn-land
That was of public right
As much as two strong oxen
Could plough from morn till might;
And they made a molten image,
And set it up on high,
And there it stands unto this day
To witness if I lie.
It stands in the Comitium,
Plain for all folk to see;
Horatius in his harness,
Halting upon one knee:
And underneath is written,
In letters all of gold,
How valiartly he kept the bridge
In the brave days of old.

And the long howling of the wolves

Athena, the Queen of the Air.
We will take the bird first. It is little more than a drift of the
air brought into form by plumes; the air is in all its quills, it
breathes thrcugh its whole frame and flesh, and glows with air in
its flying, like blown flame: it rests upon the air, subdues it, sur-
passes it, ontraces it;- is the air, conscious of itself, conquering
itself, ruling itself.
Also, into the throat of the bird is given the voice of the air.
All that in the wind itself is weak, wild, useless in sweetness, is
knit together in its song. As we may imagine the wild form of the
cloud closed into the perfect form of the bird's wings, so the wild
voice of the cloud into its ordered and commanded voice; un-
wearied, rippling through the clear heaven in its gladness, inter-
preting all intense passion through the soft spring nights, bursting
into rapture of acclaim and rapture of choir at daybreak, or lisping
and twittering among the boughs and hedges through heat of day,
like little winds that only make the cowslip bells shake, and ruffle
the petals of the wild rose.
Also, upon the plumes of the bird are put the colors of the air:
on these the golil of the cloud that cannot be gathered by any
covetousness; the rubies of the clouds, that are not the price of
Atena, but are Athena; the vermilion of the cloud-bar, and the
tame of the clo 2c-crest, and the snow of the cloud, and its shadow,
and the melted blue of the deep wells of the sky - all these, seized
by the creating spirit, and woven by Athena herself into films and
threads of plume; with wave on ware following and fading along
breast, and throat, and opened wings, infinite as the dividing of the

Toam and the sifting of the sea-sand; — even the white down of
the cloud seeming to ſlutter up between the stronger plumes, seen,
but too soft for touch.
And so the Spirit of the Air is put into, and upon, this created
form; and it becomes, through twenty centuries, the symbol of

The Veto Power.
Mr. President, I protest against the right of any chief to con.e
irto either House of Congress, and scrutinize the motives of its
members; to examine whether a measure has been passed with
promptitude or repugnance; and to pronounce upon the willing-
ness or unwillingness with which it has been adopted or rejected.
It is an interference in concerns which partakes of a domestic
nature. The official and constitutional relations between the Presi-
dent and the two Houses of Congress subsist with them as organ-
ized bodies. His action is confined to their consummated proceed-
ing3, and does not extend to measures in their incipient stages,
during their progress through the Houses, nor to the motives by
which they are actuated.
There are some parts of this message that ought to excite deep
alarm; and that especially in which the President announces that
each public officer may interpret the constitution as he pleases.
His language is, “Each public officer who takes an oath to support
the nonstitution, swears that he will support it as he understands it,
and not as it is understood by others.” “The opinion of the judges
has no more authority over Congress than the opinion of Congress
has over the judges; and on that point the President is independ-
ent of both.” Now, Mr. President, I conceive, with great defer-
enco, that the President has mistaken the purport of the oath to
support the constitution of the United States. No one swears to
support it as he understands it, but to support it simply as it is in
truth. All men are hound to obey the laws, of which the consti-
tution is the supreme; but must they obey them as they are, or as
they understand them?

EXERCISES IV ELOCUTION.
If the obligation of obedience is limited and controlied by the
measure of information; in other words, if the party is bound to
obey the constitution only as he understands it, what will be ihe
consequence? The judge of an inferior court will disobey the
mandate of a superior tribunal, because it is not in conformity to
the constitution as he understands it; a custom-house officer will
disobey a circular from the treasury department, because contrary
to the constitution as he understands it; an American minister will
disregard an instruction from the President, communicated from
the department of state, because not agreeable to the constitution
as he understands it; and a subordinate officer in the army or navy
will violate the orders of his superiors, because they are not in ac-
cordance with the constitution as he understands it.
We shall have nothing settled, nothing stable, nothing fixed.
There will be general disorder and confusion throughout every
branch of the administration, from the highest to the lowest officer
- universal nullification. For, what is the doctrine of the Presi-
dent but that of South Carolina applied throughout the Union ? The
President independent both of Congress and the Supreme Court!
Only bound to execute the laws of the one and the decisions of the
other as far as they conform to the constitution of the United
States as he understands it! Then it should be the duty of every
President, on his installation into office, carefully to examine all the
acts in the statute book, approved by his predecessors, and mark
out those which he is resolved not to execute, and to which he
means to apply this new species of veto, because they are repug-
nant to the constitution as he understands it. And, after the expira-
tion of every term of the Supreme Court, he should send for the
record of its decisions, and discriminate between those which he
will, and those which he will not, execute, because they are or are
not agreeable to the constitution as he understands it.
Mr. President, we are about to close one of the longest and most
arduong sessions of Congress under the present constitution; and
when we return among our consutuents what account of the opera-
tions of their government shall we be bound to communicate ?
We shall be compelled to say that the Supreme Court is paralyzed,
and the missionaries retained in prison in contempt of its authority
and in defiance of numerous treaties and laws of the United States;

that the exccutive, through the secretary of the Treasury, sent to
Congress a tarif bill which would have destroyed numerous
branches of our domestic industry; and, to the final destruction
of all, that the veto has been applied to the bank of the United
States, our only reliance for a sound and uniforin currency; that
the Senate has been violently attacked for the exercise of a clear
constitutional power; that the House of Representatives have been
unn:cessarily assailed; and that the President has promulgated a
rule of action for those who have taken the oath to support the
constitution of the United States, that must, if there be practical
conformity to it, introduce general nullification and end in the
absolute subversion of the government.

Marco Bozzaris.
At midnight, in his guarded tenty
The Turk was dreaming of the hour
When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent, .
Should tremble at his power:
In dreams, through camp and court, he bore
The trophies of a conqueror;
In dreams his song of triumph heard;
Then wore his monarch's signet ring:
Then pressed that monarch's throne — a king;
As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing,
As Eden's garden bird.
At midnight, in the forest shades,
Bozzaris ranged his Suliote band,
True as the steel of their tried blades,
Heroes in heart and hand.
There had the Persian's thousands stood,
There had the glad earth drunk their blood
On old Plataa's day;
And now there breathed that haunted air
The sons of sires who conquered there,
With arm to strike and soul to dare,
As quick, as far as they.

An hour passed on — the Turk awoke;
That bright dream was his last;
He woke - to hear his sentries shriek,
“ To arms! they comel the Greek! the Greek ?"
He woke - to die midst flame, and smoke,
And shout, and groan, and sabre-stroke,
And death shots falling thick and fast
As lightnings from the mountain-cloud;
And heard, with voice as trumpet loud,
Bozzaris cheer his band :
“Strike — till the last armed foe expires;
Strike - for your altars and your fires;
Strike - for the green graves of your sires,
God, and your native land I"
They fought -- like brave men, long and well;
They piled that ground with Moslem slain,
They conquered – but Bozzaris fell,
Bleeding at every vein.
His few surviving comrades saw
His smile when rang their proud burrah,
And the red field was won;
Then saw in death his eyelids close
Calmly, as to a night's repose,
Like flowers at set of sun.
Come to the bridal-chamber, Death!
Come to the mother's, when she feels,
For the first time, her first-born's breath :
Come when the blessed seals
That close the pestilence are broke,
And crowded cities wail its stroke ;
Come in consumption's ghastly form,
The earthquake shock, the ocean-storm;
Come when the heart beats high and warm,
With banqnet-song, and dance and wine:
And thou art terrible — the tear,
The groan, the knell, the pall, the bier;
And all we know, or dream, or fear
Of agony, are thine.

Come, with her laurel-leaf, blood bought -

Like torn branch from death's leafless tree
In sorrow's pomp and pageantry,

But she remembers thee as one
Long loved and for a season gone;
For thee her poet's lyre is wreathed,
Her marble wrought, her music breathed;
For thee she rings the birthday bells;

At palace-couch and cottage-bed;

Gives for thy sake a deadlier blow;

The Teetotal Mill.
Two jolly old topers sat once in an inn,
Discussing the merits of brandy and gin;
Said one to the other, “I'll tell you what, Bill,
I've been learning to-day of the Teetotal Mill.
" You must know that this comical Mill has been built
Of old broken casks, where the liquor 's been spilt;
You go up some high steps, and when at the sill,
You've a paper to sign at the Teetotal Mill.
“You promise, by signing this paper (I think),
That ale, wine and spirits you never will drink,
You give up (as they call it) such rascally swill,
And then you go into the Teetotal Mill.
" There's a wheel in this Mill that they call 'self-denial,'
They turn it a bit, just to give you a trial;
Old clothes are made new, and if you've been ill,
You are very soon cured at the Teetotal Mill."
Bill listened and wondered - at length he cried outy
“Why, Tom, if its true, what you 're telling about,
What fools we must be to be here sitting still,
Let us go and we 'll look at this Teetotal Mill."

They gazed with astonishment; there came in a man,
With excess and disease his visage was wan;
He mounted the steps, signed the pledge with good will,
And went for a turn in the Teetotal Bill.
He quickly came out, the picture of health,
And walked briskly on the highway to wealth;
And, as onward he pressed, he shouted out still,
“Success to the wheel of the Teetotal Mill."
The next that went in were a man and his wife,
For many long years they'd been living in strife;
He had beaten her shamefully, swearing he'd kill,
But his heart took a turn in the Teetotal Mill.
And when he came out how altered was he,
Steady, honest, and sober-how happy was she;
They no more contend, “No you shan't;” “Yes I will."
They were blessing together the Teetotal Mill.
Next came a rough fellow, as grim as a Turk,
To curse and to swear seemed his principal work;
He swore that that morning himself he would fill,
And drunk as he was he reeled into the Mill.
And what he saw there, I never could tell,
But his conduct was changed, and his language as well;
I saw, when he turned round the brow of the hill,
That he knelt and thanked God for the Teetotal Mill.
The poor were made rich, the weak were made strong,
The shot was made short, and the purse was made long-
These miracles puzzled both Thomas and Bill,
At length they went in for a turn in the Mill.
A little time after, I heard a great shout,
I turned round to see what the noise was about;
A flag was conveyed to the top of the hill,
And a crowd, amongst which were both Thomas and Bill
Were shouting, “Hurrah for the Teetotal Mill."

"Little Bennie."
A CORISTMAS STORY.
I had told him, Christmas morning,
As he sat upon my knee,
Holding fast his little stockings,
Stuffed as full as full can be,
And attentive listening to me,
With a face demure and mild,
That old Santa Claus, who filled them,
Did not love a naughty child.
“But we'll be good, won't we, moder,"
And from off my lap he slid,
Digging deep among the goodies
In his crimson stockings hid.
While I turned me to my table,
Where a tempting goblet stood
Brimming high with dainty custard
Sent me by a neighbor good.
But the kitten, there before me,
With his white paw, nothing loth,
Sat, by way of entertainment,
Lapping off the shining froth;
And, in not the gentlest humor
At the loss of such a treat,
I confess I rather rudely
Thrust him out into the street.
Then how Bennie's blue eyes kindled ;
Gathering up the precious store
He had busily been pouring
In his tiny pinafore,
With a generous look that shamed me
Sprang he from the carpet bright,
Showing by his mien indignant,
All a baby's sense of right.

But the door was fastened tight,
So he stood abashed and silent,
In the center of the floor,
With defeated look alternate
Bent on me and on the door.
Then, as by some sudden impulse,
Quickly ran he to the fire,
And while eagerly his bright eyes
Watched the flames grow higher and higher,
In a brave, clear key, he shouted,
Like some lordly little elf,
“Santa Kaus, come down the chimney,
Make my Mudder 'have herself.”
“I will be a good girl, Bennie,”
Said I, feeling the reproof;
And straightway recalled poor Harney,
Mewing on the gallery roof.
Soon the anger was forgotten, .
Laughter chased away the frown,
And they gamboled 'neath the live oaks,
Till the dusky night came down.
In my dim, fire-lighted chamber,
Harney purred beneath my chair,
And my playworn boy beside me
Knelt to say his evening prayer;
“God bess Fader, God bess Moder,
God bess Sister," then a pause,
And the sweet young lips devoutly
Murmured, “God bess Santa Kaus."
He is sleeping; brown and silken
Lie the lashes, long and meek,
Like caressing, clinging shadows,
On his plump and peachy cheek,

Lady Clare.
It was the time when lilies blow,
And the clouds are highest up in air,
Lord Ronald brought a lily-white doe
To give his cousin, Lady Clare.
I trow they did not part in scorn;
Lovers long betrothed were they:
They two will wed the morrow morn;
God's blessing on the day!
“He does not love me for my birth,
Nor for my lands as broad and fair;
He loves me for my own true worth,
And that is well," said Lady Clare.
In there came old Alice, the nurse,
Said, “Who was this that went from thee on
“It was my cousin," said Lady Clare,
“ To-morrow he weds with me.”
"O God be thanked!" said Alice the nurse,
“That all comes round so just and fair,
Lord Ronald is heir of all your lands,
And you are not the Lady Clare."
“ Are ye out of your mind, my nurse, my nurse ? ”
Said Lady Clare, “that ye speak so wild ?"
“ As God 's above," said Alice the nurse,
“I speak the truth; you are my child."
“ The old earl's daughter died at my breast;
I speak the truth as I live by bread;
I buried her like my own sweet child,
And put my child in her stead."

Was thy garden nipped with the midnight frost,
Or scorched with the mid-day glare ?
Were thy vincs laid low, or thy lilies crushed,
That thy face is so full of care ?
“No pleasant garden toils were mine,
I have sate on the judgment seat,
Where the Master sits at eve, and calls
The children around his feet.”

Sweetheart, who set thee there?
*T is a lonely and loſty seat for thee,
And well might fill thee with care.
“I climbed on the judgment seat myself;
I have sate there alone all day,
For it grieved me to see the children around,
Idling their liſe away.
“They wasted the Master's precious seed,
They wasted the precious hours;
They trained not the vines, nor gathered the fruit,
And they trampled the sweet meek flowers.”
And what didst thou on the judgment seat,
Sweetheart, what didst thou there?
Would the idlers heed thy childish voice ?
Did the garden mend for thy care ?
“Nay, that grieved me more; I called and I cried,
But they left me there forlorn;
My voice was weak, and they heeded not,
• Or they laughed ay words to scorn."
Ah! the judgment seat was not for thee,

Whilst thou sat on the judgment seat ?

And kept them from careless feet ?
“Nay! that is saddest of all to me,
That is saddest of all!
My vines are trailing, my roses are parched,
My lilies droop and fall.”
Go back to thy garden plot, sweetheart,
Go back till the evening falls,
And bind thy lilies, and train thy vines,
Till for thee the Master calls.
Go make thy garden fair as thou canst,
Thou workest never alone;
Perchance he whose plot is next to thine,
Will see it, and mend his own.
And the next shall copy his, sweetheart,
Till all grows fair and sweet;
And when the Master comes at eve,
Happy faces his coming will greet.
Then shall thy joy be full, sweetheart,
In thy garden so fair to see,
In the Master's voice of praise to all,
In a look of his own for thee.

Wanted, a Minister's Wife.
At length we have settled a pastor:
I am sure I cannot tell why
The people should grow so restless,
Or candidates grow so shy;
But after a two years searching
For the “smartest" man in the land,
In a fit of desperation
We took the nearest at hand.
And really, he answers nicely
To “fill up the gap," you know,
To “run the machine," and " bring up arrears,"
And make things generally go;
He has a few little failings,
His sermons are common-place quite,
But his manner is very charming,
And his teeth are perfectly white.
And so, of all the “ dear people,"
Not one in a hundred complains,
For beauty and grace of manner
Are so much better than brains.
But the parish have all concluded
He needs a partner for life,
To shine a gem in the parlor:
“ Wanted, a minister's wife ! ”
Wanted, a perfect lady,
Delicate, gentle, refined,
With every beauty of person,
And every endowment of mind;
Fitted by early culture
To move in fashionable life-
Please notice our advertisement:

Who well to her household looks;

By extravagant Irish cooks ?)

The True Teacher.
I hold the teacher's position second to none. The Christian
teacher of a band of children combines the office of the preacher
and the parent, and has more to do in shaping the mind and the
morals of the community than preacher and parent united. The
teacher who spends six hours a day with my child, spends three
times as many hours as I do, and twenty fold more time than my
pastor does. I have no words to express my sense of the import-
ance of your office.
Still less have I words to express my sense of the importance
of having that office filled by men and women of the purest motives,
the noblest enthusiasm, the finest culture, the broadest charities,
and the most devoted Christian purpose. Why, sir, a teacher
should be the strongest and inost angelic man that breathes. No
man living is intrusted with such precious material. No man living
can do so much to set human life to a noble tune. No man living
needs higher qualifications for his work. Are you "fitted for tea zh-
ing"? I do not ask you this question to discourage you, but to
stimulate you to an effort at preparation which shall continue as
long as you continue to teach.
Holland,
New Year's Eve.
Little Gretchen, little Gretchen wanders up and down the street
The snow is on her yellow hair, the frost is at her feet.
The rows of long, dark houses without look cold and damp,
By the struggling of the moonbeam, by the flicker of the lamp.
The clouds ride fast as horses, the wind is from the north,
But no one cares for Gretchen, and no one looketh forth.
Within those dark, damp houses are merry faces bright,
And happy hearts are watching out the old year's latest night.

With the little box of matches she could not sell all day,
And the tliin, thin tattered mantle the wind blows every way,
She clingeth to the railing, she shivers in the gloom, —
There are parents sitting snugly by firelight in the room;
And children with grave faces are whispering one another
Of presents for the new year, for father or for mother.
But no one talks to Gretchen, and no one hears her speak,
No breath of little whispers conies warmly to her cheek.
No little arms are round her: ah me! that there should be,
With so much happiness on earth, so much of misery !
Sure they of many blessings should scatter blessings round,
As laden bouglis in autumn fling their ripe fruits to the grouna.
And the best love man can offer to the God of love, be sure,
Is kindness to his little ones, and bounty to his poor.
Little Gretchen, little Gretchen goes coldly on her way;
There's no one looked out on her, there's ro one bids her stay.
Her home is cold and desolate; no smile, no food, no fire,
But children clamorous for bread, and an impatient sire.
So she sits down in an angle where two great houses meet,
And she curled up beneath her, for warmth, her little feet;
And she looketh on the cold wall, and on the colder sky,
Anil wonders if the little stars are bright fires up in high.
She hears a clock strike slowly, up in a far church tower,
With such a sad and solemn tone, telling the midnight hour.
And she remembered her of tales her mother used to tell,
And of the cradle-songs she sang, when summer's twilight fell;
Of good men and of angels, and of the Holy Child,
Who was cradled in a manger, when winter was most wild;
Who was poor, and cold, and hungry, and desolate and lone;
And she thought the song had told he was ever with his own;
And all the poor and hungry and forsaken ones are his, –
" How good of Him to look o: me in such a place as this ? "
Colder it grows and colder, but she does not feel it now,
For the pressure at her heart, and the weight upon her brow;
But she struck one little match on the wall so cold and bare,
That she might look around her, and see if He were there

The single match has kindled, and by the light it threw
It seemed to little Gretchen the wall was rent in two;
And she could see folks seated at a table richly spread,
With heaps of goodly viands, red wine and pleasant bread
She could smell the fragrant savor, she could hear what they did
say,
Then all was darkness once again, the match had burned away.
Sl:e struck another hastily, and now she seemed to see
Tithin the same warm chamber a glorious Christmas tree.
The branches were all laden with things that children prize,
Bright giſts for boy and maiden - she saw them with her eyes.
And she almost seemed to touch them, and to join the welconie
shout,
When darkness fell around her, for the little match was out.
Another, yet another, she has tried — they will not light;
Till all her little store she took, and struck with all her might:
And the whole miserable place was lighted with the glare,
And she dreamed there stvod a little child before her in the air.
There were blood-drops on his forehead, a spear-wound in his side,
And cruel nail-prints in his feet, and in his hands spread wide;
And he looked upon her gently, and she felt that he had known
Pain, hunger, cold, and sorrow -- ay, equal to her own.
And he pointed to the laden board and to the Christmas tree,
Then up to the cold sky, and said, “Will Gretchen come with me?"
The poor child felt her pulses fail, she felt her eyeballs swim,
And a ringing sound was in her ears, like her dead mother's hymn :
And she folded both her thin white hands, and turned from that
bright board,
And from the golden giſts, and said, “With thee, with thee, O Lord?”
The chilly winter morning breaks up in the dull skies
On the city wrapt in vapor, on the spot where Gretchen lies.
In her scant and tattered garment, with her back against the wall,
She sitteth cold and rigid, she answers to no call.
They have liſted her up fearfully, they shuddered as they said,
“It was a bitter, bitter night! the child is frozen dead.”

The angels sang their greeting for one more redeemed from sin;
Men said, “It was a bitter night; would no one let her in ? "

Gabriel Grub.
In an old abbey town, down in this part of the country, a long,
iong while ago — there officiated as sexton and grare-digger one
Gabriel Grub.
A little before twilight one Christmas ere, Gabriel shouldered his
spade, lighted his lantern, and betook himself towards the old
churchyard, for he had got a grare to finish by next morning; and
feeling very low, he thought it might raise his spirits perliaps, if he
went on with his work at once. As he wended his way up the
ancient strect, he saw the cheerful light of the blazing fires gleam
through the old casements, and heard the loud laugh and the cheer-
ful shouts of those who were assembled around tliem; he marked
the bustling preparations for next day's good cheer, and smelt the
numerous savory odors consequent thereupon, as they steamed up
from the kitchen windows in clouels. All this was gall and worm-
wood to the heart of Gabriel Grub; and as groups of children
bounded out of the houses, tripped across the road, and were met,
before they could knock at the opposite door, by half a dozen curly-
headed little rascals, who crowded round them as they flocked up
stairs to spend the evening in their Christmas games, Gabriel smiled
grimly, and clutched the handle of his spade with a firmer grasp, as
he thought of measles, scarlet-ferer, thrush, whooping-cough, and
a good many other sources of consolation beside.
Ir. tliis happy frame of mind, Gabriel strode along, returning a
shori, sullen growl to the good-humoured greetings of such of his
neighbors as now and then passed him, until he turned into the
dark lane which led to the churchyard. Now he had been looking
forward to reaching the dark lane, because it was, generally speak-
ing, a nice gloomy, mournful place, and he was not a little indignant
to hear a young urchin roaring out some jolly song about a merry
Christmas in this very sanctuary. So Gabriel waited till the bov

came up, and then dodged him into a corner, and rapped him over
the head with his lantern five or six times, just to teach him to
modulate his voice. And as the boy hurried away with his hand
to liis head singing quite a different sort of tune, Gabriel Grub
chuckled very heartily to himself, and entered the churchyard, lock-
ing the door behind him.
He took off his coat, set down his lantern, and getting into the
unfinished grave, worked at it for an hour or so, with right good-
will. But the earth was hardened with the frost, and it was no
very easy matter to break it up, and shovel it out; and although
there was a moon, it was a very young one, and shed little light
upon the grave, which was in the shadow of the church. At any
other time these obstacles would have made Gabriel Grub very
moody and miserable, but he was so well pleased with having
stopped the small boy's singing, that he took little heed of the scanty
progress he had made, and looked down into the grave when he had
finished work for the night with grim satisfaction, murmuring, as he
gathered up his things-
“Brave lodgings for one, brave lodgings for one,
A few feet of cold earth when life is done.
“Ho! hol” laughed Gabriel Grub, as he sat himself down on a
flat tombstone, which was a favorite resting-place of his, and drew
forth his wicker bottle; "a coflin at Christmas — a Christmas box.
Ho! ho! ho!”
“Hol hol hol” repeated a voice, which sounded close behind
him.
Gabriel paused in some alarm, in the act of raising the wicker
bottle to his lips, and looked round. The bottom of the oldest
grave about him was not more still and quiet than the churchyard
in the pale moonlight. The frost glistened on the tombstones, and
sparkled like rows of gems among the stone carvings of the cld
church. Not the faintest rustle broke the profound tranquillity of
we solemn scene. Sound itself appeared to be frozen up, - all was
so cold and still.
“It was the echoes," said Gabriel Grub, raising the bottle to his
lips again.
“It was not,” said a deep voice.

Gabriel started up, and stood rooted to the spot, with astonish-
ment and terror; for his eyes rested on a form which made his
blood run cold.
Seated on an upright tombstone, close to him, was a strange un-
earthly figure, whom Gabriel felt at once was no being of this world.
His long fantastic legs which might have reached the ground, were
cocked up, and crossed after a quaint fantastic fashion; his sinewy
arms were bare, and his hands rested on his knees. On his short
round body he wore a close covering, ornamented with small slashes;
and a short cloak dangled on his back; the collar was cut into curi-
ous peaks, which served the goblin in lieu of ruff or neckerchief;
and his shoes curled up at the toes into long points. On his head
he wore a broad-brimmed sigar-loaf hat, garnished with a single
feather. The hat was covered with the white frost, and the goblin
looked as if he had sat on the same tombstone very comfortably for
two or three hundred years. He was sitting perfectly still; his
tongue was put out, as if in derision; and he was grinning at
Gabriel Grub with such a grin as only a goblin could call up.
" It was not the echoes," said the goblin.
Gabriel Grub was paralyzed, and could make no reply.
“What do you do here on Christmas eve ?” said the goblin
sternly.
“I came to dig a grave, sir,” stammered Gabriel Grub.
“What man wanders among graves and churchyards, on such a
night as this ?” said the goblin.
“Gabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub!” screamed a wild chorus of voices
that seemed to fill the churchyard. Gabriel looked fearfully round-
nothing was to be seen.
“What have you got in that bottle?" said the goblin.
"Hollands, sir,” replied the sexton, trembling more than ever;
for he had bought it of the smugglers, and he thought that perhaps
his questioner might be in the excise department of the goblins.
“Who drinks Hollands in a churchyard, on such a night as this?"
said tl.e goblin.
“Gabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub!” exclaimed the wild voices again.
The goblin leered maliciously at the terrified sexton; and then,
raising his voice, exclaimed –
“And who, then, is our fair and lawful prize?”


## p. 324 (#348) ############################################

EXERCISES IN ELOCUTION.
To this inquiry, the invisible chorus replied, - in a strain chat
sounded like the voices of many choristers singing to the mighty
swell of the old church organ - a strain that seemed borne to the
sexton's ears upon a gentle wind, and to die away as its soft breath
passed onward; but the burden of the reply was still the same, -
“Gabriel Grub! Gabriel Grub!”.
The goblin grinned a broader grin than before, as he said, “ Well,
Gatriel, what do you say to this?"
The sexton gasped for breath. .
" It's — it's — very curious, sir, very curious, and very pretty;
but I think I'll go back and finish my work, sir, if you please.”
“Work!” said the gollin, “what work ?"
“ The grave, sir: making the grave," staminered the sexton.
“Oh, the grave, eh?” said the goblin : "who makes graves at a
time when all other men are merry, and takes a pleasure in it ?"
Again the mysterious voices replied, “Gabriel Grub! Gabriel
Grub!”
" I'm afraid my friends want you, Gabriel," " I'm afraid my friends
want you."
“ Under faror, sir,” “I don't think they can, sir; they don't
know me, sir; I don't think the gentlemen liave ever seen me, sir."
“Oh, yes they have.” “We know the man with the sulky face
and the grim scowl that came down the street to-night, throwing
his evil looks at the children, and grasping his burying-spade the
tighter. We know the man that struck the boy, in the envious
malice of his heart, because the boy could be merry, and he could
not. We know him - we know him."
“I-I- am afraid I must leave you, sir."
“Leave us!”-“Gabriel Grub going to leave us.. Ho! ho! ho!"
As the goblin laughed, the sexton observed for one instant a
brilliant illumination within the windows of the church, as if the
whole building were lighted up; it disappeared, the organ pealed
forth a lively air, and whole troops of goblins, the very counterpart
of the first one, poured into the churchyard, and began playing ai
leap-frog with the tombstones, never stopping for an instant to take
Creath, but overing the highest among them, one after the other,
with the most marvelous dexterity. The first goblin was a most
estonishing leaper, and none of the others could come near him

EXERCISES IN ELOCUTION.

Even in the extremity of his terror, the sexton could not help ob-
serving, that while his friends were content to leap orer the com-
mon-sized gravestones, the first one took the family-vaults, iron
railings and all, with as much ease as if they had been so many
street posts.
At last, the game reached to a most exciting pitch; the organ
played quicker and quicker, and the goblins leaped faster and faster,
coiling themselves up, rolling liead over heels upon the ground, ani
bounding over the tombstones like foot-balls. The sexton's brain
vzhirled round with the rapidity of the motion he beheld, and his
legs reeled beneath him, as the spirits flew before his eyes, when
the goblir. king, suddenly darted towards him, laid liis hand upon
his collar, and sank with him through the eartlı.
When Gabriel Grub had had time to fetch his breath, which the
rapidity of his descent had, for the moment, taken away, he found
himseli in what appeared to be a large cavern, surrounded on all
sides by crowds of goblins, ugly and grim. In the centre of the
room, on an clevated seat, was stationed his friend of the church-
yard; and close beside him, stood Gabriel Grub himself, without
the power of motion.
“ Cold, to-night,” said the king of the goblins, — “very cold,
A glass of something warm, here."
At this command, half a dozen officious goblins, with a perpetual
smile upon their faces, whom Gabriel Grub imagined to be courtiers,
on that account, hastily disappeared, and presently returned with a
goblet of liquid fire, which they presented to the king.
“Ah!" said the goblin, whose cheeks and throat were quite
transparent, as he tossed down the flame," this warms one indeed;
bring a bumper of the same for Mr. Grub."
It was in vain for the unfortunate sexton to protest that he was
not in the habit of taking anything warm at night; for one of the
goblins held him, while another poured the blazing liquid down his
throat; and the whole assembly screeched with laughter, as he
coughed and choked, and wiped away the tears which gushed plen-
tifully from his eyes, after swallowing the burning draugint.
“And now,” said the king, fantastically poking the taper corner
of his sugar-loaf hat into the sexton's eye, and thereby occasioning
him the most exquisite pain, — “And now, show the man of mis-
ery and gloom a few of the pictures from our own great storehouse."

As the goblin said this, a thick cloud, which obscured the finther
end of the cavern, rolled gradually away, and disclosed, apparently
at a great distance, a small and scantily-furnished, but neat and
clean apartment. A crowd of little children were gathered round
a bright fire, clinging to their mother's gown, and gamboling round
her chair. The mother occasionally rose, and drew aside the win-
dow-curtain, as if to look for scme expected object. A frugal meal
was ready spread upon the table, and an elbow-chair was placed
near the fire. A knock was heard at the door; the mother opened
it, and the children crowded round her, and clapped their hands fo:
joy, as their father entered. He was wet and weary, and shook
the snow from his garments, as the children crowded round him,
and, seizing his cloak, hat, stick and gloves, with busy zeal, ran
with them from the room. Then, as he sat down to his meal before
the fire, the children climbed about his knee, and the mother sat by
his side, and all seemed happiness and comfort.
But a change came upon the view, almost imperceptibly. The
scene was altered to a small bedroom, where the fairest and young-
est child lay dying; the roses had fled from his cheek, and the light
from his eye; and even as the sexton looked upon him, with an
interest he had never felt or known before, he died. His young
brothers and sisters crowded round his little bed, and seized his
tiny hand, so cold and heavy; but they shrank back from its touch,
and looked with awe on his infant face; for calm and tranquil as it
was, and sleeping in rest and peace, as the beautiful child seemed to
be, they saw that he was dead, and they knew that he was an
angel, looking down upon them, and blessing them, from a bright
and happy heaven.
Again the light cloud passed across the picture, and again the
subiect changed. The father and mother were old and helpless
now, and the number of those about them was diminished more
than half; but content and cheerfulness sat on every face, and
beamed in every eye, as they crowded round the fireside, and told
and listened to old stories of earlier and bygone days. Slowly and
peacefully the father sank into the grave, and, soon after, the sharer
of all his cares and troubles followed him to a place of rest and
peace. The few who yet survived then knelt by their tomb, and
watered the green turf which covered it with their tears; then rose,

327
and turned away, sadly and mournfully, but not with bitter cries,
or despairing lamentations, for they knew that they should one day
meet again; and once more they mixed with the busy world, and
their content and cheerfulness were restored. The cloud settled
upon the picture, and concealed it from the sexton's view.
“What do you think of that ? ” said the goblin, turning his large
face toward Gabriel Grub.
Gabriel murmured out something about its being very pretty,
and looked somewhat ashamed, as the goblin bent his fiery eyes
upon him.
“ You a miserable man!” said the goblin, in a tone of excessivo
contempt. "You!" He appeared disposed to add more but in-
dignation choked his utterance; so he lifted up one of his very
pliabile legs, and, Aourishing it above his head a little, to insure his
aim, adıninistered a good sound kick to Gabriel Grub; immediately
after which, all the goblins-in-waiting crowded round the wretched
sexton, and kicked him without mercy, according to the established
and invariable custom of courtiers upon earth, who kick whom roy-
alty kicks, and hug whom royalty hugs.
"Show him some more,” said the king of the goblins.
At these words the cloud was again dispelled, and a rich and
beautiful landscape was disclosed to view. The sun shone from out
the clear blue sky, the water sparkled beneath his rays, and the
trees looked greener, and the flowers more gay, beneath his cheer-
ful influence. The water rippled on, with a pleasant sound, the trees
rustled in the light wind that murmured among their leaves, the
birds sang upon the boughs, and the lark caroled on high her wel-
come to the morning. Yes, it was morning, the bright, balmy
morning of summer; the minutest leaf, the smallest blade of grass,
was instinct with life. Man walked forth, elated with the scene;
and all was brightness and splendor.
“ You a miserable man!” said the king of the goblins, in a more
contemptuous tone than beföre. And again the king of the goblins
gave his leg a flourish; again it descended on the shoulders of the
sexton; and again the attendant goblins imitated the example of
their chief.
Dlany a time the cloud went and came, and many a lesson it
taught to Gabriel Grub, who, although his shoulders smarted with

pain from the frequent applications of the goblin's feet thereunto,
looked on with an interest which nothing could diminish. He saw
that men who worked hard, and earned their scanty bread with
lives of labor, were cheerful and happy; and that to the most igno-
rant, the sweet face of nature was a nerer-ſailing source of cheerful-
ness and joy. Above all, he saw that men like himself, who snarled
at the mirth and cheerfulness of others, were the foulest weeds on
the fair surface of the earth; and, setting all the good of the world
against the evil, he came to the conclusion that it was a very decen
and respectable sort of a world after all. No sooner had he formed
it, than the cloud which had closed over the last picture, seemed to
settle on his senses, and lull him to repose. One by one the gob-
lins faded from his sight, and as the last one disappeared, he sank
to sleep.
The day had broken when Gabriel Grub awoke, and found him-
self lying at full length on the flat gravestone in the churchyard,
with the wicker bottle lying empty by his side, and his coat, spade,
and lantern, well whitened by the last night's frost, scattered on the
ground. The stone on which he had first seen the goblin seated,
stood bolt upright before him, and the grave at which he had worked
the niglit before, was not far off. At first he began to doubt the
reality of his adventures; but the acute pain in his shoulders, when
he attempted to rise, assured him that the kicking of the goblins
was certainly not ideal. IIc was staggered again, by observing no
traces of footsteps in the snow on which the goblins had played at
leap.frog with the gravestones; but he speedily accounted for this
circumstance when he remembered that, being spirits, they would
leave no visible impression behind them. So Gabriel Grub got on
his feet as well as he could for the pain in his back; and brushing
the frost off his coat, put it on, and turned his face toward the town.
But he was an altered man, and he could not bear the thought
of returning to a place where his repentance would be scoffed at,
and liis reformation disbelieved. He hesitated for a few moments;
and then turned away to wander where he might, and seek luis
bread elsewhere.
The lantern, the spade and the wicker bottle, were found that
day in the churchyard. There were a great many speculations about
the sexton's fate at first, but it was speedily determined that he had

329
been carried away by the goblins; and there were not wanting
some very credible witnesses who had distinctly seen him whisked
through the air on the back of a chestnut horse blind of one cye,
with the hind quarters of a lion, and the tail of a bear. At length
all this was devoutly believed; and the new sexton used to exhibit
to the curious for a triſling emolument, a good-sized piece of the
church weathercock which had been accidently kicked off by the
aforesaid horse in his ærial flight, and picked up by himself in
the churchyard, a year or two afterward.
Unfortunately these stories were somewhat disturbed by the un
looked-for reappearance of Gabriel Grub himself, some ten years
afterward, a ragged, contented, rheumatic old man. He told his
story to the clergyman, and also to the mayor: and in course of
time it began to be received as a matter of history, in which form
it has continued down to this very day. The believers in the
weathercock tale, having misplaced their confidence once, were not
easily prerailed upon to part with it again, so they looked as wise
as they could, shrugged their shoulders, touched their foreheads,
and murmured something about Gabriel Grub's having drunk all
the Hollands, and then fallen asleep on the flat tombstone; and they
affected to explain what he supposed he had witnessed in the gob-
lin's carern, by saying he had seen the world and grown wiser.
But this opinion, which was by no means a popular one at any
time, gradually died off; and be the matter how it may, as Gabriel
Grub was allicted with rheumatism to the end of his days, this
story has at least one moral, if it teach no better one — and that is,
that if a man turns sulky and drinks at Christmas time, he may
make up his mind to be not a bit the better for it, let the spirits be
ever so good, or let them be even as many degrees beyond proof,
as those which Gabriel Grub saw in the goblin's cavern.

Dora.
With farmer Allan at the farm abode
William and Dora. William was his son,
And she his niece. He often looked at them,
And often thought, “I'll make them man and wife."

EXERCISES IN ELOCUTION.
Now Dora felt her uncle's will in all,
And yearned toward William; but the youth, becauso
He had been always with her in the house,
Thought not of Dora.
Then there came a day
When Allan called his son, and said, “My son,
I married late, but I would wish to see
My grandchild on my knees before I die;
And I have set my heart upon a match.
Now, therefore, look to Dora; she is well
To look to; thrifty too beyond her age.
She is my brother's daughter; he and I
Had once hard words, and parted, and he died
In foreign lands; but for his sake I bred
His daughter Dora : take her for your wife;
For I have wished this marriage, night and day,
For many years."
But William answered short:
“I cannot marry Dora; by my life,
I will not marry Dora." Then the old man
Was wroth, and doubled up his hands, and said :
“ You will not, boy ! you dare to answer thus!
But in my time a father's word was law,
And so it shall be now for me. Look to 't;
Consider, William : take a month to think,
And let me have an answer to my wish;
Or, by the Lord that made me, you shall pack,
And never more darken my doors again !"
But William answered madly ; bit his lips,
And broke away. The more he looked at her,
The less he liked her; and his ways were harsh ;
But Dora bore them meekly. Then before
The month was out, he left his father's house,
And hired himself to work within the fields ;
And half in love, half spite, he wooed and wed
A laborer's danghter, Mary Morrison.

331
Then, when the bells were ringing, Allan called
His niece and said: “My girl, I love you well;
But if you speak with him that was my son,
Or change a word with her he calls his wife,
My home is none of yours. My will is law.”
And Dora promised, being meek. She thought,
" It can not be; my uncle's mind will change !”
And days went on, and there was born a boy
To William ; then distresses came on him;
And day by day he passed his father's gate,
Heart-broken, and his father helped him not.
But Dora stored what little she could save,
And sent it to them by stealth, nor did they know
Who sent it; till at last a fever seized
On William, and in harvest time he died.
Then Dora went to Mary. Mary sat
And looked with tears upon her boy, and thought
Hard things of Dora. Dora came and said:
“I have obeyed iny uncle until now,
And I have sinned, for it was all through me
This eril came on William at the first.
But, Mary, for the sake of him that is gone,
And for your sake, the woman that he chose,
And for this orphan, I am come to you.
You know there has not been for these five years
So full a harvest: let me take the boy,
And I will set himn in my uncle's eye
Among the wheat; that when his heart is glad
Of the full harvest, he may see the boy,
And bless him for the sake of him that 's gone."
And Dora took the child, and went her way
Across the wheat, and sat upon a mound
That was unsown, where many poppies grew.
Far off the farmer came into the field
And spied her not; for none of all his men
Dare tell him Dora waited with the child;
And Dora would have risen and gone to him,
But her heart failed her; and the reapers reaped,
And the sun fell, and all the land was dark.

But when the morrow caine, she rose and took
The child once more, and sat upon the mound;
And made a little wreath of all the flowers
That grew about, and tied it on his hat
To make him pleasing in her uncle's eye.
Then, when the farmer passed into the field,
Ile spied her, and he left his men at work,
And came and said, “Where were you yesterday?
Whose child is that? What are you doing here?'
So Dora cast her eyes upon the ground,
And answered softly, “This is William's child I”
“And did I not,” said Allan, “did I not
Forbid you, Dora ?” Dora said again :
“Do with me as you will, but take the child
And bless him for the sake of him that is gone!”
And Allan said, “I see it is a trick
Got up betwixt you and the woman there.
I must be taught my duty, and by you!
You knew my word was law, and yet you dared
To slight it. Well, – for I will take the boy;
But go you hence, and never see me more.”
So saying, he took the boy, that cried aloud
And struggled hard. The wreath of flowers fell
At Dora's ſect. She bowed upon her hands,
And the boy's cry came to her from the field,
More and more distant. She bowed down her head,
Remembering the day when first she came,
And all the things that had been. She bowed down
And wept in secret; and the reapers reaped,
And the sun fell, and all the land was dark.
Then Dora went to Mary's house, and stood
Upon the threshold. Mary saw the boy
Was not with Dora. She broke out in praise
To God, that helped her in her widowhood.
And Dora said, "My uncle took the boy;
But, Mary, let me live and work with you;
He says that he will never see me more."

333
Then answered Mary, " This shall never be,
That thou shouldst take my trouble on thyself;
And, now, I think, he shall not have the boy,
For he will teach him harshness, and to slight
IIis mother; therefore thou and I will go,
And I will have my boy, and bring him home;
And I will beg of him to take thee back;
But if he will not take thee back again,
Then thou and I will live within one house,
And work for William's child until he grows
Of age to help us.'
So the women kissed
Each other, and set out and reached the farm.
The door was off the latch; they peeped, and saw
The boy set up betwixt his grandsire's knees,
Who thrust hiin in the hollows of his arın,
And clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks,
Like one that loved him; and the lad stretched out
And babbled for the golden seal that liung
From Allan's watch and sparkled by the fire.
Then they came in; but when the boy behield
Ilis mother, he cried out to come to her;
And Allan sat him down, and Mary said:
“O father ! — if you let me call you so, -
I nerer came a-begging for myself,
Or William, or this child; but now I come
For Dora : take her back ; she loves you well.
O, sir! when William dicd, he died at peace
With all men; for I asked him, and he said,
lle could not ever rue his marrying me, -
I had been a patient wiſe: but, sir, he said
That he was wrong to cross his father thus;
"God bless him l' he said, "and may he never know
The troubles I have gone through!' Then he turned
His face and passed, — unhapry that I am!
But now, sir, let me have my boy, for you
Will make him hard, and he will learn to slight
His father's memory; and take Dora back,
And let all this be as it was before."

So Mary said, and Dora hid her face
By Mary. There was silence in the room;
And all at once the old man burst in sobs: -
“I have been to blame - to blame! I have killed my son!
I have killed him, — but I loved him, — my dear son!
May God forgive me! — I have been to blame.
Kiss me, my children 1"
Then they clung about
The old man's neck, and kissed him many times.
And all the man was broken with remorse ;
And all his love came back a hundred-fold;
And for three hours he sobbed o'er William's child,
Thinking of William. — So those four abode
Within one house together; and as years
Went forward, Mary took another mate;
But Dora lived unmarried till her death.

Revelations of Wall-street.
It proved to be a night of adventure.
I had four avenues to traverse, and the storm coming from the
north-east, drove violentiy in my teeth. I buttoned my overcoat
about my ears, settled my hat close over my face, and presenting
my head coinbatively to the tempest, I pushed on. I had in this
way crossed from the Eighth to the Sixth Avenue, scarcely con-
scious of the progress made, when I struck against an object in the
middle of the side-walk, and was saluted by the exclamation:
" Stop !”
Whatever alarm I experienced was immediately dissipated when
I raised my head and got sight of the person who stood in my
way. It was a girl, bare-headed, without cloak or shawl; perhaps
sixteen years old.
Before I could question her, she exclaimed: 'Mother is dying.
Won't you come, quick?'
Without a word being said, for she hurried me on too rapidly for
conversation, I foilowed down the avenue to the next street, and
turning into it, went perhaps half a block, when my companion
entered a two-story wooden house, and ran rapidly up the stairs to

the front-room. Here on a bed lay a woman moaning and gasping
and exhibiting symptoms resembling epilepsy.
"Do n't be frightened,' I said, 'your mother is not dying - is not
going to die.'
-'Are you sure of that?' said the girl.
Soinething in the sound of her voice strange and startling — a
masculine vigor, coupled with an extraordinary maturity, caused me
to turn and regard her. Large black eyes were fixed on me with
a firm but unsatisfied look, as if they would say: ‘Do not amuse
mne: I am no child. Tell me the truth.'
To these imaginary observations, rather than to the direct ques
tion, I replied: 'I repeat, your mother is not dying, but evidently
has had a fit of some kind. Is she subject ty such attacks ?'
"No!'
She looked at me almost defiantly.
I was at a loss what to say or do when I was relieved by hearing
the poor woman, who had regained her consciousness, exclaim,
Matilda.'
Matilda, with entire composure, went to the bed-side of her
mother, who asked what was the matter.
I replied that I believed she had been taken suddenly ill, and her
daughter in alarm ran out for aid and met me. And now that I
am here,' I continued, 'I shall be happy if I can do any thing to
relieve you.'
'Give the gentleman a chair, my daughter,' said the sick woman,
for although I had shaken the snow from my hat and coat, I was
still standing.
The daughter obeyed, and I sat down. Meanwhile I had glanced
about the room and taken a closer look at its inmates. The appear-
ance was that of biting poverty without squalidness or misery. The
girl was very handsome and well formed, but exhibited in her de-
meanor no softness - inileed, little that was feminine. When I sat
down, she seated herself at the window and looked out on the
storm. There was something in the expression of her face which
brought back some old association, but what I could not tell. The
mother was evidently a lady and possessed of natural refinement
and delicacy. She explained to me that she had been very closely
at work all day with the needle, and as she was getting into bed
15

she had been seized in a most alarming manner, and was for :0
time insensible. When she recovered she saw me standing over
her.
It was the old tale of destitution, hard work, and a final break-
ing down of a naturally strony constitution. Yes, the familiar
story, so much so that the novel-reader who has persevered thus
far, in the belief that some extraordinary incident would yet turn
ip, will exclaim: 'Pshawl how very stale and common-place this
accting a girl in the street and being conducted up a pair of stairs
to a sick-room, and so-forth and so forth.' To be sure, all this is
very common — would it were otherwise, but God permits one class
of his creatures to fare sumptuously erery day, while another class
starves, and the mystery of this we may not undertake to fathom.
The poor lady seemed so nearly recovered that there was nothing
to be done for her. I asked if I could render ber any assistance,
and if she was suffering from any pressing want. She said she was
not, and regretted that I should be taken out of my way.
There was no reason why I siould stay longer, yet I felt irresis-
tibly impelled to speak to the young girl, who maintained her seat
by the window, looking lisedly out of it. I rose to depart. Then
I said, turning to her:
"You see I was right, your mother will be quite well by morning.'
She assented by a nod.
* Where were you going when I met you ?' I asked.
'I thought mother was dying, and I started to find somebody to
come to her. I did not daré stay to see her die.' And she looked
again with that expression which had touched me, and which called
up a strange feeling, like the meniory of a half-forgotten drcam.
'I think I must call and see you to-morrow,' I said to the lady,
'for we are in the midst of a heavy storm. I reside not far frora
here, and I shall see if I can't be of some use to you. Pray, may I
inquire your name?'
Mrs. Ilitchcock.'
• And your husband ?
‘Has been dead for a long time.'
'He was —
'A physician; Dr. Ralph Hitchcock.'

'Yes.'
'Who resided in Cincinnati, and died there?
The same.
'And you are Ralph Hitchcock's widow?'
"I am.
And this young person?'
'Ilis daughter. The o:ly surviving of five children.'
The room swam round. Frank Hitchcock, my class-mate, my
zoom-mate in college, my. beloved friend, my cherished correspond-
ent, so long as he lived, cut off in the flower of his life; while
already acquiring fame, and laying the foundation for a grand suc.
cess, death had snatched him away.
I stood oppressed with these thoughts, not speaking, not moving
Mrs. Hitchcock lay waiting calmly for some explanation. She had
been too long schooled by trcuble to become easily excited. Not
so the daughter; she rose from her chair, came into the middle of
the rooin, and burst into a liysterical sobbing, which was so violent
that it alarmed me. I had made no explanation, but my questions
showed I was well acquainted with the one whose decease had
caused such a revolution in their fortunes.
After a short pause, I said: 'My dear lady, I knew your husband
well: more than that, we were the best of friends. It is now late;
you are just recovering from this sudden attack. I shall be sure to
see you to-morrow. God bless you both!' And I came away.
Desperate as my own affairs had been, here were circumstances
much more discouraging. Reader, if you yourself are unfortunately
borne down by the weight of what seems a calanıitous destiny, cast
about for some more amicted, and take on you the office of aid and
adviser. Assume a part of their burdens, it will help to lighten your
own. You will be surprised what strength you will gain beside
It is so. For thus marvelously has God established the paradiux

The Romance and the Reality of the Law.
Among the learud or liberal professions, the one that oftcnest
tempts and dazzles the youthful mind is that of the law.
This fact has its reason, and is susceptible of explanation.
The profession of the law is venerable for its antiquity, rich in
the illustrious names which adorn its history, and unequaled for the
aggregate of talent and eloquence which have in all ages character-
ized its leading members.
Far back in the din vista of the past, the fancy of the legal en-
thusiast may behold the commanding form of the inspired Cicero,
liis toga falling gracefully about him, his eye glowing with pathetic
emotion, as he stands there on the Roman ſorum pleading the cause
of his early friend and tutor, the poet Archius.
It must be with no small degree of pride that the advocate thus
traces his professional lineage back to the greatest orator of ancient
times.
There is a kind of ancestral congratulation that he, too, like
Cicero, is empowered to use his country's laws, when occasion re-
quires, to defend the innocent and relieve the oppressed.
Then again there is romance connected with the practice of the
law. Should every lawyer of long experience keep a journal,
wherein he might detail the stories of all his clients, their strange
grievances, their complicated affairs, and confidential disclosures, it
would form a book only surpassed for variety and novelty by the
famous “ Arabian Nights.'
The amount of heart-history with which he becomes acquainted
seems strangely in contrast with the lack of sentiment for which
his character is so generally noted. He becomes familiar with
domestic difficulties, disappointed affections, atrocious crimes, and
daring schemes; and finds out more of the inner life of humanity
than can be discovered from any other stand-point in society. His
council-room is a kind of secular confessional, where clients reveal
reluctant secrets, and tell of private wrongs. To hin, what the
world is accustomed to regard as fiction, constitutes the common.
place fart of his legal practice.
But in our country the more seductive phrase of the law is this.
It has ever been the natural avenue to political preferment and judi.
cial honors. Hence it is that young men of fine abilities and am-

bitious of distinction, so frequently choose this profession as the
proper field whereon to meet the high endeavor and the glad suc-
cess.' And perhaps it is sometimes a misfortune that such a reason
decides them rather than a sense of any peculiar fitness for the call-
ing which they so hastily espouse. But of that hereafter.
Lawyers, as a class, are, or were, much respected and revered,
exerting as they do a very controlling influence over society and
affairs. I know full well that novels and plays abound in a certain
stereotyped character called an attorney, who is made to do all the
dirty work of the plot or story. He is represented usually as a
cadaverous-looking individual, with a swinish propensity to thrust
his nose into every one's business, who is willing to damn his
soul for a fee, and whose heart is devoid of all sympathy for
suffering or distress. The worst of all these human fiends is Uriah
Heep, wliose freckled, hairy hand, with its cold clammy touch, so
often makes the reader shudder as he turns the pages of David
Copperfield. Then there is Oily Gammon, who figures in Ten
Thousand a Year,' and whose qualities are very plainly suggested
by his name. And among the more recent types of this character,
we have the Marks' of Harriet Beecher Stowe, who, when asked
to do a small favor, or to perform a common act of politeness with-
out the tender of a fee, rolls out his eyes in wonderment, and to
explain his refusal drawls out: ‘Oh! I'm a lawyer l' The muses
too have conspired against these poor, persecuted fellows; and there
is extant a little poem, called 'Law versus Saw,' in which a very
invidious comparison is sought to be made between a lawyer and
that small operator in the lumber business commonly known as a
sawyer. In usefulness and dignity the poet confers the palm on the
vocation of the latter. The last verse sums up the whole matte).
thus
• This conclusion then I draw,
That no exercise of jaw,
Twisting India-rubber law,
Is as good
As the exercise of paw
On the handle of a saw,
Sawing wood.'
But these pictures of law-attorneys, found so frequently in light
literature, furnish the unknowing with a very erroneous estimate of
the average character of the legal profession. These seeming caric-
atures have had, and still have, originals in fact, but they are as

Grannie's Trust.
Dear Grannie is with us no longer;
IIer hair, that was white as the snow
Was parted one morning forever,
On her head lying soſt and low;
Her hands left the Bible wide open,
To tell us the road she had trod,
With waymarks like footsteps to tell us
The path she had gone up to God.
No wonderful learning had Grannie;
She knew not the path of the stars,
Nor aught of the comet's wide cycle,
lor of Nebula's dim cloudy bars;
But she knew how the wise inen adoring,
Saw a star in the East long ago;
She knew how the first Christmas anthema
Came down to the shepherds below.
She had her own test, I remember,
For the people whoe'er they might be.
When we spoke of the strangers about us
But lately come over the sea;
Of “Laura,” and “ Lizzie," and "Jamie,”
And stately old “Essellby Oakes,"
She listened and whispered it softly,
“My dear, are these friends meetin'-folks ?"
When our John went away to the city
With patrons, whom all the world knew
To be sober and honest great merchants,
For Grannie this all would not do;

Till she pulled at John's sleere in the twilight,
To be certain, before he had gone;
And lie smiled as lie heard the old question,
“Are you sure they are meetin'-folks, John ?'
When Minnie came home from the city,
And leſt heart and happiness there,
! saw her close kneeling by Grannie,
With her dear wrinkled hands on her hair;
And amid thc low sobs of the maiden,
Came softly the tremulous tone,
“He wasn't like meetin'-folks, Minnie;
Dear child, you are better alone."
And now from the corner we miss her,
And hear that reminder no more;
But still, unforgotten, the echo
Comes back from that far-away shore;
Till Sophistry slinks in the corner,
Though Charity sweet has her due,
Yet we feel, if we want to meet Grannie,
'Twere best to be meetin' -folks too.

Dead I did you say ? hel dead in his prime 1
Son of my mother! my brother l my friend 1
While the hurologue points to the noon of his time,
Has his sun set in darkness? is all at an end ?

Dead I it is not, it cannot, it must not be true!
Let me read the dire words for myself, if I can;
Relentless, hard, cold, they rise on my view -
They blind me l how did you say that they ran?

And the breath of June roses comes in at the pane,
Nothing — nothing is changed by those terrible words,
They cannot be true ! let me see them again;

Scathing my heart as it falls at my feet!

The Swan's Nest.
Little Ellie sits alone
Mid the beeches of a meadow,
By a stream-gide, on the grass;
And the trees are showering down
Doubles of their leaves in shadow,
On her shining hair and face.
She has thrown her bonnet by;
And her feet she has been dipping
· In the shallow water's flow; -
Now she holds them nakedly
In her hands, all sleek and dripping,
While she rocketh to and fro.
Little Ellie sits alone;
And the smile she softly uses,
Fills the silence like a speech;
While she thinks what shall be done, -
And the sweetest pleasure chooses,
For her future within her reach.
Little Ellie in her smile
Chooseth –“I will have a lover,
Riding on a steed of steeds!
He shall love me without guile;
And to him I will discover
The swan's nest among the reeds.

" And the steed shall be red-roan,
And the lover shall be noble,
With an eye that takes the breath;
And the lute he plays upon
Shall strike ladies into trouble,
As his sword strikes men to death.
“And the steed it shall be shod
All in silver, housed in azure,
And the mane shall swim the wind :
And the hooſs along the sod
Shall flash onward and keep measure,
Till the shepherds look behind.
But my lover will not prize
All the glory that he rides in,
When he gazes in my face.
He will say, 'O Lore, thine eyes
Build the shrine my soul abides in;
And I kneel here for thy grace.'
“Then, ay I then he shall kucel low,
With the red-roan steed anear him,
Which shall seem to understand
Till I answer, ‘Rise and gol
For the world must love and fear him
Whom I gift with heart and hand.'
“Then he will arise so pale,
I shall feel my own lips tremble
With a yes I must not say -
Nathless maiden brave, “Farewell,'
I will utter and dissemble --
‘Light to-morrow with to-day.'
“ Then he 'll ride among the hills
To the wide world past the river,
There to put away all wrong:
To make straight distorted wille
And to empty the broad quiver
Which the wicked bear along.

“ Three times shall a young foot-page
Swim the stream and climb the mountain
And kneel down beside my feet —
‘Lo! my master sends this gage,
Larly, for thy pity's counting!
What wilt thou exchange for it?'
“And the first time I will send
A white rosebud for a guerdon -
And the second time a glove:
But the third time — I may bend
From my pride, and answer — 'Pardon . .

“ Then the young foot-page will run -
Then my lover will ride faster,
Till he kuceleth at my knee:

But, O Love, I love but thee!

Then; and lead me as a lover,
Through the crowds that praise his deeds :
And, when soul-tied by one troth,
Unto him I will discover

Little Ellie, with her smile
Not yet en led, rose up gayly,
Tied the bonnet, donned the shoe -
And went homeward, round a mile,
Just to see, as she did daily,
What more eggs were with the two.
Pushing through the elm-tree copso
Winding by the stream, light-hearted,
Where the ozier pathway leads —
Past the bouglis she stoops — and stops!
Lol the wild swan had deserted, --
And a rat had gnawed the reeds.

The Main Truck, or a Leap for Life.
Old Ironsides at anclior lay,
In the harbor of Mahon ;
A dead calm rested or the bay,
The waves to sleep had gone;
When little IIal, the captain's son,
A lad both brare and good,
In sport, up shroud and rigging ran,
And on the main-truck stood!
A shudder shot through every vein,
All cyes were turned on high !
There stood the boy, with dizzy brain,
Between the sea and sky;
No hold had lie above, below,
Alone he stood in air;
To that far height none dared to go;
No aid could reach him there.
We gazed, — but not a man could speak!
With horror all aghast,
In groups, with pallid brow and cheek,
We watched the quivering mast.
The atmosphere grew thick and hot,
And of a lurid hue;
As riveted unto the spot,
Stood officers and crew.
The father came on deck, - he gasped,
“Oh God! thy will be done!”.
Then suddenly a rifle grasped,
And aimed it at his son ;

He sunk, — he rose, — he lived, - he moved,
And for the ship struck out;
On board, we hailed the lad beloved,
With many a manly shout.
His father drew, in silent joy,
Those wet arms round his neck, -
Then folded to his heart his boy,
And fainted on the deck.

"The earth is well enough, I s'pose,' said Dolly. "I never looked

'None of that, now,' said that lady; "such airs won't go dowo

Rose thought this was the only light in which she was likely to
view the relationship; but she was too wise to reply.
"There's no knowing,' said Dolly 'what you may have learned
among those children at the asylum.'

‘May I go to the evening-school ?' asked Rose. “It is a free-

Well, you are not free to go, if it is; you know how to read
and write, and I have taught you how to make change pretty well-
that is all you need for my purposes.'
• But I should like to learn other things, Aunt Dolly.'
"What other things, I'd like to know? That's your mother all
over. She never was content without a book at the end of her
nose. She could n't have earned her living to have saved her life,
if she had n't got married.'
'It was partly to earn my living I wanted to learn, Aunt Dolly:
perhaps I could be a teacher.'
*Too grand to trim caps and bonnets, like your Aunt Dolly, I

The rich men despots, and the poor banditti; -
Sloth in the mart, and schism within the temple;
Brawls festering to Rebellion; and weak Laws
Rotting away with rust in antique sheaths -

Of the old feudal and decrepid carcase,
Civilization on her luminous wings
Soars, – phanix-like, to Jove! — What was my art?
Genius, sume say, -some Fortune, Witchcraft, some.

Lowliest in France, I would not so have wrong'd her,
As bid her link rich life and virgin hope
With one, the deathman's gripe might, from her side,
Pluck at the nuptial altar.

Yet since she knows not of thy love, renounce her;
Take life and fortune with another! — Silent ?

How bless'd a thing it was in my dark hour
To nurse the one sweet thought you bid me banish.
Love hath no need of words; - nor less within

On unsuspected virtue; and the flower

A Scotch Lady of the Old School.
As soon as she recognized Mr. Douglas, she welcomed him with
much cordiality, shook him long and heartily by the hand, patted
him on the back, looked into his face with much seeming satisfac-
tion; and, in short, gave all the demonstration of gladness usual
with gentlewomen of a certain age. Her pleasure, however,
appeared to be rather an impromptu than a habitual feeling; for, as
the surprise wore off, her visage resumed its harsh and sarcastic
expression, and she seemed eager to efface any agreeable impres-
sion her reception might have excited.
“And whia thought o' seein' ye enoo ? " said she, in a quick,
gabbling voice; “what's brought you to the toon? Are you come
to spend your honest faither's siller ere he's weel cauld in his grave,

Mr. Douglas explained that it was on account of his niece's
health.
“Health !” repeated she, with a sardonic smile, “it wad make
an ool laugh to hear the wark that 's made aboot yonng fowk's
health noo-a-days. I wonder what ye 're a' made o'," grasping
Mary's arm in her great bony hand - "a wheen puir feckless

ner and appearance had excited, joined most heartily in the laugh.

“Changes! — weel a wat I sometimes wonder if it's the same

“But with these changes you must also have seen many improve-
ments ?" said Mary in a tone of diffidence.
“Impruvments ?” turning sharply round upon her; "what ken

tinue the conversation by some observation on the prevailing man-

"Mainers!” repeated she, with a contemptuous laugh ; "what

Here a long pinch of snuff caused a pause in the old lady's
harangue. * *

Mr. Douglas availed himself of the opportunity to rise and take leave.
“Oo, what's takin ye awa', Archie, in sic a hurry? Sit doon
there," laying her hand upon his arm, "an' rest ye, an' tak a glass o'

She had now shuffled along to the farther end of the room, and
opening a press, took out wine and a plateful of various-shaped
articles of bread, which she handed to Mary.
“Hae, bairn — tak a cookie — tak it up — what are you feared

worth the sendin': poor dry fushinless dirt, no worth the chowin';
weel a wat I begrudged my teeth on 't. Your muirlowl war nay
that ill, but they 're no worth the carryin'; they 're doug cheap i'
the market eroo, so it 's nae great compliment. Gin ye had
brought me a leg o' gude mutton, or a cauler sawmont, there would
hae been some sense in 't; but ye're ane o' the fowk that 'll ne 'er

cost ye, an' I'se warran' yo 're thinkin' mair o' your ain diversion
than o'my stamick whan ye 're at the shootin' o' them puir beasts.”
Mr. Douglas had borne the various indignities levelled against
himself and his family with a philosophy that had no parallel in his
life before, but to this attack upon his game he was not proof. His
color rose, his eyes flashed fire, and something resembling an oath
burst from his lips, and he strode indignantly toward the door.
His friend, however, was too nimble for him. She stepped
before him, and, breaking into a discordant laugh as she patted him
on the back: “So I see ye 're just the auld man, Archie - aye
ready to tak the strums an' ye dinna get a' thing your ain wye.
Many a time I had to feech ye oot o' the dorts when ye was a

Archie."
Mr. Douglas still looked as if he was irresolute whether to laugh
or be angry.
“Come, come, sit ye doon there till I speak to this bairn," said
she, as she pulled Mary into an adjoining bedchamber, which wore
the same aspect of chilly neatness as the one they had quitted.
Then pulling a huge bunch of keys from her pocket, she opened a
drawer, out of which she took a pair of diamond ear-rings.“ Hac

Break ! Break! Break!
Break, break, break,
On thy cold gray stones, 0 Seal
And I would that my tongue could utter
The thoughts that arise in me.
( well for the fisherman's boy,
That he shouts with his sister at play!
O well for the sailor lad,
That he sings in his boat on the bay !
And the stately ships go on
To their haven under the hill;
But O for the touch of a vanish'd hand,
And the sound of a voice that is still.
Break, break, break,
At the foot of thy crags, O Sea!
But the tender grace of a day that is dead
Will never come back to me.

What is Life?
And what is life ? An hour-glass on the run,
A mist retreating from the morning sun,
A busy, bustling, still-repeated dream.
Its length ? A minute's pause, a moment's thought
And Happiness? A bubble on the stream,
That in the act of seizing shrinks to nought.

And what is Hope ? The puffing gale of morn,
That robs each floweret of its gem – and dies;
A cobweb, hiding disappointment's thorn,
Which stings more keenly through the thin disguise.
And what is Death? Is still the cause unfound ?
That dark mysterious name of horrid sound ?
A long and lingering sleep the weary crave.
And Peace? Where can its bappiness abound ?
Nowhere at all, save heaven and the grave.
Then what is life? When stripped of its disguise ?
A thing to be desired it cannot be;
Since everything that meets our ſoolish eyes
Gives proof sufficient of its vanity.
'Tis but a trial all must undergo,
To teach unthankful mortal how to prize
That happiness vain man's denied to know,
Until he's called to claim it in the skies. John Clare.
Remarks on Reading.
“Reading is to the mind," said the Duke of Vivonne to Louis
XIV, “what your partridges are to my chops.” It is, in fact, the
nourishment of the mind; for by reading we know our Creator, his
works, ourselves chiefly, and our fellow-creatures. But this nour-
ishment is easily converted into poison. Salmasius had read as
much as Grotius, perhaps more; but their different modes of read-
ing made the one an enlightened philosopher, and the other, to
speak plainly, a pedant, puffed up with a useless erudition.
Let us read with method, and propose to ourselves an end to
which ail our studies may point. Through neglect of this rule,
gross ignorance often disgraces great readers; who, by skipping
hastily and irregularly from one subject to another, render thcni-
selves incapable of combining their ideas. So many detached par-
cels of knowledge cannot form a whole. This inconsistency weakens
the energies of the mind, creates in it a dislike to application, and
even robs it of the advantages of natural good sense.
Yet let 113 avoid the contrary extreme, and respect method, with.
out rendering ourselves its slaves. While we propose an end in our
reading, let not this end be too remote; and when once we have

375
attained it, let our attention be directed to a different subject. In-
constancy weakens the understanding; a long and exclusive appli-
cation to a single object hardens and contracts it. Our ideas no
longer change easily into a different channel, and the course of read-
ing to which we have too long accustomed ourselves is the only
one that we can pursue with pleasure.
We ought, besides, to be careful not to make the order of our
thoughts subservient to that of our subjects; this would be to sacri-
fice the principle to the accessory. The use of our reading is to aid
as in thinking. The perusal of a particular work gives birth, per-
haps, to ideas unconnected with the subject of which it treats. I
wish to pursue these ideas; they withdraw me from my pro-
posed plan of reading, and throw me into a new track, and from
thence, perhaps, into a second and a third. At length I begin to
perceive whither my researches tend. Their result, perhaps, may
be profitable; it is worth while to try; whereas, had I followed the
high road, I should not have been able, at the end of my long jour-
ney, to retrace the progress of my thoughts.
This plan of reading is not applicable to our early studies, since
the severest method is scarcely sufficient to make us conceive objects
altogether new. Neither can it be adopted by those who read in
order to write, and who ought to dwell on their subject till they
have sounded its depths. These reflections, however, I do not
absolutely warrant. On the supposition that they are just, they
may be so, perhaps, for myself only. The constitution of minds
differs like that of bodies; the same regimen will not suit all. Each
individual ought to study his own.
To read with attention, exactly to define the expressions of our
author, never to admit a conclusion without comprehending its rea-
son, often to pause, reflect, and interrogate ourselves, these are so
many advices which it is easy to give, but difficult to follow. The
game may be said of that almost evangelical maxim of forgetting
friends, country, religion, of giving merit its due praise, and embrar-
ing truth wherever it is to be found.
But what ought we to read ? Each individual must answer this
question for hiinself, agreeably to the object of his studies. The
only general precept that I would venture to give, is that of Pliny,
"to read much. rather than many things; ” to make a careful
selection of the best works, and to render them familiar to us by
attentive and repeated perusals.
Gibbon.

Appius. Well, Claudius, are the forces
At hand ?
Claudius. They are, and timely, too; the people
Are in unwonted ferment.

The treasures of her beauty, nor avert it

Is silence my opponent? Fit opponent
To plead a cause too foul for speech! What brow
Shameless gives front to this most valiant cause,
That tries its prowess 'gainst the honor of
A girl, yet lacks the wit to know, that he
Who casts off shame, should likewise cast off fear -
And on the verge o' the combat wants the nerve
To stammer forth the signal ?
App. You had better,
Virginius, wear another kind of carriage;
This is not of the fashion that will serve you.
Vir. The fashion, Appius! Appius Claudius tell me
The fashion it becomes a man to speak in,
Whose property in his own child — the offspring
Of his own body, near to him as is
IIis hand, his arm — yea, nearer — closer far,
Knit to his heart - I say, who has his property
In such a thing, the very self of himself,

But not your soul. I see it through your eye
Shifting and shrinking — turning every way
· To shun me. You surprise me, that your eye,
So long the bully of its master, knows not
To put a proper face upon a lie,
But gives the port of impudence to falsehood
When it would pass it off for truth. Your soul
Dares as soon shew its face to me. Go on,
I had forgot; the fashion of my speech
May not please Appius Claudius.
Claud. I demand
Protection of the Decemvir!

The evidence is good, unless confronted
By better evidence. Look you to that,
Virginius. I shall take the woman's cath.
Virginia. Icilius!
Icilius. Fear not, love; a thousand oaths
Will answer her.

And that you sold her to Virginius' wife,

And dear society, may be allowed
A little time for parting. Let me take

James Sheridan Knowles
From the Dodge Club: or, Italy in MDCCOLIX.
La Cica did not speak the best English in the world; yet that
could not account for all the singular remarks which she made.
Still less could it account for the tender interest of her manner. She
had remarkably bright eyes. Why wandered those eyes so often
to his, and why did they beam with such devotion — beaming for
moment only to fall in sweet innocent confusion ? La Cica had the
most fascinating manners, yet they were often perplexing to the
Senator's soul.
“ The Countess," he thought, " is a most remarkable fine woman;
but she does use her eyes uncommon, and I do wish she wouldn't
be quite so demonstrative."


## p. 383 (#407) ############################################

383
At last the Senator came to this conclusion : La Cica was des-
perately in love with him.
She appeared to be a widow. Now if the poor Cica was hope-
lessly in love, it must be stopped at once. For he was a married
man, and his good lady still lived, with a very large family, most
of the members of which had grown up.
La Cica ought to know this. She ought indeed. But let the
knowledge be given delicately, not abruptly.
On the following evening they walked on the balcony of La Cica's
noble residence. She was sentimental, devoted, charming.
The conversation of a fascinating woman does not look so well
when reported as it is when uttered. Her power is in her tone, her
glance, her manner. Who can catch the evanescent beauty of her
expression or the deep tenderness of her well-modulated voice?
Who indeed ?
“Does ze scene please you, my Senator ?"
“Very much indeed."
“Youar countrymen haf tol me zey would like to stay here
alloway."
“ It is a beautiful place."
“Did you aiver see any thin moaire loafely ?" And the Countess
looked full in his face.
“Never,” said the Senator, earnestly. The next instant he
blushed. He had been betrayed into a compliment.
The Countess sighed.
“Helas! my Senator, that it is not pairmitted to moartals to
sociate as zey would laike."
“"Your Senator,'” thonght the gentlemen thus addressed; "how
'fond, how tender — poor thing! poor thing !"
“I wish that Italy was nearer to the States," said he.
“How I adamiar youar style of mind, so differente from ze Itali-
ana. . You are so stong - 80 nobile. Yet would I laike to see moar
of ze poetic in you."
“I always loved poetry, warm," said the Senator, desperately.
“Ah-good-nais-eccelente. I am plees at zat," cried the
Countess, with much animation. “You would loafe it more eef
you knew Italiano. Your langua ees not sufficiente musicale for
poatry."

"It is not so soft a language as the I-talian.”
“Ah-no—not so soft. Very well. And what theenka you of
ze Italiano ?"
"The sweetest language I ever heard in all my born days."
“Ah, now — you hev not heard much of ze Italiano, my Senator.'
“I hare heard you speak often," said the Senator, naively.
“Ah, you compliment! I sot you was aboore flattera."
And the Countess playfully tapped his arm with her little fan.
“What Ingelis poet do you loafe best?"
“Poet? English poet ?" said the Senator, with some surprise.
"Oh - why, marin, I think Watts is about the best of the lot!"
" Watt? Was he a poet? I did not know zat. He who in.
vented ze stim-injaine? And yet if he was a poet it is natura e
zat you loafe him best."
“Steam-engine? Oh no! This one was a minister."
“A meeneestaire? Ah! an abbe? I know him not. Yet I
ha? read mos of all youar poets.”
“He made up hymns, marm, and psalms— for instance: Watts
Divine Hymns and Spiritual Songs.'"
“Songs ? Spiriiuelle? Ali, I mus at once procuaire ze works
of Watt, which was favorit poet of my Senator."
“A lady of such intelligence as you would like the poet Watts,"
said the Senator, firmly. “He is the best known by far of all our
poets."
“What? better zan Shakespeare, Milton, Bairon? You mucn
surprass me.”
“Better known and better lored than the whole lot. Why, his
poetry is known by heart through all England and America."
“Merciful learen! what you tell me! ees eet possibl! An yet
he is not known here efen by name. It would please me moocla,
my Senator, to haire you make one quotatione. Know you Watt?
Tell me some words of his which I may remembaire."
“I have a shocking bad memory.”
“Bad memora! Oh, but you remember somethin, zis most
beautiful charm nait - you haf a nobile soul — you must be axeola
by beauty — by ze ideal. Make for me one quotatione."
And she rested her little land on the Senator's arm, and looko.
up imploringly in his face.

The Senator looked foolish. He felt even more so. Here was a
beautiful woman, by act and look showing a tender interest in him.
Perplexing — but very flattering after all. So he replied:
“You will not let me refuse you any thing."
“Ahal you are vera willin to refuse. It is difficulty for ine to
excitare youar regards. You are fill with the grands ideas. But
ccme — will you spik for me som from your favorit Watt ? ”
“Well, if you wish it so much," said the Senator, kindly, and lie
besitated.
"Ah-I do wish it so much !"
“Ehem!”
“Begin," said the Countess. “Behold me. I listen. I hear
cverysin, and will remember it forava."
The only thing that the Senator could think of was the verse
which had been running in his head for the last few days, its
measured rhymth keeping time with every occupation:
"My willing soul would stay -'"
“Stop one moment," said the Countess. “I weesh to learn it
ti'oin you;” and she looked fondly and teuderly up, but instantly
dropped her eyes.
"Ma willina sol wooda sta —'"
“In such a frame as this,'” prompted the Senator.
"Een socha framas zees.' Wait — “Ma willina sol wooda sta
in socha frarnas zees.' Ah, appropriat! but could I hope zat you
were true to zose lines, my Senator ? Well?”
"And sit and sing herself away,'” said the Senator, in a falter-
ing roice, and breaking out into a cold perspiration for fear of
committing himself by such uncommonly strong language.
"" Ansit ansin hassaf awai,'” repeated the Courtess, her face
lighting up with a sweetly conscious expression.
The Senator paused.
“I - ehem! I forget."
“Forget ? Impossible!'
“I do really."
“Al now! Forget? I see by your face --- you desave. Say
on."
The Countess again gently touched his arm with both her little
hands, and held it as though she would clasp it

“ Have you fear ? An, cruell"
The Senator turned pale, but finding reſusal impossible, boldly
änished:
“ • To everlasting bliss' – there!"
"" To affarlastin blees thar.' Stop. I repeat it all: “My willina
sol wooda sta in socha frame as zees, ansit ansin hassaf awai to
alarlastin blees thar.' Am I right?"
“Yes," said the Senator meekly.
“I knew you were a poetic sola," said the Countess, confidingly.
'You air honesto — true — you cannot desare. When you spik I
can beliv you. Ah, my Senator, an you can spik zis poetry! — at

sione! Ah! what do you mean? Santissima madre! how I wish

The Countess drew nearer to him, but her approach only deep-
ened his perplexity.
“ IIow that poor thing does lore me!" sighed the Senator.
“ Law bless it! she can't help it - can't help it nohow. She is
a goner; and what can I do? I 'll have to leave Florence.”
The Countess was standing close beside him in a tender mood
waiting for him to break the silence. How could he? De had
been uttering words which sounded to her like love; and she — "a
widow, a widowl wretched man that I am!”
There was a pause. The longer it lasted the more awkward the
Senator felt. What upon earth was he to do or say? What
business had he to go and quote poetry to widows? What an old
ſool he must be! But the Countess was very far from feeling
awkward. Assuming an elegant attitude she looked up, her face
expressing the tenderest solicitude.
“What ails my Senator ? "
“Why the fact is, marm – I feel sad — at leaving Florence. I
aust go shortly. My wife has written summoning me home. The
children are down with the measles,"
Oh, base fabrication! Oh, false Senator! There wasn't a word
of truth in that last remark. You spoke so because you wished

La Cica changed neither her attitude nor her expression. Evi.
dently the existence of his wife, and the melancholy situation of
his unfortunate children, awaked no sympathy.
“But my Senator — did you not say you wooda seeng yousellef
away to affarlasteen belees?”.
“Oh, marm, it was a quotation — only a quotation."
But at this critical juncture the conversation was broken up by
the arrival of a number of ladies and gentlemen.
But could the Senator have known!
Could he have known how and where those words would con.
front him again!
"Do you know La Cica ?" asked the General, with the air of a
man who was putting a home-thrust, and speaking with uncoinmon
fierceness.
“I do," said the Senator, mildly.
“You know her well ? You are one of her intimate friends ?"
“Am I?"
“Are you.not ?"
“I am friendly with her. She is an estimable woman, with much
feeling and penetration" — and a fond regret exhibited itself in the
face of the speaker.
"Well, Sir, you may as well confess. We know you, Sir. We
know you. You are one of the chosen associates of that infamous
Garibaldian plotter and assassin, whose hotel is in the hot-bed of
conspiracy and revolution. We know you. Do you dare to come
here and deny it?"
“I did not come here; I was brought. I do not deny that you
know me, though I haven't the pleasure of knowing you. But I do
deny that I am the associate of conspirators."
“Are you not the American whom La Cica so particularly distiu
guished with her favor ?"
“I have reason to believe that she was partial to me-somewhat."
“He confesses !" said the General. “You came from her to this
place, cominunicating on the way with her emissaries."
"I communicated on the way with none but brigands among the
mountains. If they were her emissaries I wish her joy of them.
My means of communication," said the Senator, while a grim smile

some deep impression on them, I do believe.”
“Teil ine now — and tell me truly,” said the General after a pause,
in which he seemed trying to make out whether the Senator wat
joking or not. “To whom are you sent in this city ?”
"To no one."
“Sir! ( warn you that I will not be trified with."
“ I tell you,” said the Senator, with no apparent excitement, “I
tell you that I have come here to no one. What more can I say i'
“You must confess."
“I have nothing to confess."
“Sir! you have much to confess," cried the General, angrily,
" and I will wring it out of you. Beware how you trifle with my
patience. If you wish to regain your liberty confess at once, and
you may escape your just punishment. But if you reſuse, I'll shui
you up in a dungeon for ten years!"
"You will do no such thing."
“Wat !” roared the General. “Won't I ?"
“You will not. On the contrary, you will have to make apolo-
gies for these insults."
“I!— Apologies! Insults."
The General gnawed his mustache, and his eyes blazed in fury.
“You have arrested us on a false charge, based on some slander-
ous or stupid information of some of your infernal spies," said the
Senator. “What right have you to pry into the private affairs of
an American traveler? We hare nothing to do with you."
“You are associated with conspirators. You are charged with
treasonable correspondence with rebels. You countenanced revolu-
tion in Florence. You openly took part with Republicans. You
are a notorious friend of La Cica. And you came here with the
intention of ſomenting treason in Venice!"
“Whoever told you that," replied the Senator, “told miserablo
lies -- most horrid lies. I am no emissary of any party. I am a
private traveler."
"Sir, we have correspondents in Florence on whom we can rely
better than on you. They watched you."
“Then the best thing you can do is to dismiss those correspond.

“Sir, I tell you that they watched you well. You had better
confess all. Your antecedents in Florence are known. You are in
a position of imminent danger. I tell you — beware!!"
The Gencral said this in an awful voice, which was meant to
strike terror into the soul of his captive. The Senator looked back
into his eyes with an expression of calm scorn. His form seemed
to grow larger, and his eyes dilated as he spoke:
“Then you, General, I tell you-beware! Do you know who
you've got hold of?- No conspirator; no contemptible Italian ban.
dit, or Dutchman either; but an American citizen. Your Government
has already tried the temper of Americans on one or two remarkable
occasions. Don't try it on a third tiine, and don't try it on with
me. Since you want to know who I am, I'll tell you. I, Sir, am
an American Senator. I take an active and prominent part in the
government of that great and glorious country. I represent a con-
stituency of several hundred thousand Ycu tell me to beware. I
tell you — BEWARE! for, if you don't let me go, you'll have to give
me up at the cannon's mouth. If you don't let me off by evening
I won't go at all till I am delivered up with humble and ample
apologies, both to us and to our country, whom you have insulted
in our persons."
“Sir, you are bold !”
“ Bulil Send for the American Consul of this city and see if he
don't corroborate this. But you had better nake haste, for if you
subject me to furtlier disgrace it will be the worse for your Govern-
ment, and particularly for you, my friend. You'll have the town
battered down about your ears. Don't get another nation down on
you, and above all, don't let that nation be the American. What I
tell you is the solemn truth, and if you don't mind it you will know
it some day to your sorrow."
Whatever the cause may have been the company present, includ.
ing even the General, were impressed by the Senator's words. The
announcement of his dignity; the venerable title of Senator; th
mention of his “constituency," a word the more formidable froin
not being at all understood — all combined to fill them with respect
and even awe.
So at his proposal to send for the American Consul the General
gave orders to a messenger who went off at once in search of that
functionary.

The American Consul soon made his appearance. Upon entering
the hall he cast a rapid look around, and seemed surprised at so
august a tribunal, for in the General's martial form he saw no less a
person than the Austrian Commandant.
The Consul bowed and then looked at the prisoners. As his eye
ſell upon the Senator it lighted up, and his face assumed an expres-
sion of the most friendly interest. Evidently a recognition. The
Austrian Commandant addressed the Consul cirectly in German.
“ Do you know the prisoners ?":
“I know one of them.”
“He is here under a very heavy accnisation. I have well sub-
stantiated charges by which he is implicated in treason and con-
spiracy. He has been connected with Revolutionists of the worst
stamp in Florence, and there is strong proof that he has come here
to communicate with Revolutionists in this city."
“Who accuses him of this? Are they here?”
“No, but they have written from Florence warning me of his
journey here."
“Does the prisoner confess ?"
“Of course not. He denies. He requested me to send for you.
I don't want to be unjust, so if you have anything to say, say on.”
“These charges are impossible.”
“Impossible ?"
“He is altogether a different man from what you suppose. He
is an eminent member of the American Senate. Any charges made
against one like him will have to be well substantiated; and any
injury done to him will be dangerous in the highest degree. Unless
you have undeniable proofs of his guilt it will be best to free him at
once - or else ".
“Or else what ?”
"Or else there will be very grave complications."
The Commandant looked doubtful. The others impassive. But-
tons and Dick interested. The Senator calm. Again the Com-
mandant turned to the Senator, his remarks being interpreted as
before.
“How does it happen that you were so particularly intimate with
all the Revolutionists in Florence, and an habitue of La Cica's salon?
that your mission was well known throughout the city? that you

391
publicly acknowledged the Florentine rebellion in a speech? that
the people carried you home in triumph ? and that immediately
before leaving you received private instructions from La Cica ?”
“To your questions," said the Senator, with unabated dignity,
"I will reply in brief: First, I am a free and independent citizen
of the great and glorious American Republic. If I associated with
Revolutionists in Florence, I did so because I ain accustomed to
choose my own society, and not to recognize any law or any mag-
ter that can forbid my doing so. I deny, lowever, that I was in
any way connected with plots, rebellions or conspiracies. Secondly,
I was friendly with the Countess because I considered her a most
reinarkably fine woman, and because she showed a disposition to
be frienilly with me — a stranger in a strange land. Thirdly, I
have no mission of any kind whatever. I am a traveler for self-
improrement. I have no business, political or commercial. So
that my mission could not have been known. If people talked
about me they talked nonsense. Fourthly, I confess I made a
speech, but what of that? It's not the first time, by a long chalk.
I don't know what you mean by acknowledging.' As a private
citizen I congratulated them on their success, and would do so
again. If a crowd calls on me for a speech, I'm there. The people
of Florence dragged me liome in a carriage. Well, I don't know
why they did so. I can't help it if people will take possession of
me and pull me about. Fifthiy, and lastly, I had an interview with
the Countess, had I? Well, is it wrong for a man to bid good-bye
to a friend ? I ask yon, what upon earth do you mean by such a
charge as that? Do you take me for a puling infant ?".
"On that occasion," said the Commandant, she taught you some
mysterious words which were to be repeated among the Revolu-
tionists here."
“Never did any thing of the kind. That's a complete full-blown
Ection."
“I have the very words."
“That's impossible. You've got hold of the wrong man I sce.'
"I will have them read," said the General solemnly.
And he beckoned to the Interpreter. Whereupon the Interpreter
gravely took out a formidable roll of papers from his breast, and
opened it. Every gesture was made as if his hand was heavy with
the weight of crushing proof. At last a paper was produced. The

Interpreter took one look at the prisoner, then glanced treniphantly
at the Consul, and said:
"It is a mysterious language with no apparent meaning, nor
have I been able to find the key to it in any way. It is very skill-
fully made, for all the usual tests of cipher writing ſail in this. The
person who procurel it did not get near enough till the latter part
of the interview, so that he gained no explanation whatever from
the conversation."
“Read,” said the Commandant. The Senator waited, wonder.
ingly. The interpreter read :
“Ma ouillina sola ouda ste ensoce fremas dis ansit ansin assalf a oru
tu affa lastinna belis."
Scarcely had the first words been uttered in the Italian voice of
the reader than the Senator started as though a shot had struck
him. Ilis face flushed. Finally a broad grin spread itself over h.s
countenance, and down his neck, and over his chest, and over his
form, and into his boots, till at last his whole colossal frame shook
with an earthquake of laughter.
The Commandant stared and looked uneasy. All looked at the
Senator - all with amazement -- the General, the Interpreter, the
Officials, the Guards, Buttons, Dick and the American Consul.
"Oh dear! Oh de-ar ! Oh DEE-ar!" cried the Senator, in the
intervals of his outrageous peals of laughter. “OHI" and a new
peal followed
Wbat did all this mean? Was he crazy? Had misfortunes
turned his brain ?
But at last the Senator, who was always remarkable for his self.
control, recovered himself. He asked the Commandant if he might
be permitted to explain.
“Certainly,” said the Commandant, dolefully. He was afraid
that the thing would take a ridiculous turn, and nothing is so terri-
ble as that to an Austrian official.
“ Will you allow me to look at the paper ?" asked the Senator.
“I will not injure it at all."
The Interpreter politely carried it to him as the Commandant
nodded. The Senator beckoned to the Consul. They then walked
up to the Commandant. All four looked at the paper.
“You see, gentlemen," said the Senator, drawing a lead pencil
from his pocket, “the Florence correspondent has been too sharp

I can explain all this at once. I was with the Countess, and we
got talking of poetry. Now, I don't know any more about poetry
than a horse."
“ Well ?"
"Well, she insisted on my making a quotation. I had to gire in.
The only one I could think of was a line or two from Watts."
“J'atts ? Ah! I don't know him," said the interpreter.
“IIe was a minister — a parson."
"Ah!"
“So I said it to her, and she repeated it. These friends of yours,
General, have taken it down, but their spellin' is a little unusual,”
said the Senator, with a tremendous grin that threatened a new
outburst.
“Look. Here is the true key which this gentleman tried so hard
to find.”
And taking his pencil the Senator wrote under the strange words
the true meaning:
“My willing soul would stay
In such a frame as this,
And sit and sing herself away
To everlasting bliss."
The interpreter saw it all. He looked profoundly foolish. The
whole thing was clear. The Senator's innocence was plain. He
turned to explain to the Commandant. The Consul's face exhibited
a variety of expressions, over which a broad grimace finally pre-
dominated, like sunshine over an April sky. In a few words the
whole was made plain to the Commandant. He looked annoyed,
glared angrily at the Interpreter, tossed the papers on the floor and
rose to his feet.
“Give these gentlemen our apologies,” said he to the Interpreter.
“In times of trouble, when States have to be held subject to mar.
tial law, proceedings are abrupt. Their own good sense, will. I
trust, enable them to appreciate the difficulty of our position."

Pictures of Swiss Scenery and of the City of Venice.
It was in Switzerland that I first felt how constantly to contem.
plate sublime creation develops the poetic power. It was here that
I first began to study nature. Those forests of black gigantic pines
rising out of the deep snows; those tall white cataracts, leaping like
headstrong youth into the world, and dashing from their precipices,
as if allured by the beautiful delusion of their own rainbow mist;
those mighty clouds sailing beneath my feet, or clinging to the
bosoms of the dark green mountains, or boiling up like a spell from
the invisible and unfathomable depths; the fell avalanche, fleet as a
spirit of evil, terrific when its sound suddenly breaks upon the
almighty silence, scarcely less terrible when we gaze upon its crumb-
ling and pallid frame, varied only by the presence of one or two
blasted firs; the head of a mountain loosening from its brother peak,
rooting up, in the roar of its rapid rush, a whole forest of pines, and
covering the earth for miles with elephantine masses; the superna-
tural extent of landscape that opens to us new worlds; the strong
eagles, and the strange wild birds that suddenly cross you in your
path, and stare, and shrieking fly—and all the soft sights of joy and
loveliness that mingle with these sublime and savage spectacles, the
rich pastures and the numerous flocks, and the golden bees and the
wild flowers, and the carved and painted cottages, and the simple
manners and the primeval grace- wherever I moved, I was in turn
appalled or enchanted; but whatever I beheld, new images ever
sprang up in my mind, and new feelings ever crowded on my fancy.
If I were to assign the particular quality which conduces to that
dreamy and voluptuous existence, which men of high imagination
experience in Venice, I should describe it as the feeling of abstrac-
tion, which is remarkable in that city, and peculiar to it. Venice is
the only city which can yield the magical delights of solitude. All
is still and silent. No rude sound disturbs your reveries; fancy,
therefore, is not put to flight. No rude sound distracts your self-
consciousness. This ienders existence intense. We feel everything,
And we feel thus keenly in a city not only eminently beautiful, not
only abounding in wonderful creations of art, but each step of which
is hallowed ground, quick with associations, that in their more vari.
ous nature, their nearer relation to ourselves, and perhaps their more
picturesque character, exercise a greater influence over the imagina-
tion than the more antique story of Greece and Rome. We feel al?

Joan of Arc.
What is to be thought of her ? What is to be thought of the
poor shepherd-girl from the hills and forests of Lorraine, that -
like the Hebrew shepherd-boy from the hills and forests of Judea
- rose suddenly out of the quiet, out of the safety, out of the relig-
ious inspiration, rooted in deep pastoral solitudes, to a station in the
van of armies, and to the more perilous station at the right hand of
kings? The Hebrew boy inaugurated his patriotic mission by an
act, by a victorious act, such as no man could deny. But so did the
girl of Lorraine, if we read her story as it was read by those who
saw her nearest. Adverse armies bore witness to the boy as no
pretender: but so they did to the gentle girl. Judged by the
voices of all who saw them from a station of good-will, both were
found true and loyal to any promises involved in their first acts
Enemies it was that made the difference between their subsequent
fortunes. The boy rose – to a splendor and a noonday prosperity,
both personal and public, that rang through the records of his people,
and became a by-word amongst his posterity for a thousand years,
until the sceptre was departing from Judah. The poor, forsaken
girl, on the contrary, drank not herself from that cup of rest which
she had secured for France. She never sang together with the
songs that rose in her native Demremy, as echoes to the departing
steps of invaders. She mingled not in the festal dances of Vaucou-
leurs which celebrated in rapture the redemption of France. No!
for her voice was then silent. No! for her feet were dust. Pure,

receive a robe of honor, but she will be found en contumace. When
the thunders of universal France, as even yet may happen, shall pro-
claim the grandeur of the poor shepherd-girl that gave up all for hier
country — thy ear, young shepherd-girl, will have been deaf for five
centuries. To suffer and to do, that was thy portion in this life; to
do-never for thyself, always for others; to suffer — nerer in the
persons of generous champions, always in thy own; that was thy
destiny; and not for a moment was it hidden from thyself. 'Life,'
thou saidst, 'is short, and the sleep which is in the grave is long.
Let me use that life, so transitory, for the glory of those bearenly
dreams destined to comfort the sleep which is so long.' This pure
creature - pure from every suspicion of even a visionary self-interest,
even as she was pure in senses more obvious— never once did this
holy child, as regarded herself, relax from. her belief in the darkness
that was traveling to meet her. She might not prefigure the very
manner of her death; she saw not in vision, perhaps, the aerial
altitude of the fiery scaffold, the spectators without end on every
road pouring into Rouen as to a coronation, the surging smoke, the
volleying flames, the hostile faces all around, the pitying eye that
lurked but here and there until nature and imperishable truth broke
loose from artificial restraints; these might not be apparent through
the mists of the hurrying future. But the voice that called her to
death, that she heard for ever.

the dust. Gorgeous were the lilies of France, and for centuries had
the privilege to spread their beauty over land and sea, until, in
another century, the wrath of God and man combined to withier
teem; but well Joanna knew, early at Domreniy she had read that
bitter truth, that the lilies of France would decorate no garland for
ber. Flower nor bud, bell nor blossom would ever bloom for her.

Death and Sleep
How wonderful is Death,
Death and his brother Sleep!
One pale as yonder waning moon,
With lips of lurid blue;
The other rosy as the morn
When, throned on ocean wave,
It blushes o'er the world:
Yet both so passing wonderſul!
Hath then the gloomy Power,
Whose reign is in the tainted sepulchres,
Seized on her sinless soul?
Must then that peerless form
Which love and admiration cannot riew
Without a beating heart, those azure veins
Which steal like streams along a field of snow,
That lovely outline, which is fair
As breathing marble, perish ?
Must putrefaction's breath
Leave nothing of this heavenly sight
But loathsomeness and ruin ?
Spare nothing but a gloomy theme
On which the lightest heart might moralize?
Or is it only a sweet slumber
Stealing o'er sensation,
Which the breath of roseate morning
Chaseth into darkness?
Will Ianthe wake again,
And give that faithful bosom joy
Whose sleepless spirit waits to catch
Light, life and rapture from her smile?
Her dewy eyes are closed,
And on their lids, whose texture fine
Scarce hides the dark-blue o.:bs beneath,
The baby Sleep is pillowed:
Her golden tresses shade
The forehead's stainless pride,
Curling like tendrils of the parasite
Around a marble column.

Hark! whence that rushing sound?
'Tis like the wondrous strain
That round a lonely ruin swells,
Which wandering on the echoing shore,
The enthusiast hears at evening:
'Tis softer than the west wind's sigh;
'Tis wilder than the unmeasured notes
Of that strange lyre whose strings
The genii of the breezes sweep;
Those lines of rainbow light
Are like the moonbeams when they fall
Through some cathedral window, but the tints
Are such as may not find
Comparison on earth.
Behold the chariot of the fairy queen !
Celestial coursers paw the unyielding air;
Their filmy pennons at her word they furl,
And stop obedient to the reins of light:

And leaning graceful from the ethereal car,

There is in that same solitude a taste

From land to land I'll roam, in all a stranger,
And, as the body gains a braver look,
By staring in the face of all the winds,

Oh! sing unto my roundelay;
Oh! drop the briny tear with me;
Dance no more at holiday,
Like a running river be;
My love is dead,
Gone to his death-bed,
All under the willow-tree.
Black his hair as the winter night,
White his neck as summer snow,
Ruddy his face as the morning light,
Cold he lies in the grave below:
My love is dead,
Gone to his death-bed,
All under the willow-tree.
Sweet his tongue as throstle's note,
Quick in dance as thought was lie;
Deſt his tabor, cudgel stout;
Oh! he lies by the willow-tree.
My love is dead,
Gone to his death-bed,
All under the willow-tree.
Hark! the raren flaps his wing,
In the briered dell below:
Hark! the death-owl loud doth sing,
To the nightmares as they go.

Death of Long Tom Coffin.
Liſting his broad bands high into the air, his voice was heard in
the tempest. 'God's will be done with me,' he cried: 'I saw the
first timber of the Ariel laid, and shall live just long enough to see
it turn out of her bottom; after which I wish to live no longer.'
But his slipınates were far beyond the sounds of his voice before
these were half uttered. All command of the boat was rendered
impossible, by the numbers it contained, as well as the raging of the
surf; and as it rose on the white crest of a wave, Tom saw his
beloved little craft for the last time. It fell into a trough of the sea,
and in a few moments more its fragments were ground into splinters
on the adjoining rocks. The cockswain (Tom) still remained where
lie had cast off the rope, and belield the numerous heads and arms
that appeared rising, at short intervals, on the waves, some making
powerful and well-directed efforts to gain the sands, that were
becoming visible as the tide ſell, and others wildly tossed, in the
frantic movements of helpless despair. The honest old seaman gave
a cry of joy as he saw Barnstable (the commander whom Tom had
forced into the boat] issue from the surf, where one by one sereral
seamen soon appeared also, dripping and exhausted. Many others
of the crew were carried in a similar manner to places of safety:
though, as Tom returned to liis seat on the bowsprit, he could not
conceal from his reluctant eyes the lifeless forms that were, in other
spots, driven against the rocks with a fury that soon left them but
few of the outward vestiges of humanity.
Dillon and the cockswain were now the sole occupants of their
dreadful station. The former stood in a kind of stupid despair, a
witness of the scene; but as liis curdled blood began again to now
more warmly to liis heart, he crept close to the side of Tom, with
that sort of selfish feeling that makes even hopeless misery niore
tolerable, when endured in participation with another.
When the tide falls,' he said in a roice that betrayed the agony
of fear, though his words expressed the renewal of hope, 'we shall
be able to walk to land.'
"There was One and only One to whose feet the waters were the
same as a dry deck,' returned the cockswain; "and none but such
as have His power will ever be able to walk from these rocks to the
sands.' The old seaman paused, and turuing his eyes, which exhib-

ited a mingled expression of disgust and compassion, on his com.
panion, he added with reverence: ‘Had you thought more of Him
in fair weather, your case would be less to be pitied in this tempest.'
Do you still think there is much danger ?' asked Dillon.
"To them that have reason to fear death. Listen! Do you hear
that hollow noise beneath ye?'
"Tis the wind driving by the vessel!'
''Tis the poor thing herself,' said the affected cockswain, 'giving
her last groans. The water is breaking up her decks, and in a few
minutes more, the handsomest model that ever cut a wave, will be
like the chips that fell from her in framing !'
"Why then did you remain here?' cried Dillon wildly.
"To die in my coffin, if it should be the will of God,' returned
Tom. "These waves are to me what the land is to you: I was born
on them, and I have always meant that they should be my grave.'
‘But I-I,' shrieked Dillon, 'I am not ready to diel- I cannot
die!- I will not die!'
“Poor wretch I'muttered his companion, 'you must go like the
rest of us; when the death-watch is called, none can skulk from
the muster.'
'I can swim,' Dillon continued, rushing with frantic eagerness to
the side of the wreck. “Is there no billet of wood, no rope, that I
can take with me?'
'None; everything has been cut away, or carried off by the sea.
If ye are about to strive for your life, take with ye a stout heart
and a clean conscience, and trust the rest to God.'
Goill' echoed Dillon, in the madness of his frenzy, “I know no
God! there is no God that knows me!'
Peace!' said the deep tones of the cockswain, in a voice that
seemed to speak in the elements; •blasphemer, peace !
The heavy groaning, produced by the water in the timbers of the
Ariel, at that moment added its impulse to the raging feelings of
Dillon, and he cast himself headlong into the sea. The water,
thrown by the rolling of the surf on the beach, was necessarily
returned to the ocean, in eddies, in different places favorable to such
an action of the element. Into the edge of one of these counter-
currents, that was produced by the very rocks on which the schooner
lay, and which the watermen call the 'under-tow,' Dillon had un-

knowingly thrown his person; and when the waves had driven
him a short distance from the wreck, he was met by a stream that
his most desperate efforts could not overcome. He was a light and
powerful swimmer, and the struggle was hard and protracted. With
the shore immediately before his eyes, and at no great distance, he
was led, as by a false phantom, to continue his efforts, although they
did not advance him a foot. The old seaman, who at first had
watched his motions with careless indifference, understood the dan-
ger of his situation at a glance, and, forgetful of his own fate, he
shouted aloud, in a voice that was driven over the struggling victim
to the ears of his shipmates on the sands:
'Sheer to port, and clear the under-tow! Sheer to the south.
ward!'
Dillon heard the sounds, but his faculties were too much obscured
by terror to distinguish their cbject; he, however, blindly yielded
to the call, and gradually changed his direction until his face was
once more turned toward the vessel. Tom looked around him for a
rope, but all had gone over with the spars, or been swept away by
the waves. At this moment of disappointment, his eyes met those
of the desperate Dillon. Calm and inured to horrors as was the
veteran seaman, he involuntarily passed his hand before his brow to
exulude the look of despair he encountered; and when, a moment
afterward, he removed the rigid member, he beheld the sinking form
of the victim as it gradually settled in the ocean, still struggling with
regular but impotent strokes of the arms and feet to gain the wreck,
and to preserve an existence that had been so much abused in its
hour of allotted probation. He will soon meet his God, and learn
that his God knows himl' murmured the cockswain to himself.
As he yet spoke, the wreck of the Ariel yielded to an overwhelm-
ing sea, and after a universal shudder, her timbers and planks gave
way, and were swept toward the cliffs, bearing the body of the
simple-hearted cockswain among the ruins.
James F. Cooper,
The Character of Falstaff.
Falstaff's wit is an emanation of a fine constitution; an exubera-

of laughter and good-fellowship; a giving vent to his heart's ease

and over-contentment with himself and others. We would not be
in character if he were not so fat as he is; for there is the greatest
keeping in the boundless luxury of his imagination, and the pam.
pered self-indulgence of his physical appetites. He enricles and
nourishes his mind with jests, as he does his body with sack and
sugar. He carves out his jokes as he would a capon or a liaunch
of verison, where there is cut and come again ; and pours out upon
them the oil of gladness. His tongue drops fatness, and in the
hambers of his brain 'it snows of meat and drink.' He keeps
up perpetual holiday and open house, and we live with him in a
round of invitations to a rump and dozen. Yet we are not to sun-
pose that he was a mere sensualist. All this is as much in imagina-
tion as in reality. His sensuality does not engross and stupify liis
other faculties, but 'ascends me into the brain, clears away all the
dull crude vapors that environ it, and makes it full of nimble, fiery,
and delectable shapes.' His imagination keeps up the ball after his
senses have done with it. He seems to have even a greater enjoy-
ment of the freedom from restraint, of good cheer, of his ease, of his
vanity, in the ideal exaggerated description wliich he gives of ihem,
than in fact. He never fails to enrich his discourse with allusions
to enting and drinking; but we never see him at 'able. He carries
his own larder about with him, and he is himself 'a tun of man.'
His pulling out the bottle in the field of battle is a joke to show his
contempt for glory accompanied with danger, his systematic adher-
ence to his Epicurean philosophy in the most trying circumstances.
Again, such is his deliberate exaggeration of his own rices, that it
does not seem quite certain whether the account of his hostess's bill,
found in his pocket, with such an ont-of-the-way charge for capons
and sack, with only one hall-penny-worth of bread, was not put
there by liimself as a trick to humor the jest npon his favorite pro-
pensities, and as a conscious caricature of himself. He is repre-
sented as a liar, a braggart, a coward, a glutton, etc., and yet we aro
not offended, but delighted with him; for he is all these as much to
amuse others as to gratiſy himself. He openly assumes all these
characters to show the humorous part of them. The unrestrained
indulgence of liis own case, appetites, and convenience, has neither
inalice nor hypocrisy in it. In a word, he is an actor in himself
almost as much as upon the stage, and we no more object to the

Hazlitt.
The Raven.
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondereu, weak and weary
Orer many a quaint and curicus volume of forgotten lore -
While I nodded nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber-door;
l 'Tis some visitor," I muttered, “tapping at my chamber-door ...
Only this, and nothing more.”
Ah! distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December,
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Eagerly I wished the morrow; vainly I had sought to borrow
From my books surcease of sorrow — sorrow for the lost Lenore ---
For the rare and radiant inaiden whom the angels name Lenore ·
Naineless here for evermore.
And the silken sad uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled me — filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating:
" 'Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber-door-
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber-door;
This it is, and nothing more.
Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
“Sir," said I, “or madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber-door,
That I scarce was sure I heard you" — here I opened wide cho
door —
Darkness there, and nothing more.
Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering,
fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before:
But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness Gave no token,

And the only word there spoken was the whispered word
“Lenore!"
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word,
“Lenore!" -
Merely this, and nothing more.
Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping something louder than before.
"Surely,” said I — "surely that is something at my window lattice
Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore
Let my lieart be still a moment, and this mystery explore.
'Tis the wind, and nothing more.”
Open here I Aung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore.
Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed
he;
But, with mien of lord or lady, perched abore my chamber-door –
Perched upon a bust of Pallas, just above my chamber-door-
Perched and sat, and nothing more.
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou," I said, “art sure
no craren,
Ghastly, grim and ancient Raven, wandering from the nightly
shore-
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's Plutonian shorel'
Quoth the Raven: “Nevermore.”
Much I marveled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly
Though its answer little meaning - little relerancy bore;
or we cannot help agrecing that no living human being
Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber-door.
Birl or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber-door,
With such name as “Nevermore,"
But the Raven, sitting lonely on that placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
Nothing further then he uttered; not a feather then be fluttered.

Till I scarcely more than muttered: “Other friends have flown
before
On the morrow he will leare me, as my hopes hare flown before."
Then the bird said: “Nevermore.”
Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
“Doubtless," said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store,
Canght from some unhappy master, whom unmerciful disaster
Followed fast and followed faster, till his songs one burden bors -
Till the dirges of liis hope that melancholy burden bore,
Of “Never — nevermore."
But, the Raren still beguiling all my sad soul into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird and bust and
door;
Then upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore-
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt and ominous bird of yore
Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”
This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom's core;
This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
On the cushion's velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o'er,
But whose velvet violet lining with the lamp-liglit gloating o'er
She shall press, ah, nevermore !
Then, methought, the air grew denser, perſunied from an unseen
censer
Swung by seraphim, whose footfalls tinkled on the tufted floor.
“Wretch!” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee — by these angels lie
hath sent thee
Respite — respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore!
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe, and forget this lost Lenore!"
Quoth the Raven: “Nevermore."
“ Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil! — prophet still, if bird or devil:
Whether tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
Desolate, yet all urdaunted, on this desert land enchanted —

Tell this soul with sorrow laden, if, within the distant Aidenn,

Casp a rare and radiant maiden, whom the angels name Lenore ?"
Quoth the Raven: “Nevermore.”
“Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend !" I shrieked,
upstarting -
“Get thee back into the tempest and the night's Plutonian shore !
Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
Leave my loneliness unbroken! - quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my
door!”
Quoth the Raven: “Nevermore.”
Anil the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting,
On the pallid bust of Pallas, just above my chamber-door;
And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming,
And the lamp-light o'er bim streaming, throws his shadow on the
floor;
And my soul from out the shadow that lies floating on the floor,

Death of Gawtrey the Coiner,
At both doors now were heard the sounds of voices. "Open in
the king's name, or expect no mercy!' 'Hist!' said Gawtrey.
'One way yet - the window — the rope.'
Morion opened the casement—Gawtrey uncoiled the rope. The
dawn was breaking; it was light in the streets, but all seemed qniet
without. The doors rec'ed and shook beneath the pressure of the
pursuers. Gawtrey flung tl.e rope across the street to the opposite

parapet; after two or three efforts, the grappling-hook caught firna
hold — the perilous path was made.
"Go first,' said Morton; ‘I will not leave you now; you will be
longer getting across than I shall. I will keep guard till you are
over.'
‘HIark! hark ! — are you mad? You keep guard! What is your
strength to mine? Twenty men shall not more that door, while
any weight is against it. Quick, or you destroy us both! Besides,
you will hold the rope for me, it may not be strong enough for my
bulk of itself. Stay!--stay one moment. If you escape, and I
fall - Fanny.- my father, he will take care of her - you remember
- thanks! Forgive me all! Go; that's right!
With a firm pulse, Morton threw himself on that dreadful bridge;
it swung and crackled at his weight Shifting his grasp rapidly-
holding his breath — with set teeth — with closed eyes — he moved
01 — lie gained the parapet — hie stood safe on the opposite side.
And now, straining his eyes across, he saw through the open case-
ment into the chamber he had just quitted. Gawtrey was still
standing against the door to the principal staircase, for that of the
two was the weaker and the more assailed. Presently the explo-
sion of a firearm was lieard; they liad shot through the parel.
Gawtrey seemed wounded, for he staggered forward, and uttered a
fierce cry; a moment more and he gained the window — he seized
the rope — he hung over the tremendous depth! Morton knelt by
the parapet, holding the grappling-hook in its place, with convulsive
grasp, and fixing his eyes, bloodshot with fear and suspense, on the
huge bulk that clung for life to that slender cord !
Le voila! le voila!' cried a voice from the opposite side. Mor-
toi. raised his gaze from Gawtrey; the casement was darkened by
• the forms of the pursuers — they had burst into the room — an
officer sprung upon the parapet, and Gawtrey, now aware of his
danger, opened his eyes, and, as he moved on, glared upon the fue..
The policeman deliberately raised his pistol — Gawtrey arrested
himself— from a wound in liis side the blood trickled slowly aud
darkiy down, drop by drop, upon the stones below; even the offi-
cers of law shuddered as they eyed him; his hair bristling - his
chcek white — his lips drawn convulsively from his teeth, and his
eyes glaring from beneath the frown of agony and menace in which

yet spoke the indomitable power and fierceness of the man. His
look, so fixed — so intense - so stern, awed the policeman; his
hand trembled as lie fired, and the ball struck the parapet an inch
below the spot where Morton knelt. An indistinct, wild, gurgling
sound --half laugh, half yell — of scorn and glee, broke from Gawt-
rey's lips. He swung himself on — near — near — nearer — a yard
from the parapet.
'You are saved l' cried Morton; when at that moment a volley
burst from the fatal casement — the smoke rolled over both the
fugitives — a groan, or rather howl, of rage, and despair, and agony,
appalled even the hardiest on whose ear it came. Morton sprang to
his feet, and looked below. He saw on the rugged stones, far down,
a dark, formless, motionless mass — the strong man of passion and
levity — the giant who had played with life and soul, as an infant
with the baubles that it prizes and breaks — was what the Cæsar
and the leper alike are, when all clay is without God's breath —
what glory, genius, power, and beauty, would be for ever and for
ever, if there were no God!

I turned me from the world away
With weary feet and thrubbing brow.
And ever since that fatal hour
Has my life's lamp been waning dim,
And fading with the autumn flower,-
I soon shall sing my evening hymn;
I soon shall sing my evening hymn,
And lay me down alone to rest,
Then Death, the spirit cold and grim,
Will come in clouds of darkness drest.
Through all the night so long and still,
In my shadowy chamber alone I lie -
While the moon shines pale on the window sill,
And the mystic hours go slowly by —
I think o'er all the glad, bright way
My life hath passed its few short years;
They are gone, like one long summer day,
And night has come with gloom and tears

But surely, soon will break the morn -
The fair liglit of the Better Land,
When, unto angel glories borne,
Before the great white throne I'll stand.
Oh! I have dreamed, in days gone by,
Ambition's dream of pride and fam9,
Of days and years to come, when I
Should gain a minstrel's glorious name.
Now coldly blows the autumn wind,
And darker grows the autumn sky -
And, withered on the damp, cold ground,
Summer's bright leaves and flowers lie:
E'en thus within my heart are strewn
The wrecks of each bright hope and dream,
Like withered leaves and flowers, grown,
Precious no more to me, they seem.
All faded are those visions bright,
And crushed those dreams of earthly fame,
And I would only seek to write
Within the book of life, my name.
Now life is no more bright to me,
For fairer forms my soul shall greet-
When I go up the shining way,
The pearly gate, and golden street.
Oh! I am longing to go home,
For earth is growing cold and dim;
And soon will my Redeemer come –
I soon shall sing my evening hymn.
And so she sang her hymn at even,
And laid her down in peace to rest:
She woke next morn, away in Heaven,
To dwell for aye among the blest.

cated at Oberlin, Ohio. She published, a few years ago, a volume
of poems entitled Household Songs; she edited for a long time The
Home Monthly and a juvenile magazine called the Youth’s Com-
panion, and has written much for the New York Independent, and
many other newspapers and periodicals. She has also been much
interested in educational work, lecturing upon methods of teach-
ing and literary subjects at Teachers' Institutes in several States.
At present she is associated with her husband, Prof. Oliver Arey, in
conducting the Normal School at Whitewater, Wis.
BROWNING, ROBERT, an English poet, author of Bells and Pome-
grantes, The Soul's Tragedy, etc.
BROWNING, ELIZABETH BARRETT, was born in Londoi. in 1809, was
a very remarkable child, writing verses at ten years of age, and
publishing “An Essay on Mind” at seventeen.
She had a very thorough education, studying the classics, phil-
osophy, etc.; but her favorite study was the Greek language and
its literature.
Mrs. Browning's life was early saddened by the loss of an idol-
ized brother, and then followed years of illness. But when others
would have sunken under the load of infirmity and pain, this sub-
lime woman wrote impassioned poetry and translated Greek. In
1846 she was married to Robert Browning, and the last years of
her life were spent in Italy. Under its sunny skies, and in the
brightness of her home, she was somewhat restored to health. She
died at Florence on the 29th of June, 1861. In the English burial
ground in that city the traveler will find a white marble tablet bear-
ing this inscription: “Here wrote and died Elizabeth Barrett
Browning, vho, in her woman's heart, united the wisdom of the
sage and the eloquence of the poet; with her golden verse she
linked Italy to England. Grateful Florence places this memorial
A. D. 1862."

works have been very ably translated by Mary Howitt, of England.
She wrote Family Cares and Family Joys, The President's Daugh-
ter, Nina, etc. A few years since, and but a short time previous to
her death, she visited America. She received great attention from
Se on her mot Tomes in the
the literary people of this country, and her book, Homes in the
New World, published after her return to Sweden, is an interesting
history of her travels. She visited her people who had settled in
the West, commending them for their industry and thrift. She died
ir. 1864.
Brown, GRACE, a native of Comac, Long Island, and a young
writer of promise.

her ancient family name— Lytton. This gentleman's full name is,
Edward George Earle Lytton Bulwer Lytton. His first volume
was published at the age of fifteen, and he has written almost con-
stantly ever since. He is interested in politics as well as literature,
and has been several years in the House of Commons. In 1853 the
University of Oxford conferred the degree of D. C. L. upon Sir Bul-
wer Lytton, in 1856 he was elected rector of the University of Glas-
gow, and in 1858 was made Secretary for Colonial Affairs.

Oxford. After leaving school he took clerical orders, but soon
abandoned the gown and prayer - book to apply himself more
closely to literature.
He was not successful, at first, in attracting much attention as a
writer, and it is said that he sank under the disappointment, and be-
came indolent and dissipated. For a few years before his death,
which occurred in 1759, he frequented the aisles and cloisters of
Chichester Cathedral, night and day, accompanying the music with
robs and moans. The poor poet died of melancholy, and a gener-
ation after his poems became popular.

educated at Glasgow, and was distinguished, while still in the Uni-
versity, for liis translations from the Greek and for his poetic writ-
ings. He published poetry at the age of fourteen. He wrote some
of the grandest battle pieces which have been produced --Lochiel's
Warning, Hohenlinden, The Battle of the Baltic, Song of the Greeks,
etc. He should be especially admired by Americans, for his Ger-
trude of Wyoming, in which he sketches with the pencil of a true
artist, pictures of Pennsylvania scenery, throwing a new halo over
the beautiful valley in which the scenes are laid. He died in 1844,
and his remains lie in Westminster Abbey. A history of his life
tas written by his friend, Dr. Beattie, and published in 1849.
CHATTERTON, THOMAS, a boy of strange genius, was born in 1753.
He deceived all the literary world, by producing what he declared

of priests, sketches in art, and the poetical writings of those who
had been dead for hundreds of years. He committed suicide by
taking arsenic, when a little more than seventeen years of age.

carnings, but his mind also, and he is now in a private asylum for
the insane.

States Senate, was the American Minister to Ghent, etc. . .
CLARK, JAMES G., was born in Oswego county, N. Y., in 1830.
He has the rare gift of wedding his poetry to most beautiful music,
and, also, of giving it expression in song. As a poet, he is noted
for the beauty and perfection of his rhythm; as a composer, for the
wonderful adaptation of the music to the sentiment, and as a bal-
lad singer, he has, probably, no superior.

pendent upon her own exertions for support. In 1851 her literary
life began. For a long time the real name of the author of the
dashing little sketches which appeared in various newspapers was
not known; seventy thousand copies of Fern Leaves were sold in
in this country alone, and shortly afterward there were found thirty-
two thousand purchasers for Little Ferns. Ruth Hall and Rose
Clark soon followed, and our author was in a full tide of prosperity.

first rolume at lifteen. This chillish attempt at poetry was not suc-
cessſul, but our young author did not despair, and the next publi-
cation placed her upon a firm literary ſootiny. In 1812 she was
marricıl to Captain Hemans; but the union was far from being a
happy one, and in 1818 he removed to Italy, while his wife remained

was enthusiastically received by the English people. His poetry is
not startling, but is quaint and beautiful.

PERCIVAL, JAMES GATES, was born in Kensington parish, in the
lown of Berlin, Connecticut, September 15, 1795. As soon as the
alphabet was mastered, he seemed to have an insatiable thirst for
knowledge, never engaging in play with his mates, but always por-
ing over books or studying nature. We find the boy invoking the
muse with passionate pleadings, at the age of fourteen or fifteen:
writing sometimes in smooth, beautiful rhythm, and then again
descending to a childish doggerel. In 1811 he entered Yale Col-
loge, New Haven, as a inember of the Freshman's class, and ir due
tiine completed the course of study in that institution. After leav-
ing college he studied medicine, but bis practice in the profession
