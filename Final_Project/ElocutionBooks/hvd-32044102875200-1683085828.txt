PREFACE.
A BRIEF outline of the principal part of
the following Work was sketched out several
years ago for the private use of some young
friends; and from that MS. chiefly, the
Article "Rhetoric" in the Encyclopædia
Metropolitana was afterwards drawn up. I
was induced to believe that it might be more
useful if published in a separate form; and I
have accordingly, with the assistance of some
friends, revised the treatise, and made a few
additions and other alterations which sug-
gested themselves; besides dividing it in a
manner more convenient for reference.
"
The title of Rhetoric," I have thought
it best on the whole to retain, as being that
by which the Article in the Encyclopædia is
designated; though it is in some respects
open to objection. Besides that it is rather

the more commonly employed in reference
to public Speaking alone, it is also apt to
suggest to many minds an associated idea
of empty declamation, or of dishonest arti-
fice.
The subject indeed stands perhaps but a
few degrees above Logic in popular estima-
tion; the one being generally regarded by
the vulgar as the Art of bewildering the
learned by frivolous subtleties; the other, that
of deluding the multitude by specious false-
hood. And if a treatise on Composition be
itself more favourably received than the
work of a Logician, the Author of it must
yet labour under still greater disadvantages.
He may be thought to challenge criticism; and
his own performances may be condemned by
a reference to his own precepts; or, on the
other hand, his precepts may be under-
valued, through his own failures in their
application. Should this take place in the
present instance, I have only to urge, with
Horace in his Art of Poetry, that a whet-
stone, though itself in capable of cutting, is
yet useful in sharpening steel. No system
of instruction will completely equalize natural

powers; and yet it may be of service towards
their improvement. The youthful Achilles
acquired skill in hurling the javelin under
the instruction of Chiron, though the master
could not compete with the pupil in vigour
of arm.
It may perhaps be hardly necessary to
observe, that the following pages are designed
principally for the instruction of unpractised
writers. Of such as have long been in the
habit of writing or speaking, those whose
procedure has been conformable to the rules
I have laid down, will of course have antici-
pated most of my observations; and those
again who have proceeded on opposite prin-
ciples, will be more likely to censure, as it
were in self-defence, than laboriously to
unlearn what they have perhaps laboriously
acquired, and to set out afresh on a new
system. But I am encouraged, partly by
the result of experiments, to entertain a hope
that the present System may prove useful to
such as have their method of composition,
and their style of writing and of delivery to
acquire. And an Author ought to be con-

not unprofitable, which cannot, from its
nature, be expected to pass completely un-
censured.
Whoever indeed, in treating of any sub-
ject, recommends (whether on good or bad
grounds) a departure from established prac-
tice, must expect to encounter opposition.
This opposition does not indeed imply that
his precepts are right; but neither does it
prove them wrong; it only implies that they
are new; since few will readily acknowledge
the plans on which they have long been
proceeding, to be mistaken. If a treatise
therefore on the present subject were re-
ceived with immediate, universal, and un-
qualified approbation, this circumstance
would not indeed prove it to be erroneous,
(since it is conceivable, that the methods
commonly pursued may be altogether right,)
but would afford a presumption that there
was not much to be learnt from it.

dantic morality to give solemn admonitions
against employing them, or to enter a formal
disclaimer of dishonest intention; since, after
all, the generality will, according to their
respective characters, make what use of a
book they think fit, without waiting for the
Author's permission: but what I have en-
deavoured to do, is, clearly to set forth, as
far as I could, (as Bacon does in his Essay
on Cunning,) these sophistical tricks of the
Art; and as far as I may have succeeded in
this, I shall have been providing the only
effectual check to the employment of them.
The adulterators of food or of drugs, and
the coiners of base money, keep their pro-
cesses a secret, and dread no one so much
as him who detects, describes, and pro-
claims their contrivances, and thus puts men
on their guard; for "every one that doeth
evil hateth the light, neither cometh to
the light, lest his deeds should be made
manifest."
To the prevailing association of the term
"Rhetoric," with the idea of these delusive
contrivances, may be traced the opinion.

(which I believe is also common) that the
power of eloquence is lost on those who
themselves possess it; or at least that a critical
knowledge of the art of Composition fortifies
any one, in proportion to his proficiency,
against being affected by the persuasive
powers of another. This is undoubtedly
true, as far as Sophistical skill is concerned :
the better acquainted one is with any kind
of rhetorical trick, the less liable he is to be
misled by it. The Artifices, strictly so called,
of the Orator, are,
like tricks by sleight of hand,
Which to admire, one should not understand:
and he who has himself been behind the
scenes of a puppet-show, and pulled the
strings by which the figures are moved, is
not likely to be much affected by their per-
formance. This is indeed one great recom-
mendation of the study of Rhetoric, that it
furnishes the most effectual antidote against
deception of this kind. But it is by no
means true that acquaintance with an Art-

consisting in juggling tricks,-tends to dimi-

nish our sensibility to the most excellent
productions of Art. The greatest proficients
in music are usually the most enthusiastic ad-
mirers of good music: the best Painters and
Poets, and such as are best versed in the prin-
ciples of those arts, are in general (when ri-
valry is out of the question) the most power-
fully affected by paintings and by poetry, of
superior excellence. And none I believe are
more open to the impression of sound,
honest, manly eloquence, than those who
display it in their own compositions, and are
capable of analysing critically the mode in
which its effects are produced.
A few passages will be found in the fol-
lowing pages which presuppose some ac-
quaintance with Logic; but the greatest
part will, I trust, be intelligible to those who
have not this knowledge. At the same
time, it is implied by what I have said of that
Science, and indeed by the very circumstance
of my having written on it, that I cannot but
consider him as undertaking a task of un-
necessary difficulty who endeavours, without
studying Logic, to become a thoroughly good
argumentative writer.

PREFACE.
It may be thought that some apology is
necessary for the frequent reference made
to the treatise just mentioned, and, occa-
sionally, to some other works of my own.
It appeared to me, however, that either of
the other two alternatives would have been
more objectionable; viz. either to omit en-
tirely much that was needful for the elucida-
tion of the subject in hand; or, to repeat, in
the same or in other words, what had been
already published.
Perhaps some apology may also be thought
necessary for the various illustrations, se-
lected from several authors, or framed for the
occasion, which occur both in the present
treatise, and in that on Logic; and in which,
opinions on various subjects are incidentally
conveyed; in all of which, it cannot be ex-
pected that every one of my readers will
concur. And some may accordingly be dis-
posed to complain that they cannot put
these works into the hands of any young
person under their care, without a risk of his
imbibing notions which they think erroneous.
This objection, I have reason to believe, has
been especially felt, though not always ex-
plicitly stated, by the most decidedly anti-

christian writers of the present day. But it
should be remembered, that Logic and Rhe-
toric having no proper subject-matter of
their own, it was necessary to resort to other
departments of knowledge for exemplifica-
tions of the principles laid down; and it
would have been impossible, without con-
fining myself to the most insipid truisms, to
avoid completely all topics on which there
exists any difference of opinion. If, in the
course of either work, I have advocated any
erroneous tenet, the obvious remedy is, to
refute it. I am utterly unconscious of having
in any instance resorted to the employment
of fallacy, or substituted declamation for
argument; but if any such faults exist, it is
easy to expose them. Nor is it necessary
that when any book is put into the hands of

If however any one finds himself unequal to this task,
he must be content to "prohibit his pupils (as was done,
according to a representation lately made, in a statute of
this University) from reading books not suitable to their
faculties." Such was the translation given of the Statute
which forbade any one to give lectures [legere] on books
not appertaining to his own department of study, [facultas,]

a young student, he should understand that
he is to adopt implicitly every doctrine con-
tained in it, or should not be cautioned
against any erroneous principles which it
may inculcate otherwise indeed, it would
be impossible to give young men what is
called a classical education, without making
them Pagans.
That I have avowed an assent to the
evidences of Christianity, (that, I believe, is
the point on which the greatest soreness is
felt,) and that this does incidentally imply
some censure of those who reject it, is not
to be denied. But they again are at liberty,
and they are not backward in using their
liberty, to repel the censure, by refuting, if
they can, those evidences. And as long as
they confine themselves to calm argument-
ation, and abstain from insult, libellous per-
sonality, and falsification of facts, I earnestly
hope no force will ever be employed to
silence them, except force of argument. I
am not one of those jealous lovers of freedom
who would fain keep it all to themselves;
nor do I dread ultimate danger to the cause
of truth from fair discussion.

It has been objected, I understand, by
some, that in the foregoing words I have put
forth a challenge which cannot be accepted;
inasmuch as it has been declared by the
highest legal authorities, that "Christianity
is part of the Law of the Land ;" and con-
sequently any one who impugns it, is liable
to prosecution. What is the precise mean-
ing of the above legal maxim, I do not pro-
fess to determine; having never met with
any one who could explain it to me but
evidently the mere circumstance, that we
have a Religion by Law established, does
not, of itself, imply the illegality of arguing
against that Religion. The regulations of
Trade and of Navigation, for instance, are
unquestionably part of the Law of the Land;
but the question of their expediency is freely
discussed, and frequently in no very mea-
sured language; nor did I ever hear of any
one's being menaced with prosecution for
censuring them.
I presume not however to decide what
steps might, legally, be taken; I am looking
only to facts and probabilities; and I feel a
confident trust, as well as hope, (and that,

founded on experience of the past,) that
no legal penalties will, in fact, be incurred
by temperate, decent, argumentative main-
tainers even of the most erroneous opinions.
I have only to add my acknowledgments
to those friends for whose kind and judicious
suggestions I am so much indebted; and to
assure them, that whatever may be the public
reception of the work, I shall never cease to
feel flattered and obliged by the diligent at-
tention they have bestowed on it.

finitions of
OF Rhetoric various definitions have been Various de-
given by different writers; who, however, seem Rhetoric.
not so much to have disagreed in their concep-
tions of the nature of the same thing, as to
have had different things in view while they
employed the same term. Not only the word
Rhetoric itself, but also those used in defining
it, have been taken in various senses; as may
be observed with respect to the word "Art" in
Cic. de Orat, where a discussion is introduced
as to the applicability of that term to Rhetoric;
manifestly turning on the different senses in
which "Art" may be understood.
To enter into an examination of all the de-
finitions that have been given, would lead to
much uninteresting and uninstructive verbal
controversy. It is sufficient to put the reader
on his guard against the common error of sup-
posing that a general term has some real object,

properly corresponding to it, independent of
our conceptions;-that, consequently, some
one definition is to be found which will com-
prehend every thing that is rightly designated
by that term;—and that all others must be
erroneous: whereas, in fact, it will often happen,
as in the present instance, that both the wider,
and the more restricted sense of a term, will be
alike sanctioned by use, (the only competent
authority,) and that the consequence will be
a corresponding variation in the definitions
employed; none of which perhaps may be
fairly chargeable with error, though none can
be framed that will apply to every acceptation
of the term.
It is evident that in its primary signification,
Rhetoric had reference to public Speaking alone,
as its etymology implies: but as most of the
rules for speaking are of course applicable
equally to Writing, an extension of the term
naturally took place; and we find even Aris-
totle, the earliest systematic writer on the sub-
ject whose works have come down to us,
including in his Treatise rules for such com-
positions as were not intended to be publicly
recited". And even as far as relates to Speeches,
properly so called, he takes, in the same Trea-

tise, at one time, a wider, and at another, a more
restricted view of the subject; including under
the term Rhetoric, in the opening of his work,
nothing beyond the finding of topics of Per-

spoken; and afterwards embracing the consi-
deration of Style, Arrangement, and Delivery.
The invention of Printing, by extending
the sphere of operation of the Writer, has of
course contributed to the extension of those
terms which, in their primary signification, had
reference to Speaking alone. Many objects
are now accomplished through the medium of
the Press, which formerly came under the
exclusive province of the Orator; and the qua
lifications requisite for success are so much the
same in both cases, that we apply the term.

rules analogous to these, are applicable to such
compositions. Conformably to this view there-
fore, some writers have spoken of Rhetoric as
the Art of Composition, universally; or, with
the exclusion of Poetry alone, as embracing all
Prose-composition.
A still wider extension of the province of
Rhetoric has been contended for by some of
the ancient writers; who thinking it necessary
to include, as belonging to the Art, every thing
that could conduce to the attainment of the
object proposed, introduced into their systems,
Treatises on Law, Morals, Politics, &c. on the
ground that a knowledge of these subjects was
requisite to enable a man to speak well on
them and even insisted on Virtue as an es-
sential qualification of a perfect Orator; because
a good character, which can in no way be so
surely established as by deserving it, has great
weight with the audience.
These notions are combated by Aristotle;
who attributes them either to the ill-cultivated
understanding (άaidevσía) of those who main-
tained them, or to their arrogant and pretending
disposition, aλačoveía; i. e. a desire to extol and
magnify the Art they professed. In the pre-
sent day, the extravagance of such doctrines is

so apparent to most, readers, that it would not
be worth while to take much pains in refuting
them. It is worthy of remark however, that
the very same erroneous view is, even now,
often taken of Logic; which has been consi-
dered by some as a kind of system of universal
knowledge, on the ground that Argument may
be employed on all subjects, and that no one
can argue well on a subject which he does not
understand; and which has been complained
of by others for not supplying any such uni-
versal instruction as its unskilful advocates have
placed within its province; such as in fact no
one Art or System can possibly afford.
The error is precisely the same in respect of
Rhetoric and of Logic; both being instrumental
arts; and, as such, applicable to various kinds
of subject-matter, which do not properly come
under them.
So judicious an author as Quinctilian would
not have failed to perceive, had he not been
carried away by an inordinate veneration for
his own Art, that as the possession of building
materials is no part of the art of Architecture,
though it is impossible to build without mate-
rials, so,
the knowledge of the subjects on
which the Orator is to speak, constitutes no

part of the art of Rhetoric, though it be essen-

though virtue, and the good reputation it pro-
cures, add materially to the Speaker's influence,
they are no more to be, for that reason, con-
sidered as belonging to the Orator, as such,
than wealth, rank, or a good person, which
manifestly have a tendency to produce the same
effect.

I propose in the present work to adopt a
middle course between these two extreme points;
and to treat of Argumentative Composition,
generally, and exclusively; considering Rhetoric
(in conformity with the very just and philo-
sophical view of Aristotle) as an off-shoot from
Logic.
I remarked in treating of that Science, that
Reasoning may be considered as applicable to
two purposes, which I ventured to designate re-
spectively by the terms "Inferring,” and “Prov-
ing;" i. e. the ascertainment of the truth by
investigation, and the establishment of it to
the satisfaction of another: and I there re-

marked, that Bacon, in his Organon, has laid
down rules for the conduct of the former of
these processes, and that the latter belongs to
the province of Rhetoric: and it was added, Philosophy
that to infer is to be regarded as the proper toric com-
office of the Philosopher, or the Judge;-to
prove, of the Advocate. It is not however to
be understood that Philosophical works are to
be excluded from the class to which Rhetorical
rules are applicable; for the Philosopher who
undertakes, by writing or speaking, to convey
his notions to others, assumes, for the time
being, the character of Advocate of the doc-
trines he maintains. The process of investi-
gation must be supposed completed, and certain
conclusions arrived at by that process, before
he begins to impart his ideas to others in a
treatise or lecture; the object of which must
of course be to prove the justness of those
conclusions. And in.
And in doing this, he will not
always find it expedient to adhere to the same
course of reasoning by which his own dis-
coveries were originally made; other arguments
may occur to him afterwards, more clear, or
more concise, or better adapted to the under-
standing of those he addresses. In explaining
therefore, and establishing the truth, he may
often have occasion for rules of a different kind
from those employed in its discovery.

cordingly, when I remarked, in the work above
alluded to, that it is a common fault, for those
engaged in Philosophical and Theological in-
quiries, to forget their own peculiar office, and
assume that of the Advocate, improperly, this
caution is to be understood as applicable to the
process of forming their own opinions; not, as
excluding them from advocating by all fair
arguments, the conclusions at which they have
arrived by candid investigation. But if this
candid investigation do not take place in the
first instance, no pains that they may bestow
in searching for arguments, will have any tend-
ency to ensure their attainment of truth. If a
man begins (as is too plainly a frequent mode
of proceeding) by hastily adopting, or strongly
leaning to some opinion, which suits his in-
clination, or which is sanctioned by some au-
thority that he blindly venerates, and then
studies with the utmost diligence, not as an
Investigator of Truth, but as an Advocate
labouring to prove his point, his talents and
his researches, whatever effect they may pro-
duce in making converts to his notions, will
avail nothing in enlightening his own judgment,
and securing him from error.

open to objection, inasmuch as it is not likely
to lead to discussions that can be deemed
superfluous, even by those who may choose to
consider Rhetoric in the most restricted sense,
as relating only to "Persuasive Speaking;"
since it is evident that Argument must be, in
most cases at least, the basis of Persuasion.

are extant, may safely be pronounced to be also
the best, of the systematic writers on Rhetoric.
Cicero is hardly to be reckoned among the
number; for he delighted so much more in the
practice than in the theory of his art, that he is
perpetually drawn off from the rigid Philoso-
phical analysis of its principles, into discursive
declamations, always eloquent indeed, and often
highly interesting, but adverse to regularity of
system, and frequently as unsatisfactory to the
practical student as to the Philosopher. He
abounds indeed with excellent practical re-
marks, though the best of them are scattered
up and down his works with much irregularity;
but his precepts, though of great weight, as
being the result of experience, are not often
traced up by him to first principles; and we
are frequently left to guess, not only on what
basis his rules are grounded, but in what cases
they are applicable. Of this latter defect a
remarkable instance will be hereafter cited.

much good sense, but this was tinctured with
pedantry; with that axalovela as Aristotle calls
it, which extends to an extravagant degree the
province of the Art which he professes. A
great part of his work indeed is a Treatise on
education generally; in the conduct of which
he was no mean proficient; for such was the
importance attached to public speaking, even
long after the downfall of the Republic had
cut off the Orator from the hopes of attaining,
through the means of this qualification, the
highest political importance, that he who was
nominally a Professor of Rhetoric, had in fact
the most important branches of instruction
intrusted to his care.
Many valuable maxims however are to be
found in this author; but he wanted the pro-
fundity of thought and power of analysis which
Aristotle possessed.

numerous; but most of them appear to have
confined themselves to a very narrow view of
the subject; and to have been occupied, as
Aristotle complains, with the minor details of
style and arrangement, and with the sophistical
tricks and petty artifices of the Pleader, instead
of giving a masterly and comprehensive sketch
of the essentials.

§. 2.
ELEMENTS OF RHETORIC.
Among the moderns, few writers of ability
have turned their thoughts to the subject; and
but little has been added, either in respect of
matter, or of system, to what the ancients have
left us.
It were most unjust however to leave
Campbell. unnoticed Dr. Campbell's Philosophy of Rhe-
toric: a work which does not enjoy indeed so
high a degree of popular favour as Dr. Blair's,
but is incomparably superior to it, not only
in depth of thought and ingenious original
research, but also in practical utility to the
student. The title of Dr. Campbell's work
has perhaps deterred many readers, who have
concluded it to be more abstruse and less
popular in its character than it really is. Amidst
much however that is readily understood by
any moderately intelligent reader, there is much
also that calls for some exertion of thought,
which the indolence of most readers refuses
to bestow. And it must be owned that he
also in some instances perplexes his readers
by being perplexed himself, and bewildered
in the discussion of questions through which
he does not clearly see his way. His great
defect, which not only leads him into occasional
errors, but leaves many of his best ideas but
imperfectly developed, is his ignorance and
utter misconception of the nature and object of
Logic; on which some remarks were made in

my treatise on that Science. Rhetoric being
in truth an off-shoot of Logic, that Rheto-
rician must labour under great disadvantages
who is not only ill-acquainted with that system,
but also utterly unconscious of his deficiency.
§. 3.
From a general view of the history of Rhe-
toric, two questions naturally suggest them-
selves, which on examination will be found
very closely connected together: first, what is
the cause of the careful and extensive cultivation,
among the ancients, of an Art which the
moderns have comparatively neglected; and
secondly, whether the former or the latter are to
be regarded as the wiser in this respect ;-in
other words, whether Rhetoric be worth any
diligent cultivation.
cultivation
With regard to the first of these questions, Assiduous
the answer generally given is, that the nature of of Rhetoric

the Government in the ancient democratical cients.
States caused a demand for public speakers,
and for such speakers as should be able to gain
influence not only with educated persons in
dispassionate deliberation, but with a promis-
cuous multitude; and accordingly it is re-
marked, that the extinction of liberty brought
with it, or at least brought after it, the decline
of Eloquence; as is justly remarked (though

in a courtly form) by the author of the dialogue
on Oratory, which passes under the name of
Tacitus: " Quid enim opus est longis in Senatu
sententiis, cum optimi cito consentiant? quid,
multis apud populum concionibus, cum de
Republica non imperiti et multi deliberent, sed
sapientissimus, et unus ?"
This account of the matter is undoubtedly
correct as far as it goes; but the importance of
public-speaking is so great, in our own, and all
other countries that are not under a despotic
Government, that the apparent neglect of the
study of Rhetoric seems to require some
further explanation. Part of this explanation
may be supplied by the consideration, that the
difference in this respect between the ancients
and ourselves, is not so great in reality as in
appearance. When the only way of addressing
ers rather the public was by orations, and when all poli-
tical measures were debated in popular assem-
blies, the characters of Orator, Author, and
Politician, almost entirely coincided; he who
would communicate his ideas to the world, or
would gain political power, and carry his legis-
lative schemes into effect, was necessarily a
Speaker; since, as Pericles is made to remark
by Thucydides, "one who forms a judgment
on any point, but cannot explain himself clearly
to the people, might as well have never thought

at all on the subjecte." The consequence
was, that almost all who sought, and all who
professed to give, instruction, in the principles
of Government, and the conduct of judicial
proceedings, combined these, in their minds
and in their practice, with the study of Rhetoric,
which was necessary to give effect to all such
attainments; and in time the Rhetorical writers
(of whom Aristotle makes that complaint) came
to consider the Science of Legislation and of
Politics in general, as a part of their own Art.
Much therefore of what was formerly studied
under the name of Rhetoric, is still, under other
names, as generally and as diligently studied
as ever.
-
It cannot be denied however that a great
difference, though less, as I have said, than
might at first sight appear, does exist between
the ancients and the moderns in this point ;-
that what is strictly and properly called Rhe-
toric, is much less studied, at least less syste-
matically studied, now, than formerly. Perhaps
this also may be in some measure accounted
for from the circumstances which have been
just noticed. Such is the distrust excited by Disavowal
any suspicion of Rhetorical artifice, that every studies

point, endeavours to disown or to keep out
of sight any superiority of skill; and wishes to
be considered as relying rather on the strength
of his cause, and the soundness of his views,
than on his ingenuity and expertness as an
advocate. Hence it is, that even those who
have paid the greatest and the most successful
attention to the study of Composition and of
Elocution, are so far from encouraging others
by example or recommendation to engage in
the same pursuit, that they labour rather to
conceal and disavow their own proficiency;
and thus, theoretical rules are decried, even by
those who owe the most to them. Whereas
among the ancients, the same cause did not,
for the reasons lately mentioned, operate to the
same extent; since, however careful any speaker
might be to disown the artifices of Rhetoric
properly so called, he would not be ashamed
to acknowledge himself, generally, a student, or
a proficient, in an Art which was understood to
include the elements of Political wisdom.
§. 4.
With regard to the other question proposed,
viz. concerning the utility of Rhetoric, it is to
be observed that it divides itself into two; first,
whether Oratorical skill be, on the whole, a pub-
lic benefit, or evil; and secondly, whether any

artificial system of Rules is conducive to the
attainment of that skill. The former of these
questions was eagerly debated among the an-
cients; on the latter but little doubt seems to
have existed. With us, on the contrary, the
state of these questions seems nearly reversed.
It seems generally admitted that skill in Com-
position and in Speaking, liable as it evidently.
is to abuse, is to be considered, on the whole,
as advantageous to the public; because that
liability to abuse is neither in this, nor in any
other case, to be considered as conclusive against
the utility of any kind of art, faculty, or
profession;-because the evil effects of mis-
directed power, require that equal powers should
be arrayed on the opposite side;-and because
truth, having an intrinsic superiority over false-
hood, may be expected to prevail when the
skill of the contending parties is equal; which
will be the more likely to take place, the more
widely such skill is diffused. But many, per-
haps most persons, are inclined to the opinion
that Eloquence, either in writing or speaking,
is either a natural gift, or, at least, is to be
acquired by mere practice, and is not to be
attained or improved by any system of rules.
And this opinion is favoured not least by those
(as has been just observed) whose own expe-
rience would enable them to decide very

differently; and it certainly seems to be in a
great degree practically adopted. Most persons,
if not left entirely to the disposal of chance in
respect of this branch of education, are at least
left to acquire what they can by practice, such
as school or college exercises afford, without
much care being taken to initiate them sys-
tematically into the principles of the Art; and
that, frequently, not so much from negligence
in the conductors of education, as from their
doubts of the utility of any such regular
system.
It certainly must be admitted, that rules not
constructed on broad Philosophical principles,
are more likely to cramp than to assist the
operations of our faculties;-that a pedantic

that a system of rules imperfectly comprehended,
or not familiarized by practice, will (while that
continues to be the case) prove rather an
impediment than a help; as indeed will be
found in all other Arts likewise ;-and that no
system can be expected to equalize men whose
natural powers are different: but none of these
concessions at all invalidate the positions of
Aristotle; that some succeed better than others

others to them; and that, not merely by
superiority of natural gifts, but by acquired
habit; and that consequently if we can discover
the causes of this superior success, the means
by which the desired end is attained by all who
do attain it,—we shall be in possession of rules
capable of general application: Teg σrì, says he,
Texvñs egyors, Experience so plainly evinces,
what indeed we might naturally be led antece-
dently to conjecture, that a right judgment on
any subject is not necessarily accompanied
by skill in effecting conviction,-nor the ability
to discover truth, by a facility in explaining
it, that it might be matter of wonder how
any doubt should ever have existed as to the
possibility of devising, and the utility of em-
ploying, a System of Rules for " Argumentative
Composition," generally, distinct from any
system conversant about the subject-matter of
each composition.
It is probable that the existing prejudices on
this subject may be traced in great measure
to the imperfect or incorrect notions of some
writers, who have either confined their attention
to trifling minutiae of style, or at least have in
some respect failed to take a sufficiently com-
prehensive view of the principles of the Art.

powers.
One distinction especially is to be clearly laid
down and carefully borne in mind by those
who would form a correct idea of those prin-
ciples; viz. the distinction already noticed
in Logic, between an Art, and the Art. "An
Art of Reasoning" would imply, "a Method
or System of Rules by the observance of which
one may Reason correctly;" "the Art of
A rightly. Reasoning" would imply a System of Rules
formed sys- to which every one does conform (whether
not cramp knowingly, or not) who reasons correctly: and
such is Logic, considered as an Art. In like
manner "an Art of Composition" would
imply "a System of Rules by which a good
Composition may be produced;" "the Art of
Composition," "such rules as every good
Composition must conform to," whether the
author of it had them in his mind or not. Of
the former character appear to have been (among
others) many of the Logical and Rhetorical
Systems of Aristotle's predecessors in those
departments: he himself evidently takes the
other and more Philosophical view of both
branches: as appears (in the case of Rhetoric)
'both from the plan he sets out with, that of
investigating the causes of the success of all
who do succeed in effecting conviction, and
from several passages occurring in various parts
of his "Treatise, which indicate how sedulously

he was on his guard to conform to that plan.
Those who have not attended to the important
distinction just alluded to, are often disposed to
feel wonder, if not weariness, at his reiterated
remarks, that "all men effect persuasion either
in this way or in that;" "it is impossible to
attain such and such an object in any other
way;"&c. which doubtless were intended to
remind his readers of the nature of his design;
viz. not to teach an Art of Rhetoric, but the
Art; not to instruct them merely how con-
viction might be produced, but how it must.
If this distinction were carefully kept in
view by the teacher and by the learner of
Rhetoric, we should no longer hear complaints
of the natural powers being fettered by the
formalities of a System; since no such com-
plaint can lie against a System whose Rules
are drawn from the invariable practice of all
who succeed in attaining their proposed object.
No one would expect that the study of
Sir Joshua Reynolds's lectures would cramp
the genius of the painter. No one complains
of the Rules of Grammar as fettering Language;
because it is understood that correct use is
not founded on Grammar, but Grammar on
correct use. A just system of Logic or of
Rhetoric is analogous, in this respect, to
Grammar.

IT was remarked in the Treatise on LOGIC, Inquiry
that in the process of Investigation properly so and after
Arguments
called, viz. that by which we endeavour to distinguish-
discover Truth, it must of course be uncertain
to him who is entering on that process, what
the conclusion will be, to which his researches
will lead; but that in the process of conveying
truth to others, by reasoning, (i. e. that which
according to the view I have at present taken
may be termed the Rhetorical process,) the
conclusion or conclusions which are to be esta-
blished must be present to the mind of him who
is conducting the Argument, and whose business
is to find Proofs of a given proposition.
It is evident therefore, that the first step to
be taken by him is to lay down distinctly in
his own mind the proposition or propositions

to be proved. It might indeed at first sight
appear superfluous even to mention so obvious
a rule; but experience shews that it is by no
means uncommon for a young or ill-instructed
writer to content himself with such a vague
and indistinct view of the point he is to aim at,
that the whole train of his reasoning is in con-
sequence affected with a corresponding per-
plexity, obscurity, and looseness. It may be
worth while therefore to give some hints for
the conduct of this preliminary process,―the
choice of propositions. Not, of course, that
I am supposing the author to be in doubt
what opinion he shall adopt: the process of
Investigation (which does not fall within the
province of Rhetoric) being supposed to be
concluded; but still there will often be room for
deliberation as to the form in which an opinion
shall be stated, and, when several propositions
are to be maintained, in what order they shall
be placed.

order to anticipate some objections or doubts
which might arise) one remark relative to the
object to be effected. This is, of course, what
may be called, in the widest sense of the word,
Conviction; but under that term are compre.
hended, first, what is strictly called Instruction;

and, secondly, Conviction in the narrower sense;
i. e. the Conviction of those who are either of
a contrary opinion to the one maintained, or
who are in doubt whether to admit or deny it.
By Instruction, on the other hand, is commonly
meant the conviction of those who have neither
formed an opinion on the subject, nor are delibe-
rating whether to adopt or reject the proposition
in question, but are merely desirous of ascer-
taining what is the truth in respect of the case
before them. The former are supposed to have
before their minds the terms of the proposition
maintained, and are called upon to consider
whether that particular proposition be true or
false; the latter are not supposed to know the
terms of the conclusion, but to be enquiring
what proposition is to be received as true.
It is evident that the speaker or writer is,
relatively to these last, (though not to himself,)
conducting a process of Investigation; as is
plain from what has been said of that subject, in
the treatise on LOGIC.
The distinction between these two objects
gives rise in some points to corresponding
differences in the mode of procedure, which
will be noticed hereafter; these differences
however are not sufficient to require that
Rhetoric should on that account be divided into
two distinct branches; since, generally speaking,

though not universally, the same rules will
be serviceable for attaining each of these ob-
jects.
§. 2.
The first step is, as I have observed, to lay
down (in the author's mind) the proposition
or propositions to be maintained, clearly, and in
a suitable form.
He who strictly observes this rule, and who
is thus brought to view steadily the point he
is aiming at, will be kept clear, in a great degree,
of some common faults of young writers; viz.
entering on too wide a field of discussion, and
introducing many propositions not sufficiently
connected; an error which destroys the unity

imply unity apt to fall into, who place before themselves a

that because they are treating of one thing,
they are discussing one question. In an Ethical
work, for instance, one may be treating of
virtue, while discussing all or any of these
questions;
"Wherein virtue consists?"

Whence our notions of it arise ?” “Whence
it derives its obligation?" &c. but if these
questions were confusedly blended together, or

ness of mat-
view.
Nearly akin to this fault is the other just
mentioned, that of entering on too wide a field
for the length of the work; by which means
the writer is confined to barren and uninteresting
generalities; as e. g. general exhortations to
virtue (conveyed, of course, in very general
terms) in the space of a discourse only of
sufficient length to give a characteristic de-
scription of some one branch of duty, or of
some one particular motive to the practice of it.
Unpractised composers are apt to fancy that they Copious-
shall have the greater abundance of matter, the ter furnish-
ed by a
wider extent of subject they comprehend; but restricted
experience shews that the reverse is the fact:
the more general and extensive view will often
suggest nothing to the mind but vague and
trite remarks, when, upon narrowing the field of
discussion, many interesting questions of detail
present themselves. Now a writer who is ac-
customed to state to himself precisely, in the
first instance, the conclusions to which he is
tending, will be the less likely to content
himself with such as consist of very general
statements; and will often be led, even where
an extensive view is at first proposed, to dis-
tribute it into several branches, and, waiving the
discussion of the rest, to limit himself to the

plying, as it were, a microscope to a small
space, will present to the view much that a
wider survey would not have exhibited.
§. 3.
It may be useful for one who is about thus
to lay down his propositions, to ask himself
these three questions: first, What is the fact?
secondly, Why (i. e. from what Cause) is it
so? or, in other words, how is it accounted
for? and thirdly, What Consequence results
from it?
The last two of these questions, though they
will not in every case suggest such answers as
are strictly to be called the Cause and the
Consequence of the principal truth to be
maintained, may, at least, often furnish such
propositions as bear a somewhat similar relation
to it.
It is to be observed, that in recommending
the writer to begin by laying down in his own
mind the propositions to be maintained, it is
not meant to be implied that they are always
to be stated first; that will depend upon the
nature of the case; and rules will hereafter be
given on that point.

view to an ulterior conclusion: those propo-
sitions which are intended to serve as premises,
being called, in allowable conformity with
popular usage, Arguments; it being customary
to argue in the enthymematic form, and to call,
for brevity's sake, the expressed premiss of an

clusion of it is proved.

The business of Logic is, as Cicero complains,
to judge of arguments, not to invent them:

The knowledge again, in each case, of the
subject in hand, is essential; but it is evidently
borrowed from the science or system conversant
about that subject-matter, whether Politics,
Theology, Law, Ethics, or any other. The

Various di-
visions of
belong exclusively to Rhetoric, since Poetry
has at least as much to do with that branch.
Nor are the considerations relative to Style and
Elocution confined to argumentative and per-
suasive compositions. The art of inventing and
arranging Arguments is, as has been said, the
only province that Rhetoric can claim entirely
and exclusively.
Arguments are divided according to several
Arguments. different principles; i. e. logically speaking,
there are several divisions of them. And these
cross-divisions have proved a source of endless
perplexity to the Logical and Rhetorical
student, because the writers on those sub-
jects have not been aware of them. Hardly
any thing perhaps has contributed so much
to lessen the interest and the utility of systems
of Rhetoric, as the indistinctness hence result-
ing. When in any subject the members of a
division are not opposed, but are in fact
members of different divisions crossing each
other, it is manifestly impossible to obtain any
clear notion of the Species treated of; nor will
any labour or ingenuity bestowed on the subject
be of the least avail, till the original source of
perplexity is removed ;-till, in short, the cross-
division is detected and explained.

Fourthly, into Arguments from " Example,??
from "Testimony," from "Cause to Effect,"
from " Analogy," &c. &c.
It will be perceived, on attentive examination,
that several of the different species just men-
tioned will occasionally contain each other;
e. g. a Probable Argument may be at the same
time a Categorical Argument, a Direct Argu-
ment, and an Argument from Testimony, &c.;
this being the consequence of Arguments having
been divided on several different principles; a
circumstance so obvious the moment it is dis-
tinctly stated, that I apprehend such of my
readers as have not been conversant in these
studies will hardly be disposed to believe that
it could have been (as is the fact) generally
overlooked, and that eminent writers should
have been involved in in-
extricable confusion. I need only remind

as it is mentioned, may nevertheless fail to occur,
even to men of considerable ingenuity.
Forms of
Division of It will also be readily perceived, on exa-
Arguments. mining the principles of these several divisions,
that the last of them alone is properly and
strictly a division of Arguments as such. The
first is evidently a division of the Forms of
stating them; for every one would allow that
the same Argument may be either stated as an
enthymeme, or brought into the strict syllogistic
form; and that, either categorically or hypo-
thetically, &c., e. g. "Whatever has a begin-
ning has a cause; the earth had a beginning,
therefore it had a cause;" or, "If the earth
had a beginning, it had a cause: it had a be-
ginning," &c. every one would call the same
Argument, differently stated. This, therefore,
evidently is not a division of Arguments as
such.

Arguments, ments according to their subject-matter, whether

human affairs the propositions which we assume

rules; and in Physics, though they must be
true as long as the laws of nature remain
undisturbed, the contradiction of them does not,
imply an absurdity; and the conclusions of
course, in each case, have the same degree and
kind of certainty with the premises. This

they consist.

clusion to disprove one of the premises: (i. e.
to prove its contradictory:) since the alternative
proposed in every valid Argument is, either
to admit the conclusion, or to deny one of the
premises. Now it may so happen that in
some cases, one person will choose the former,
and another the latter, of these alternatives.
It is probable, e. g. that many have been induced
to admit the doctrine of Transubstantiation,
from its clear connection with the infallibi-
lity of the Romish Church; and many others,
by the very same Argument, have surrendered
their belief in that infallibility. Again, Berkeley

and Reid seem to have alike admitted that the
non-existence of matter was a necessary con-.
sequence of Locke's Theory of Ideas: but
the former was hence led, bonâ fide, to admit.
and advocate that non-existence; while the
latter was led by the very same Argument to
reject the Ideal Theory. Thus, we see it is
possible for the very same Argument to be.
Direct to one person, and Indirect to another;
leading them to different results, according as
they judge the original conclusion, or the contra-
dictory of a premiss, to be the more probable.
This, therefore, is not properly a division of
Arguments as such, but a division of the
purposes for which they are employed.
Division of

Arguments The fourth, which alone is properly a divi-
sion of Arguments as such, and accordingly
will be principally treated of, is a division ac-.
cording to the "relation of the subject-matter
of the premises to that of the conclusion." I
say, "of the subject-matter," because the logical
connection between the premises and conclu-
sion is independent of the meaning of the terms
employed, and may be exhibited with letters of
the alphabet substituted for the terms; but the
relation I am now speaking of between the
premises and conclusion, (and the varieties of
which form the several species of Arguments,)
is in respect of their subject-matter; as e. g.

an Argument from Cause to Effect" is so
called and considered, in reference to the rela-
tion existing between the premiss, which is the
Cause, and the conclusion, which is the Effect;
and an "Argument from Example," in like
manner, from the relation between a known
and an unknown instance, both belonging to the
same class. And it is plain that the present
division, though it has a reference to the
subject-matter of the premises, is yet not a
division of propositions considered by them-
selves, (as in the case with the division into
"probable" and "demonstrative,”) but of Argu-
ments considered as such; for when we say,
e. g. that the premiss is a Cause, and the conclu-
sion the Effect, these expressions are evidently
relative, and have no meaning, except in
reference to each other; and so also when we
say that the premiss and the conclusion are
two parallel cases, that very expression denotes
their relation to each other.

In distributing, then, the several kinds of Two classes
Arguments, according to this division, it will ment
be found convenient to lay down first two great
classes, under one or other of which all can be
brought; viz. first, such Arguments as might
have been employed to account for the fact

or principle maintained, supposing its truth
granted secondly, such as could not be so
employed. The former class (to which in this
Treatise the name of "A priori" Argument
will be confined) is manifestly Argument from
Cause to Effect; since to account for any
thing, signifies, to assign the Cause of it. The
other class, of course, comprehends all other
Arguments; of which there are several kinds,
which will be mentioned hereafter.
The two sorts of proof which have been just
spoken of, Aristotle seems to have intended
to designate by the titles of or for the latter,
and, or for the former; but he has not been
so clear as could be wished in observing the
distinction between them. The only decisive
test by which to distinguish the Arguments
which belong to the one and to the other, of
these classes, is, to ask the question, "Supposing
the proposition in question to be admitted,
would this Argument serve to account for the
truth, or not ?" It will then be readily
referred to the former or to the latter class,
according
as the answer is in the affirmative
or the negative, as, e. g. if a murder were
imputed to any one on the grounds of his
hatred to the deceased, and an
having а
interest in his death," the Argument would
belong to
the former class; because, supposing

37
his guilt to be admitted, and an inquiry to be
made how he came to commit the murder, the
circumstances just mentioned would serve to
account for it; but not so, with respect to such
an Argument as his "having blood on his
clothes;" which would therefore be referred to
the other class.
And here let it be observed, once for all, that
when I speak of arguing from Cause to Effect,
it is not intended to maintain the real and
proper efficacy of what are called Physical
Causes to produce their respective Effects, nor
to enter into any discussion of the controversies
which have been raised on that point, which
would be foreign from the present purpose.
The word "Cause," therefore, is to be under-
stood as employed in the popular sense; as well
as the phrase of "accounting for" any fact.
from cause
As far, then, as any Cause, popularly speak- Argument
ing, has a tendency to produce a certain Effect, to effect.
so far its existence is an Argument for that
of the Effect. If the Cause be fully sufficient,
and no impediments intervene, the Effect in
question follows certainly; and the nearer we
approach to this, the stronger the Argument.
This is the kind of Argument which produces
(when short of absolute certainty) that species
of the Probable which is usually called the
Plausible. On this subject Dr. Campbell has Plausibi-
lity.

some valuable remarks in his Philosophy of
Rhetoric, (book i. § 5. ch. vii.) though he has
been led into a good deal of perplexity, partly
by not having logically analyzed the two species
of probabilities he is treating of, and partly by
departing, unnecessarily, from the ordinary use
of terms, in treating of the Plausible as some-
thing distinct from the Probable, instead of
regarding it as a species of Probability.
This is the chief kind of Probability which
poets, or other writers of fiction, aim at; and in
such works it is often designated by the term
"natural"." Writers of this class, as they aim
not at producing belief, are allowed to take
'I do not mean, however, that every thing to which the
term "plausible" would apply, would be in strict propriety
called "probable;" as e. g. if we had fully ascertained
some story that had been told us to be an imposition, we
might still say, it was a plausible tale; though, subsequent
to the detection, the word "probable" would not be so
properly applied. But certainly common usage warrants
the use of "probable” in many cases, on the ground of this
plausibility alone; viz. the adequacy of some cause, known,
or likely to exist, to produce the effect in question.
It is also important for them, though not so essential,
to keep clear of the improbable air produced by the intro-
duction of events, which, though not unnatural, have a
great preponderance of chances against them. The dis-
tinction between these two kinds of faults is pointed out in
a passage in the Quarterly Review, for which see Ap-
pendix, [A.]

their "Causes" for granted, (i. e. to assume
any hypothesis they please,) provided they
make the Effects follow naturally; representing,
that is, the personages of the fiction as acting,
and the events as resulting, in the same manner
as might have been expected, supposing the
assumed circumstances to have been real. And
hence, the great Father of Criticism establishes
his paradoxical maxim, that impossibilities
which appear probable, are to be preferred to
possibilities which appear improbable. For, as
he justly observes, the impossibility of the
hypothesis, as e. g. in Homer, the familiar
intercourse of gods with mortals, is no bar to
the kind of Probability (i. e. Verisimilitude)
required, if those mortals are represented as
acting in the manner men naturally would have
done under those circumstances.
The Probability, then, which the writer of
fiction aims at, has, for the reason just mentioned,
no tendency to produce a particular, but only
a general, belief; i. e. not that these particular
events actually took place, but that such are
likely, generally, to take place under such
circumstances: this kind of belief (uncon-
sciously entertained) being necessary, and all
On which ground Aristotle contends that the end of
Fiction is more Philosophical than that of History, since it
aims at general, instead of particular, Truth.

that is necessary, to produce that sympathetic
feeling which is the writer's object. In Argu-
mentative Compositions however, as the object
of course is to produce conviction as to the
particular point in question, the Causes from
which our Arguments are drawn must be such
as are either admitted, or may be proved to be
actually existing, or likely to exist.
On the appropriate use of this kind of Argu-
ment, (which is probably the sixòs of Aristotle,
though unfortunately he has not furnished any
example of it,) some Rules will be laid down
hereafter; my object at present having been
merely to ascertain the nature of it. And here
it may be worth while to remark, that though I
have applied to this mode of Reasoning the
title of "a priori," it is not meant to be
maintained that all such Arguments as have
been by other writers so designated correspond
precisely with what has been
just
described'.
i
Some Rhetorical students, accordingly, partly with a
view to keep clear of any ambiguity that might hence arise,
and partly for the sake of brevity, have found it useful to
adopt, in drawing up an outline or analysis of any compo-
sition, certain arbitrary symbols, to denote, respectively,
each class of Arguments and of Propositions; viz. A, for
the former of the two classes of Arguments just described,
(to denote "A priori," or " Antecedent," probability,) and
B, for the latter, which, as consisting of several different
kinds, may be denominated "the Body
of evidence."

The phrase," a priori" Argument, is not, in-
deed, employed by all in the same sense; it
would however generally be understood to ex-
tend to any argument drawn from an antecedent
or forerunner, whether a Cause or not; e. g.
"the mercury sinks, therefore it will rain."
Now this Argument being drawn from a circum-
stance which though an antecedent, is in no
sense a Cause, would fall not under the former,
but the latter, of the classes laid down; since
when rain comes, no one would account for the
phenomenon by the falling of the mercury;
which they would call a Sign of rain; and yet
most, perhaps, would class this among α

sion, "a posteriori" Arguments, would not in
its ordinary use coincide precisely, though it
would very nearly, with the second class of

Again, they designate the proposition, which accounts for
the principal and original assertion, by a small "a," or
Greek, to denote its identity in substance with the Argu-
ment bearing the symbol "A," though employed for a
different purpose; viz. not to establish a fact that is
doubtful, but to account for one that is admitted. The
proposition, again, which results as a Consequence or
Corollary from the principal one, they designate by the
symbol C. There seems to be the same convenience in
the use of these symbols as Logicians have found in the
employment of A, E, I, O, to represent the four kinds of
Propositions according to quantity and quality.

Arguments. The division, however, which has
here been adopted, appears to be both more
philosophical, and also more precise, and conse-
quently more practically useful, than any other;
since there is so easy and decisive a test by
which an Argument may be at once referred to
the one or to the other of the classes described.
§. 3.
The second, then, of these classes, (viz.
Arguments which could not be used to
account for the fact in question, supposing
it granted,") may be subdivided into two
kinds; which will be designated by the terms
Sign" and " Example."
66
66
By "Sign," (so called from the Equo of
Aristotle,) is meant a species of Argument of
which the analysis is as follows; As far as any
circumstance is, what may be called, a Condition
of the existence of a certain effect or phe-
nomenon, so far it may be inferred from the
existence of that Effect: if it be a Condition
absolutely essential, the Argument is, of course,
demonstrative; and the Probability is the stronger
in proportion as we approach to that case.
Of this kind is the Argument in the instance
lately given a man is suspected as the perpe-
trator of the supposed murder, from the circum-
stance of his clothes being bloody; the murder

being considered as in a certain degree a probable
condition of that appearance; i. e. it is presumed
that his clothes would not otherwise have been
bloody. Again, from the appearance of ice,
we infer, decidedly, the existence of a tempe-
rature below freezing point; that temperature
being an essential Condition of the crystalliza-
tion of water.
66
cause.
Among the circumstances which are con- Proof of a
ditional to any Effect, must evidently come the
Cause or Causes; and if there be only one
possible Cause, this being absolutely essential,
may be demonstratively proved from the Effect:
if the same Effect might result from other
Causes, then the Argument is, at best, but
probable. But it is to be observed, that there
are also many circumstances which have no
tendency to produce a certain Effect, though it
cannot exist without them, and from which
Effect, consequently, they may be inferred, as
Conditions, though not Causes; e. g. a man's
being alive one day," is a circumstance ne-
cessary, as a Condition, to his "dying the
next;" but has no tendency to produce it; his
having been alive, therefore, on the former day,
may be proved from his subsequent death, but
not vice versâk.
It is however very common, in the carelessness of
ordinary language, to mention, as the Causes of phe-

It is to be observed therefore, that though it
is very common for the Cause to be proved
from its Effect, it is never so proved, so far
forth as [] it is a Cause, but so far forth as it is
a condition, or necessary circumstance.
A Cause, again, may be employed to prove
an Effect, (this being the first class of Argu-
ments already described,) so far as it has a
tendency to produce the Effect, even though it
be not at all necessary to it; (i. e. when other
Causes may produce the same Effect;) and
in this case, though the Effect may be inferred
from the Cause, the Cause cànnot be inferred
from the Effect; e. g. from a mortal wound you
may
infer death, but not vice versa.
Lastly, when a Cause is also a necessary
or probable condition, i. e. when it is the only
possible or only likely Cause, then we may
argue both ways; e. g. we may infer a General's
success from his known skill, or, his skill, from
nomena, circumstances which every one would allow, on
consideration, to be not Causes, but only conditions, of the
Effects in question; e. g. it would be said of a tender plant,
that it was destroyed in consequence of not being covered
with a mat; though every one would mean to imply
that the frost destroyed it; this being a Cause too well
known to need being mentioned; and that which is spoken
of as the Cause, viz. the absence of a covering, being only
the Condition, without which the real Cause could not
have operated.

his known success: these two Arguments
belonging, respectively, to the two classes ori-
ginally laid down. And it is to be observed, Logical and

that, in such Arguments from Sign as this last, sequence.
the conclusion which follows, logically, from
the premiss, being the Cause from which the
premiss follows, physically, (i. e. as a natural
Effect,) there are in this case two different kinds
of Sequence opposed to each other; e. g.
"With many of them God was not well-
pleased; for they were overthrown in the wilder-
ness." In Arguments of the first class, on the
contrary, these two kinds of Sequence are
combined; i. e. the Conclusion which follows
logically from the premiss, is also the Effect
following physically from it as a Cause; a
General's skill, e. g. being both the Cause and
the Proof of his being likely to succeed.
It is most important to keep in mind the
distinction between these two kinds of Sequence,
which are, in Argument, sometimes combined,
and sometimes opposed. There is no more
fruitful source of confusion of thought than that
ambiguity of the language employed on these
subjects, which tends to confound together
these two things, so entirely distinct in their
nature. There is hardly any argumentative
writer on subjects involving a discussion of
the Causes or Effects of any thing, who has

clearly perceived and steadily kept in view the
distinction I have been speaking of, or who has
escaped the errors and perplexities thence re-
sulting. The wide extent accordingly, and the
importance of the mistakes and difficulties
arising out of the ambiguity complained of,
is incalculable. To dilate upon this point as
fully as might be done with advantage, would
exceed my present limits; but it will not be
irrelevant to offer some remarks on the origin of
the ambiguity complained of, and on the cau-
tions to be used in guarding against being
misled by it.
The premiss by which any thing is proved, is
not necessarily the Cause of the fact's being
such as it is; but it is the Cause of our knowing
and being convinced that it is so; e. g. the
wetness of the earth is not the Cause of rain,
but it is the Cause of our knowing that it has
rained. These two things, the premiss which
produces our conviction, and the Cause which
produces that of which we are convinced, are
the more likely to be confounded together,
in the looseness of colloquial language, from the
circumstance that (as has been above remarked)
they frequently coincide; as, e. g. when we
infer that the ground will be wet, from the fall
of rain which produces that wetness. And
hence it is that the same words have come to be

47
applied, in common, to each kind of Sequence;
e. g. an Effect is said to "follow" from a Cause,
and a Conclusion to "follow" from the Pre-
mises; the words "Cause" and "Reason,"
are each applied indifferently, both to a Cause,
properly so called, and to the Premiss of an

speaking, should be confined to the latter..

The multitude of the words which bear this
double meaning (and that, in all languages).
greatly increases our liability to be misled by it;
since thus the very means men resort to for
ascertaining the sense of any expression, are
infected with the very same ambiguity; e. g. if
we enquire what is meant by a "Cause," we
shall be told that it is that from which some-
thing "follows;" or, which is indicated by the
words "therefore," "consequently," &c. all.
which expressions are as equivocal and uncertain
in their signification as the original one. It
is in vain to attempt ascertaining by the balance
the true amount of any commodity, if false
weights are placed in the opposite scale. Hence
it is that so many writers, in investigating the
Cause to which any fact or phenomenon is to be
attributed, have assigned that which is not a

Cause, but only a Proof that the fact is so;
and have thus been led into an endless train of
errors and perplexities.
Several, however, of the words in question,
though employed indiscriminately in both signi-
fications, seem (as was observed in the case of
the word "Reason") in their primary and strict
sense to be confined to one. "A" in Greek,
and "ergo," or " itaque," in Latin, seem
originally and properly to denote the Sequence
of Effect from Cause; "aga"," and " igitur,"
that of conclusion from premises. The English
word "accordingly," will generally be found to
correspond with the Latin " itaque."

The interrogative "why," is employed to
of "Why." enquire, either, first, the "Reason," (or "Proof;")
secondly, the "Cause;" or thirdly, the "object
proposed," or Final-Cause: e. g. first, Why are
the angles of a triangle equal to two right
angles? secondly, Why are the days shorter in
winter than in summer? thirdly, Why are the
works of a watch constructed as they are"?

the Testimony would not have been given, had
it not been true,) can this Argument have any
force.
Testimony is of various kinds; but the dis-
tinction between them is so obvious, as well as
the various circumstances which add to, or
diminish the weight of any Testimony, that it is
not necessary to enter into any detailed discus-

sion of the subject. It may be worth remarking,
however, that one of the most important dis-
tinctions is between Testimony to matters of
Fact, and to Doctrines or opinions: in estimat-
ing the weight of the former, we look chiefly to
the honesty of the witness, and his means of
obtaining information; in the latter, his ability
to judge is equally to be taken into consideration.
With respect however to the credibility of
witnesses, it is evident that when many coincide
in their testimony, (where no previous concert
can have taken place,) the probability resulting
from this concurrence does not rest on the
supposed veracity of each considered separately,
but on the improbability of such an agreement
Concurrent taking place by chance. For though in such a
case each of the witnesses should be considered
as unworthy of credit, and even much more
likely to speak falsehood than truth, still the
chances might be infinite against their all
agreeing in the same falsehood. This remark

"It deserves likewise to be attended to on this subject,
that in a number of concurrent testimonies, (in cases
wherein there could have been no previous concert,) there
is a probability distinct from that which may be termed the
sum of the probabilities resulting from the testimonies of
the witnesses, a probability which would remain even
though the witnesses were of such a character as to merit
no faith at all. This probability arises purely from the
concurrence itself. That such a concurrence should spring

is applied by Dr. Campbell to the Argument
from Testimony; but he might have extended
it to other Arguments also, in which a similar
calculation of chances will enable us to draw
a Conclusion, sometimes even amounting to
moral certainty, from a combination of data
which singly would have had little or no weight;
e. g. if any one out of a hundred men throw
a stone which strikes a certain object P, there is
but a slight probability, from that fact alone,
that he aimed at that object; but if all the
hundred threw stones which struck the same
object, no one would doubt that they aimed at
it. It is from such a combination of Argument
that we infer the existence of an intelligent
Creator from the marks of contrivance visible in
the Universe, though many of these are such as,
taken singly, might well be conceived undesigned
and accidental; but that they should all be
such, is morally impossible. Great care is
requisite in setting forth clearly, especially in
any popular discourse, Arguments of this na-
ture; the generality of men being better qualified
from chance, is as one to infinite; that is, in other words,
morally impossible. If therefore concert be excluded, there
remains no other cause but the reality of the fact." Camp-

for understanding, (to use Lord Bacon's words,)
"particulars, one by one," than for taking a
comprehensive view of the whole; and therefore
in a Galaxy of evidence, as it may be called, in
which the brilliancy of no single star can be
pointed out, the lustre of the combination is
often lost on them. Hence it is, as was re-
marked in the Treatise on Fallacies, that the
sophism of "Composition," as it is called, so
frequently misleads men: it is not improbable,
(in the above example,) that each of the stones,
considered separately, may have been thrown
at random: and therefore the same is concluded
of all, considered in conjunction. Not that in
such an instance as this, any one would reason
so weakly; but that a still greater absurdity of
the very same kind is involved in the rejection
of the evidences of our religion, will be plain
to any one who considers, not merely the in-
dividual force, but the number and variety of
those evidences 9.

case, where it leads to a manifest absurdity,
a metaphysical objection may still be urged
against many cases in which we thus reason
from calculation of chances; an objection not
likely indeed practically to influence any one,
but which may afford the Sophist a triumph
over those who are unable to find a solution.
If it were answered then to those who maintain
that the universe, which exhibits so many marks
of design, might be the work of non-intelligent
causes, that no one would believe it possible for
such a work as the Iliad, e. g. to be produced
by a fortuitous shaking together of the letters of
the alphabet, the Sophist might challenge us to
explain why even this last supposition should be
regarded as less probable than any other; since
the letters of which the Iliad is composed,
if shaken together at random, must fall in some
form or other; and though the chances are
millions of millions to one against that, or any
other determinate order, there are precisely as
many chances against one, as against another,
whether more or less regular: and in like manner,
astonished as we should be, and convinced of
the intervention of artifice, if we saw any one
draw out all the cards in a pack in regular
sequences, it is demonstrable that the chances
are not more against that order, than against any
one determinate order we might choose to fix

upon. The multitude of the chances, therefore,
he would say, against any series of events, does
not constitute it improbable; since the like
happens to every one every day; e. g. a man
walking through London streets on his business,
meets accidentally hundreds of others passing to
and fro on theirs; and he would not say at the
close of the day that any thing improbable had
occurred to him; yet it would almost baffle
calculation to compute the Chances against his
meeting precisely those very persons, in the
order, and at the times and places of his meeting
each. The paradox thus seemingly established,
though few might be practically misled by it,
many would be at a loss to solve.
The truth is, that any supposition is justly
called improbable, not from the number of
chances against it, considered independently,
but from the number of chances against it
compared with those which lie against some
other supposition: we call the drawing of a
prize in the lottery improbable, though there be
but five to one against it, because there are more
chances of a blank; on the other hand, if any
one were cast on a desert island under circum-
stances which warranted his believing that the
chances were a hundred to one against any one's
having been there before him, yet if he found

distinctly the letters of a man's name, he would
not only conclude it probable, but absolutely
certain that some human being had been there;
because there would be millions of chances
against those forms having been produced by
the fortuitous action of the waves. So also, in
the instance above given, any unmeaning form
into which a number of letters might fall, would
not be called improbable, countless as the
chances are against that particular order, because
there are just as many against each one of all
other unmeaning forms; but if the letters
formed a coherent poem, it would then be called
incalculably improbable that this form should
have been fortuitous, though the chances against
it remain the very same; because there must be
much fewer chances against the supposition of
its having been the work of design. The
probability in short, of any supposition, is esti-
mated from a comparison with each of its
alternatives.
The foregoing observations however, as was
above remarked, are not confined to Arguments
from Testimony, but apply to all cases in which
the degree of probability is estimated from a
calculation of chances.

§. 5.
Before I dismiss the consideration of Signs,
it may be worth while to notice another case of
combined Argument different from the one
lately mentioned, yet in some degree resembling
it. The combination just spoken of is where
several Testimonies or other Signs, singly
perhaps of little weight, produce jointly, and by
their coincidence, a degree of probability far
exceeding the sum of their several forces, taken
separately; in the case I am now about to
notice, the combined force of the series of
Arguments results from the order in which
they are considered, and from their progressive
tendency to establish a certain conclusion. E. g.
one part of the law of nature called the "vis
inertiæ," is established by the Argument alluded
to; viz. that a body set in motion will eternally
continue in motion with uniform velocity in
a right line, so far as it is not acted upon by any
causes which retard or stop, accelerate or divert,
its course. Now, as in every case which can
come under our observation, some such causes
do intervene, the assumed supposition, is practi-
cally impossible, and we have no opportunity of
verifying the law by direct experiment; but we
may gradually approach indefinitely near to
the case supposed: and on the result of such

find that when a body is projected along a rough
surface, its motion is speedily retarded and soon
stopped; if along a smoother surface, it con-
tinues longer in motion; if upon ice, longer
still; and the like with regard to wheels, &c. in
proportion as we gradually lessen the friction of
the machinery; if we remove the resistance
of the air, by setting a wheel or pendulum
in motion under an air-pump, the motion is
still longer continued. Finding then that the
effect of the original impulse is more and more
protracted, in proportion as we more and more
remove the impediments to motion from friction
and resistance of the air, we reasonably con-
clude that if this could be completely done,
(which is out of our power,) the motion would
never cease, since what appear to be the only
causes of its cessation, would be absent.
Again, in arguing for the existence and
moral attributes of the Deity from the authority
of men's opinions, great use may be made
of a like progressive course of Argument, though
it has been often overlooked. Some have
argued for the being of a God from the universal,

or at least, general, consent of mankind; and
some have appealed to the opinions of the
wisest and most cultivated portion, respecting
both the existence and the moral excellence
of the Deity. It cannot be denied that there is
a presumptive force in each of these Arguments;
but it
may
be answered that it is conceivable an
opinion common to almost all the species, may
possibly be an error resulting from a con-
stitutional infirmity of the human intellect;—
that if we are to acquiesce in the belief of the
majority, we shall be led to Polytheism; such
being the creed of the greater part and that
though more weight may reasonably be attached
to the opinions of the wisest and best-instructed,
still, as we know that such men are not exempt
from error, we cannot be perfectly safe in
adopting the belief they hold, unless we are
convinced that they hold it in consequence
their being the wisest and best instructed; so
far forth as they are such. Now this is pre-
cisely the point which may be established by
the above-mentioned progressive Argument.
Nations of Atheists, if there are any such,
are confessedly among the rudest and most
ignorant savages:
those who represent their
God or Gods as
malevolent, capricious, or
subject to human passions and vices, are in-
variably to be found (in the present day at

least) among those who are brutal and unci-
vilized; and among the most civilized nations
of the ancients, who professed a similar creed,
the more enlightened members of society seem
either to have rejected altogether, or to have
explained away, the popular belief. The Ma-
hometan nations, again, of the present day,
who are certainly more advanced in civilization
than their Pagan neighbours, maintain the
unity and the moral excellence of the Deity;
but the nations of Christendom, whose notions
of the Divine goodness are more exalted, are
undeniably the most civilized part of the world,
and possess, generally speaking, the most
cultivated and improved intellectual powers.
Now if we would ascertain, and appeal to, the
sentiments of man as a rational being, we must
surely look to those which not only prevail
most among the most rational and cultivated,
but towards which also a progressive tendency
is found in men in proportion to their degrees of
rationality and cultivation. It would be most
extravagant to suppose that man's advance
towards a more improved and exalted state of
existence should tend to obliterate true and
instil false notions. On the contrary we are
authorized to conclude, that those notions would
be the most correct, which men would entertain,
whose knowledge, intelligence, and intellectual

cultivation should have reached the highest
pitch of perfection; and that those consequently
will approach the nearest to the truth, which
are entertained, more or less, by various nations,
in proportion as they have advanced towards
this civilized state.
Many other instances might be adduced,
in which truths of the highest importance may
be elicited by this process of Argumentation ;
which will enable us to decide with sufficient
probability what consequence would follow
from an hypothesis which we have never ex-
perienced. It might, not improperly, be termed
the Argument from Progressive Approach.
§. 6.
The third kind of Arguments to be considered,
being the other branch of the second of the two
classes originally laid down, may be treated
of under the general name of Example, taking
that term in its widest acceptation, so as to
comprehend the Arguments designated by the
various names of Induction, Experience, Ana-
logy, Parity of Reasoning, &c. all of which
are essentially the same, as far as regards the
fundamental principles I am here treating of;
for in all the Arguments designated by these
names it will be found, that we consider one or
more, known, individual objects or instances, of

61
a certain Class, as fair specimens, in respect
of some point or other, of that class; and
consequently draw an inference from them
respecting either the whole Class, or other, less
known, individuals of it.
In Arguments of this kind then it will be
found, that, universally, we assume as a major
premiss that what is true (in regard to the
point in question) of the individual or indi-
viduals which we bring forward and appeal
to, is true of the whole Class to which they
belong; the minor premiss next asserts some-
thing of that individual; and the same is then
inferred respecting the whole Class; whether
we stop at that general conclusion, or descend
from thence to another, unknown, individual; in
which last case, which is the most usually called
the Argument from Example, we generally omit,
for the sake of brevity, the intermediate step,
and pass at once, in the expression of the
Argument, from the known, to the unknown,
individual. This ellipsis however does not, as
some seem to suppose, make any essential
difference in the mode of Reasoning; the
reference to a common Class being always, in
such a case, understood, though not expressed;
for it is evident that there can be no reasoning
from one individual to another, unless they

come under some common genus, and are
considered in that point of view; e. g.
66
Astronomy was de-
cried at its first intro-
duction, as adverse to
religion:
therefore
Geology is likely to
be decried, &c.
therefore
every Science is likely to be decried at its
first introduction, as adverse to religion."
This kind of Example, therefore, appears
to be a compound Argument, consisting of two
enthymemes; and when (as often happens) we
infer from a known Effect a certain Cause, and
again, from that Cause, another, unknown
Effect, we then unite in this example, the argu-
ment from Effect to Cause, and that from Cause
to Effect, e. g. we may from the marks of
Divine benevolence in this world argue, that
"the like will be shewn in the next;" through
the intermediate conclusion, that " God is bene-
volent." This is not indeed always the case;
but there seems to be in every Example, a
reference to some Cause, though that Cause
may frequently be unknown; e. g. we suppose,
in the instance above given, that there is some

Cause, though we may be at a loss to assign
it, which leads men generally to decry a new
Science.
The term "Induction" is commonly applied Induction.
to such Arguments as stop short at the general
conclusion; and is thus contradistinguished, in
common use, from Example. There is also this
additional difference, that when we draw a
general conclusion from several individual cases,
we use the word Induction in the singular num-
ber; while each one of these cases, if the appli-
cation were made to another individual, would
be called a distinct Example. This difference,
however, is not essential; since whether the
inference be made from one instance or from
several, it is equally called an Induction, if
a general conclusion be legitimately drawn.
And this is to be determined by the nature
of the subject-matter; in the investigation of
the laws of nature, a single experiment, fairly
and carefully made, is usually allowed to be
conclusive, because we can then pretty nearly
ascertain all the circumstances operating a
Chemist who had ascertained, in a single speci-
men of gold, its capability of combining with
mercury, would not think it necessary to try
the same experiment with several other speci-

those metals universally, and with certainty;

Experience.
in human affairs on the contrary, our uncertainty
respecting many of the circumstances, that may
affect the result, obliges us to collect many
coinciding instances to warrant even a probable
conclusion. From one instance, e, g. of the
assassination of an Usurper, it would not be
allowable to infer the certainty, or even the
probability, of a like fate attending all Usurpers.
Experience, in its original and proper sense,
is applicable to the premises from which we
argue, not to the inference we draw. Strictly
speaking, we know by Experience only the
past, and what has passed under our own
observation; thus, we know by Experience
that the tides have daily ebbed and flowed,
during such a time; and from the Testimony of
others as to their own Experience, that they
have formerly done so; and from this Expe-
rience, we conclude, by Induction, that the
same Phenomenon will continuet.
The word Analogy again is generally em-
ployed in the case of Arguments in which the
instance adduced is somewhat more remote from
that to which it is applied; e. g. a physician
would be said to know by Experience the

resemblance is less, between a man and a brute,
than between one man and another; and ac-
cordingly it is found that many brutes are not
acted upon by some drugs which are pernicious
to man. But more strictly speaking, Analogy
ought to be distinguished from direct resem-
blance, with which it is often confounded in the
language even of eminent writers (especially on
Chemistry and Natural History) in the present
day. Analogy being a "resemblance of ratios","
that should strictly be called an Argument from
Analogy, in which the two things (viz. the one
from which, and the one to which we argue) are
not themselves alike, but stand in similar
relations to some other things; or, in other
words, that the common genus which they both
fall under, consists in a relation. Thus an egg
and a seed are not in themselves alike, but bear
a like relation to the parent bird and to her
future nestling, on the one hand, aud to the old
and young plant on the other, respectively;

this relation being the genus which both fall
under and many Arguments might be drawn
from this Analogy. Again the fact that from
birth different persons have different bodily
constitutions, in respect of complexion, stature,
strength, shape, liability to particular disorders,
&c. which constitutions, however, are capable
of being, to a certain degree, modified by
regimen, medicine, &c. affords an Analogy
by which we may form a presumption, that the
like takes place in respect of mental qualities
also; though it is plain that there can be no
direct resemblance either between body and
mind, or their respective attributes.
In this kind of Argument, one error, which is
very common, and which is to be sedulously
avoided, is that of concluding the things in
question to be alike, because they are Ana-
logous;-to resemble each other in themselves,
because there is a resemblance in the relation
they bear to certain other things; which is
manifestly a groundless inference. Another
caution is applicable to the whole class of
Arguments from Example; viz. not to consider
the resemblance of Analogy to extend further
(i. e. to more particulars) than it does. The
resemblance of a picture to the object it repre-
sents, is direct; but it extends no further than
the one sense of seeing is concerned. In the

the same class, are the most dissimilar in
that class. Thus, virtue and vice are called
Contraries, as being, both, "moral habits," and
the most dissimilar of moral habits. Mere
dissimilarity, it is evident, would not constitute
Contrariety; for no one would say that virtue
was contrary to a mathematical problem; the
two things having nothing in common. In this
then, as in other arguments of the same class, we
may infer that the two Contrary terms have
a similar relation to the same third, or, respec-
tively, to two corresponding (i. e. in this case,
Contrary) terms: we may conjecture, g. that
since virtue may be acquired by education,
so may vice; or again, that since virtue leads to
happiness, so does vice to misery.

Aristotle, in his Rhetoric, has divided Ex-
amples into Real and Invented: the one being
drawn from actual matter of fact; the other,
from a supposed case. And he remarks, that
though the latter is more easily adduced, the
former is more convincing. If however due

or even several, historical facts may be appealed. Examples.
to, which being nevertheless exceptions to a
general rule, will not prove the probability of
the conclusion. Thus, from several known
instances of ferocity in black tribes, we are not
authorized to conclude, that blacks are univer-
sally, or generally, ferocious; and in fact, many
instances may be brought forward on the other
side. Whereas in the supposed case, (instanced
by Aristotle, as employed by Socrates,) of
mariners choosing their steersman by lot, though
we have no reason to suppose such a case
ever occurred, we see so plainly the probability,
that if it did occur, the lot might fall on an
unskilful person, to the loss of the ship, that the
argument has considerable weight against the
practice, so common in the ancient republics, of
appointing magistrates by lot.
There is, however, this important difference;
that a fictitious case which has not this intrinsic
probability, has absolutely no weight whatever;
so that of course such arguments might be
multiplied to any amount without the smallest
effect whereas any matter of fact which is well
established, however unaccountable it may seem,
has some degree of weight in reference to a
parallel case; and a sufficient number of such

arguments may fairly establish a general rule,
even though we may be unable, after all, to
account for the alleged fact in any of the
instances; e. g. no satisfactory reason has yet
been assigned for a connection between the
absence of upper cutting teeth, or of the presence
of horns, and rumination; but the instances are
so numerous and constant of this connection,
that no Naturalist would hesitate, if on examin-
ation of a new species he found those teeth
absent, and the head horned, to pronounce
the animal a ruminant. Whereas, on the other
hand, the fable of the countryman, who obtained
from Jupiter the regulation of the weather, and
in consequence found his crops fail, does not go
one step towards proving the intended con-
clusion; because that consequence is a mere
gratuitous assumption without any probability
to support it. There is an instance of a like
error in a tale of Cumberland's, intended to
prove the advantage of a public over a private
education; he represents two brothers educated,
on the two plans respectively; the former turning
out very well, and the latter very ill and had
In fact the assumption there is not only gratuitous, but
is in direct contradiction to experience; for a gardener has,
to a certain degree, the command of rain and sunshine, by
the help of his watering-pots, glasses, hotbeds, and flues;

the whole been matter of fact, a sufficient
number of such instances would have had weight
as an Argument; but as it is a fiction, and
no reason is shewn why the result should be
such as represented, except the supposed
superiority of a public education, the Argument
involves a manifest petitio principii; and re-
sembles the appeal made, in the well-known
fable, to the picture of a man conquering a lion;
a result which might just as easily have been
reversed, and which would have been so, had
lions been painters. It is necessary, in short,

such an event did actually take place, or that,
under a certain hypothesis, it would be likely
to take place.
illustration.
Under the head of Invented Example, a Fable and
distinction is drawn by Aristotle, between

plain that the former corresponds (not to Parable,
in the sense in which we use the word, derived
from that of Tagaßon in the Sacred Writers,
but) to Illustration; the latter to Fable or
Tale. In the former, an allusion only is made
to a case easily supposable; in the latter, a
fictitious story is narrated. Thus, in his in-
stance above cited, of Illustration, if any one,
instead of a mere allusion, should relate a tale,

of mariners choosing a steersman by lot, and
being wrecked in consequence, Aristotle would
evidently have placed that under the head of
Logos. The other method is of course pre-
ferable, from its brevity, whenever the allusion
can be readily understood and accordingly
it is common, in the case of well-known fables,
to allude to, instead of narrating, them. That,
e. g. of the horse and the stag, which he gives,
would, in the present day, be rather alluded
to than told, if we wished to dissuade a people
from calling in a too powerful auxiliary. It
is evident that a like distinction might have been
made in respect of historical examples; those
cases which are well known, being often merely
alluded to, and not recited.
The word "Fable" is at present generally
limited to those fictions in which the resemblance
to the matter in question is not direct, but
analogical; the other class being called Novels,
Tales, &c. Those resemblances are (as Dr. A.
Smith has observed) the most striking, in which
the things compared are of the most dissimilar
nature; as is the case in what we call Fables;
and such accordingly are generally preferred for
argumentative purposes, both from that circum-
stance itself, and also on account of the greater
brevity which is, for that reason, not only

allowed but required in them". For a Fable
spun out to a great length becomes an Allegory,
which generally satiates and disgusts; on the
other hand, a fictitious Tale, having a more
direct, and therefore less striking resemblance to
reality, requires that an interest in the events.
and persons should be created by a longer
detail, without which it would be insipid. The
Fable of the Old Man and the Bundle of Sticks,
compared with the Iliad, may serve to exemplify
what has been said; the moral conveyed by
each being the same, viz. the strength acquired
by union, and the weakness resulting from
division; the latter fiction would be perfectly
insipid if conveyed in a few lines; the former,
in twenty-four books, insupportable.
Of the various uses, and of the real or apparent
refutation, of Examples, (as well as of other
Arguments,) I shall treat hereafter; but it may
be worth while here to observe, that I have been
speaking of Example as a kind of Argument,
and with a view therefore to that purpose alone;

either direct, or analogical, is introduced for other
purposes; viz. not to prove any thing, but
either to illustrate and explain one's meaning,

those of others, between these different pur-
poses.
CHAP. III.
Of the various use and order of the several kinds of
Propositions and of Arguments in different cases.
§. 1.
Arguments
The first rule to be observed is, that it should
of Confuta- be considered, whether the principal object of
satisfaction, the discourse be, to give satisfaction to a candid
tion and of
mind, and convey instruction to those who
are ready to receive it, or to compel the assent,
or silence the objections, of an opponent. The
former of these purposes is, in general, prin-
cipally to be accomplished by the former of
those two great classes into which arguments
were divided; (viz. by those from Cause to
Effect,) the other, by the latter.
To whatever class, however, the Arguments
we resort to may belong, the general tenour
of the reasoning will, in many respects, be
affected by the present consideration. The
distinction in question is nevertheless in general
little attended to. It is usual to call an Argu-

ment, simply, strong or weak, without reference
to the purpose for which it is designed; whereas
the Arguments which afford the most satisfac-
tion to a candid mind, are often such as would
have less weight in controversy than many
others, which again would be less suitable for
the former purpose". E. g.

My meaning cannot be better illustrated than by an
instance referred to in that incomparable specimen of
Reasoning, Dr. Paley's Hora Paulinæ.
"When we take
into our hands the letters," (viz. St. Paul's Epistles,)
"which the suffrage and consent of antiquity hath thus
transmitted to us, the first thing that strikes our attention
is the air of reality and business, as well as of seriousness
and conviction, which pervades the whole. Let the
sceptic read them. If he be not sensible of these qualities
in them, the argument can have no weight with him. If
he be; if he perceive in almost every page the language of
a mind actuated by real occasions, and operating upon real
circumstances; I would wish it to be observed, that the
proof which arises from this perception is not to be deemed
occult or imaginary, because it is incapable of being drawn
out in words, or of being conveyed to the apprehension
of the reader in any other way, than by sending him to the
books themselves." p. 403.
There is also a passage in Dr. A. Smith's Theory of
Moral Sentiments, which illustrates very happily one of the
applications of the principle in question. "Sometimes we
have occasion to defend the propriety of observing the
general rules of justice by the consideration of their
necessity to the support of society. We frequently hear the

rouses, and we are eager to refute and expose such
detestable principles. But though it is their intrinsic
hatefulness and detestableness which originally inflames us
against them, we are unwilling to assign this as the sole
reason why we condemn them, or to pretend that it is
merely because we ourselves hate and detest them. The
reason, we think, would not appear to be conclusive. Yet,
why should it not; if we hate and detest them because they
are the natural and proper objects of hatred and detestation?
But when we are asked why we should not act in such
or such a manner, the very question seems to suppose that,
to those who ask it, this manner of acting does not appear
to be for its own sake the natural and proper object of those
sentiments. We must shew them, therefore, that it ought
to be so for the sake of something else. Upon this account
we generally cast about for other arguments, and the
consideration which first occurs to us, is the disorder and
confusion of society which would result from the universal
prevalence of such practices. We seldom fail, therefore,
to insist upon this topic." (Part ii. sec. ii. p. 151, 152.

from Cause to Effect,) though the testimony
of wise men is also admissible; past Facts,
chiefly by Signs, of various kinds; (that term,
it must be remembered, including Testimony,)
and future events, by Antecedent-probabilities,
and Examples.
Example, however, is not excluded from the
proof of matters of opinion; since a man's
judgment in one case, may be aided or corrected
by an appeal to his judgment in another similar
case. It is in this way that we are directed,
by the highest authority, to guide our judgment
in those questions, in which we are most liable
to deceive ourselves; viz. what, on each oc-
casion, ought to be our conduct towards
another; we are directed to frame for ourselves
a similar supposed case, by imagining ourselves
to change places with our neighbour, and then
considering how, in that case, we should wish
to be treated.
It happens more frequently, however, that,
when in the discussion of matters of opinion,

for Argument, but, strictly speaking, for Illus-
tration;-not to prove the proposition in ques-
tion, but to make it more clearly understood;
e. g. the Proposition maintained by Cicero,
(de Off. book iii.) is what may be accounted a
matter of opinion; viz. that "nothing is ex-
pedient which is dishonourable;" when then
he adduces the Example of the supposed design
of Themistocles to burn the allied fleet, which
he maintains, in contradiction to Aristides,
would not have been expedient, because it
would have been unjust, it is manifest, that we
must understand the instance brought forward
as no more than an Illustration of the general
principle he intends to establish; since it
would be a plain begging of the question to
argue from a particular assertion, which could
only be admitted by those who assented to the
general principle.
It is important to distinguish between these
two uses of Example; that on the one hand
we may not be led to mistake for an Argument
such an one as the foregoing; and that on the
other hand, we may not too hastily charge with
sophistry him who adduces such an one simply
with a view to explanation.

force of Arguments, and Comparisons in-
troduced for the ornament of style, in the form,
either of simile, as it is called, or Metaphor.
Not only is an ingenious comparison often
mistaken for a proof, though it be such as,
when tried by the rules laid down here and in
the treatise on LOGIC, affords no proof at all;
but also on the other hand, a real and valid
argument is not unfrequently considered merely
as an ornament of style, if it happen to be such
as to produce that effect; though there is
evidently no reason why that should not be
fair Analogical Reasoning, in which the new
idea introduced by the Analogy chances to be
a sublime or a pleasing one. E. g. "The ef-
ficacy of penitence, and piety, and prayer, in
rendering the Deity propitious, is not ir-
reconcileable with the immutability of his
nature, and the steadiness of his purposes. It
is not in man's power to alter the course of the

The pleasure derived from taking in the author's mean-
ing, when an ingenious comparison is employed (referred
by Aristotle to the pleasure of the act of learning) is so
great that the reader or hearer is apt to mistake his ap-
prehension of this for a perception of a just and convincing
analogy. See part iii. ch. 2. §. 3.

before him, the sun no longer shines on him;
if he quits the shade, or removes the curtain,
the light is restored to him; and though no
change is in the mean time effected in the
heavenly luminary, but only in himself, the
result is the same as if it were. Nor is the
immutability of God any reason why the re-
turning sinner, who tears away the veil of
prejudice or of indifference, should not again be
blessed with the sunshine of divine favour."
The image here introduced is ornamental, but
the Argument is not the less perfect; since the
case adduced fairly establishes the general
principle required, that " a change effected in
one of two objects having a certain relation to
each other, may have the same practical result
as if it had taken place in the other."
The mistake in question is still more likely
to occur when such an Argument is conveyed
in a single term employed metaphorically; as is
generally the case where the allusion is common
and obvious; e. g. "we do not receive as the
genuine doctrines of the primitive Church what
have passed down the polluted stream of Romish
tradition." The Argument here is not the less
valid for being conveyed in the form of a Meta-
phor.

Men are apt to listen with prejudice to the

to lend an ear to the evidence. And thus, in

when thus used in conjunction, and in the order
prescribed; a sufficient cause being established,
leaves us still at liberty to suppose that there
may be circumstances which will prevent the
effect from taking place; but Examples sub-
joined shew that these circumstances do not,
at least always, prevent that effect; and on the
other hand, Examples introduced at the first,
may be suspected of being exceptions to the
general rule, (unless they are very numerous,)
instead of being instances of it; which an
adequate cause previously assigned will shew
them to be. E. g. if any one had argued, from
the temptations and opportunities occurring to
a military commander, that Buonaparte was
likely to establish a despotism on the ruins of
the French Republic, this Argument, by itself,
would have left men at liberty to suppose that
such a result would be prevented by a jealous
attachment to liberty in the citizens, and a
fellow-feeling of the soldiery with them; then,
the Examples of Cæsar and of O. Cromwell
would have proved, that such preventives are
not to be trusted.
Aristotle accordingly has remarked on the
expediency of not placing Examples in the
foremost rank of Arguments; in which case,
he says, a considerable number would be re-
quisite; whereas, in confirmation, even one will

have much weight. This observation, however,
he omits to extend, as he might have done, to
Testimony and every other kind of Sign, to
which it is no less applicable.
Another reason for adhering to the order here
prescribed is, that if the Argument from Cause
to Effect were placed after the others, a doubt
might often exist, whether we were engaged in
proving the point in question, or (assuming it
as already proved) in seeking only to account for
it; that Argument being, by the very nature of
it, such as would account for the truth con-
tended for, supposing it were granted. Constant
care, therefore, is requisite to guard against any
confusion or indistinctness as to the object in
each case proposed; whether that be, when a
proposition is admitted, to assign a cause which
does account for it, (which is one of the classes
of Propositions formerly noticed,) or, when it is
not admitted, to prove it by an Argument of
that kind which would account for it, if it were
granted.
With a view to the Arrangement of Argu-
ments, no rule is of more importance than the
one now under consideration; and Arrangement
is a more important point than is generally
supposed; indeed it is not perhaps of less con-
sequence in Rhetoric than in the Military Art;
in which it is well known, that with an equality

of forces, in numbers, courage, and every other
point, the manner in which they are drawn up,
so as either to afford mutual support, or, on the
other hand, even to impede and annoy each
other, may make the difference of victory or
defeat.
E. g. in the statement of the Evidences of
our Religion, so as to give them their just weight,
much depends on the Order in which they are
placed.
The Antecedent probability that a
Revelation should be given to man, and that it
should be established by miracles, all would
allow to be, considered by itself, in the absence
of strong direct testimony, utterly insufficient
to establish the Conclusion. On the other
hand, miracles considered abstractedly, as repre-
sented to have occurred without any occasion or
reason for them being assigned, carry with them
such a strong intrinsic improbability as could
not be wholly surmounted even by such evi-
dence as would fully establish any other matters
of fact. But the evidences of the former class,
however inefficient alone towards the esta-
blishment of the Conclusion, have very great
weight in preparing the mind for receiving the
other Arguments; which again, though they
would be listened to with prejudice if not so
supported, will then be allowed their just weight.
The writers in defence of Christianity have not

always attended to this principle; and their
opponents have often availed themselves of the
knowledge of it, by combating in detail, Argu-
ments, the combined force of which would have
been irresistible. They argue respecting the
credibility of the Christian miracles, abstractedly,
as if they were insulated occurrences, without
any known or conceivable purpose; as e. g.
"what testimony is sufficient to establish the
belief that a dead man was restored to life ?" and
then they proceed to shew that the probability of
a Revelation, abstractedly considered, is not such
at least as to establish the fact that one has been
given. Whereas, if it were first proved (as
may easily be done) merely that there is no
such abstract improbability of a Revelation as
to exclude the evidence in favour of it, and that
if one were given, it might be expected to be
supported by miraculous evidence, then, just
enough reason would be assigned for the occur-
rence of miracles, not indeed to establish them,
but to allow a fair hearing for the Arguments
by which they are proved.

the judges (in the celebrated contest concerning
the crown) to confine his adversary to the same
order, in his reply to the charges brought, which
he himself had observed in bringing them for-
ward. Demosthenes however was far too skilful
to be thus entrapped; and so much importance
does he attach to this point, that he opens his
speech with a most solemn appeal to the Judges
for an impartial hearing; which implies, he
says, not only a rejection of prejudice, but no
less also, a permission for each speaker to adopt
whatever Arrangement he should think fit. And
accordingly he proceeds to adopt one very differ-
ent from that which his antagonist had laid
down; for he was no less sensible than his
rival that the same Arrangement which is the
most favourable to one side, is likely to be the
least favourable to the other.
It is to be remembered however, that the rules
which have been given respecting the Order
in which different kinds of Argument should be
arranged, relate only to the different kinds of
Arguments adduced in support of each separate
Proposition; since of course the refutation of
an opposed assertion, effected by means of
Signs, may be followed by an a priori Argu-
ment in favour of our own Conclusion; and the
like in many other such cases.

come first.
A Proposition that is well known (whether when the
easy to be established or not) and which contains and when
nothing particularly offensive, should in general sion should
be stated at once, and the Proofs subjoined ;
but if it be not familiar to the hearers, and
especially if it be likely to be unacceptable, it is
usually better to state the Arguments first, or
at least some of them, and then introduce the
Conclusion.
There is no question relating to Arrangement
more important than the present; and it is
therefore the more unfortunate that Cicero, who
possessed so much practical skill, should have
laid down no rule on this point, (though it is
one which evidently had engaged his attention,)
but should content himself with saying that
sometimes he adopted the one mode and some-
times the other", (which doubtless he did not
do at random,) without distinguishing the cases
in which each is to be preferred, and laying
down principles to guide our decision. Aris-
totle also, when he lays down the two great
heads into which a speech is divisible, the
Proposition and the Proof", is equally silent as
to the order in which they should be placed ;

though he leaves it to be understood, from his
manner of speaking, that the Conclusion (or
Question) is to be first stated, and then the
Premises, as in Mathematics. This indeed is
the usual and natural way of speaking or writing;
viz. to begin by declaring your Opinion, and
then to subjoin the Reasons for it. But there
are many occasions on which it will be of the
highest consequence to reverse this plan. It
will sometimes give an offensively dogmatical
air to a Composition to begin by advancing
some new and unexpected assertion; though
sometimes again this may be advisable, when
the Arguments are such as can be well relied on,
and the principal object is to excite attention,
and awaken curiosity. And accordingly, with
this view, it is not unusual to present some
doctrine, by no means really novel, in a new
and paradoxical shape. But when the Con-
clusion to be established is one likely to hurt the
feelings and offend the prejudices of the hearers,
it is essential to keep out of sight, as much as
possible, the point to which we are tending, till
the principles from which it is to be deduced
shall have been clearly established; because
men listen with prejudice, if at all, to Argu-
ments that are avowedly leading to a Conclu-
sion which they are indisposed to admit ;
whereas if we thus, as it were, mask the battery,

they will not be able to shelter themselves from
the discharge. The observance accordingly, or
neglect, of this rule, will often make the differ-
ence of success or failure.
It may be observed that if the Proposition to
be maintained be such as the hearers are likely
to regard as insignificant, the question should
be at first suppressed; but if there be any
thing offensive to their prejudices, the question
may be stated, but the decision of it, for a time,
kept back.
And it will often be advisable to advance
very gradually to the full statement of the
Proposition required, and to prove it, if one
may so speak, by instalments; establishing sepa-
rately, and in order, each part of the truth in
question. It is thus that Aristotle establishes
many of his doctrines, and among others his
definition of Happiness, in the beginning of the
Nicomachean Ethics; he first proves in what
it does not consist, and then establishes, one
by one, the several points which together con-
stitute his notion.

truth established; (since that will have been
already done in the course of the Argument;)
on the other hand, it will often be advisable
to do this, when Arguments of the other class
have alone been employed.
For it is in every case agreeable and satis-
factory, and may often be of great utility, to
explain, where it can be done, the Causes
which produce an Effect that is itself already
admitted to exist. But it must be remembered
that it is of great importance to make it clearly
appear which object is, in each case, proposed;
whether to establish the fact, or to account for
it; since otherwise we may often be supposed
to be employing a feeble Argument; for that
which is a satisfactory explanation of an ad-
mitted fact, will frequently be such as would be
very insufficient to prove it, supposing it were
doubted.

Refutation of Objections should generally be

to begin with a Refutation; but when this

is not the case, the mention of Objections
in the opening will be likely to give a para-
doxical air to our assertion, by implying a con-
sciousness that much may be said against it.
If again all mention of Objections be deferred
till the last, the other Arguments will often
be listened to with prejudice by those who may
suppose us to be overlooking what may be
urged on the other side.
Sometimes indeed it will be difficult to give a
satisfactory Refutation of the opposed Opinions
till we have gone through the Arguments in
support of our own: even in that case however
it will be better to take some brief notice of
them early in the Composition, with a promise
of afterwards considering them more fully, and
refuting them. This is Aristotle's usual pro-
cedure.
A Sophistical use is often made of this last
rule, when the Objections are such as cannot
really be satisfactorily answered. The skilful
Sophist will often, by the promise of a trium-
phant Refutation hereafter, gain attention to his
own statement, which, if it be made plausible,
will so draw off the hearer's attention from the
Objections, that a very inadequate fulfilment of
that promise will pass unnoticed, and due
weight will not be allowed to the Objections.
It may be worth remarking, that Refutation

will often occasion the introduction of fresh
Propositions; i. e. we may have to disprove
Propositions, which, though incompatible with
the principal one to be maintained, will not be
directly contradictory to it: e. g. Burke, in
order to the establishment of his theory of
beauty, refutes the other theories which have
been advanced by those who place it in
"fitness" for a certain end-in "proportion"-
in " perfection," &c. and Dr. A. Smith, in
his Theory of Moral Sentiments, combats the
opinion of those who make "expediency the test
of virtue❞—of the advocates of a " Moral sense,"
&c. which doctrines respectively are at variance
with those of these authors, and imply, though
they do not express, a contradiction of them.
Though I am at present treating principally
of the proper collocation of Refutation, some
remarks on the conduct of it will not be un-
suitable in this place. In the first place, it is
to be observed that there is (as Aristotle re-
marks, Rhet. book ii. apparently in opposition
to some former writers) no distinct class of
refutatory Arguments; since they become such
merely by the circumstances under which they

proving the contradictory of it; secondly, by
overthrowing the Arguments by which it has
been supported. The former of these is less
strictly and properly called Refutation, being
only accidentally such, since it might have
been employed equally well had the opposite
Argument never existed; and in fact it will
often happen that a Proposition maintained by
one author may be in this way refuted by
another, who had never heard of his Arguments.
Thus Pericles is represented by Thucydides as
proving, in a speech to the Athenians, the
probability of their success against the Pelopon-
nesians, and thus, virtually, refuting the speech
of the Corinthian ambassador at Sparta, who
had laboured to shew the probability of their
speedy downfals. In fact, every one who
argues in favour of any Conclusion is virtually
refuting, in this way, the opposite Conclusion.
But the character of Refutation more strictly
belongs to the other mode of proceeding, viz. in
which a reference is made, and an answer given,
to some specific Arguments in favour of the
The speeches indeed are avowedly the composition of
the historian; but he professes to give the substance of
what was either actually said, or likely to be said, on each
occasion; and the Arguments urged in the speeches now
in question are undoubtedly such as the respective speakers
would be likely to employ.

opposite Conclusion. This Refutation may con-
sist either in the denial of one of the Premises,
or an Objection against the conclusiveness of the
Reasoning. And here it is to be observed that
the Objection is often supposed, from the mode
in which it is expressed, to belong to this last
class, when perhaps it does not, but consists
in the contradiction of a Premiss; for it is
very common to say, "I admit your principle,
but deny that it leads to such a consequence ;'
"the assertion is true, but it has no force as
an Argument to prove that Conclusion;" this
sounds like an objection to the Reasoning itself,
but it will not unfrequently be found to amount
only to a denial of the suppressed Premiss of
an Enthymeme; the assertion which is admitted
being only the expressed Premiss, whose force
as an Argument must of course depend on the
other Premiss which is understood. Thus
Warburton admits that in the Law of Moses
the doctrine of a future state was not revealed;
but contends that this, so far from disproving,
as the Deists pretend, his Divine mission, does,
on the contrary, establish it. But the Objec-
tion is not to the Deist's Argument properly
h It has been remarked to me by an intelligent friend,
that in common discourse the word "Principle" is usually
employed to designate the major premiss of an Argument,
and "Reason," the minor.

so called, but to the other Premiss, which they
so hastily took for granted, and which he
disproves, viz. " that a divinely-commissioned
Lawgiver would have been sure to reveal that
doctrine." The Objection is then only properly
said to lie against the Reasoning itself, when it
is shewn that, granting all that is assumed on
the other side, whether expressed or understood,
still the Conclusion contended for would not
follow from the Premises, either on account of
some ambiguity in the Middle Term, or some
other fault of that class. (See LOGIC, chapter
on Fallacies.)
It may be proper in this place to remark,
that "Indirect Reasoning" is sometimes con-
founded with "Refutation," or supposed to
be peculiarly connected with it; which is not
the case; either Direct or Indirect Reasoning
being employed indifferently for Refutation as
well as for any other purpose. The application
of the term "elenctic," (from exéyxe to refute or
ἐλέγχειν
disprove,) to Indirect Arguments, has probably
contributed to this confusion; which, however
principally arises from the very circumstance
that occasioned such a use of that term; viz.
that in the Indirect method the absurdity or
falsity of a Proposition (opposed to our own)
is proved; and hence is suggested the idea of
an adversary maintaining that Proposition, and

be remembered, that Euclid and other mathe-
maticians, though they can have no opponent
to refute, often employ the Indirect Demon-
stration; and that on the other hand, if the
contradictory of an opponent's Premiss can be
satisfactorily proved in the Direct Method, the
Refutation is sufficient. It is true however
that while, in science, the Direct Method is
considered preferable, in controversy, the In-
direct is often adopted by choice, as it affords
an opportunity for holding up an opponent to
scorn and ridicule, by deducing some very
absurd Conclusion from the principles he main-
tains, or according to the mode of arguing he
employs. Nor indeed can a fallacy be so
clearly exposed to the unlearned reader in any
other way. For it is no easy matter to ex-
plain, to one ignorant of Logic, the grounds on
which you object to an inconclusive Argument;
though he will be able to perceive its corre-
spondence with another brought forward to illus-
trate it, in which an absurd Conclusion may
be introduced, as drawn from true Premises.

It is evident that either the Premiss of an
opponent or his Conclusion, may be disproved,
either in the Direct or in the Indirect Method;
i. e. either by proving the truth of the Con-

tradictory, or by shewing that an absurd Con-
clusion may fairly be deduced from the Pro-
position in question: when this latter mode of
Refutation is adopted with respect to the
Premiss, the phrase by which this procedure is
usually designated, is, that the "Argument
proves too much ;" i. e. that it proves, besides
the Conclusion drawn, another, which is mani-
festly inadmissible; e. g. the Argument by
which Dr. Campbell labours to prove that
every correct Syllogism must be nugatory, as
involving a "petitio principii," proves, if ad-
mitted at all, more than he intended; since it
may easily be shewn to be equally applicable
to all Reasoning whatever.
It is worth remarking, that that which is in
substance an Indirect Argument, may easily be
altered in form so as to be stated in the Direct
Mode. For, strictly speaking, that is Indirect
Reasoning in which we assume as true the
Proposition whose Contradictory it is our object
to prove; and deducing regularly from it an
absurd Conclusion, infer thence that the Premiss
in question is false; the alternative proposed in all
correct Reasoning being either to admit the Con-
clusion, or to deny one of the Premises; but by
adopting the form of a Destructive Conditional',

may be stated, directly; e. g. we may say,
"let it be admitted, that no testimony can
satisfactorily establish such a fact as is not
agreeable to our experience; thence it will follow
that the Eastern Prince judged wisely and
rightly in at once rejecting, as a manifest false-
hood, the account given him of the phenome-
non of ice; but he was evidently mistaken in so
doing; therefore the Principle assumed is un-
sound." Now the substance of this Argument
remaining the same, the form of it may be so
altered as to make the Argument Direct; viz.

if it be true that no testimony, &c. that
Eastern Prince must have judged wisely, &c.
but he did not; therefore that Principle is not
true."

Universally indeed a Conditional Proposition

of a certain Argument; the Antecedent cor-
responding to the Premises, and the Consequent
to the Conclusion; and neither of them being
asserted as true, only the dependence of the one
on the other; the alternative then is, to admit
the Consequent, (which forms the Constructive
Syllogism,) or to deny the Antecedent; which
forms the Destructive; and the former accord-
ingly corresponds to Direct Reasoning, the
latter to Indirect; being, as has been said, a

fect of indi-

The difference between these two modes of Ironical ef-
stating such an Argument is considerable, when rect argu-
there is a long chain of Reasoning; for when
we employ the Categorical form, and assume as
true the Premises we design to disprove, it is
evident we must be speaking ironically, and in
the character, assumed for the moment, of an
adversary; when, on the contrary, we use the
hypothetical form, there is no irony. Butler's
Analogy is an instance of the latter procedure;
he contends that if such and such objections are
admissible against Religion, they must be ap-
plied equally to the constitution and course of
Nature. Had he, on the other hand, assumed,
for the Argument's sake, that such objections
against Religion are valid, and had thence
proved the condition of the natural world to be
totally different from what we see it to be, his
Arguments, which would have been the same
in substance, would have assumed an ironical
form. This form has been adopted by Burke
in his celebrated Defence of Natural Society,
by a late noble Lord; in which, assuming the

the principles of that author, that the Arguments
he brought against ecclesiastical, would equally
lie against civil institutions.
It is in some respects a recommendation of
this latter method, and in others an objection to
it, that the sophistry of an adversary will often
be exposed by it in a ludicrous point of view;
and this, even where no such effect is designed;
the very essence of jest being its mimic sophis-
try'. This will often give additional force to
the Argument, by the vivid impression which
ludicrous images produce; but again, it will
not unfrequently have this disadvantage, that
weak men, perceiving the wit, are apt to conclude
that nothing but wit is designed, and lose sight
perhaps of a solid and convincing Argument,
which they regard as no more than a good joke.

test of truth," and " that wisdom and wit" are
Evidences of our religion, (the third point against which
objections have been urged,) on a similar plan with the
work of Burke just mentioned, and consequently, like that,
in an ironical form, I attempted a few years ago, in a
pamphlet, (published anonymously merely for the preserva-
tion of its ironical character,) whose object was to shew,
that objections, similar to those brought against the Scrip-
ture-history, and much more plausible, might be urged
against all the received accounts of Napoleon Buonaparte.

can possibly be regarded as witty; not having
judgment to perceive the combination, when it
occurs, of wit with sound Reasoning. The
ivy-wreath completely conceals from their view
the point of the Thyrsus. And moreover if Danger of

It may be observed generally, that too much
stress is often laid, especially by unpractised
Reasoners, on Refutation; (in the strictest and
narrowest sense, i. e. of Objections to the Pre-
mises, or to the Reasoning,) they are apt both to
expect a Refutation where none can fairly be
expected, and to attribute to it, when satis-
factorily made out, more than it really accom-
plishes.

For first, not only specious, but real and solid

impossible to refute, may be urged against a
Proposition which is nevertheless true, and
may be satisfactorily established by a prepon
derance of probability. It is in strictly scientific
Reasoning alone that all the Arguments which
lead to a false Conclusion must be fallacious:
in what is called moral or probable Reasoning,
there may be sound Arguments and valid
objections on both sides"; e. g. it may be shewn
that each of two contending parties has some
reason to hope for success; and this, by irrefra-
gable Arguments on both sides; leading to
Conclusions which are not (strictly speaking)
that it was ironical. And the same with the "Historic
Doubts" lately referred to.

contradictory to each other; for though only one
party can obtain the victory, it may be true that
each has some reason to expect it. The real
question in such cases is, which event is the more
probable;-on which side the evidence pre-
ponderates. Now it often happens that the
inexperienced Reasoner, thinking it necessary
that every Objection should be satisfactorily
answered, will have his attention drawn off from
the Arguments of the opposite side, and will be
occupied perhaps in making a weak defence,
while victory was in his hands. The Objection
perhaps may be unanswerable, and yet may
safely be allowed, if it can be shewn that more
and weightier Objections lie against every
other supposition. This is a most important
caution for those who are studying the Evidences

Secondly, the force of a Refutation is often Over-esti-
over-rated: an Argument which is satisfactorily force of re-
answered ought to go for nothing; but it is
possible that the Conclusion drawn may never-
theless be true: yet men are apt to take for
granted that the Conclusion itself is disproved,
when the Arguments brought forward to esta-
blish it have been satisfactorily refuted; as-

"Another form of ignoratio elenchi, (irrelevant con-
clusion,) which is rather the more serviceable on the side
of the respondent, is, to prove or disprove some part of that
which is required, and dwell on that, suppressing all the
rest.
"Thus, if a University is charged with cultivating only
the mere elements of Mathematics, and in reply a list of
the books studied there is produced, should even any one
of those books be not elementary, the charge is in fairness
refuted; but the Sophist may then earnestly contend that
some of those books are elementary; and thus keep out of
sight the real question, viz. whether they are all so. This
is the great art of the answerer of a book: suppose the
main positions in any work to be irrefragable, it will be
strange if some illustration of them, or some subordinate
part in short, will not admit of a plausible objection; the
opponent then joins issue on one of these incidental ques-
tions, and comes forward with "a Reply" to such and
such a work." Logic, pp. 199, 200. §. 18. Another
expedient which answerers sometimes resort to, and
which is less likely to remain permanently undetected,
is to garble a book; exhibiting statements without their
explanations, conclusions without their proofs,—and pas-
sages brought together out of their original order;-so
as to produce an appearance of falsehood, confusion, or
inconclusiveness. The last and boldest step is for the
"answerer" to make some false statement or absurd re-
mark, and then father it upon the author. And even this
artifice will sometimes succeed for a time, because many

persons do not suspect that any one would venture upon it.
Thus, in a work which professes to contain Strictures on
my Elements of Logic, I am represented (to take a few
instances out of many) as treating of "Accidental pro-
perties!"-as teaching, that "a man's having been walk-
ing" is a separable accident; and as having given a
statement (which is very formally exhibited in a Table,
p. 95.) of the Species of Definitions; which I will not defend
from the charge of being nonsensical, but which certainly
has no resemblance to any thing I ever wrote or thought
of.
"Hence the danger of ever advancing more than can
be well maintained; since the refutation of that will often
quash the whole: a guilty person may often escape by
having too much laid to his charge; so he may also by
having too much evidence against him, i. e. some that is
not in itself satisfactory: thus, a prisoner may sometimes
obtain acquittal by shewing that one of the witnesses
against him is an infamous informer and spy; though
perhaps if that part of the evidence had been omitted, the
rest would have been sufficient for conviction." Logic,

On the same principle is founded a most
important maxim, that it is not only the fairest,
but also the wisest plan, to state Objections
in their full force; at least, wherever there
does exist a satisfactory answer to
them;
otherwise, those who hear them stated more
strongly than by the uncandid advocate who
had undertaken to repel them, will naturally
enough conclude that they are unanswerable.
It is but a momentary and ineffective triumph
that can be obtained by manœuvres like those
of Turnus's charioteer, who furiously chased the
those cases in which, (waiving the consideration of ho-
nesty,) first, it is wished to produce not merely a tempo-
rary, but a lasting impression, and that, on readers or
hearers of some judgment; and secondly, where there really
are some weighty arguments to be urged. When no charge
e. g. can really be substantiated, and yet it is desired to
produce some present effect on the unthinking, there may
be room for the application of the proverb, "Slander stoutly,
and something will stick:" the vulgar are apt to conclude,
that where a great deal is said, something must be true;
and many are fond of that lazy contrivance for saving the
trouble of thinking,-" splitting the difference;" imagining
that they shew a laudable caution in believing only a part
of what is said. And thus a malignant Sophist may gain
such a temporary advantage by the multiplicity of his
attacks, as the rabble of combatants described by Homer
sometimes did by their showers of javelins, which encum-
bered and weighed down the shield of one of his heroes,
though they could not penetrate it.

Obvious, and such as naturally first occur.
This is evidently the natural order; and the
adherence to it gives an easy, natural air to the
Composition. It is seldom therefore worth
while to depart from it for the sake of beginning
with the most powerful Arguments, (when they
happen not to be also the most Obvious,) or on
the other hand, for the sake of reserving these to
the last, and beginning with the weaker; or
again, of imitating, as some recommend, Nestor's
plan of drawing up troops, placing the best,
first and last, and the weakest in the middle.
It will be advisable however (and by this
means you may secure this last advantage) when
the strongest Arguments naturally occupy the
foremost place, to recapitulate in a reverse

anti-climax, and is also in itself the most easy
and natural mode of recapitulation. Let, e. g. Reverse re-

Of Introductions.
§. 1.
A Proeme, Exordium, or Introduction, is, as
Aristotle has justly remarked, not to be ac-
counted one of the essential parts of a Com-
position, since it is not in every case necessary.
In most, however, except such as are extremely
short, it is found advisable to premise something
before we enter on the main Argument, to
avoid an appearance of abruptness, and to
facilitate, in some way or other, the Object
proposed. In larger works this assumes the
appellation of Preface or Advertisement; and
not unfrequently two are employed, one under
the name of Preface, and another, more closely
connected with the main work, under that of
Introduction.
The rules which have been laid down already
will apply equally to that preliminary course
of Argument of which Introductions often
consist.

him for inaccuracy, in placing under the head
of Introductions, as properly belonging to them,

the point to be proved or explained is one which
may be very fully established, or on which there
is little or no doubt, that it may nevertheless
be strange, and different from what might have

as strongly as possible this paradoxical character,
and dwell on the seeming improbability of that
which must, after all, be admitted. This may
be called an "Introduction paradoxical '."

and if (instead of each picking where and what it liked,
taking just as much as it wanted, and no more) you should
see ninety-nine of them gathering all they got into a heap;
reserving nothing for themselves, but the chaff and the refuse;
keeping this heap for one, and that the weakest, perhaps
worst, of the flock; sitting round, and looking on, all the
winter, whilst this one was devouring, throwing about, and
wasting it; and if a pigeon, more hardy or hungry than the
rest, touched a grain of the hoard, all the others instantly
flying upon it, and tearing it to pieces; if you should see
this, you would see nothing more than what is every day
practised and established among men. Among men, you

heap of superfluities for one, (and this one too, oftentimes

the while, but a little of the coarsest of the provision,

Introduction," to put the reader or hearer in
possession of the outline of some transaction,
or the description of some state of things, to
which references and allusions are to be made
in the course of the Composition. Thus, in
Preaching, it is generally found advisable to
detail, or at least briefly to sum up, a portion of
Scripture-history, or a parable, when either of
these is made the subject of a Sermon.
Two or more of the Introductions that have
been mentioned are often combined, especially
in the Preface to a work of any length.
And very often the Introduction will contain
appeals to various passions and feelings in the
hearers; especially a feeling of approbation
towards the Speaker, or of prejudice against an
opponent who has preceded him; but this is, as
Aristotle has remarked, by no means confined
to Introductions".

Persuasion.
PERSUASION, properly so called, i. e. the Analysis of
Art of influencing the Will, is the next point
to be considered. And Rhetoric is often re-
garded (as was formerly remarked) in a more
limited sense, as conversant about this head
alone. But even, according to that view, the
rules above laid down will be found not the
less relevant; since the Conviction of the under-
standing (of which I have hitherto been treat-
ing) is an essential part of Persuasion; and
will generally need to be effected by the Argu-
ments of the Writer or Speaker. For in order
that the Will may be influenced, two things
are requisite; viz. 1. that the proposed Object
should appear desirable; and 2. that the Means
suggested should be proved to be conducive
to the attainment of that Object; and this last,
evidently must depend on a process of Reason-

ing. In order, e. g. to induce the Greeks to
unite their efforts against the Persian invader,
it was necessary to prove that cooperation
could alone render their resistance effectual, and
also to awaken such feelings of patriotism, and
abhorrence of a foreign yoke, as might prompt
them to make these combined efforts. For it
is evident, that however ardent their love of
liberty, they would make no exertions if they ap-
prehended no danger; or if they thought them-
selves able, separately, to defend themselves,
they would be backward to join the confederacy;
and on the other hand, that if they were willing
to submit to the Persian yoke, or valued their
independence less than their present ease, the
fullest conviction that the Means recommended
would secure their independence, would have
had no practical effect.
Persuasion, therefore, depends on, first, Argu-
ment, (to prove the expediency of the Means
proposed,) and secondly, What is usually called
Exhortation, i. e. the incitement of men to
adopt those Means, by representing the End
as sufficiently desirable. It will happen indeed,
not unfrequently, that the one or the other of
these objects will have been already, either
wholly or in part, accomplished, so that the
other shall be the only one that it is requisite
to insist on; viz. sometimes the hearers will be

sufficiently intent on the pursuit of the End,
and will be in doubt only as to the Means of
attaining it; and sometimes, again, they will
have no doubt on that point, but will be indif-
ferent, or not sufficiently ardent, with respect
to the proposed End, and will need to be
stimulated by Exhortations. Not sufficiently
ardent, I have said, because it will not so often
happen that the Object in question will be one
to which they are totally indifferent, as that
they will, practically at least, not reckon it, or
not feel it, to be worth the requisite pains.
No one is absolutely indifferent about the at-
tainment of a happy immortality; and yet a
great part of the Preacher's business consists
in Exhortation, i. e. endeavouring to induce
men to use those exertions which they them-
selves know to be necessary for the attainment
of it.
Aristotle, and many other writers, have
spoken of Appeals to the Passions as an unfair
mode of influencing the hearers; in answer to
which Dr. Campbell has remarked, that there
can be no Persuasion without an address to
the Passions: and it is evident, from what has

been just said, that he is right, if under the
term Passion is included every active principle
This he cannot avoid doing, if he speak to the purpose.
To make me believe, it is enough to shew me that things
are so; to make me act, it is necessary to shew that the
action will answer some End. That can never be an End
to me which gratifies no passion or affection in my nature.
You assure me,' It is for my honour.' Now you solicit
my pride, without which I had never been able to under-
stand the word. You say, 'It is for my interest.' Now
you bespeak my self-love. It is for the public good.'
Now you rouse my patriotism. It will relieve the
miserable.' Now you touch my pity. So far therefore is
it from being an unfair method of persuasion to move the
passions, that there is no persuasion without moving them.
"But if so much depend on passion, where is the scope
for argument? Before I answer this question, let it be
observed, that, in order to persuade, there are two things
which must be carefully studied by the orator. The first
is, to excite some desire or passion in the hearers; the
second is to satisfy their judgment that there is a con-
nection between the action to which he would persuade
them, and the gratification of the desire or passion which
he excites. This is the analysis of persuasion. The
former is effected by communicating lively and glowing
ideas of the object; the latter, unless so evident of itself
as to supersede the necessity, by presenting the best and
most forcible arguments which the nature of the subject
admits. In the one lies the pathetic, in the other the
argumentative. These incorporated together constitute that
vehemence of contention to which the greatest exploits of
Eloquence ought doubtless to be ascribed."-Campbell's

of our nature. This however is a greater latitude
of meaning than belongs even to the Greek
word Пán, though the signification of that is
wider than, according to ordinary use, that of our
term "Passions." But Aristotle by no means Influence of
overlooked the necessity with a view to Per-
suasion, properly so termed, of calling into
action some motive that may influence the
Will; it is plain that whenever he speaks with
reprobation of an appeal to the Passions, his
meaning is, the excitement of such feelings as
ought not to influence the decision of the ques-
tion in hand. A desire to do justice may be
called, in Dr. Campbell's wide acceptation of
the term, a Passion: this is what ought to in-
fluence a Judge; and no one would ever
censure a Pleader for striving to excite and
heighten this desire; but if the decision be
influenced by an appeal to Anger, Pity, &c.
the feelings thus excited being such as ought
not to have operated, the Judge must be allowed
to have been unduly biassed; and that this is
Aristotle's meaning is evident from his cha-
racterising the introduction of such topics, as
ἔξω τοῦ πράγματος, “ foreign to the matter in
hand." And it is evident that as the motives

another would be perfectly allowable". An
instance occurs in Thucydides, in which this
is very judiciously and neatly pointed out: in
the debate respecting the Mityleneans, who had
been subdued after a revolt, Cleon is introduced
contending for the justice of inflicting on them
capital punishment; to which Diodotus is
made to reply, that the Athenians are not sitting
in judgment on the offenders, but in delibera-
tion as to their own interest; and ought there-
fore to consider, not the right they may have
to put the revolters to death, but the expediency
or inexpediency of such a procedure.
In judicial cases, on the contrary, any appeal
to the personal interests of the Judge, or even
to public expediency, would be irrelevant. In
framing laws indeed, and (which comes to the
same thing) giving those decisions which are
to operate as precedents, the public good is
the object to be pursued; but in the mere
administering of the established laws, it is
inadmissible.
There are many feelings, again, which it is
evident should in no case be allowed to operate,
as Envy, thirst for Revenge, &c. &c. the ex-
citement of which by the Orator is to be re-
probated as an unfair artifice; but it is not the

less necessary to be well acquainted with their
nature, in order to allay them when previously
existing in the hearers, or to counteract the
efforts of an adversary in producing or directing
them. It is evident, indeed, that all the weak-
nesses, as well as the powers of the human
mind, and all the arts by which the Sophist
takes advantage of these weaknesses, must be
familiarly known by a perfect Orator; who,
though he may be of such a character as to dis-
dain employing such arts, must not want the
ability to do so, or he would not be prepared
to counteract them. An acquaintance with
the nature of poisons is necessary to him who
would administer antidotes.

The active principles of our nature may
be classed in various ways; the arrangement
adopted by Mr. Dugald Stewart is, perhaps,
the most correct and convenient; the heads he
enumerates are Appetites, (which have their
origin in the body,) Desires, and Affections;
these last being such as imply some kind of
disposition relative to another Person; to
which must be added, Self-love, or the desire
of Happiness as such; and the Moral-faculty,

called by some writers Conscience, by others
the Moral sense, and by Dr. A. Smith, the
sense of Propriety.
Under the head of Affections may be in-
cluded the sentiments of Esteem, Regard,
Admiration, &c. which it is so important that
the audience should feel towards the Speaker.
Aristotle has considered this as a distinct head,
separating the consideration of the speaker's
Character, (H005 To AéyovTos) from that of the
disposition of the hearers; under which, how-
ever, it might, according to his own views, have
been included; it being plain from his manner
of treating of the speaker's Character, that he
means, not his real character, (according to the
fanciful notion of Quinctilian,) but the im-
pression produced on the minds of the hearers,
Character by the speaker, respecting himself. He re-

blished is that of, first Good Principle,
secondly, Good Sense, and thirdly, Goodwill
and friendly disposition towards the audience
addressed; and that if the Orator can com-
pletely succeed in this, he will persuade more
powerfully than by the strongest Arguments.

slightly hint at the conclusion of his Treatise,)

that, where there is an opponent, a like result
is produced by exciting the contrary feelings
respecting him; viz. holding him up to con-
tempt, or representing him as an object of re-
probation or suspicion.
To treat fully of all the different emotions
and springs of action which an Orator may
at any time find it necessary to call into play,
or to contend against, would be to enter on an
almost boundless field of Metaphysical inquiry,
which does not properly fall within the limits of
the subject now before us: and on the other
hand, a brief definition of each passion, &c.
and a few general remarks on it, could hardly
fail to be trite and uninteresting. A few mis-

wise the effect will be, in great measure, if
not entirely, lost. This circumstance forms a
remarkable distinction between the head now
under consideration, and that of Argumentation.
When engaged in Reasoning, properly so
called, our purpose not only need not be
concealed, but may, without prejudice to the
effect, be distinctly declared: on the other
hand, even when the feelings we wish to excite
are such as ought to operate, so that there is no
reason to be ashamed of the endeavours thus
to influence the hearer, still, our purpose and
drift should be, if not absolutely concealed,
yet not openly declared, and made prominent.
Whether the motives which the Orator is
endeavouring to call into action be suitable or
unsuitable to the occasion,-such as it is right,
or wrong for the hearer to act upon, the same
rule will hold good. In the latter case it is
plain, that the speaker who is seeking to bias
unfairly the minds of the audience will be the
more likely to succeed by going to work
clandestinely, in order that his hearers may not
be on their guard, and prepare and fortify their
minds against the impressions he wishes to
produce; in the other case,—where the motives
dwelt on are such as ought to be present, and
strongly to operate, men are not likely to be
pleased with the idea that they need to have

these motives urged upon them, and that they
are not already sufficiently under the influence
of such sentiments as the occasion calls for.
A man
man may indeed be convinced that he
is in such a predicament, and may ultimately
feel obliged to the Orator for exciting or
strengthening such sentiments; but while he
confesses this, he cannot but feel a degree of
mortification. in making the confession, and a
kind of jealousy of the apparent assumption
of superiority, in a speaker, who seems to say,
"now I will exhort you to feel as you ought on
this occasion ;" "I will endeavour to inspire
you with such noble, and generous, and amiable
sentiments as you ought to entertain ;" which
is, in effect, the tone of him who avows the
purpose of Exhortation. The mind is sure
to revolt from the humiliation of being thus
moulded and fashioned, in respect to its feelings,
at the pleasure of another; and is apt, per-
versely, to resist the influence of such a dis-
cipline.
Whereas there is no such implied superiority
in avowing the intention of convincing the
understanding: men know, and (what is more
to the purpose) feel, that he who presents to
their minds a new and cogent train of Argument,
does not necessarily possess or assume any
offensive superiority, but may, by merely having

devoted a particular attention to the point in
question, succeed in setting before them Argu-
ments and Explanations which have not occurred
to themselves; and even if the Arguments
adduced, and the Conclusions drawn, should be
opposite to those with which they had formerly
been satisfied, still there is nothing in this so
humiliating, as in that which seems to amount
to the imputation of a moral defect.
Caution
against
hortation.
It is true that Sermons not unfrequently
avowed ex- prove popular, which consist avowedly and
almost exclusively of Exhortation, strictly so
called, in which the design of influencing the
sentiments and feelings is not only apparent,
but prominent throughout; but it is to be
feared, that those who are the most pleased
with such discourses, are more apt to apply
these Exhortations to their neighbours than
to themselves; and that each bestows his
commendation rather from the consideration
that such admonitions are much needed, and
must be generally useful, than from finding
them thus useful to himself.
-
When indeed the speaker has made some
progress in exciting the feelings required, and
has in great measure gained possession of his
audience, a direct and distinct Exhortation
to adopt the conduct recommended will often
prove very effectual; but never can it be need-

ful or advisable to tell them (as some do) that
you are going to exhort them.
It will, indeed, sometimes happen that the
excitement of a certain feeling will depend,
in some measure, on a process of Reasoning;
e. g. it may be requisite to prove, where there is
a doubt on the subject, that the person recom-
mended to the Pity, Gratitude, &c. of the
hearers, is really an object deserving of these
sentiments but even then, it will almost
always be the case, that the chief point to
be accomplished shall be to raise those feelings
to the requisite height, after the understanding
is convinced that the occasion calls for them.
And this is to be effected not by Argument,
properly so called, but by presenting the circum-
stances in such a point of view, and so fixing
and detaining the attention upon them, that
corresponding sentiments and emotions shall
gradually, and as it were spontaneously, arise.
* Sermons would probably have more effect, if, instead
of being, as they frequently are, directly hortatory, they
were more in a didactic form;-occupied chiefly in ex-
plaining some transaction related, or doctrine laid down,
in Scripture. The generality of hearers are too much
familiarized to direct exhortation to feel it adequately: if
they are led to the same point obliquely, as it were, and
induced to dwell with interest for a considerable time on
some point, closely, though incidentally, connected with

Hence arises another Rule', closely connected
with the foregoing, though it also so far relates
to style that it might with sufficient propriety
have been placed under that head; viz. thạt
in order effectually to excite feelings of any
kind, it is necessary to employ some copious-
ness of detail, and to dwell somewhat at large on
the several circumstances of the case in hand;
the most awful and important truths, a very slight appli-
cation to themselves might make a greater impression than
the most vehement appeal in the outset: often indeed they
would themselves make this application unconsciously;
and if on any this procedure made no impression, it can
hardly be expected that any thing else would. To use a
homely illustration, a moderate charge of powder will have
more effect in splitting a rock, if we begin by deep boring,
and introducing the charge into the very heart of it, than
ten times the quantity exploded on the surface.
"Non enim, sicut argumentum, simulatque positum
est, arripitur, alterumque et tertium poscitur; ita miseri-
cordiam aut invidiam aut iracundiam, simulatque intuleris,
possis commovere: argumentum enim ratio ipsa confirmat,
quæ, simulatque emissa est, adhærescit; illud autem genus
orationis non cognitionem judicis, sed magis perturbationem
requirit, quam consequi, nisi multa et varia et copiosa

in which respect there is a wide distinction
between strict Argumentation, with a view
to the Conviction of the understanding alone,
and the attempt to influence the will by the
excitement of any emotion. With respect to
Argument itself indeed, different occasions will
call for different degrees of Copiousness, Re-
petition, and Expansion ;-the chain of Reason-
ing employed, may, in itself, consist of more
or fewer links ;-abstruse and complex Argu-
ments must be unfolded at greater length than
such as are more simple;-and the more
uncultivated the audience, the more full must be
the explanation and illustration, and the more
frequent the repetition, of the Arguments pre-
sented to them; but still the same general
principle prevails in all these cases; viz. to aim
merely at letting the Arguments be fully
understood and admitted; this will indeed
occupy a shorter or longer space, according
to the nature of the case and the character of
the hearers; but all Expansion and Repetition
beyond what is necessary to accomplish convic-
tion, is in every instance tedious and disgusting.
On the contrary, in a description of any thing
that is likely to act on the feelings, this effect
will by no means be produced as soon as the
understanding is sufficiently informed ; detail
and expansion are here not only admissible, but

absolutely necessary, in order that the mind
may have leisure and opportunity to form vivid
and distinct ideas. For as Quinctilian well
observes, he who tells us that a city was sacked,
although that one word implies all that occurred,
will produce little, if any, impression on the
feelings, in comparison of one who sets before
us a lively description of the various lamentable
circumstances; to tell the whole, he adds, is by
no means the same as to tell

8 Dr. Campbell has treated very ably of some circum-
stances which tend to heighten any impression. The
reader is referred to the Appendix for some extracts. See

Accordingly it may be observed, that though every one
understands what is meant by "a wound," there are some
who cannot hear a minute description of one without
fainting.
The death of Patroclus is minutely related by Homer
for the interest of the reader; though to Achilles, whose
feelings would be sufficiently excited by the bare fact, it
is told in two words: κειται Πατροκλος.
There is an instance related in a number of the Ad-
venturer, of a whole audience being moved to tears by a
minute detail of the circumstances connected with the
death of a youthful pair at the battle of Fontenoy; though
they had previously listened without emotion to a general
statement of the dreadful carnage in that engagement.

It is not, however, always advisable to enter Indirect de-
into a direct detail of circumstances, which scription.
would often have the effect of wearying the hearer
beforehand, with the expectation of a long
description of something in which he probably
does not as yet feel much interest; and would
also be likely to prepare him too much, and fore-
warn him, as it were, of the object proposed,-
the design laid against his feelings. It will
often, therefore, have a better effect to describe
obliquely, (if I may so speak,) by introducing
circumstances connected with the main object
or event, and affected by it, but not absolutely
forming a part of it. And circumstances of
this kind may not unfrequently be selected,
so as to produce a more striking impression
of any thing that is in itself great and remarkable,
than could be produced by a minute and direct
description; because in this way the general
and collective result of a whole, and the effects
produced by it on other objects, may be vividly
impressed on the hearer's mind; the circum-
stantial detail of collateral matters not draw-
ing off the mind from the contemplation
of the principal matter as one and complete.

Samaria, to compel her neighbour to fulfil the

agreement of sharing with her the infant's flesh,
gives a more frightful impression of the horrors
of the famine than any more direct description
could have done; since it presents to us the pic-
ture of that hardening of the heart to every kind
of horror, and that destruction of the ordinary
state of human sentiment, which is the result
of long-continued and extreme misery. Nor
could any detail of the particular vexations
suffered by the exiled Jews for their disobe-
dience, convey so lively an idea of them as that
description of their result contained in the
denunciation of Moses; "in the evening thou
shalt say, would God it were morning, and in
the morning thou shalt say, would God it were
evening."
In the poem of Rokeby, a striking exemplifi-
cation occurs of what has been said: Bertram in
describing the prowess he had displayed as a
Buccaneer, does not particularize any of his
exploits, but alludes to the terrible impression
they had left:

that they form a very inadequate notion of the

once.
An analogous Arrangement of Arguments, in order to
set forth the full force of the one we mean to dwell upon,
would also receive the same appellation; and in fact is
very often combined and blended with that which is here
spoken of,

towering above them. And the mind, no less
than the eye, cannot so well take in and do
justice to any vast object at a single glance,
as by several successive approaches and repeated
comparisons. Thus in the well-known Climax
of Cicero in the Oration against Verres, shocked
as the Romans were likely to be at the bare
mention of the crucifixion of one of their
citizens, the successive steps by which he
brings them to the contemplation of such an
event, were calculated to work up their feelings
to a much higher pitch: "It is an outrage to
bind a Roman citizen; to scourge him is an
atrocious crime; to put him to death is almost
parricide; but to crucify him-what shall I call
it ?"
It is observed, accordingly, by Aristotle, in
speaking of Panegyric, that the person whom
we would hold up to admiration, should always
be compared, and advantageously compared, if
possible, with those that are already illustrious,
but if not, at least with some person whom he
excels: to excel, being in itself, he says, a
ground of admiration. The same rule will
apply, as has been said, to all other feelings as
well as to Admiration: Anger, or Pity, for
instance, are more effectually excited if we pro-
duce cases such as would call forth those
passions, and which though similar to those

before us, are not so strong; and so with
respect to the rest.
When it is said, however, that the object
which we compare with another, should be one
which ought to excite the feeling in question
in a higher degree than that other, it is not
meant that this must actually be, already, the im-
pression of the hearers; the reverse will more com-
monly be the case; that the instances adduced
will be such as actually affect their feelings more
strongly than that to which we are endeavouring
to turn them, till the flame spreads, as it were,
from the one to the other. This will especially
hold good in every case where self is concerned';
e. g. men feel naturally more indignant at a
slight affront offered to themselves, or those
closely connected with them, than at the most
grievous wrong done to a stranger; if therefore
you would excite their utmost indignation in
such a case, it must be by comparing it with a
parallel case that concerns themselves; i. e. by
leading them to consider how they would feel
were such and such an injury done to themselves.
And, on the other hand, if you would lead
them to a just sense of their own faults, it must
be by leading them to contemplate like faults in
others; of which the celebrated parable of Na-
than, addressed to David, affords an admirable
instance.

It often answers very well to introduce in this
manner an instance not only avowedly fictitious,
but even manifestly impossible, provided it be
but conceivable. A case may thus be exhibited
more striking and apposite than any real or
possible one that could be found. I have
inserted in the Appendix some examples of this

§. 5.
Another Rule, (which also is connected in
some degree with Style) relates to the tone of
feeling to be manifested by the writer or speaker
himself, in order to excite the most effectually
the desired emotions in the minds of the hearers.
And this is to be accomplished by two opposite
methods the one, which is the more obvious,
is to express openly the feeling in question;
the other, to seem labouring to suppress it: in
the former method, the most forcible remarks
are introduced,-the most direct as well as
impassioned kind of description is employed,-
and something of exaggeration introduced, in
order to carry the hearers as far as possible in
the same direction in which the Orator seems
to be himself hurried, and to infect them to a
certain degree with the emotions and sentiments

which he thus manifests: the other method,
which is often no less successful, is to abstain
from all remarks, or from all such as come up
to the expression of feeling which the occasion
seems to authorize-to use a gentler mode of
expression than the case might fairly warrant,-
to deliver "an unvarnished tale," leaving the .
hearers to make their own comments,-and to
appear to stifle and studiously to keep within
bounds such emotions as may seem natural.
This produces a kind of reaction in the hearers'
minds; and being struck with the inadequacy
of the expressions, and the laboured calmness
of the speaker's manner of stating things, com-
pared with what he may naturally be disposed
to feel, they will often rush into the opposite
extreme, and become the more strongly affected
by that which is set before them in so simple
and modest a form. And though this method
is in reality more artificial than the other, the
artifice is the more likely (perhaps for that very
reason) to escape detection; men being less
on their guard against a speaker who does not
seem so much labouring to work up their
feelings, as to repress or moderate his own;
provided that this calmness and coolness of
manner be not carried to such an extreme as to
bear the appearance of affectation; which caution
is also to be attended to in the other mode of

procedure no less; an excessive hyperbolical
exaggeration being likely to defeat its own
object. Aristotle mentions, (Rhet. book ix.)
though very briefly, these two modes of rousing
the feelings, the latter under the name of
Eironeia, which in his time was commonly
employed to signify, not according to the
modern use of " Irony," saying " the contrary
to what is meant," but, what later writers
usually express by Litotes, i. e. " saying less
than is meant."
The two methods may often be both used
on the same occasion, beginning with the calm,
and proceeding to the impassioned, afterwards,
when the feelings of the hearers are already
wrought up to a certain pitch: ὅταν ἔχῃ ἤδη τοὺς
ἀκροατὰς, καὶ ποίησῃ ἐνθουσιάσαι'. Universally in-
deed it is a fault carefully to be avoided, to
express feelings more vehemently than that the
audience can go along with the speaker; who
would, in that case, as Cicero observes, seem
like one raving among the sane, or intoxicated
in the midst of the sober". And accordingly,

except where from extraneous causes the
audience are already in an excited state, we
must carry them forward gradually, and allow
time for the fire to kindle. The blast which
would heighten a strong flame, would, if applied
too soon, extinguish the first faint spark. The
speech of Antony over Cæsar's corpse, which
selves to the mind) is, that the statements and arguments
should first be clearly and calmly laid down and developed,
which are the ground and justification of such sentiments
and emotions as the case calls for; and that then the im-
passioned appeal (supposing the circumstances such as
admit of or demand this) should be made, to hearers well
prepared by their previous deliberate conviction, for re-
signing themselves to such feelings as fairly arise out of
that conviction. The former of these two parts may be
compared to the back of a sabre; the latter to its edge.
The former should be firm and weighty; the latter keen.
The writer who is deficient in strength of Argument, seems
to want weight and stoutness of metal; his strokes make
but a superficial impression, or the weapon is shivered to
fragments in his hand. He again whose Logic is convinc-
ing, but whose deficiency is in the keenness of his application
to the heart and to the will of the hearer, seems to be
wielding a blunt though ponderous weapon; we wonder to
find that such weighty blows have not cut deeper. And
he who reverses the natural order,-who begins with a
vehement address to the feelings, and afterwards proceeds
to the arguments which alone justify such feelings, re-
minds us of one wielding an excellent sword, but striking
with the back of it: if he did but turn it round, its blows
would take effect.

has been already mentioned, affords an ad-
mirable example of that combination of the
two methods which has been just spoken of.
Generally, however, it will be found that the
same Orators do not excel equally in both
modes of exciting the feelings; and it should
be recommended to each to employ principally
that in which he succeeds best; since either,
if judiciously managed, will generally prove
effectual for its object. The well-known tale

turn their attention to some object which will
call forth these feelings; and when they are
too much excited to be capable of judging
calmly, it will not be difficult to turn their
passions, once roused, in the direction required,
and to make them view the case before them
in a very different light. When the metal is

abhorrence or admiration. For the very ut-
terance of such words as have a multitude of
what may be called stimulating ideas associated
with them, will operate like a charm on the minds,
especially of the ignorant and unthinking, and
raise such a tumult of feeling, as will effectually
blind their judgment; so that a string of vague
abuse or panegyric, will often have the effect
of a train of sound Argument. This artifice
falls under the head of " Irrelevant Conclusion,"
or ignoratio elenchi, mentioned in the Treatise
on Fallacies".
" Mr. Bentham has treated of the employment of these
"passion-kindling appellatives," as he calls them, under
the head of" Fallacies of Confusion," in his work entitled
the Book of Fallacies. Many other observations, also oc-

employed; as if, because existing abuses are maintained
by those who have an interest in keeping what they have,
no apprehension were to be entertained of new evils being
introduced through the interested conduct of those who
wish to acquire what they have not; and as if, because
many are misled by a blind veneration for "Authority"

also, as antagonist muscles, as it were, to these, an equally
blind craving after novelty for its own sake, and a venera-

It is matter of regret that the powers of such a mind
as that of Mr. Bentham should be to so great a degree
wasted. Such, however, must always be the case, when
a Scientific work is composed (with whatever sincerity)
for party-purposes, or with any object foreign to the precise
End of the Science in question. Many Arguments ac-
cordingly are, in the work alluded to, stigmatised as
lacies, which may be, either sophistical, or sound and fair,
according to the circumstances in which they are employed;
such as that a certain proposed reformation ought to be
effected “ gradually;” that we must “ wait awhile, the
present not being the time for such and such a measure;"
or that "this or that proposal comes from a suspicious
quarter,” &c. which are topics that may be fairly or un-

mendation will usually be disgusting, to a greater
degree, even than a direct personal attack on
fairly urged. And it is but too plain that the line is
drawn not with a view to the mode in which, but to the
object for which, and the party by which, each Argument
is urged. It is only when certain classes of Propositions
are distinctly pointed out as absolutely false, inad-
missible, or irrelevant, or certain deductions from true ones
shewn to be unfair, that any useful warning can be sup-
plied. The hopes, therefore, which the author entertains
(p. 410,) that by the general study and adoption of his
Principles, debates may be cleared and shortened, (each
Fallacy being detected, exposed by name, and exploded, as
soon as uttered,) seem more sanguine than well-founded.
If the general adoption, by the great majority of the
audience, of the same system, means, their being of the
same party, no doubt they would readily and easily silence.
by clamour every opposite Argument; but if they are
merely to agree in adopting Logical principles as ill-defined
as those in question, the proposed plan for the ready ex-
posure of each fallacious Argument, resembles that by
which children are deluded, of catching a bird by laying
salt on its tail; the existing doubts and difficulties of
debate being no greater than, on the proposed system,
would be found in determining what Arguments were, and
what not, to be classed with the Fallacies in question.
The work, however, may be read safely, and not without
advantage, by those who have sufficient interest in the
subject to encounter the obscurity of the style, and suf-
ficient patience in investigation, and power of discrimina-
tion, to separate the particles of gold-dust from the mass
of sand with which they are blended. It has been thought
advisable therefore to make this reference to an author

another; though, if the Orator is pleading his
own cause, or one in which he is personally con-
cerned, (as was the case in the speech of
Demosthenes concerning the Crown,) a greater
allowance will be made for him on this point;
especially if he be a very eminent person, and
one who may safely appeal to public actions
performed by him. Thus Pericles is repre-
sented by Thucydides as claiming, directly,
when speaking in his own vindication, exactly
the qualities (good Sense, good Principle, and
Good-will,) which Aristotle lays down as con-
stituting the character which we must seek to
appear in. But then it is to be observed, that
the historian represents him as accustomed to
who is, perhaps, too generally regarded, except by the
small number of disciples who idolize him, with that un-
mixed contempt which is due to a portion only of his
tenets. Among posterity, the opinions entertained of him
may probably be less violently contrasted, and, on the
whole, more favourable; at least it usually happens that
those who have manifested any considerable original powers,
and have elicited valuable truths, however contaminated by
the most extravagant errors, are remembered, even more
favourably than is strictly their due; their absurdities are
gradually forgotten, like the inscription on plaster, on the
light-house of Pharos, which mouldered away by the action
of the weather; while the value of their discoveries is
durably recorded, and becomes more and more conspicuous,
like the inscription engraved on the marble beneath.

It is by the expression of wise, amiable, and
generous Sentiments, that Aristotle recommends
the speaker to manifest his own character°;
but even this must generally be done in an
oblique P and seemingly incidental manner, lest
the hearers be disgusted with a pompous and
studied display of fine sentiments; and care
must also be taken not to affront them by seeming
to inculcate as something likely to be new to
them, maxims which they regard as almost
truisms. Of course the application of this last

the persons addressed; that might excite admira-

relative.
Universally indeed, in the Arguments used, Eloquence
as well as in the appeals made to the Feelings,
a consideration must be had of the hearers,
whether they are learned or ignorant,—of this
or that profession,-nation,-character, &c.
and the address must be adapted to each; so
that there can be no excellence of writing or
speaking in the abstract; nor can we any more
pronounce on the Eloquence of any Compo-
sition, than upon the wholesomeness of a
medicine, without knowing for whom it is
intended. The less enlightened the hearers, the
harder, of course, it is to make them comprehend
a long and complex train of Reasoning; so that
sometimes the Arguments, in themselves the
most cogent, cannot be employed at all with
effect; and the rest will need an expansion and
copious illustration which would be needless,
and therefore tiresome, (as has been above
remarked,) before a different kind of audience:
on the other hand, their feelings may be ex-
cited by much bolder and coarser expedients;
such as those are the most ready to employ,
and the most likely to succeed in, who are
themselves but a little removed above the vulgar;
as may be seen in the effects produced by

fanatical preachers. But there are none whose
feelings do not occasionally need and admit of
excitement by the powers of Eloquence; only
there is a more exquisite skill required in thus
affecting the educated classes than the popu-
lace.
"The less improved in knowledge and discernment the
hearers are, the easier it is for the speaker to work upon
their passions, and by working on their passions, to obtain
his end. This, it must be owned, appears on the other
hand to give a considerable advantage to the preacher; as
in no Congregation can the bulk of the people be regarded as
on a footing, in point of improvement, with either House of
Parliament, or with the Judges in a Court of Judicature.
It is certain, that the more gross the hearers are, the more
avowedly may you address yourself to their passions, and
the less occasion there is for argument; whereas, the more
intelligent they are, the more covertly must you operate on
their passions, and the more attentive must you be in
regard to the justness, or at least the speciousness, of your
reasoning. Hence some have strangely concluded, that
the only scope for eloquence is in haranguing the multi-
tude; that in gaining over to your purpose men of know-
ledge and breeding, the exertion of Oratorical talents hath
no influence. This is precisely as if one should argue,
because a mob is much more easily subdued than regular
troops, there is no occasion for the art of war, nor is there
a proper field for the exertion of military skill, unless when
you are quelling an undisciplined rabble. Every body sees
in this case, not only how absurd such a way of arguing
would be, but that the very reverse ought to be the conclu-
sion. The reason why people do not so quickly perceive

On the other hand, it is, as has been said, in
the same degree more difficult to bring the
uneducated to a comprehension of the Argu-
ments employed; and this, not only from their
reasoning-powers having less general cultivation,
but also, in many instances, from their ignorance
of the subject ;—their needing to be informed of
the facts, and to have the principles explained
to them, on which the Argument proceeds.
And I cannot but think that the generality of
sermons seem to presuppose a degree of religious
knowledge in the hearers greater than many of
them would be found on examination to possess.
When this is the case, the most angelic eloquence
must be unavailing to any practical purpose.
the absurdity in the other case, is, that they affix no dis-
tinct meaning to the word eloquence, often denoting no
more by that term than simply the power of moving the
passions. But even in this improper acceptation, their
notion is far from being just; for wherever there are men,
learned or ignorant, civilized or barbarous, there are pas-
sions; and the greater the difficulty is in affecting these,
the more art is requisite." Campbell's Rhetoric, book i..
chap. x. sec. 2. p. 224, 225.
It may be added to what Dr. C. has here remarked,
that the title of eloquent may have come to be often limited
to such compositions as he is speaking of, from the circum-
stance that their eloquence is (to readers of cultivated
mind) more conspicuous. That which affects our own
feelings is not, by us, at the time at least, perceived to be
eloquence.

In no point more than in that now under
consideration, viz. the Conciliation (to adopt
the term of the Latin writers) of the hearers,
is it requisite to consider who and what the
hearers are; for when it is said that good Sense,
good Principle, and Good-will, constitute the
character which the speaker ought to establish
of himself, it is to be remembered that every
one of these is to be considered in reference to
the opinions and habits of the audience. To
think very differently from his hearers, may
often be a sign of the Orator's wisdom and
worth; but they are not likely to consider it so.
A witty Satirist has observed, that "it is a
short way to obtain the reputation of a wise and
reasonable man, whenever any one tells you
his opinion, to agree with him." Without
going the full length of completely acting on
this maxim, it is absolutely necessary to remem-
ber, that in proportion as the speaker manifests
his dissent from the opinions and principles of
his audience, so far he runs the risk at least of
impairing their estimation of his judgment.
But this it is often necessary to do when any
serious object is proposed; because it will
commonly happen that the very End aimed at
shall be one which implies a change of senti-

ments, or even of principles and character, in
the hearers. Those indeed who aim only at
popularity, are right in conforming their senti-
ments to those of the hearers, rather than the
contrary; but it is plain that though in this
way they obtain the greatest reputation for
Eloquence, they deserve it the less; it being
much easier, according to the tale related of
Mahomet, to go to the mountain, than to bring
the mountain to us. There is but little
+
This must be very much the case with any preacher of
the Gospel, but must have been much more so with its
first promulgators. "Christ crucified" was
"" to the Jews
a stumbling-block, and to the Greeks foolishness." The
total change required in all the notions, habits, and sys-
tems of conduct in the first converts, constituted an obstacle
to the reception of the new religion, which no other that
has prevailed ever had to contend with. The striking
contrast which Mahommedism presents, in this respect, to
Christianity, constitutes the rapid diffusion of the two, by
no means parallel cases.
"Little force is necessary to push down heavy bodies
placed on the verge of a declivity; but much force is re-
quisite to stop them in their progress, and push them up.
If a man should say, that because the first is more fre-
quently effected than the last, it is the best trial of strength,
and the only suitable use to which it can be applied, we
should at least not think him remarkable for distinctness
in his ideas. Popularity alone, therefore, is no test at all

Eloquence in convincing men that they are in
the right, or inducing them to approve a
character which coincides with their own.
The Christian preacher therefore is in this
respect placed in a difficult dilemma; since he
may be sure that the less he complies with the
depraved judgments of man's corrupt nature,
the less acceptable is he likely to be to that
depraved judgment.
But he who would claim the highest rank as
an Orator, (to omit all higher considerations,)
must be the one who is the most successful,
not in gaining popular applause, but in carry-
ing his point, whatever it be. The preacher,
however, who is intent on this object, should
use all such precautions as are not inconsistent
with it, to avoid raising unfavourable impressions
ginally given to the body moving. As in this the direction
of the body, and other circumstances, must be taken into
the account; so in that, you must consider the tendency of
the teaching, whether it favours or opposes the vices of the
hearers. To head a sect, to infuse party-spirit, to make
men arrogant, uncharitable, and malevolent, is the easiest
task imaginable, and to which almost any blockhead is
fully equal. But to produce the contrary effect, to subdue
the spirit of faction, and that monster spiritual pride, with
which it is invariably accompanied, to inspire equity, mo-
deration, and charity into men's sentiments and conduct
with regard to others, is the genuine test of eloquence."

Much will depend on a gentle
and conciliatory manner; nor is it necessary
that he should, at once, in an abrupt and
offensive form, set forth all the differences
of sentiment between himself and his congrega-
tion, but win them over by degrees; and in
whatever point, and to whatever extent, he may
suppose them to agree with him, it is allowable,
and for that reason advisable, to dwell on that
agreement; as the Apostles began every address
to the Jews by an appeal to the Prophets,
whose authority they admitted; and as St.
Paul opens his discourse to the Athenians
(though unfortunately the words of our transla-
tion are likely to convey an opposite idea")
by a commendation of their respect for religion.
And above all, where censure is called for, the
speaker should avoid, not merely on Christian,
but also on Rhetorical principles, all appearance
of exultation in his own superiority,—of con-
tempt, or of uncharitable triumph in the
detection of faults; "in meekness, instructing
them that

§. 2.
Of intellectual qualifications, there is one
which, it is evident, should not only not be
blazoned forth, but should in a great measure be
concealed, or kept out of sight; viz. Rhetorical
skill; since whatever is attributed to the
Eloquence of the speaker is so much deducted
from the strength of his cause. Hence, Pericles
is represented by Thucydides as artfully claim-
ing, in his vindication of himself, the power
of explaining the measures he proposes, not,
Eloquence in persuading their adoption. And
accordingly a skilful Orator seldom fails to
notice and extol the Eloquence of his opponent,
and to warn the hearers against being misled by
it. It is a peculiarity therefore in the Rhe-
torical art, that in it, more than in any other,
vanity has a direct and immediate tendency
to interfere with the proposed object. Ex-
cessive vanity may indeed, in various ways,
prove an impediment to success in other
pursuits; but in the endeavour to Persuadé,
all wish to appear excellent in that art, operates
as a hindrance. A Poet, a Statesman, or a
General, &c. though extreme covetousness of
applause may mislead them, will, however,
attain their respective Ends, certainly not the
less for being admired as excellent, in Poetry,

End the better the less he is regarded as an
Orator; if he can make the hearers believe that
he is not only a stranger to all unfair artifice,
but even destitute of all Persuasive skill what-
ever, he will persuade them the more effectually*,
and if there ever could be an absolutely perfect
Orator, no one would, at the time at least,
discover that he was soy. And this considera-

y The following passage from a review of "The Heart of
Mid-Lothian" coincides precisely with what has here been
remarked: "We cannot bestow the same unqualified praise
on another celebrated scene, Jeannie's interview with Queen
Caroline. Jeannie's pleading appears to us much too rhe-,
torical for the person and for the occasion; and the queen's
answer, supposing her to have been overpowered by Jeannie's
entreaties, 'This is eloquence,' is still worse. Had it been
eloquence, it must necessarily have been unperceived by
the queen.
If there is any art of which celare artem is
the basis, it is this. The instant it peeps out, it defeats
its own object, by diverting our attention from the subject
to the speaker, and that, with a suspicion of his sophistry
equal to our admiration of his ingenuity. A man who, in
answer to an earnest address to the feelings of his hearer,
is told, you have spoken eloquently,' feels that he has
failed. Effie, when she entreats Sharpitlaw to allow her
to see her sister, is eloquent, and his answer accordingly
betrays perfect unconsciousness that she has been so, ‘You
shall see your sister,' he began, 'if you'll tell me;' then

tion may serve to account for the fact which
Cicero remarks upon (De Oratore, book i.)
as so inexplicable; viz. the small number of
persons who, down to his time, had obtained
high reputation as orators, compared with those
who had obtained excellence in other pursuits.
Few men are destitute of the desire of admiration;
and most are especially ambitious of it in the
pursuit to which they have chiefly devoted them-
selves; the Orator therefore is continually
tempted to sacrifice the substance to the shadow,
by aiming rather at the admiration of the hearers,
than their conviction; and thus to fail of that ex-
cellence in his art which he might otherwise be
well qualified to attain, through the desire of a
reputation for it. And on the other hand,
some may have been really persuasive speakers,
who yet may not have ranked high in men's
opinion, and may not have been known to
possess that art of which they gave proof by
their skilful concealment of it. There is no

should in reply, counsel him who wishes to produce a per-
manent effect, (for I am not now adverting to the case of
a barrister,) to keep on the side of what he believes to be
truth; and, avoiding all sophistry, to aim only at setting
forth that truth as strongly as possible, (combating, of
course, any unjust personal prejudice against himself,)
without any endeavour to gain applause for his own abi-
lities. If he is himself thoroughly convinced, and strongly
impressed, and can keep clear of the seductions of vanity,
he will be more likely in this way to gain due credit for the
strength of his cause, than by yielding to a feverish
anxiety about the opinion that others may form of him.
And as I should of course advise the reader or hearer to
endeavour in each case to form his judgment according to
the real and valid arguments urged, and to regulate his
feelings and sentiments according to what the case justly
calls for, so, with a view to this end I would suggest these
two cautions; first, to keep in mind that there is danger of
over-rating as well as of under-rating the eloquence of
what is said; and that to attribute to the skill of the
advocate what really belongs to the strength of his cause,
is just as likely to lead to error as the opposite mistake:
and secondly, to remember that when the feelings are
strongly excited, they are not necessarily over-excited;
it may be that they are only brought into the state which
the occasion fully justifies; or even that they still fall short
of this. It does indeed often happen that men's feelings
are extravagantly heightened on some inadequate occasion;
but it is at least as common (as most preachers know by

a
at first sight that one, viz. "Good-will," is
unnecessary to be mentioned; since Ability
and Integrity would appear to comprehend, in
most cases at least, all that is needed;
virtuous man, it may be said, must wish well
to his countrymen, or to any persons whatever,
whom he may be addressing. But on a more
attentive consideration, it will be manifest that
Aristotle had good reason for mentioning this
head; if the speaker were believed to wish well
to his Country, and to every individual of it,
yet if he were suspected of being unfriendly to
the political or other Party to which his hearers
belonged, they would listen to him with pre-
judice. The abilities and the conscientiousness
of Phocion seem not to have been doubted by
any; but they were so far from gaining him a
favourable hearing among the Democratical
party at Athens, (who knew him to be no friend
to Democracy,) that they probably distrusted
experience) that their feelings should be cold and languid,
and fall far short of what even they themselves would
acknowledge to be reasonable. Stimulants are not to be
condemned as necessarily bringing the body into an un-
natural state because they raise the circulation: in a fever
this would be hurtful; but there may be a torpid, lethargic
disease in which an excitement of the circulation is
precisely what is wanted to bring it into a healthy con-
dition.

him the more; as one whose public spirit
would induce him, and whose talents would
enable him, to subvert the existing Consti-
tution.
One of the most powerful engines, accord-Party-spirit.
ingly, of the Orator, is this kind of appeal to
party-spirit. Party-spirit may, indeed, be con-
sidered in another point of view, as one of the
Passions which may be directly appealed to,
when it can be brought to operate in the direc-
tion required; i. e. when the conduct the
writer or speaker is recommending appears
likely to gratify party-spirit; but it is the indirect
appeal to it which is now under consideration;
viz. the favour, credit, and weight which the
speaker will derive from appearing to be of the
same party with the hearers, or at least not
opposed to it. And this is a sort of credit
which he may claim more openly and avowedly
than any other; and he may likewise throw dis-
credit on his opponent in a less offensive, but

Mr. Pitt, or of Mr. Fox;" "I am a friend
to Presbyterianism or to Episcopacy," (as the
case may be,) and "my opponent the reverse;"

Hard, indeed, therefore is the task of him

take care that he give no ground for being

prejudices of the opposite party,—that he give
his audience credit, (since it rarely happens but
that each party has some tenets that are reason-
able,) for whatever there may be that deserves

remarks that this last is also requisite to be

suspected of wanting Good-will towards him-
self, yet many very able men act most absurdly,
even in their own affairs, for want of Moral
virtue; being either blinded or overcome by their
Passions, so as to sacrifice their own most im-
portant interests to their present gratification;
and much more, therefore, may they be ex-
pected to be thus seduced by personal tempta-
tions, in the advice they give to others. Pericles,
accordingly, in the speech which has been
already referred to, is represented by Thucydides
as insisting not only on his political ability and
his patriotism, but also on his unimpeached in-
tegrity, as a qualification absolutely necessary

that the one party deserves the hearers' con-

their distrust. “If the measure is a good one,"

and not in themselves decisive; it is only
in matters of strict science, and that too, in
arguing to scientific men, that the character
of the advisers (as well as all other probable
Arguments) should be wholly put out of the
question.
And it is remarkable that the necessity of
allowing some weight to this consideration, in
political matters, increases in proportion as any
country enjoys a free government. If all the
power be in the hands of a few of the higher
orders, who have the opportunity at least, of
obtaining education, it is conceivable, whether
probable or not, that they may be brought to
try each proposed measure exclusively on its
intrinsic merits, by abstract arguments; but
can any man, in his senses, really believe that
the great mass of the people, or even any con-
siderable portion of them, can ever possess so
much political knowledge, patience in investiga-

to their opinion of the persons who propose
it? And it is evident that in every case, in
which the hearers are not completely competent
judges, they not only will, but must, take into
consideration the characters of those who pro-
pose, support, or dissuade any measure ;-the
persons they are connected with,-the designs
they may be supposed to entertain, &c. ;
though, undoubtedly, an excessive and ex-
clusive regard to Persons rather than Argu-
ments, is one of the chief Fallacies against which
men ought to be cautioned.
dIf this mode of judging in every case were to be
adopted without limitation, it is plain that children could
not be educated. Indeed happily for the world, most of
them, who were allowed to proceed on this plan, would in
consequence perish in childhood. A pious Christian again
has the same implicit reliance on his God, even where
unable to judge of the reasonableness of his commands and
dispensations, as a dutiful and affectionate child has on
a. tender parent. Now though such a man is of course
regarded by an Atheist as weak and absurd, it is surely on
account of his belief, not of his consequent conduct, that
be is so regarded. Even Atheists would in general admit
that he is acting reasonably, on the supposition that
there is a God, who has revealed himself to man.

Authority
derived from
experience.
In no way, perhaps, are men, not bigoted to
supposed party, more likely to be misled by their favour-
able or unfavourable judgment of their advisers,
than in what relates to the authority derived
from Experience; not that Experience ought
not to be allowed to have great weight; but
that men are apt not to consider with sufficient
attention, what it is that constitutes Expérience
in each point; so that frequently one man shall
have credit for much Experience, in what
relates to the matter in hand, and another, who,
perhaps, possesses as much, or more, shall
be underrated as wanting it. The vulgar, of all
ranks, need to be warned, first, that time alone
does not constitute Experience; so that many
years may have passed over a man's head,
without his even having had the same oppor-
tunities of acquiring it, as another, much
younger; secondly, that the longest practice in
conducting any business in one way, does not
necessarily confer any Experience in conducting
it in a different way; e. g. an experienced
Husbandman, or a Minister of State, in Persia,
would be much at a loss in Europe; and if
they had some things less to learn than an
entire novice, on the other hand they would
have much to unlearn: and, thirdly, that

merely being conversant about a certain class of
subjects, does not confer Experience in a case
where the Operations, and the End proposed,
are different. It is said that there was an
Amsterdam merchant, who had dealt largely
in corn all his life, who had never seen a field of
wheat growing; this man had doubtless acquired,
by Experience, an accurate judgment of the
qualities of each description of corn, of the
best methods of storing it,—of the arts of buying
and selling it at proper times, &c.; but he
would have been greatly at a loss in its cultiva-
tion; though he had been, in a certain way,
long conversant about corn. Nearly similar
is the Experience of a practised Lawyer, (sup-
posing him to be nothing more,) in a case of
Legislation; because he has been long con-
versant about Law, the unreflecting attribute
great weight to his judgment; whereas his
constant habits of fixing his thoughts on what
the law is, and withdrawing it from the irre-
levant question of what the law ought to be ;—
his careful observance of a multitude of rules,
(which afford the more scope for the display
of his skill, in proportion as they are arbitrary,
unreasonable, and unaccountable,) with a studied
indifference as to, that which is foreign from his
business, the convenience or inconvenience of
those Rules,-may be expected to operate

unfavourably on his judgment in questions of
Legislation; and are likely to counterbalance
the advantages of his superior knowledge, even
in such points as do bear on the question.
The consideration then of the character of
the speaker, and of his opponent, being of so
much importance, both as a legitimate source of
Persuasion, in many instances, and also as a
topic of Fallacies, it is evidently incumbent on
the Orator to be well versed in this branch
of the art, with a view both to the justifiable
advancement of his own cause, and
cause, and to the
detection and exposure of unfair artifice in
an opponent. It is neither possible, nor can it
in justice be expected, that this mode of Per-
suasion should be totally renounced and ex-

e In matters connected with Political-economy, the ex-
perience of practical men is often appealed to in opposition
to those who are called Theorists; even though the latter
perhaps are deducing conclusions from a wide induction of
facts, while the experience of the others will often be found
only to amount to their having been long conversant with
the details of office, and having all that time gone on in a
certain beaten track, from which they never tried, nor wit
nessed, nor even imagined, a deviation.
So also the authority derived from experience of a prac-
tical Miner, i. e. one who has wrought all his life in one
mine, will sometimes delude a speculator into a vain search
for metal or coal, against the opinion perhaps of Theorists,

ploded, great as are the abuses to which it is
liable; but the speaker is bound, in conscience,
to abstain from those abuses himself, and, in
prudence, to be on his guard against them in
others.
It only remains to observe, on this head,
that, as Aristotle teaches, the place for the
disparagement of an opponent is, for the first
speaker, near the close of his discourse, to
weaken the force of what may be said in reply ;
and, for the opponent, near the opening, to
lessen the influence of what has been already

It is obvious that this will the most effectually
be done, not by endeavouring to produce a
state of perfect calmness and apathy, but by
exciting some contrary emotion. And here
it is to be observed that some passions may be,
Rhetorically speaking, opposite to each other,
though in strictness they are not so; viz.
whenever they are incompatible with each other:
e. g. the opposite, strictly speaking, to Anger,

would be a feeling of Good-will and approbation
towards the person in question; but it is not by
the excitement of this, alone, that Anger may
be allayed; for Fear is, practically, contrary to
it also; as is remarked by Aristotle; who
philosophically accounts for this, on the prin-
ciple that Anger implying a desire to inflict
punishment, must imply also a supposition that
it is possible to do so; and accordingly men do
not, he says, feel Anger towards one who is so
much superior as to be manifestly out of their
reach; and the object of their Anger ceases to
be so, as soon as he becomes an object of
Apprehension. Of course the converse also of
this holds good; Augerf, when it prevails, in
like manner subduing Fear. Compassion,
likewise, may be counteracted either by Dis-
approbation, by Jealousy, by Fear, or by
Disgust and Horror; and Envy, either by
Good-will, or by Contempt.
This is the more necessary to be attended
to, in order that the Orator may be on his
guard against inadvertently defeating his own
object, by exciting feelings at variance with
f. Savage nations accordingly, having no military disci-
pline, are accustomed to work themselves up into a phrensy
of rage by their war-songs and dances, in order to excite
themselves to courage.

produce, though
those he is endeavouring to
not strictly contrary to them. Aristotle accord-
ingly notices, with this view, the difference
between the "Pitiable,” (¿λɛɛvòv,) and the " Horri-
ble or Shocking," (dewòv,) which, as he observes,
excite different feelings, destructive of each
other; so that the Orator must be warned,
if the former is his object, to keep clear of any
thing that may excite the latter.
It will often happen that it will be easier
to give a new direction to the unfavourable
passion, than to subdue it; e. g. to turn the
indignation or the laughter of the hearers against
a different object. Indeed, whenever the case
will admit of this, it will generally prove the
more successful expedient, because it does
not imply the accomplishment of so great a
change in the minds of the hearers.

THOUGH the consideration of Style has Style not to
been laid down as holding a place in a Treatise of gene-
of Rhetoric, it would be neither necessary nor
pertinent, to enter fully into a general discussion
of the subject; which would evidently embrace
much, that by no means peculiarly belongs to
our present enquiry. It is requisite for an
Orator, e. g. to observe the rules of Grammar;
but the same may be said of the Poet, and the
Historian, &c. nor is there any peculiar kind
of grammatical propriety belonging to Per-
suasive or Argumentative compositions; so
that it would be a departure from our subject to
treat at large, under the head of Rhetoric, of
such rules as equally concern every other of
the purposes for which Language is employed.
Conformably to this view I shall, under the
present head, notice but slightly such principles

of composition as do not exclusively or pecu-
liarly belong to the present subject; confining
my attention chiefly to such observations on
Style as have an especial reference to Argumen-
tative and Persuasive works.
Perspicuity

quality.
§. 2.
It is sufficiently evident (though the maxim
is often practically disregarded) that the first
requisite of Style not only in Rhetorical, but in
all compositions, is Perspicuity; since, as
Aristotle observes, language which is not intel-
ligible, or not clearly and readily intelligible,
fails, in the same proportion, of the purpose for
which language is employed. And it is equally
self-evident (though this truth is still more
frequently overlooked) that Perspicuity is a
relative quality, and consequently cannot pro-
perly be predicated of any work, without a
tacit reference to the class of readers or hearers
for whom it is designed. Nor is it enough that
the Style be such as they are capable of under-
standing, if they bestow their utmost attention:
the degree and the kind of attention, which they
have been accustomed, or are likely to bestow,
will be among the circumstances that are to be
taken into the account, and provided for. I say
the kind, as well as the degree, of attention,
because some hearers and readers will be found
·

slow of apprehension indeed, but capable of
taking in what is very copiously and gradually
explained to them; while others, on the contrary,
who are much quicker at catching the sense of
what is expressed in a short compass, are
incapable of long attention, and are not only
wearied, but absolutely bewildered, by a diffuse
Style.
When a numerous and very mixed audience
is to be addressed, much skill will be required
in adapting the Style, (both in this, and in other
respects,) and indeed the Arguments also, and
the whole structure of the discourse, to the
various minds which it is designed to impress;
nor can the utmost art and diligence prove, after
all, more than partially successful in such a case;
especially when the diversities are so many and
so great, as exist in the congregations to which
most Sermons are addressed, and in the readers
for whom popular works of an argumentative,
instructive, and hortatory character, are intended.
It is possible, however, to approach indefinitely
to an object which cannot be completely at-
tained; and to adopt such a Style, and likewise
such a mode of Reasoning, as shall be level to the
comprehension of the greater part, at least, even
of a promiscuous audience, without being dis-
tasteful to any.
It is obvious, and has often been remarked,

prolixity.
that extreme conciseness is ill suited to hearers
or readers, whose intellectual powers and cul-
tivation are but small: the usual expedient,
Brevity and however, of employing a prolix Style by way of
accommodation to such minds, is seldom suc-
cessful: most of those who could have compre-
hended the meaning, if more briefly expressed,
and many of those who could not do so, are
likely to be bewildered by tedious expansion;
and being unable to maintain a steady attention
to what is said, they forget part of what
they have heard before the whole is completed.
Add to which, that the feebleness produced by
expressive dilution, (if such an expression may
be allowed,) will occasion the attention to
languish; and what is imperfectly attended to,
however clear in itself, will usually be but
imperfectly understood. Let not an author,
therefore, satisfy himself by finding that he has
expressed his meaning so that, if attended to,
he cannot fail to be understood; he must
consider also (as was before remarked) what
attention is likely to be paid to it: if on the
one hand much matter is expressed in very
few words, to an unreflecting audience, or if, on
the other hand, there is a wearisome prolixity,
the requisite attention may very probably not
be bestoweds.

advantages both of conciseness and of prolixity,
is to employ Repetition: to repeat, that is, the
same sentiment and Argument in many different
forms of expression; each, in itself brief, but all,
together, affording such an expansion of the
sense to be conveyed, and so detaining the
mind upon it, as the case may require. Cicero
among the ancients, and Burke among the
modern writers, afford, perhaps, the most abun-
dant practical exemplifications of this rule. The
latter sometimes shews a deficiency in correct
taste, and lies open to Horace's censure of an
lity is not the only requisite in food;-that a certain degree
of distention of the stomach is required, to enable it to act
with its full powers;-and that it is for this reason hay
and straw must be given to horses, as well as corn, in order
to supply the necessary bulk. Something analogous to
this takes place with respect to the generality of minds;
which are incapable of thoroughly digesting and assimilat-
ing what is presented to them, however clearly, in a very small
compass. Many a one is capable of deriving that instruc-
tion from a moderate sized volume, which he could not
receive from a very small pamphlet, even more perspicu-
ously written, and containing every thing that is to the
purpose. It is necessary that the attention should be de-
tained for a certain time on the subject: and persons of
unphilosophical mind, though they can attend to what
they read or hear, are unapt to dwell upon it in the way of
subsequent meditation.

Care must of course be taken that the repeti-

variation must not consist in the mere use of
other, synonymous, words; but what has been

but it may be worth remarking,
that to those who wish to be understood by
the lower orders, one of the best principles of
selection is to prefer terms of Saxon origin,
which will generally be more familiar to them,
than those derived from the Latin, (either
directly or through the medium of the French,)
even when the latter are more in use among
persons of education. Our language being

elements, it is very easy for any one, though
unacquainted with Saxon, to observe this
precept, if he has but a knowledge of French
or of Latin; and there is a remarkable scope
for such a choice as I am speaking of, from the
multitude of synonymes derived, respectively,
from those two sources. The compilers of our
Liturgy being anxious to reach the understand-
ings of all classes, at a time when our language
was in a less settled state than at present,
availed themselves of this circumstance in
employing many synonymous, or nearly sy-
nonymous expressions, most of which are of
the description just alluded to. Take as an
instance, the Exhortation: acknowledge"
and "confess;" "dissemble" and "
cloak ;"
"humble" and "lowly;" "goodness" and
mercy;""assemble" and "meet together."
And here it may be observed that, as in
this last instance, a word of French origin will
very often not have a single word of Saxon
derivation corresponding to it, but may find
an exact equivalent in a phrase of two or more
words: e. g." constitute," "go to make up;"

not incon-
ornament.
In adapting the Style to the comprehension of
sistent with the illiterate¹, a caution is to be observed against
the ambiguity of the word " Plain;" which is op-
posed sometimes to Obscurity, and sometimes to
Ornament; the vulgar require a perspicuous, but
by no means a dry and unadorned Style; on the
contrary, they have a taste rather for the over-
florid, tawdry, and bombastic: nor are the orna-
ments of style by any means necessarily incon-
sistent with perspicuity; Metaphor, which is
among the principal of them, is indeed, in many
cases, the clearest mode of expression that can be
adopted; it being usually much easier for un-
cultivated minds to comprehend a similitude or
analogy, than an abstract term. And hence
the language of savages, as has often been
remarked, is highly metaphorical; and such
appears to have been the case with all languages
in their earlier, and consequently ruder and
the lowest classes, is characteristic of those who in cultiva-
tion of taste are below the highest. As in dress, furniture,
deportment, &c. so also in language, the dread of vulgarity
constantly besetting those who are half conscious that they
are in danger of it, drives them into the extreme of affected
finery. So that the precept which has been given with a
view to perspicuity, may, to a certain degree, be observed
with an advantage in point of elegance also.

burthened with. Take as an instance such a
sentence as this: "It is not without a degree
of patient attention and persevering diligence,
greater than the generality are willing to be-
stow, though not greater than the object
deserves, that the habit can be acquired of ex-
amining and judging of our own conduct with
the same accuracy and impartiality as of that of
another;" this labours under the defect I am
speaking of, which may be remedied by some
such alteration as the following: "the habit of
examining our own conduct as accurately as
that of another, and judging of it with the
same impartiality, cannot be acquired without
a degree of patient attention and persevering
diligence, not greater indeed than the object
deserves, but greater than the generality are
willing to bestow." The two sentences are
nearly the same in length, and in the words
employed; but the alteration of the arrangement
allows the latter to be understood clause by
clause, as it proceeds. The caution just given

* Care must be taken however, in applying this precept,
not to let the beginning of a sentence so forestall what
follows as to render it apparently feeble and impertinent:

Solomon, one of the most celebrated of men for
wisdom and for prosperity,"
"why who needs"
(the hearer will be apt to say to himself) " to be told that?”

is the more necessary to be insisted on, because
an author is apt to be misled by reading over
a sentence to himself, and being satisfied on
finding it perfectly intelligible; forgetting that

has not, of knowing at the beginning of the

liable to be misled by his own knowledge

pressions clearly intelligible, which are so to
himself; but which may not be so to the reader,

And hence it is that some do not write or
speak with so much perspicuity on a subject
which has long been very familiar to them, as
on one which they understand indeed, but
with which they are less intimately acquainted,
and in which their knowledge has been more
recently acquired. In the former case it is a
matter of some difficulty to keep in mind the
necessity of carefully and copiously explaining
principles which by long habit have come to
assume in our minds the appearance of self-

the attention on these circumstances: let the description
come before the name, and the sentence, while it remains
equally perspicuous, will be free from the fault com-

being correct, that obscurity of Style necessarily
springs from indistinctness of Conception.

Af Pog §. 4.
The foregoing rules have all, it is evident,
proceeded on the supposition that it is the
writer's intention to be understood; and this
cannot but be the case in every legitimate
exercise of the Rhetorical art; and generally
speaking, even where the design is Sophistical.
For, as Dr. Campbell has justly remarked, the
Sophist may employ for his purpose what are
in themselves real and valid Arguments; since
probabilities may lie on opposite sides, though
truth can be but on one; his fallacious artifice
consisting only in keeping out of sight the
stronger probabilities which may be urged
against him, and in attributing an undue weight
to those which he has to allege.
Or again
he may, either directly or indirectly, assume as
self-evident a premiss which there is no suf-
ficient ground for admitting; or he may draw
off the attention of the hearers to the proof of
some irrelevant point, &c. according to the
various modes described in the Treatise on
FALLACIES; but in all this there is no call
for any departure from perspicuity of Style,
properly so called; not even when he avails

as Dr. Campbell says, "a Sophism can be
mistaken for an Argument only where it is
not rightly understood," it is the aim of him
who employs it, rather that the matter should
be misunderstood than not understood; that his
language should be deceitful, rather than obscure
or unintelligible. The hearer must not indeed
form a correct, but he must form some, and if
possible, a distinct, though erroneous idea of
the Arguments employed, in order to be misled
by them. The obscurity in short, if it is to be
so called, must not be obscurity of Style;
it must be, not like a mist which dims the ap-
pearance of objects, but like a coloured glass
which disguises them.
Oratory.
There are, however, certain spurious kinds, Spurious
as they may be called, of writing or speaking,
(distinct from what is strictly termed Sophistry,)
in which obscurity of Style may be apposite.
The Object which has all along been supposed,

posed.

said; so as at least to avoid the ignominy of
being silenced. To this end, the more con-
fused and unintelligible the language, the better,
provided it carry with it the
appearance of
profound wisdom, and of being something to
the purpose.
"Now though nothing (says Dr. Campbell)
would seem to be easier than this kind of Style,
where an Author falls into it naturally; that
is, when he deceives himself as well as his
reader, nothing is more difficult when attempted
of design. It is beside requisite, if this manner
must be continued for any time, that it be
artfully blended with some glimpses of mean-
ing; else, to persons of discernment, the charm
will at length be dissolved, and the nothingness
of what has been spoken will be detected; nay
even the attention of the unsuspecting multi-
tude, when not relieved by any thing that is
level to their comprehension, will infallibly flag.
The Invocation in the Dunciad admirably suits
the Orator who is unhappily reduced to the
necessity of taking shelter in the unintelligible:
Of darkness visible so much he lent,
As half to shew, half veil the deep intent."
Chap. viii. sec. 1. p. 119.
This artifice is distinguished from Sophistry,
properly so called, (with which Dr. Campbell

seems to confound it,) by the circumstance that
its tendency is not, as in Sophistry, to convince,
but to have the appearance of arguing, when in
fact nothing is urged; for in order for men to
be convinced, on however insufficient grounds,
they must (as was remarked above) understand
something from what is said, though, if it be
fallacious, they must not understand it rightly;
but if this cannot be accomplished, the Sophist's
next resort is the unintelligible; which indeed is
very often intermixed with the Sophistical,
when the latter is of itself too scanty or too
weak. Nor does the adoption of this Style
serve merely to save his credit as an Orator or
Author; it frequently does more ignorant
and unreflecting persons, though they cannot
be, strictly speaking, convinced, by what they
do not understand, yet will very often suppose,
each, that the rest understand it; and each is
ashamed to acknowledge, even to himself, his
own darkness and perplexity; so that if the
speaker with a confident air announces his
conclusion as established, they will often, ac-
cording to the maxim "omne ignotum pro
mirifico," take for granted that he has advanced
valid Arguments, and will be loth to seem
behind-hand in comprehending them. It usually
requires that a man should have some
fidence in his own understanding, to venture

Another purpose sometimes answered by
a discourse of this kind is, that it serves to
furnish an excuse, flimsy indeed, but not unfre-
quently sufficient, for men to vote or act
according to their own inclinations; which they
would perhaps have been ashamed to do, if

§. 5.
Another end, which in speaking is some-
times proposed, and which is, if possible, still
more remote from the legitimate province of
Rhetoric, is to occupy time. When an un-
favourable decision is apprehended, and the
protraction of the debate may afford time for
fresh voters to be summoned, or may lead to an
adjournment, which will afford scope for some
other manœuvre ;-when there is a chance of so
wearying out the attention of the hearers, that

they will listen with languor and impatience
to what shall be urged on the other side,-
when an advocate is called upon to plead a
cause in the absence of those whose opinion
it is of the utmost importance to influence,
and wishes to reserve all his Arguments till
they arrive, but till then, must apparently
proceed in his pleading; in these and many
similar cases, which it is needless to particu-
larize, it is a valuable talent to be able to pour
forth with fluency an unlimited quantity of
well-sounding language which has little or no
meaning ;-which shall not strike the hearers
as unintelligible or nonsensical, though it convey
to their minds no distinct idea.
Perspicuity of Style,-real, not apparent
perspicuity, is in this case never necessary,
and sometimes, studiously avoided. If any
distinct meaning were conveyed, and that which
was said were irrelevant, it would be perceived
to be so, and would produce impatience in the
hearers, or afford an advantage to the opponents;
if, on the other hand, the speech were relevant,
and there were no Arguments of any force to be
urged, except such as either had been already
dwelt on, or were required to be reserved (as
in the case last alluded to) for a fuller audience,
the speaker would not further his cause by
bringing them forward. So that the usual

resource on these occasions, of such Orators as
thoroughly understand the tricks of their art,
and do not disdain to employ them, is to amuse
their audience with specious emptiness'.
§. 6.
Another kind of spurious Oratory, and the
last that will be noticed, is that which has for its
object to gain the hearer's admiration of the
Eloquence displayed. This, indeed, constitutes
one of the three kinds of Oratory enumerated
by Aristotle, and is regularly treated of by
him along with the Deliberate and Judicial
branches; though it hardly deserves the place he
has bestowed on it.
It is most unfortunate, that in Sermons there should be
so much temptation to fall into the first two (to say no-
thing of the third) of these kinds of spurious oratory: when
it is appointed that a Sermon shall be preached, and
custom requires that it shall be of a certain length, there
cannot but be more danger that the preacher should chiefly
consider himself as bound to say something, and to occupy
the time prescribed, without keeping in mind the object of
leaving his hearers wiser or better, than if he were to preach
solely in consequence of his having such a specific object
to accomplish. See note, part iii. chap. iii. §. 2.
For he says, that in each of the two other kinds, the
hearer is a "judge;" in the first of the "expedient," in
the other, of the "just;" but in the third kind he is only
Owgòs, literally, a Spectator; and is a judge merely (rs
duvausas) of the ability of the Orator.

When this is the end pursued, perspicuity is
not indeed to be avoided, but it may often without
detriment be disregarded". Men frequently
admire as eloquent, and sometimes admire the
most, what they do not at all, or do not fully
comprehend, if elevated and high sounding
words be arranged in graceful and sonorous
periods. Those of uncultivated minds espe-
cially, are apt to think meanly of any thing that
is brought down perfectly to the low level of their
capacity; though to do this with respect to
valuable Truths which are not trite, is one of
the most admirable feats of genius. They admire
the profundity of one who is mystical and
obscure; mistaking the muddiness of the water
for depth; and magnifying in their imaginations
what is viewed through a fog; and they conclude
that brilliant language must represent some
brilliant ideas, without troubling themselves to
enquire what those ideas are.
Many an enthusiastic admirer of a "fine
discourse," or a piece of " fine writing," would
be found on examination to retain only a few
sonorous, but empty phrases; and not only to
have no notion of the general drift of the
Argument, but not even to have ever con-
sidered whether the Author had any such drift
or not.

It is not meant to be insinuated that in every
such case the composition is in itself unmeaning,
or that the Author had no other object than the
credit of Eloquence: he may have had a higher
End in view; and he may have expressed
himself very clearly to some hearers, though not
to all but it is most important to be fully
aware of the fact, that it is possible to obtain
the highest applause from those who not only
receive no edification from what they hear, but
absolutely do not understand it. So far is
popularity from being a safe criterion of the
usefulness of a preacher.

§. 1.
The next quality of Style to be noticed is
what may be called Energy; the term being
used in a wider sense than the 'Evégy of
Aristotle, and nearly corresponding with what
Dr. Campbell calls Vivacity; so as to compre-
hend every thing that may conduce to stimulate
attention, to impress strongly on the mind the
Arguments adduced, to excite the Imagina-
tion, and to arouse the Feelings.
This Energy then, or Vivacity of Style, must
depend (as is likewise the case in respect of

those two classes which Aristotle has described
under the titles of Kúgia and Eva, for which our
language does not afford precisely corresponding

former; the latter class including all others;-
all that are in any way removed from common
use ;-whether uncommon terms, or ordinary
terms, either transferred to a different meaning

denoting them (called by Logicians "Singular
terms,") will of course make the most vivid
impression on the mind, and exercise most the
power of Conception; and the less remote any
term is from these, i. e. the more specific, the
more Energy it will possess, in comparison of
such as are more general. The impression
produced on the mind by a Singular term, may
be compared to the distinct view taken in by
the eye, of any object (suppose some particular
man) near at hand, in a clear light, which
enables us to distinguish the features of the
individual; in a fainter light, or rather farther
off, we merely perceive that the objeet is a man ;
this corresponds with the idea conveyed by the
name of the Species; yet further off, or in a
still feebler light, we can distinguish merely
some living object; and at length, merely some
nominated "secondary," as not properly denoting a "really-
existing-thing," (róda ri,) but rather an attribute. He has,
indeed, been considered as the great advocate of the opposite
doctrine; i. e. the system of" Realism;" which was certainly
embraced by many of his professed followers; but his own
language is sufficiently explicit. Πᾶσα δὲ οὐσία δοκεῖ τόδε τι

object; these views corresponding respectively
with the terms denoting the genera, less or more
remote: and as each of these views conveys, as
far as it goes, an equally correct impression to
the mind, (for we are equally certain that the
object at a distance is something, as that the
one close to us is such and such an individual,)
though each, successively, is less vivid; so, in
language, a General term may be as clearly
understood, as a Specific, or a Singular term, but
will convey a much less forcible impression to
the hearer's mind. "The more General the
terms are," (as Dr. Campbell justly remarks,)
"the picture is the fainter; the more Special
they are, the brighter. The same sentiment
may be expressed with equal justness, and even
equal perspicuity, in the former way, as in the
latter; but as the colouring will in that case be
more languid, it cannot give equal pleasure to
the fancy, and by consequence will not con-
tribute so much either to fix the attention, or to
impress the memory."
It might be supposed at first sight, that an
Author has little or no choice on this point, but
must employ either more or less general terms
according to the objects he is speaking of.
There is, however, in almost every case, great
room for such a choice as we are speaking of;
for, in the first place, it depends on our choice

whether or not we will employ terms more
general than the subject requires; which may
almost always be done consistently with Truth
and Propriety, though not with Energy; if it
be true that a man has committed murder, it
may be correctly asserted, that he has committed
a crime: if the Jews were "exterminated,"
and "Jerusalem demolished" by " Vespasian's
army," it may be said, with truth, that they
were “subdued" by "an Enemy," and their
Capital" taken. This substitution then of
the General for the Specific, or of the Specific
for the Singular, is always within our reach;
and many, especially unpractised Writers, fall
into a feeble Style by resorting to it unneces
sarily; either because they imagine there is
more appearance of refinement or of profundity,
in the employment of such terms as are in less
common use among the vulgar, or, in some
cases, with a view to give greater comprehen-
siveness to their reasonings, and to increase
the utility of what they say, by enlarging the
field of its application. Inexperienced Preachers
frequently err in this way, by dwelling on
Virtue and Vice,-Piety and Irreligion, in the
abstract, without particularizing; forgetting that
while they include much, they impress little or
nothing.
The only appropriate occasion for this Generic

language, (as it may be called,) is when we
wish to avoid giving a vivid impression,-when
our object is to soften what is offensive, dis-
gusting, or shocking; as when we speak of an
"execution," for the infliction of the sentence
of death on a criminal: of which kind of

the two classes just mentioned. The use of

duces much to the Energy of the expression,
without occasioning, in general, any risk of
its meaning being mistaken. The passage
cited by Dr. Campbell, from one of our
Lord's discourses, (which are in general of this
character,) together with the remarks made upon
it, will serve to illustrate what has been just
said: "Consider,' says our Lord, the lilies
how they grow: they toil not, they spin not;
and yet I say unto you, that Solomon in all his
glory, was not arrayed like one of these. If
then God so clothe the grass, which to-day is in
the field, and to-morrow is cast into the oven,
how much more will he clothe you?' Let us
here adopt a little of the tasteless manner of
modern paraphrasts, by the substitution of more
General terms, one of their many expedients of
infrigidating, and let us observe the effect pro-
duced by this change. • Consider the flowers

that no king whatever, in his most splendid

his providence doth so adorn the vegetable pro-
ductions, which continue but little time on the
land, and are afterwards devoted to the meanest
uses, how much more will he provide clothing
for you ? How spiritless is the same sentiment
rendered by these small variations? The very
particularizing of to-day and to-morrow, is in-
finitely more expressive of transitoriness, than
any description wherein the terms are General,
that can be substituted in its room." It is
a remarkable circumstance that this characteristic
of style is perfectly retained in translation, in
which every other excellence of expression is
liable to be lost; so that the prevalence of this
kind of language in the Sacred writers may be
regarded as something providential. It may be
said with truth, that the book which it is the
most necessary to translate into every language,
is chiefly characterised by that kind of excel-
lence in diction which is least impaired by
translation.

is the Metaphor, in the usual and limited sense;
viz. a word substituted for another, on account
of the Resemblance or Analogy between their
significations. The Simile or Comparison may
be considered as differing in form only from
a Metaphor; the Resemblance being in that
case stated, which in the Metaphor is implied.
Each may be founded either on Resemblance,
strictly so called, i. e. direct Resemblance be-
tween the objects themselves in question, (as
when we speak of "table-land," or compare
great waves to mountains,) or on Analogy,
which is the resemblance of Ratios,—a simi-
larity of the relations they bear to certain other
objects; as when we speak of the "light of
reason," or of "revelation;" or compare a
wounded and captive warrior to a stranded
ship. The Analogical Metaphors and Com-
parisons are both the more frequent and the
more striking. They are the more frequent,
because almost every object has such a multi-
tude of relations, of different kinds, to many
other objects; and they are the more striking,
because (as Dr. A. Smith has well remarked)
the more remote and unlike in themselves any

two objects are, the more is the mind impressed
and gratified by the perception of some point
in which they agree.
It has been already observed, under the
head of Example, that we are carefully to
distinguish between an Illustration, (i. e. an
Argument from Analogy or Resemblance,) and
what is properly called a Simile or Comparison,
introduced merely to give force or beauty to
the expression. The aptness and beauty of an
Illustration sometimes leads men to overrate,
and sometimes to underrate, its force as an
Argument".
With respect to the choice between the
Metaphorical form and that of Comparison, it
may be laid down as a general rule, that the
former is always to be preferred*, wherever it
is sufficiently simple and plain to be imme-
diately comprehended; but that which as a
Metaphor would sound obscure and enigmatical,
may be well received if expressed as a Com-
parison. We may say, e. g. with propriety,
that Cromwell trampled on the laws:" it
would sound flat to say that "he treated the
laws with the same contempt as a man does

any thing which he tramples under his feet."
On the other hand it would be harsh and
obscure to say, "the stranded vessel lay shaken
by the waves," meaning the wounded Chief
tossing on the bed of sickness; it is therefore
necessary in such a case to state the Re-
semblance. But this is never to be done more
fully than is necessary to perspicuity; because
all men are more gratified at catching the Re-
semblance for themselves, than at having it
Metaphori- pointed out to them". And accordingly the
greatest masters of this kind of Style, when
the case will not admit of pure Metaphor,
generally prefer a mixture of Metaphor with
Simile; first pointing out the similitude, and
afterwards employing metaphorical terms which
imply it; or, vice versa, explaining a Metaphor
by a statement of the Comparison. To take
examples of both kinds from an Author who
particularly excels in this point; (speaking of
a morbid Fancy,)

Of the words here put in italics, the former is
a Metaphor, the latter introduces a Com-
parison. Though the instances here adduced
are taken from a Poet, the judicious manage-
ment of Comparison which they exemplify, is
even more essential to a Prose writer, to whom
less licence is allowed in the employment of
it. It is a remark of Aristotle, (Rhet. book
iii. chap. 4.) that the Simile is more suitable in
Poetry, and that Metaphor is the only ornament
of language in which the Orator may freely
indulge. He should therefore be the more
careful to bring a Simile as near as possible to
the Metaphorical form. The following is an
example of the same kind of expression:
"These metaphysic rights entering into com-
mon life, like rays of light which pierce into a
dense medium, are, by the laws of nature, re-
fracted from their straight line. Indeed, in
the gross and complicated mass of human
passions and concerns, the primitive rights of
a Marmion.

man undergo such a variety of refractions, and
reflections, that it becomes absurd to talk of
them as if they continued in the simplicity of
their original direction"."
Metaphors may be employed, as Aristotle
observes, either to elevate or to degrade the
subject, according to the design of the Author;
being drawn from similar or corresponding
objects of a higher or lower character. Thus
a loud and vehement Speaker may be described
either as bellowing, or as thundering. And
in both cases, if the Metaphor is apt and
suitable to the purpose designed, it is alike
conducive to Energy. He remarks that the
same holds good with respect to Epithets also,
which may be drawn either from the highest or
the lowest attributes of the thing spoken of".
Metonymy likewise (in which a part is put
for a whole, a cause for an effect, &c.) admits
of a similar variety in its applications.
Any Trope (as is remarked by Dr. Camp-
↳ Burke, On the French Revolution.
A happier example cannot be found than the one which
Aristotle cites from Simonides, who, when offered a small
price for an Ode to celebrate a victory in a mule-race, ex-
pressed his contempt for half-asses, (¿µlovo,) as they were
commonly called; but when a larger sum was offered,
addressed them in an Ode ፡፡

bell) adds force to the expression, when it tends
to fix the mind on that part, or circumstance,
in the object spoken of, which is most essential
to the purpose in hand. Thus, there is an
Energy in Abraham's Periphrasis for "God,"
when he is speaking of the allotment of Divine
punishment:" shall not the Judge of all the
earth do right?" If again we were alluding to
His omniscience, it would be more suitable to
say, "this is known only to the Searcher of
hearts" if, to his power, we should speak of
Him as “ the Almighty," &c.
Of Metaphors, those generally conduce most
to that Energy or Vivacity of Style we are
speaking of, which illustrate an intellectual by
a sensible object; the latter being always the
most early familiar to the mind, and generally
giving the most distinct impression to it. Thus
we speak of "unbridled rage,” “ deep-rooted
prejudice," glowing eloquence," a stony
heart," &c. And a similar use may be made
of Metonymy also; as when we speak of the
"Throne," or the "Crown" for " Royalty,"
the "sword" for "military violence," &c.

violated, i. e. when sensible objects are illus-
trated by intellectual. For the disadvantage is
overbalanced by the vivid impression produced
by the idea of personality or activity; as
when we speak of the rage of a torrent, a
furious storm, a river disdaining to endure its
bridge, &c. Many such expressions, indeed,
are in such common use as to have lost all their
Metaphorical force, since they cease to suggest
the idea belonging to their primary signification,
and thus are become, practically, Proper terms.
But a new, or at least unhackneyed, Metaphor
of this kind, if it be not far-fetched and obscure,
adds greatly to the force of the expression.
This was a favourite figure with Homer, from
whom Aristotle has cited several examples of
it; as "the raging arrow," " the darts eager
to taste of flesh," " the shameless" (or, as it
The figure called by Rhetoricians Prosopopoeia (lite-
rally, Personification) is, in fact, no other than a Metaphor
of this kind: thus, in Demosthenes, Greece is represented
as addressing the Athenians. So also in the book of

blood crieth unto me from the ground."

f There is a peculiar aptitude in some of these expres-
sions which the modern student is very likely to overlook;
an arrow or dart, from its flying with a spinning motion,
quivers violently when it is fixed; thus suggesting the idea
of a person trembling with eagerness.

with less dignity, "the provoking) stone,"
(xãas åvaidùs,) which mocks the efforts of Sisy-
phus, &c. Our language possesses one re-
markable advantage, with a view to this kind
of Energy, in the constitution of its genders.
All nouns in English, which express objects.
that are really neuter, are considered as strictly
of the neuter gender; the Greek and Latin,
though possessing the advantage (which is
wanting in the languages derived from them)
of having a neuter gender, yet lose the benefit
of it, by fixing the masculine or feminine
genders upon many nouns denoting things in-
animate; whereas in English, when we speak
of
any such object in the masculine or feminine
gender, that form of expression at once confers
personality upon it. When " Virtue," e. g.
or our " Country," are spoken of as females,
or" Ocean" as a male, &c. they are, by that
very circumstance, personified; and a stimulus
is thus given to the imagination, from the very
circumstance that in calm discussion or descrip-
tion, all of these would be neuter; whereas in
Greek or Latin, as in French or Italian, no
such distinction could be made. The employ-
ment of" Virtus," and "'Agerǹ," in the femi-
nine gender, can contribute, accordingly, no

There is, however, very little, comparatively,
of Energy produced by any Metaphor or Simile
that is in common use, and already familiar to
the hearer; indeed, what were originally the
boldest Metaphors, are become, by long use,
virtually, Proper terms; as is the case with the
words "source," "reflection," &c. in their
transferred senses; and frequently are even
nearly obsolete in the literal sense, as in the
words" ardour," "acuteness,' " ruminate,"
&c. If, again, a Metaphor or Simile that is
not so hackneyed as to be considered common
property, be taken from any known Author, it
strikes every one, as no less a plagiarism than
if an entire argument or description had been
thus transferred. And hence it is, that, as
Aristotle remarks, the skilful employment of
these, more than of any other, ornaments of
language, may be regarded as a mark of genius:
(suquias onusov,) not that he means to say, as
some interpreters suppose, that this power is
entirely a gift of nature, and in no degree to be
learnt; on the contrary, he expressly affirms,
that the "perception of Resemblances," on

which it depends, is the fruit of " Philosophy";"
but he means that Metaphors are not to be,
like other words and phrases, selected from
common use, and transferred from one com-
position to another¹, but must be formed for
the occasion. Some care is accordingly re-
quisite, in order that they may be readily com-
prehended, and may not have the appearance
of being far-fetched and extravagant; for this
purpose it is usual to combine with the Meta-
phor a Proper term which explains it; viz.
either attributing to the term in its transferred
sense, something which does not belong to it
in its literal sense; or vice versa, denying of
it in its transferred sense, something which does
belong to it in its literal sense. To call the
Sea the "watery bulwark," of our island,
would be an instance of the former kind; an
example of the latter is the expression of a
writer who speaks of the dispersion of some
hostile fleet, by the winds and waves," those
ancient and unsubsidized allies of England."
It is hardly necessary to mention the obvious
and hackneyed cautions against mixture of
Metaphors; and against any that are complex

and far-pursued, so as to approach to Allegory.
In this last case, the more apt and striking is
the Analogy suggested, the more will it have
of an artificial appearance; and will draw off
the reader's attention from the subject, to admire
the ingenuity displayed in the Style. Young
writers, of genius, ought especially to be ad-
monished to ask themselves frequently, not
whether this or that is a striking expression,
but whether it makes the meaning more striking
than another phrase would,-whether it im-
presses more forcibly the sentiment to be con-
veyed.
§. 4.
It is a common practice with some writers
to endeavour to add force to their expressions
by accumulating high-sounding Epithets', de-
strain;"" which," says the Critic, "is an act that was
never restrained by a bridle." Some, however, are too
fastidious on this point. Words, which by long use in a
transferred sense, have lost nearly all their metaphorical
force, may fairly be combined in a manner which, taking
them literally, would be incongruous. It would savour of
hypercriticism to object to such an expression as " fertile
source."
I Epithets, in the Rhetorical sense, denote, not every
adjective, but those only which do not add to the sense,
but signify something already implied in the noun itself;
as, if one says, "the glorious sun;" on the other hand, to

noting the greatness, beauty, or other admirable
qualities of the things spoken of; but the effect
is generally the reverse of what is intended.
Most readers, except those of a very vulgar or
puerile taste, are disgusted at studied efforts to
point out and force upon their attention what-
ever is remarkable; and this, even when the
ideas conveyed are themselves striking. But
when an attempt is made to cover poverty of
thought with mock sublimity of language, and
to set off trite sentiments and feeble arguments
by tawdry magnificence, the only result is, that
a kind of indignation is superadded to con-
tempt; as when (to use Quinctilian's com-
parison) an attempt is made to supply, by
paint, the natural glow of a youthful and healthy
complexion".

speak of the "rising" or "meridian sun," would not be
considered as, in this sense, employing an Epithet.
m" A principal device in the fabrication of this Style,"
(the mock-eloquent,)" is to multiply epithets,-dry epithets,
laid on the outside, and into which none of the vitality
of the sentiment is found to circulate. You may take a
great number of the words out of each page, and find that
the sense is neither more nor less for your having cleared
the composition of these Epithets of chalk of various
colours, with which the tame thoughts had submitted
to be rubbed over, in order to be made fine." Foster,

Frigid
Style.
We expect, indeed, and excuse in ancient
writers, as a part of the unrefined simplicity of
a ruder language, such a redundant use of
Epithets as would not be tolerated in a modern,
even in a translation of their works; the "white
milk,” and “dark gore," &c. of Homer, must
not be retained, at least, not so frequently as
they occur in the original. Aristotle, indeed,
gives us to understand that in his time this
liberty was still allowed to Poets; but later
taste is more fastidious. He censures, however,
the adoption, by prose-writers, of this, and of
every other kind of ornament that might seem
to border on the poetical; and he bestows
on such a Style the appellation of “frigid,”
(uxgov,) which at first sight may appear some-
what remarkable, (though the same expression,
frigid," might very properly be so applied by
us,) because "warm," "glowing," and such-
like Metaphors, seem naturally applicable to
poetry. This very
circumstance, however,
does in reality account for the use of the other
expression. We are, in poetical prose, re-
minded of, and for that reason disposed to miss,
the "warmth and glow" of poetry: it is on
the same principle that we are disposed to
speak of coldness in the
rays of the moon,
because they remind us of sunshine, but want
its warmth; and that (to
use an humbler and

more familiar instance) an empty fire-place is
apt to suggest an idea of cold.
The use of Epithets however, in prose com-
position, is not to be proscribed; as the judicious
employment of them is undoubtedly conducive
to Energy. It is extremely difficult to lay
down any precise rules on such a point. The
only safe guide in practice must be a taste
formed from a familiarity with the best Authors,
and from the remarks of a skilful Critic, on
one's own composition. It may, however, be
laid down as a general caution, more particularly
needful for young writers, that an excessive
luxuriance of Style, and especially a redundancy
of Epithets, is the worse of the two extremes;
as it is a positive fault, and a very offensive
one; while the opposite is but the absence of
an excellence. It is also an important rule Caution
that the boldest and most striking, and almost uniform
against
poetical, turns of expression, should be reserved
(as Aristotle has remarked, book iii. chap. 7.)
for the most impassioned parts of a discourse;
and that an Author should guard against
the vain ambition of expressing every thing
in an equally high-wrought, brilliant, and
forcible Style. The neglect of this caution
often occasions the imitation of the best models,
to prove detrimental. When the admiration
of some fine and animated passages leads a
brilliancy.

young writer to take those passages for his
general model, and to endeavour to make every
sentence he composes equally fine, he will, on
the contrary, give a flatness to the whole, and
destroy the effect of those portions which would
have been forcible if they had been allowed to
stand prominent. To brighten the dark parts
of a picture, produces much the same result as
if one had darkened the bright parts; in either
case there is a want of relief and contrast; and
Composition, as well as Painting, has its lights
and shades, which must be distributed with
no less skill, if we would produce the desired
effect".
Uses of epi-
thets.
In no place, however, will it be advisable to
introduce any Epithet which does not fulfil one
of these two purposes; 1st, to explain a Meta-
phor; a use which has been noticed under that
head, and which will justify, and even require,
the introduction of an Epithet, which, if it had
been joined to the Proper term, would have
been glaringly superfluous; thus, Æschylus
speaks of the "winged hound of Jove,"
meaning the Eagle: to have said the "winged
eagle," would have had a very different effect;

2dly, when the Epithet expresses something
which, though implied in the subject, would
not have been likely to occur at once spontane-
ously to the hearer's mind, and yet is im-
portant to be noticed with a view to the purpose
in hand. Indeed it will generally happen, that
the Epithets employed by a skilful Orator, will
be found to be, in fact, so many abridged argu-
ments, the force of which is sufficiently conveyed
by a mere hint; e. g. if any one says, "we
ought to take warning from the bloody revolution
of France," the Epithet suggests one of the
reasons for our being warned; and that, not

and prose-writers most, should be very cautious
and sparing in the use of them; not only
because in excess they produce a barbarous
dialect, but because they are so likely to suggest
the idea of artifice; the perception of which is
most especially adverse to Energy. The occa-
sional apt introduction of such a term will
sometimes produce a powerful effect; but
whatever may seem to savour of affectation,
or even of great solicitude and study in the
choice of terms, will effectually destroy the true
effect of Eloquence. The language which
betrays art, and carries not an air of simplicity
and sincerity, may, indeed, by some hearers,
be thought not only very fine, but even very
energetic; this very circumstance, however, may
be taken for a proof that it is not so; for if it
had been, they would not have thought about
it, but would have been occupied, exclusively,
with the subject. An unstudied and natural
air, therefore, is an excellence to which the
true Orator, i. e. he who is aiming to carry
his point, will be ready to sacrifice any other
that may interfere with it.
The principle here laid down will especially
apply to the choice of words, with a view to
their Imitative, or otherwise appropriate Sound.
The attempt to make "the sound an echo to the
sense," is indeed more frequently to be met with

217
in poets than in prose writers; but it may be
worth remarking, that an evident effort after
this kind of excellence, as it is offensive in any
kind of composition, would in prose appear
peculiarly disgusting. Critics treating on this
subject have gone into opposite extremes: some
fancifully attributing to words, or combinations
of words, an Imitative power far beyond what
they can really possess, and representing this
kind of Imitation as deserving to be studiously
aimed at; and others, on the contrary, con-
sidering nearly the whole of this kind of excel-
lence as no better than imaginary, and regarding
the examples which do occur, and have been
cited, of a congruity between the sound and
the sense, as purely accidental.
The truth probably lies between these two
extremes.
In the first place, that words denoting sounds,
Pope has accordingly been justly censured for his in-
consistency in making the Alexandrine represent both a
quick and a slow motion:
1. "Flies o'er the unbending corn, and skims along the main."
2. " Which, like a wounded snake, drags its slow length along."
In the first instance, he forgot that an Alexandrine is long,
from containing
more feet than a common verse; whereas
a long hexameter has but the same number of feet as a
short one, and therefore being pronounced in the same
time, seems to move more rapidly.

or employed in describing them, may be Imi-
tative of those sounds, must be admitted by all;
indeed this kind of Imitation is, to a certain
degree, almost unavoidable, in our language at
least; which abounds perhaps more than any
other, in these, as they may be called, naturally
expressive terms; such as "hiss," "rattle,"
"clatter," "splash," and many others.
In the next place, it is also allowed by most,
that quick or slow motion may, to a certain
degree at least, be imitated or represented by
words; many short syllables (unincumbered by
a clash either of vowels, or of consonants
coming together) being pronounced in the
same time with a smaller number of long syl-
lables, abounding with these incumbrances, the
former seems to have a natural correspondence
to a quick, and the latter to a slow motion;
since in the one a greater, and in the other a
less space, seem to be passed over in the same
time. In the ancient Poets, their hexameter
verses being always considered as of the same
length, i. e. in respect of the time taken to pro-
nounce them, whatever proportion of dactyls
or spondees they contained, this kind of Imita-
tion of quick or slow motion, is the more
apparent; and after making all allowances for
fancy, it seems impossible to doubt that in
many instances it does exist; as, e. g. in the

often-cited line which expresses the rolling of
Sisyphus's stone down the hill:
Αὖθις ἔπειτα πέδονδε κυλίνδετο λᾶας ἀναιδής.
The following passage from the Æneid can
hardly be denied to exhibit a correspondence
with the slow and quick motions at least, which it
describes; that of the Trojans laboriously hewing
the foundations of a tower on the top of Priam's
palace, and that of its sudden and violent fall:
“ Aggrēssī férrō cīrcīm, quā summa labantes',
Junctūrās tabulata dabat, divellimus altis
Sedibus, impulimusque, ĕă lapsă rěpentě růinam
Cum sănĭtu trăhit, et Dănăum super agmină late
Incidit."
But, lastly, it seems not to require any exces-
sive exercise of fancy to perceive, if not, properly
speaking, an Imitation, by words, of other
things besides sound and motion, at least, an
Analogical aptitude. That there is at least
The slow movement of this line would be much more
perceptible, if we pronounced (as doubtless the Latins did)
the doubled consonants; "ag-gres-si fer-rosum-ma:"
but in English, and consequently in the English way of
reading Latin or Greek, the doubling of a consonant only
serves to fix the place of the accent; the latter of the two
being never pronounced, except in a very few compound
words; as "innate," "connatural," "poor-rate," "hop-
pole."

an apparent Analogy between things sensible,
and things intelligible, is implied by numberless
Metaphors; as when we speak of "rough, or
harsh, soft, or smooth manners," " turbulent
passions," the "stroke, or the storms of adver-
sity," &c. Now if there are any words, or
combinations of words, which have in their
sound a congruity with certain sensible objects,
there is no reason why they should not have
the same congruity with those emotions, actions,
&c. to which these sensible objects are ana-
logous. Especially, as it is universally allowed
that certain musical combinations are, respec-
tively, appropriate to the expression of grief,
anger, agitation, &c.
On the whole, the most probable conclusion
seems to be, that many at least of the cele-
brated passages that are cited as Imitative in
sound, were, on the one hand, not the result of
accident, nor yet, on the other hand, of study;
but that the idea in the author's mind spontane-
ously suggested appropriate sounds: thus, when
Milton's mind was occupied with the idea of
the opening of the infernal gates, it seems
natural that his expression,
And on their hinges grate harsh thunder,”
should have occurred to him without any dis-
tinct intention of imitating sounds.

It will be the safest rule, therefore, for a prose-
writer at least, never to make any distinct effort
after this kind of Energy of expression, but to
trust to the spontaneous occurrence of suitable
sounds on every occasion where the introduction
of them is likely to have a good effect.

It is hardly necessary to give any warning, Technical
generally, against the unnecessary introduction
of Technical language of any kind, when the
meaning can be adequately, or even tolerably,

The terms and phrases of Art have an air of
pedantic affectation, for which they do not
compensate, by even the smallest appearance
of increased Energy. But there is an apparent
s Of course this rule does not apply to avowedly technical
systems of instruction. In such works the usual and the
best rule is, to employ as far as possible such technical
terms as custom has already established; defining, modi-
fying, restricting, extending, &c. these, if necessary, as the
occasion may require. Sometimes however the introduc-
tion of new ones will be called for, either in addition to the
others, or in their stead, when there are very strong ob-
jections against these. It is no uncommon trick with some
writers to invent and adopt, on the slightest pretext, com-
plete new sets of technical terms, the more strange and
uncouth, the better for their purpose; and thus to pass off
long-known truths for prodigious discoveries, and gain the

exception to this rule, in the case of what may
be called the "Theological Style;" a peculiar
phraseology, adopted more or less by a large
proportion of writers of Sermons and other
religious works; consisting partly of peculiar
terms, but chiefly of common words used in a
peculiar sense or combination, so as to form
altogether a kind of diction widely differing
from the classical standard of the language.
Theological This phraseology having being formed partly
from the Style of some of the most eminent
Divines, partly, and to a much greater degree,
from that of the Scriptures, i. e. of our Version,
has been supposed to carry with it an air of
appropriate dignity and sanctity, which greatly
adds to the force of what is said. And this may,
perhaps, be the case when what is said is of little
or no intrinsic weight, and is only such meagre
common-place as many religious works consist
of: the associations which such language will
excite in the minds of those accustomed to it,
credit of universal originality by the boldness of their inno-
vations in language: like some voyagers of discovery, who
take possession of countries, whether before-visited or not,
by formally giving them new names. He who treats of

archetypation," "disambiguation," "discoursual," "ano-
opneumatology," &c. may pretend with truth to be, in one

supplying in some degree the deficiencies of
the matter. But this diction, though it may
serve as a veil for poverty of thought, will be
found to produce no less the effect of obscur-
ing the lustre of what is truly valuable: if it
adds an appearance of strength to what is weak,
it adds weakness to what is strong; and if
pleasing to those of narrow and ill cultivated
minds, it is in a still higher degree repulsive
to persons of taste.

improvement of the majority is a higher object
than the gratification of a refined taste in a few ;
but it may be doubted whether any real Energy,
even with respect to any class of hearers, is
gained by the use of such a diction as that of
which I am speaking. For it will often be
found, that what is received with great appro-
bation, is yet, even if, strictly speaking, under-
stood, but very little attended to, or impressed
upon the minds of the hearers. Terms and
phrases which have been long familiar to them,
and have certain vague and indistinct notions
associated with them, men often suppose them-
selves to understand much more fully than they
do; and still oftener give a sort of indolent
assent to what is said, without making any effort
of thought.
It is justly observed by Mr. Foster, (Essay

iv.) when treating on this subject, that "with
regard to a considerable proportion of Christian
readers and hearers, a reformed language would
be excessively strange to them;" but that "its
being so strange to them, would be a proof of
the necessity of adopting it, at least, in part, and
by degrees. For the manner in which some
of them would receive this altered diction,
would prove that the customary phraseology
had scarcely given them any clear ideas. It
would be found that the peculiar phrases had
been not so much the vehicles of ideas, as the
substitutes for them. These readers and hearers
have been accustomed to chime to the sound,
without apprehending the sense; insomuch, that
if they hear the very ideas which these phrases
signify, expressed ever
expressed ever so simply in other
language, they do not recognise them."
He observes also, with much truth, that the
studied incorporation and imitation of the lan-
guage of the Scriptures in the texture of any
Discourse, neither indicates reverence for the
divine composition, nor adds to the dignity of
that which is human: but rather diminishes that
of such passages as might be introduced from
the sacred writings in pure and distinct quo-
tation, standing contrasted with the general
Style of the work.

called, of Theology, there are many, the place
of which might easily be supplied by corre-
sponding expressions in common use; there are
others, doubtless, which, denoting ideas exclu-
sively belonging to the subject, could not be
avoided without a tedious circumlocution;
these, therefore, may be admitted as allowable
peculiarities of diction; and the others, perhaps,
need not be entirely disused: but it is highly
desirable that both should be very frequently
exchanged for words or phrases entirely free
from any Technical peculiarity, even at the
expense of some circumlocution. Not that
this should be done so constantly as to render
the terms in question obsolete; but by intro-
ducing frequently both the term and a sentence
explanatory of the same idea, the evil just men-
tioned,—the habit of not thinking, or not think-
ing attentively, of the meaning of what is said,
will be, in great measure, guarded against,—the
Technical words themselves will make a more
forcible impression,-and the danger of sliding
into unmeaning cant will be materially lessened.
Such repetitions, therefore, will more than
compensate for, or rather will be exempt from,
any appearance of tediousnes, by the addition
both of Perspicuity and Energyt.

It may be asserted, with but too much truth,
that a very considerable proportion of Christians
have a habit of laying aside in a great degree their
common sense, and letting it, as it were, lie
dormant, when points of Religion come before
them; as if Reason were utterly at variance
innovations have been introduced, partly by the ceasing to
employ the words designating those doctrines which were
designed to be set aside: but it is probable they may have
been still more frequently and successfully introduced under
the advantage of retaining the terms, while the principles
were gradually subverted. And therefore, since the pe-
culiar words can be kept to one invariable signification
only by keeping that signification clearly in sight, by
means of something separate from these words themselves,
it might be wise in Christian authors and speakers some-
times to express the ideas in common words, either in con-
nexion with the peculiar terms, or, occasionally, instead of
them. Common words might less frequently be applied,
as affected denominations of things, which have their own
direct and common denominations, and be less frequently
combined into uncouth phrases. Many peculiar and an-
tique words might be exchanged for other single words of
equivalent signification, and in common use. And the
small number of peculiar terms acknowledged and esta-
blished, as of permanent use and necessity, might, even
separately from the consideration of modifying the diction,
be, occasionally, with advantage to the explicit declaration
and clear comprehension of Christian truth, made to give
place to a fuller expression, in a number of common words,
of those ideas of which they are the single signs." Foster,

with Religion, and the ordinary principles of
sound Judgment were to be completely super-
seded on that subject; and accordingly it will
be found, that there are many errors which are
adopted,-many truths which are overlooked,
or not clearly understood,-and many difficulties
which stagger and perplex them, for want,
properly speaking, of the exercise of their com-
mon sense; i. e. in cases precisely analogous to
such as daily occur in the ordinary affairs of
life; in which those very same persons would
form a correct, clear, prompt, and decisive
judgment. It is well worthy of consideration,
how far the tendency to this habit might be
diminished by the use of a diction conformable
to the suggestions which have been here thrown

our sentiments by speech, the narrower the
compass of words is, wherein the thought is
comprised, the more energetic is the expression.
Accordingly, we find that the very same senti-
ment expressed diffusely, will be admitted
barely to be just ;-expressed concisely, will
be admired as spirited." He afterwards re-
marks, that though a languid redundancy of
words is in all cases to be avoided, the energetic
brevity which is the most contrary to it, is not
adapted alike to every subject and occasion.
"The kinds of writing which are less suscep-
tible of this ornament, are, the Descriptive, the
Pathetic, the Declamatory", especially the last.
It is, besides, much more suitable in writing.
than in speaking. A reader has the command
of his time: he may read fast or slow, as he
finds convenient; he can peruse a sentence
a second time when necessary, or lay down the
book and think. But if, in haranguing the
people, you comprise a great deal in few words,
the hearer must have uncommon quickness of
apprehension to catch the meaning, before you
have put it out of his power, by engaging his
attention to something else."
"This remark is made, and the principle of it (which
Dr. Campbell has omitted) subjoined, in part ii. chap. ii.

The mode in which this inconvenience should
be obviated, and in which the requisite ex-
pansion may be given to any thing which the
persons addressed cannot comprehend in a
very small compass, is, as I have already re-
marked, not so much by increasing the number
of words in which the sentiment is conveyed
in each sentence, (though in this, some variation
must of course be admitted,) as by repeating it
in various forms. The uncultivated and the
dull will require greater expansion, and more
copious illustration of the same thought, than
the educated and the acute; but they are even
still more liable to be wearied or bewildered by
prolixity. If the material is too stubborn to be
speedily cleft, we must patiently continue our
efforts for a longer time, in order to accomplish
it: but this is to be done, not by making each
blow fall more slowly, which would only
enfeeble them, but by often-repeated blows.

bcause such a style will often appear not only
to the author, but to the vulgar, (i. e. the vulgar
in intellect,) among his hearers, to be very
majestic and impressive. It is not uncommon
to hear a speaker or writer of this class, men-
tioned as having a "very fine command of
language," when, perhaps, it might be said
with more correctness, that "his language has
a command of him ;" i. e. that he follows a
train of words rather than of thought, and
strings together all the striking expressions that
occur to him on the subject, instead of first
forming a clear notion of the sense he wishes
to convey, and then seeking for the most ap-
propriate vehicle in which to convey it.
If, indeed, any class of men are found to be
the most effectually convinced, persuaded, or
instructed, by a turgid amplification, it is the
Orator's business, true to his object, not to
criticise or seek to improve their taste, but to
accommodate himself to it. But it will be found
that this is not near so often the case as many

to the subject, but from it. In those spurious
kinds of Oratory, indeed, which have been
above mentioned, (p. iii. chap. ii. §. 4, 5, 6.) in
which the inculcation of the Subject-matter is
not the principal object proposed, a redundancy
of words may often be very suitable; but in all
that comes within the legitimate province of
Rhetoric, there is no fault to be more carefully
avoided.

By a multiplicity of words, the sentiment is not set
off and accommodated, but like David, in Saul's armour, it
is incumbered and oppressed.
"Yet this is not the only, or perhaps the worst, con-
sequence resulting from this manner of treating Sacred
writ:" [paraphrasing] we are told of the torpedo, that
it has the wonderful quality of numbing every thing it
touches; a paraphrase is a torpedo. By its influence the
most vivid sentiments become lifeless, the most sublime are
flattened, the most fervid chilled, the most vigorous ener-
vated. In the very best compositions of this kind that can
be expected, the Gospel may be compared to a rich wine of
a high flavour, diluted in such a quantity of water as
renders it extremely vapid." Campbell, Rhetoric, book iii.
chap. ii. sec. 2.
It should be observed, however, that to some palates or
stomachs a dilution may be necessary. Nor does Dr.
Campbell mean, I apprehend, that there are not many
passages in Scripture which require expansion with a view
to their being fully comprehended by an ordinary reader.
But a regular paraphrase generally expands every passage,
easy or hard, nearly to the same degree: it applies a

It will therefore be advisable for a tiro in
composition to look over what he has written,
and to strike out every word and clause which
he finds will leave the passage neither less
perspicuous nor less forcible than it was before;
"quamvis invita recedant;" remembering that,
as has been aptly observed, "nobody knows
what good things you leave out :" if the general
effect is improved, that advantage is enjoyed
by the reader, unalloyed by the regret which
the author may feel at the omission of any thing
which he may think in itself excellent. But
this is not enough; he must study contrac-
tion, as well as omission. There are many
sentences which would not bear the omission
of a single word consistently with perspicuity,
which yet may be much more concisely ex-
pressed, with equal clearness, by the employ-
ment of different words, and by recasting a
great part of the expression. Take for example
such a sentence as the following: "A severe
and tyrannical exercise of power must become
a matter of necessary policy with Kings, when
their subjects are imbued with such principles
as justify and authorize rebellion;" this sentence
could not be advantageously, nor to any con-

of

in a much shorter compass, with equal clearness

The hints I have thrown out on this point
coincide pretty nearly with Dr. Campbell's
remark on " Verbosity," as contra-distinguished
from "Tautology",
Tautology," and from "Pleonasm."
"The third and last fault I shall mention
against vivid Conciseness is Verbosity. This,
it may be thought, coincides with the Pleonasm
already discussed. One difference however is
y Burke.
z Tautology, which he describes as " either a repetition
of the same sense in different words, or a representation of
any thing as the cause, condition, or consequence, of
itself," is, in most instances, (of the latter kind at least,)
accounted an offence rather againt correctness than brevity;
the example he gives from Bolingbroke, "how many are
there by whom these tidings of good news were never
heard," would usually be reckoned a blunder rather than
an instance of prolixity; like the expression of " Sinecure
places which have no duty annexed to them."
"The
Pleonasm," he observes, "implies merely superfluity.
Though the words do not, as in the Tautology, repeat the
sense, they add nothing to it; e. g. They returned [back
again] to the [same] city [from] whence they came [forth.]"

this; in the Pleonasm there are words which
add nothing to the sense; in the Verbose
manner, not only single words, but whole
clauses, may have a meaning, and yet it were
better to omit them, because what they mean
is unimportant. Instead, therefore, of enliven-
ing the expression, they make it languish.
Another difference is, that in a proper Pleonasm,
a complete correction is always made by razing.
This will not always answer in the Verbose
style; it is often necessary to alter as well
as blota."

It is of course impossible to lay down precise
rules as to the degree of Conciseness which is,
on each occasion that may arise, allowable and
desirable; but to an author who is, in his
expression of any sentiment, wavering between
the demands of Perspicuity and of Energy, (of
which the former of course requires the first
care, lest he should fail of both,) and doubting
whether the phrase which has the most forcible
brevity, will be readily taken in, it may be
recommended to use both expressions ;-first
to expand the sense, sufficiently to be clearly
understood, and then to contract it into the

most compendious and striking form. This
expedient might seem at first sight the most
decidedly adverse to the brevity recommended
but it will be found in practice, that the addition
of a compressed and pithy expression of the
sentiment, which has been already stated at
greater length, will produce the effect of brevity.
For it is to be remembered that it is not on
account of the actual number of words that
diffuseness is to be condemned, (unless one
were limited to a certain space, or time,) but
to avoid the flatness and tediousness resulting
from it; so that if this appearance can be ob-
viated by the insertion of such an abridged
repetition as is here recommended, which adds
poignancy and spirit to the whole, Conciseness
will be, practically, promoted by the addition.
The hearers will be struck by the forcibleness
of the sentence which they will have been
prepared to comprehend; they will understand
the longer expression, and remember the shorter.
But the force will, in general, be totally de-
stroyed, or much enfeebled, if the order be
reversed; if the brief expression be put first,
and afterwards expanded and explained; for it
loses much of its force if it be not clearly under-
stood the moment it is uttered; and if it be,
there is no need of the subsequent expansion.
The sentence recently quoted from Burke, as

an instance of Energetic brevity, is in this
manner brought in at the close of a more ex-
panded exhibition of the sentiment, as a con-
densed conclusion of the whole. "Power, of
some kind or other, will survive the shock in
which manners and opinions perish; and it
will find other and worse means for its support.
The usurpation which, in order to subvert
ancient institutions, has destroyed ancient prin-
ciples, will hold power by arts similar to those
by which it has acquired it. When the old
feudal and chivalrous spirit of fealty, which,
by freeing kings from fear, freed both kings and
subjects from the precaution of tyranny, shall be
extinct in the minds of men, plots and assas-
sinations will be anticipated by preventive
murder and preventive confiscation, and that
long roll of grim and bloody maxims, which
form the political code of all Power, not stand-
ing on its own honour, and the honour of those
who are to obey it. Kings will be tyrants
from policy, when subjects are rebels from
principle." Burke, Reflections on the Revolu
tion in France, Works, vol. v. p. 153.
The same writer, in another passage of the
same work, has a paragraph in like manner
closed and summed up by a striking metaphor,

well as

readily taken in if placed at the beginning.
"To avoid therefore the evils of inconstancy
and versatility, ten thousand times worse than
those of obstinacy and the blindest prejudice,
we have consecrated the State, that no man
should approach to look into its defects or
corruptions but with due caution; that he
should never dream of beginning its reformation
by its subversion; that he should approach to
the faults of the State as to the wounds of a
father, with pious awe and trembling solicitude.
By this wise prejudice we are taught to look
with horror on those children of their country
who are prompt rashly to hack that aged parent
in pieces, and put him into the kettle of ma-
gicians, in hopes that by their poisonous weeds,
and wild incantations, they may regenerate the
paternal constitution, and renovate their father's
life." Burke, Reflections on the Revolution

So great, indeed, is the effect of a skilful in-
terspersion of short, pointed, forcible sentences,
that even a considerable violation of some of the
foregoing rules may be, by this means, in a
great degree, concealed; and vigour may thus
be communicated (if vigour of thought be not
wanting) to a Style chargeable even with Tau-
tology. This is the case with much of the
language of Dr. Johnson, who is certainly on
the whole an Energetic writer, though he would
have been much more so, had not an over-
attention to the roundness and majestic sound
of his sentences, and a delight in balancing one
clause against another, led him so frequently
into a faulty redundancy. Take, as an instance,
a passage in his life of Prior, which may be
considered as a favourable specimen of his
style:

trusted the protection of his name, and which
he expected succeeding ages to regard with

labouring in vain? He had infused into it much
knowledge, and much thought; had often po-
lished it to elegance, often dignified it with
splendour, and sometimes heightened it to sub-
limity; he perceived in it many excellences, and
did not discover that it wanted that without which
all others are of small avail, the power of engag-
ing attention and alluring curiosity. Tedious-
ness is the most fatal of all faults; negligences or
errors are single and local; but tediousness per-
vades the whole; other faults are censured and for-
gotten, but the power of tediousness propagates
itself. He that is weary the first hour, is more
weary the second; as bodies forced into motion
contrary to their tendency, pass more and
more slowly through every successive interval of
space. Unhappily this pernicious failure is
that which an author is least able to discover.
We are seldom tiresome to ourselves; and the
act of composition fills and delights the mind
with change of language and succession of
images; every couplet when produced is new ;
and novelty is the great source of pleasure.
Perhaps no man ever thought a line superfluous
when he first wrote it, or contracted his work
till his ebullitions of invention had subsided."

the same resemblance to their model, that the

indeed, this kind of Style appears far from easy

artificial appearance; but in reality, there is
none less difficult to acquire. To string to-

In aiming at a Concise Style, however, care
must of course be taken that it be not crowded;
the frequent recurrence of considerable ellipses,
even when obscurity does not result from them,
will produce an appearance of affected and labo-
rious compression, which is offensive. The au-
thor who is studious of Energetic brevity, should
aim at what may be called a Suggestive Style;
such, that is, as, without making a distinct,
though brief, mention of a multitude of particu-
lars, shall put the hearer's mind into the same
train of thought as the speaker's, and suggest to
him more than is actually expressed. Aristotle's

deepest discussions, but not, of going beyond
him, in the most simple; i. e. of filling up his
meaning, and inferring what he does not actually
express; so that in many passages a free trans-
lator might convey his sense in a shorter
compass, and yet in a less cramped and ellip-
tical diction. A particular statement, example,
or proverb, of which the general application is
obvious, will often save a long abstract rule,
which needs much explanation and limitation;
and will thus suggest much that is not actually
said; thus, answering the purpose of a mathe-
matical diagram, which though itself an indivi-
dual, serves as a representative of a class. Slight
hints also respecting the subordinate branches
of any subject, and notices of the principles
that will apply to them, &c. may often be
substituted for digressive discussions, which,
though laboriously compressed, would yet
occupy a much greater space. Judicious divi-
sions likewise and classifications, save much
tedious enumeration; and, as has been formerly
remarked, a well-chosen epithet may often sug-
gest, and therefore supply the place of, an

practice will enable a writer gradually to form
the habit recommended.
It may be worth
while, however, to add, that those accustomed
to rational conversation, will find in that, a very
useful exercise, with a view to this point, (as
well as to almost every other connected with
Rhetoric;) since, in conversation, a man na-
turally tries first one and then another mode of
expressing his thoughts, and stops as soon as he
perceives that his companion fully comprehends
his sentiments, and is sufficiently impressed with

I have dwelt the more earnestly on the head
of Conciseness, because it is a quality in which
young writers (who are the most likely to seek
for practical benefit in a Treatise of this kind)
are usually most deficient; and because it is
commonly said that, in them, exuberance is a
promising sign without sufficient care being
taken to qualify this remark, by adding, that
this over-luxuriance must be checked by judi-
cious pruning. If an early proneness to redun-
dancy be an indication of natural genius, those
who possess this genius should be the more
sedulously on their guard against that fault.
And those who do not, should be admonished

sion.
The praises which have been bestowed on Copiousness
dependent
Copiousness of diction, have probably tended on preci-
to mislead authors into a cumbrous verbosity.
It should be remembered, that there is no real
Copiousness in a multitude of synonymes and
circumlocutions. A house would not be the
better furnished for being stored with ten times
as many of some kinds of articles as were
needed, while it was perhaps destitute of those
required for other purposes; nor was Lucullus's
wardrobe, which, according to Horace, boasted
five thousand mantles, necessarily well stocked,
if other articles of dress were wanting. The
completeness of a library does not consist in
the number of volumes, especially if many of
them are duplicates; but in its containing
copies of all the most valuable works. And in
like manner, true Copiousness of language con-
sists in having at command, as far as possible,
a suitable expression for each different modifi-
cation of thought. This, consequently, will
often save much circumlocution; so that the
greater our command of language, the more
concisely we shall be enabled to write. In an
author who is attentive to these principles,
diffuseness may
be accounted no dangerous
fault of Style, because practice will gradually

correct it; but it is otherwise with one who
pleases himself in stringing together well-sound-
ing words into a easy, flowing, and (falsely-
called) copious style, destitute of nerve; and
who is satisfied with a small portion of matter;
seeking to increase, as it were, the appearance
of his wealth by hammering out his metal thin.
This is far from a curable fault. When the
style is fully formed in other respects, pregnant
fulness of meaning is seldom superadded; but
when there is a basis of energetic condensation
of thought, the faults of harshness, baldness,
or even obscurity, are much more likely to be
remedied. Solid gold may be new moulded
and polished; but what can give solidity to

Lastly, the Arrangement of words may be

ance of an attention to this point, with a view to
Perspicuity, has been already noticed: but of
two sentences equally perspicuous, and con-
sisting of the very same words, the one may
be a feeble and languid, the other a striking
and Energetic expression, merely from the dif-
ference of Arrangement.

a sentence, and to consider, each, the established
arrangement of his own language as the nearest
to such a natural order; regarding that which
prevails in Latin and in Greek as a sort of
deranged and irregular structure. We are apt
to consider that as most natural and intrinsically
proper, which is the most familiar to ourselves ;
but there seems no good ground for asserting,
that the customary structure of sentences in the
ancient languages is less natural, or less suitable
for the purposes for which language is em-
ployed, than in the modern. Supposing the
established order in English or in French, for
instance, to be more closely conformed to the
grammatical or logical analysis of a sentence,
than that of Latin or Greek, because we place
the Subject first, the Copula next, and the
Predicate last, &c. it does not follow that such
an arrangement is necessarily the best fitted, in
every case, to excite the attention,-to direct it
to the most essential points,—to gratify the
imagination, or to affect the feelings. It is,
surely, the natural object of language to express
as strongly as possible the speaker's sentiments,
and to convey the same to the hearers; and
that arrangement of words may fairly be ac-
counted the most natural, by which all men are
naturally led, as far as the rules of their re-
spective languages allow them, to accomplish

this object. The rules of many of the modern
languages do indeed frequently confine an
author to an order which he would otherwise
never have chosen; but what translator of any
taste would ever voluntarily alter the arrange-
ment of the words in such a sentence, as
Μεγάλη ἡ ῎Αρτεμις Ἐφεσίων, which our language
allows us to render exactly, "Great is Diana
of the Ephesians!" How feeble in comparison
is the translation of Le Clerc," La Diane des

imperfect that of Beausobre," La grande Diane
des Ephesiens!" How undignified that of Saci,

Our language indeed is, though to a less
degree, very much hampered by the same
restrictions; it being in general necessary, for
languages. the expression of the sense, to adhere to an
order which may not be in other respects the
most eligible: "Cicero praised Cæsar," and
"Cæsar praised Cicero," would be two very
different propositions; the situation of the words
being all that indicates, (from our want of
Cases,) which is to be taken as the nominative,
and which as the accusative; but such a restric-
tion is far from being an advantage. The
transposition of words which the ancient lan-
guages admit of, conduces, not merely to
variety, but to Energy, and even to Precision.

If, for instance, a Roman had been directing
the attention of his hearers to the circumstance
that even Cæsar had been the object of Cicero's
praise, he would, most likely, have put " Co-
sarem" first; but he would have put " Cicero"
first, if he had been remarking that not only
others, but even he, had praised Cæsar.
It is for want of this liberty of Arrangement
that we are often compelled to mark the em-
phatic words of our sentences by the voice, in
speaking, and by italics, in writing; which
would, in Greek or in Latin, be plainly in-
dicated, in most instances, by the collocation
alone. The sentence which has been often
brought forward as an example of the varieties
of expression which may be given to the same
words," Will you ride to London to-morrow?”
and which may be pronounced and understood
in at least five different ways, according as the
first, second, &c. of the words is printed in
italics, would be, by a Latin or Greek writer,
arranged in as many different orders, to answer
these several intentions. The advantage thus
gained must be evident to any one who con-
siders how important the object is which is
thus accomplished, and for the sake of which
we are often compelled to resort to such clumsy
expedients; it is like the proper distribution of
the lights in a picture; which is hardly of less

It must be the aim then of an author, who
would write with Energy, to avail himself of
all the liberty which our language does allow,
so to arrange his words that there shall be the
least possible occasion for underscoring and
italics; and this, of course, must be more
carefully attended to by the writer than by the
speaker, who may, by his mode of utterance,
conceal, in great measure, a defect in this point.
It may be worth observing, however, that some
writers, having been taught that it is a fault of
style to require many of the words to be in
italics, fancy they avoid the fault, by omitting
those indications where they are really needed;
which is no less absurd than to attempt remedy-
ing the intricacies of a road by removing the
direction-posts". The proper remedy is, to
The 4th book of Q. Curtius begins with a passage
which affords a good instance of the energetic effect pro-
duced by a skilful use of the licence of the Latin arrange-
ment: "Darius tanti modo exercitus rex, qui triumphantis
magis quam dimicantis more, curru sublimis inierat prœlium,
per loca quæ prope immensis agminibus compleverat, jam
inania, et ingenti solitudine vastu, fugiebat." The effect
of the concluding verb placed where it is, is most striking.

endeavour so to construct the Style, that the
collocation of the words may, as far as is pos-
sible, direct the attention to those which are
emphatic. And the general maxim that should
chiefly guide us, is, as Dr. Campbell observes,
the homely saying, "Nearest the heart, nearest
the mouth;" the idea, which is the most
forcibly impressed on the author's mind, will
naturally claim the first utterance, as nearly
as the rules of the language will permit. And
it will be found that, in a majority of instances,
the most Emphatic word will be the Predicate;
contrary to the rule, which the nature of our
language compels us, in most instances, to
observe, It will often happen, however, that
we do place the Predicate first, and obtain a
great increase of Energy by this Arrangement.
Of this licence our translators of the Bible
have, in many instances, very happily availed
themselves; as, e. g. in the sentence lately
cited," Great is Diana of the Ephesians;"
also, "Blessed is he that cometh in the name
of the Lord:" it is evident how much this
would be enfeebled by altering the Arrangement
into" He that cometh in the name of the Lord
is blessed." And, again, "Silver and Gold

Another passage, in which they might
advantageously have adhered to the order of the
original, is, “ Επεσεν, ἔπεσε Βαβυλῶν, ἡ μεγάλης,”
which would certainly have been rendered as
correctly, and more forcibly, as well as more
closely, “Fallen, fallen is Babylon, that great
city," than," Babylon is fallen, is fallen.”
The word "IT" is frequently very service-
able in ennabling us to alter the Arrangement:
thus, the sentence," Cicero praised Cæsar,"
which admits of at least two modifications of
sense, may be altered so as to express either
of them, by thus varying the order: “It was
Cicero that praised Cæsar," or, "It was Cæsar
that Cicero praised." "IT" is, in this mode
of using it, the representative of the Subject",
which it thus enables us to place, if we will,
after the Predicate.
Rev. xviii. 2.
Of whatever gender or number the subject referred to
may be, "IT" may, with equal propriety, be employed to
represent it. Our translators of the Bible have not scrupled
to make "IT" refer to a masculine noun : "It is 1, be not
afraid;" but they seem to have thought it not allowable, as
perhaps it was not, at the time when they wrote, to make
such a reference to a plural noun.

have employed the word. A technical term
may allowably be employed, in a scientific
work, in any sense not very remote from com-
mon usage, (especially when common usage is
uniform and invariable, in the meaning
affixed to it,) provided it be clearly defined,
and the definition strictly adhered to. By a
Period, then, is to be understood in this place,
any sentence, whether simple or complex, which
is so framed that the Grammatical construction
will not adinit of a close, before the end of it;
in which, in short, the meaning remains sus-
pended, as it were, till the whole is finished.
A loose sentence, on the contrary, is, any that Loose
is not a Period;-any, whose construction will
allow of a stop, so as to form a perfect sentence
at one or more places, before we arrive at the
end. E. g." We came to our journey's end-
at last-with no small difficulty-after much
fatigue-through deep roads-and bad weather."
This is an instance of a very loose sentence;
(for it is evident that this kind of structure
admits of degrees,) there being no less than

five places, marked by dashes, at any one of
which the sentence might have terminated, so
as to be grammatically perfect. The same
words may be formed into a Period, thus:
"At last, after much fatigue, through deep
roads, and bad weather, we came, with no small
difficulty, to our journey's end." Here, no
stop can be made at any part, so that the
preceding words shall form a sentence before
the final close. These are both of them simple
sentences; i. e. not consisting of several clauses,
but having only a single verb; so that it is
plain we ought not, according to this view, to
confine the name of Period to complex sen-
tences; as Dr. Campbell has done, notwith-
standing his having adopted the same definition
as has been here laid down.
Periods, or sentences nearly approaching to
Periods, have certainly, when other things are
equal, the advantage in point of Energy, An
unexpected continuation of a sentence which
the reader had supposed to be concluded, espe-
cially if in reading aloud, he had, under that
supposition, dropped his voice, is apt to produce
a sensation in the mind of being disagreeably
balked; analogous to the unpleasant jar which
is felt, when in ascending or descending stairs,

sentence, a kind of weary impatience results
from the uncertainty when the sentence is to
close. The objection however to loose sentences,
and consequent tendency towards the periodic
structure, must have been greater among the
Ancients than the Moderns; because the variety
of arrangement which the ancient languages
permitted, and, in particular, the liberty of
reserving the verb, on which the whole sense
depends, to the end, made that structure natural
and easy,
in many instances in which, in our
language, it would appear forced, unnatural, and
affected. But the agreeableness of a certain Tendency
degree, at least, of Periodic structure, in all periodic
languages, is apparent from this; that they all
contain words which may be said to have no
other use or signification but to suspend the
sense, and lead the hearer of the first part of
the sentence to expect the remainder. He who
says, "The world is not eternal, nor the work
of chance;" expresses the same sense as if he
said, "The world is neither eternal, nor the work
of chance;" yet the latter would be generally
preferred. So also, "The vines afforded both
a refreshing shade, and a delicious fruit ;" the
word "both" would be missed, though it adds
nothing to the sense. Again, "While all the
Pagan nations consider Religion as one part
of Virtue, the Jews, on the contrary, regard

Virtue as a part of Religion;" the omission
of the first word would not alter the sense, but
would destroy the Period; to produce which is
its only use. The MEN, AE, and TE of the
Greek are, in many places, subservient to this
use alone.
The modern languages do not indeed admit,
as was observed above, of so Periodic a Style
as the ancient do: but an author, who does
but clearly understand what a Period is, and
who applies the test I have laid down, will find
it very easy, after a little practice, to compose
in Periods, even to a greater degree than, in an
English writer, good taste will warrant. His
skill and care will be chiefly called for in avoid-
ing all appearance of stiffness and affectation
in the construction of them,-in not departing,
for the sake of a Period, too far from colloquial
usage, and in observing such moderation in
the employment of this Style, as shall prevent
any betrayal of artifice,—any thing savouring
of elaborate stateliness; which is always to be
regarded as a worse fault than the slovenliness
and languor which accompany a very loose
Style.

It should be observed, however, that, as a Loose and
periodic
sentence which is not strictly a Period, accord- clauses.
ing to the foregoing definition, may yet approach
indefinitely near to it, so as to produce nearly
the same effect, so on the other hand, Periods
may be so constructed as to produce much of
the same feeling of weariness and impatience
which results from an excess of loose sentences.
If the clauses be very long, and contain an
enumeration of many circumstances, though the
sentence be so framed, that we are still kept in
expectation of the conclusion, yet it will be an im-
patient expectation; and the reader will feel the
same kind of uneasy uncertainty when the clause
is to be finished, as would be felt respecting the
sentence, if it were loose. And this will espe-
cially be the case, if the rule formerly given
with a view to Perspicuity, be not observed of
taking care that each part of the sentence be
understood, as it proceeds. Each clause, if it
consist of several parts, should be continued
with the same attention to their mutual con-
nection, so as to suspend the sense, as is em-
ployed in the whole sentence; that it may be,
as it were, a Periodic clause. And if one

as
too long, i. e. will have a tedious, dragging
effect, merely from its concluding with a much
longer clause than it began with; so that a
composition which most would censure
abounding too much in long sentences, may
often have its defect, in great measure, remedied,
without shortening any of them; merely by
reversing the order of each. This of course
holds good with respect to all complex sentences
of any considerable length, whether Periods, or
not. An instance of the difference of effect
produced by this means, may be seen in such
a sentence as the following: "The State was
made, under the pretence of serving it, in reality,
the prize of their contention, to each of those
opposite parties, who professed in specious
terms, the one, a preference for moderate Aris-
tocracy; the other, a desire of admitting the
people at large to an equality of civil privileges."
This may be regarded as a complete Period; and
yet, for the reason just mentioned, has a tedious
and cumbrous effect. Many critics might
recommend, and perhaps with reason, to break
it into two or three; but it is to our present pur-
pose to remark that it might be, in some degree
at least, decidedly improved, by merely revers-

ing the clauses; as thus: "The two opposite
parties, who professed in specious terms, the
one, a preference for moderate Aristocracy, the
other, a desire of admitting the people at large
to an equality of civil privileges, made the State,
which they pretended to serve, in reality the
prize of their contention ¹.
Another instance may be cited from a work,
in which any occasional awkwardness of ex-
pression is the more conspicuous, on account
of its general excellence, the Church Liturgy;
the style of which is so justly admired for its
remarkable union of energy with simplicity,
smoothness, and elegance: the following pas-
sage from the Exhortation is one of the very
few, which, from the fault just noticed, it is
difficult for a good reader to deliver with spirit;
"And although we ought at all times humbly
to acknowledge our sins before God,|| yet
ought we most chiefly so to do, when we
assemble and meet together-to render thanks
for the great benefits, that we have received at
his hands,—to set forth his most worthy praise,
to hear his most holy word, and to ask those
things which are requisite and necessary, -as
well for the body as the soul." This is evi-
dently a very loose sentence, as it might be
'Thucydides, on the Corcyrean sedition.

supposed to conclude at any one of the three
places which are marked by dashes (—); this
disadvantage, however, may easily be obviated
by the suspension of voice, by which a good
reader, acquainted with the passage, would
indicate that the sentence was not concluded;
but the great fault is the length of the last
of the three principal clauses, in comparison of
the former two; (the conclusions of which are
marked ||) by which a dragging and heavy effect
is produced, and the sentence is made to appear
longer than it really is. This would be more
manifest to any one not familiar, as most are,
with the passage; but a good reader of the
Liturgy will find hardly any sentence in it so
difficult to deliver to his own satisfaction. It
is perhaps the more profitable to notice a ble-
mish occurring in a composition so well known,
and so deservedly valued for the excellence,
not only of its sentiments, but of its language.
It is a useful admonition to young writers,
with a view to what has lately been said, that
they should always attempt to recast a sentence
which does not please; altering the arrange-
ment and entire construction of it, instead of
merely seeking to change one word for another.
This will give a great advantage in point of
Copiousness also; for there may be, suppose, a
substantive, which, either because it does not

reason, we wish to remove, but can find no
other to supply its place; but the object may
perhaps be easily accomplished by means of a
verb, adverb, or some other part of speech,
the substitution of which implies an alteration
of the construction. It is an exercise accord-
ingly which may be recommended as highly
conducive to the improvement of Style, to

unstudied air is looked for in such as are spoken.
The study of the best Greek and Latin
writers may be of great advantage towards the
improvement of the Style in the point concerning

lately mentioned,) as well as in most others:

at first sight, might appear a disadvantage,) that

m
§. 14.
Antithesis has been sometimes reckoned as
one form of the Period; but it is evident that,
according to the view here taken, is has no
necessary
connection with it. One clause may
be opposed to another, by means of some
contrast between corresponding words in each,
whether or not the clauses be so connected that
the former could not, by itself, be a complete
sentence. Tacitus, who is one of the most
Antithetical, is at the same time one of the
least Periodic, of all the Latin writers.
There can be no doubt that this figure is
calculated to add greatly to Energy. Every
thing is rendered more striking by contrast;
and almost every kind of subject-matter affords
materials for contrasted expressions. Truth is
opposed to error; wise conduct to foolish;
different causes often produce opposite effects;
different circumstances dictate to prudence op-
posite conduct; opposite impressions may be

Bolingbroke may be noted as one of the most Periodic
of English writers; Swift and Addison (though in other
respects very different) are among the most loose.

made by the same object, on different minds;
and every extreme is opposed both to the Mean,
and to the other extreme. If, therefore, the
language be so constructed as to contrast to-
gether these opposites, they throw light on
each other by a kind of mutual reflexion, and
the view thus presented will be the more strik-
ing. By this means also we may obtain, con-
sistently with Perspicuity, a much greater degree
of Conciseness; which in itself is so conducive
to Energy; e. g. "When Reason is against a
man, he will be against Reason";" it would be
hardly possible to express this sentiment not
Antithetically, so as to be clearly intelligible,
except in a much longer sentence. Again,
"Words are the Counters of wise men, and
the Money of fools ";" here we have an in-
stance of the combined effect of Antithesis and
Metaphor in producing increased Energy, both
directly, and at the same time, (by the Con-
ciseness resulting from them,) indirectly; and
accordingly in such pointed and pithy expres-
sions, we obtain the gratification which, as
Aristotle remarks, results from "the act of
learning quickly and easily." The Antithetical
expression," Party is the madness of many,
for the gain of a few," affords an instance of

this construction in a sentence which does not
contain two distinct clauses. Frequently the
same words, placed in different relations with
each other, will stand in contrast to themselves;
as in the expression, "A fool with judges;
among fools, a judge';" and in that given by
Quinctilian," non ut edam vivo, sed ut vivam
edo;" "I do not live to eat, but eat to live;"
and again, in the beautiful lines, from the Arabic,
by Sir W. Jones:
On Parent knees, a naked new-born child
Weeping thou sat'st while all around thee smil'd;
So live, that sinking on thy last long sleep,
'Thou then may'st smile, while all around thee weep.
All of these are instances also of perfect Anti-
thesis, without Period; for each of these ⚫
sentences might, grammatically, be concluded
in the middle. So also," It is [indeed] a just
maxim that honesty is the best policy; but he
who is governed by that maxim is not an
honest man." This antithetical sentence is or is
not a Period, according as the word "indeed"
is inserted or omitted. Of the same kind is an
expression in a Speech of Mr. Wyndham's,
"Some contend that I disapprove of this plan,
because it is not my own; it would be more

The use of Antithesis has been censured by
some, as if it were a paltry and affected decora-
tion, unsuitable to a chaste, natural, and mascu-
line Style. Pope, accordingly, himself one of

artifice, effectually destroys Energy; and draws
off the attention, even of those who are pleased

Style. But, as Dr. Campbell observes," the
excess itself into which some writers have fallen,
is an evidence of its value-of the lustre and
emphasis which Antithesis is calculated to give
to the expression. There is no risk of in-
temperance in using a liquor which has neither
spirit nor flavour."
It is, of course, impossible to lay down
precise rules for determining, what will amount
to excess, in the use of this, or of any other
figure the great safeguard will be the forma-
P Great pointedness and force is added to the argument
from contraries (part i. chap. ii. §. 6.) by the antithetical
form of expression.

tion of a pure taste, by the study of the most
chaste writers, and unsparing self-correction.
But one rule always to be observed in respect
to the antithetical construction, is to remember
that in a true Antithesis the opposition is always
in the ideas expressed. Some writers abound
with a kind of mock-antithesis, in which the
same, or nearly the same sentiment which is
expressed by the first clause, is repeated in a
second; or at least, in which there is but little
of real contrast between the clauses which are
expressed in a contrasted form. This kind of
style not only produces disgust instead of
pleasure, when once the artifice is detected,
which it soon must be, but also, instead of the
brevity and vigour resulting from true Anti-
thesis, labours under the fault of prolixity and
heaviness. Sentences which might have been
expressed as simple ones, are expanded into
complex, by the addition of clauses, which add
little or nothing to the sense; and which have
been compared to the false handles and keyholes
with which furniture is decorated, that serve no
other purpose than to correspond to the real
ones. Much of Dr. Johnson's writing is
chargeable with this fault.

common-places, (i. e. heads of Arguments, pro

mirable specimens of compressed and striking
Antitheses; many of which are worthy of being
enrolled among the most approved proverbs;
e. g. "He who dreads new remedies, must

by the sacrifice of the Period, if the clauses are
by this means made of a more convenient length,
and a resting-place provided at the most suitable
point: e. g. "The persecutions undergone by
the Apostles, furnished both a trial to their
faith, and a confirmation to our's-a trial to
them, because if human honours and rewards
had attended them, they could not, even them-
selves, have been certain that these were not
their object; and a confirmation to us, because
they would not have encountered such suffer-
ings in the cause of imposture." If this sen-
tence were not broken as it is, but compacted
into a Period, it would have more heaviness of
effect, though it would be rather shorter: e. g.

tion of ours, because," &c. Universally, in-
deed, a complex sentence, whether Antithetical
or not, will often have a degree of spirit and
liveliness from the latter clause being made to
turn back, as it were, upon the former, by con-
taining, or referring to, some word that had
there been mentioned: e. g. "The introducers
of the now-established principles of political
economy may fairly be considered to have made
a great discovery; a discovery the more credit-
able, from the circumstance that the facts on
which it was founded had long been well known
to all." This kind of Style also may, as well
as the Antithetical, prove offensive if carried to
such an excess as to produce an appearance of
affectation or mannerism.

Lastly, to the Speaker especially, the occa-

will often prove serviceable with a view to
Energy. It calls the hearer's attention more
forcibly to some important point, by a personal
appeal to each individual, either to assent to
what is urged, or to frame a reasonable objec-
tion; and it often carries with it an air of tri-
umphant defiance of an opponent to refute the
argument if he can. Either the Premiss or the

Conclusion, or both, of any argument, may be
stated in this form; but it is evident that if it
be introduced too frequently, it will necessarily
fail of the object of directing a particular atten-
tion to the most important points. To attempt
to make every thing emphatic, is to make no-
thing emphatic. The utility, however, of this
figure, to the Orator at least, is sufficiently
established by the single consideration, that it
abounds in the Speeches of Demosthenes.

Of Elegance.
§. 1.
On the last quality of Style to be noticed,
Elegance or Beauty, it is the less necessary to
enlarge, both because the most appropriate and
characteristic excellence of the class of compo-
sitions here treated of, is, that Energy of which
I have been speaking, and also because many of
the rules laid down under that head, are equally
applicable with a view to Elegance; the same
Choice, Number, and Arrangement of words,
will, for the most part, conduce both to Energy
and to Beauty. The two qualities however are Elegance
by no means undistinguishable: a Metaphor, for not the
instance, may be apt, and striking, and conse- same.

quently conducive to Energy of expression,
even though the new image, introduced by it,
have no intrinsic beauty, or be even unpleasant;
in which case it would be at variance with
Elegance, or at least would not conduce to it.
Elegance requires that all homely and coarse
words and phrases should be avoided, even at
the expence of circumlocution; though they
may be the most apt and forcible that language
can supply. And Elegance implies a smooth
and easy flow of words in respect of the sound
of the sentences; though a more harsh and
abrupt mode of expression may often be, at
least, equally, energetic.
Accordingly, many are generally acknow-
ledged to be forcible writers, to whom no one
would give the credit of Elegance; and many
others, who are allowed to be elegant, are yet
by no means reckoned among the vigorous and
energetic.
§. 2.
When the two excellences of Style are at
variance, the general rule to be observed by the
Orator is to prefer the energetic to the elegant.
Sometimes, indeed, a plain, or even a some-
what homely expression, may have even a more
energetic effect, from that very circumstance,
than one of more studied refinement; since it

may convey the idea of the Speaker's being
thoroughly in earnest, and anxious to convey
his sentiments, where he uses an expression
that can have no other recommendation; where-
as a strikingly elegant expression may some-
times convey a suspicion that it was introduced
for the sake of its Elegance; which will greatly
diminish the force of what is said.
Universally, a writer or speaker should en-
deavour to maintain the appearance of expressing
himself, not, as if he wanted to say something,
but as if he had something to say: i. e. not as
if he had a subject set him, and was anxious to
compose the best essay or declamation on it
that he could; but as if he had some ideas to
which he was anxious to give utterance ;-not
as if he wanted to compose (for instance) a
sermon, and was desirous of performing that
task satisfactorily, but as if there was something
in his mind which he was desirous of com-
municating to his hearers. This is probably
It is an admonition which probably will give offence to
some, and excite the scorn of others, but which I cannot
but think may sometimes prove useful to a young preacher,
that he should ask himself, at the beginning, and in the
course, of his composition, "for what purpose am I going
to preach? Wherein would any one be a loser if I were to
keep silence? Is it likely that any one will learn something
he was ignorant of, or be reminded forcibly of something

what Dr. Butler means when he speaks of a
man's writing" with simplicity and in earnest."
His manner has this advantage, though it is
not only inelegant, but often obscure: Dr.
Paley's is equally earnest, and very perspicuous;
and though often homely, is more impressive
than that of many of our most polished writers.
It is easy to discern the prevalence of these
two different manners in different authors,
he had forgotten, or that something he was familiar with
shall be set before him in a new and striking point of view,
or that some difficulty will have been explained, or some
confused ideas rendered clear; or, in short, that I shall at all
have edified any one? Let it not be said, that I preached
because there was to be a Sermon, and concluded when I
had said enough to occupy the requisite time; careful
only to avoid any thing that could excite censure, and
content to leave the hearers just as I found them. Let me
not be satisfied with the thousandth iteration of common-
places, on the ground that it is all very true, and that it is
the fault of the congregation if they do not believe and
practise it; for all this is equally the case, whether I
preach or not; and if all I say is what they not only knew
before, but had heard in the same trite and general state-
ments an hundred times before, I might as well hold my
peace. Am I then about to preach merely because I want
to say something, or because I have something to say?"
It is true, a man cannot expect constant success in his
endeavours; but he is not very likely to succeed in any
thing that is not even the object of his endeavours. See

respectively, and to perceive the very different
effects produced by them; it is not so easy for
one who is not really writing "with simplicity
and in earnest," to assume the appearance of
it'. But certainly nothing is more adverse to
this appearance than over-refinement. Any
expression indeed that is vulgar, in bad taste,
and unsuitable to the dignity of the subject,
or of the occasion, is to be avoided; since,
though it might have, with some hearers, an
Energetic effect, this would be more than
counterbalanced by the disgust produced in
others; and where a small accession of Energy
is to be gained at the expense of a great
sacrifice of Elegance, the latter will demand a
preference. But still, the general rule is not
to be lost sight of by him who is in earnest
aiming at the true ultimate end of the Orator,
to which all others are to be made subservient;
viz. not the amusement of his hearers, nor their
admiration of himself, but their Conviction or
Persuasion. It is from this view of the subject
that I have dwelt most on that quality of Style
which seems most especially adapted to that
object. Perspicuity is required in all composi

tions; and may even be considered as the
ultimate end of a Scientific writer, considered
as such; he may indeed practically increase
his utility by writing so as to excite curiosity,
and recommend his subject to general attention;
but in doing so, he is, in some degree, super-
adding the office of the Orator to his own; as
a Philosopher, he may assume the existence in
his reader of a desire for knowledge, and has
only to convey that knowledge in language
that may be clearly understood. Of the Style
of the Orator, (in the wide sense in which I
have been using this appellation, as including
all who are aiming at Conviction,) the appro-
priate object is to impress the meaning strongly
upon men's minds. Of the Poet, as such,
the ultimate end is to give pleasure; and ac-
cordingly Elegance or Beauty (in the most ex-
tensive sense of those terms) will be the ap-
propriate qualities of his language.

Many, no doubt, may have proposed to them-

ture but if the views of the individual are to
be taken into account, it should be considered
that the personal fame or emolument of the
author is very frequently his ultimate object.
The true test is easily applied: that which to
competent judges affords the appropriate plea-

any other purpose or not; that which does not
afford this pleasure, however instructive it may
be, is not good Poetry, though it may be a

It may be doubted, however, how far these Poetry not
remarks apply to the question respecting Beauty such by the
of Style; since the chief gratification afforded
by Poetry arises, it may be said, from the
Beauty of the thoughts; and undoubtedly if
these be mean and common-place, the Poetry
will be worth little; but still, it is not any
quality of the thoughts that constitutes Poetry.

some French critics", to prove that a work, not
in metre, may be a Poem, (which doctrine was
partly derived from a misinterpretation of a
passage in Aristotle's Poetics*,) universal
opinion has always given a contrary decision.
Any composition in verse, (and none that is
not,) is always called, whether good or bad, a
Poem, by all who have no favourite hypothesis
to maintain. It is indeed a common figure of
speech to say, in speaking of any work that is
deficient in the qualities which Poetry ought
to exhibit, that it is not a Poem; just as we
say of one who wants the characteristic ex-
cellences of the species, or the sex, that he is
not a man: and thus some have been led to
confound together the appropriate excellence of
the thing in question, with its essence; but
the use of such an expression as, an "indif
ferent" or " a dull Poem," shews plainly that
the title of Poetry does not necessarily imply
the requisite Beauties of Poetry.
Poetry is not distinguished from Prose by

superior Beauty of thought or of expression, but
is a distinct kind of composition; and they
produce, when each is excellent in its kind,
distinct kinds of pleasure. Try the experiment,
of merely breaking up the metrical structure of
a fine Poem, and you will find it inflated and
bombastic Prose: remove this defect by alter-
ing the words and the Arrangement, and it will
be better Prose than before; then, arrange this
again into metre, without any other change,
and it will be tame and dull Poetry; but still
it will be Poetry, as is indicated by the very
censure it will incur; for if it were not, there
would be no fault to be found with it; since,
while it remained Prose, it was (as we have
supposed) unexceptionable. The circumstance
that the same Style which was even required in
one kind of composition, proved offensive in
the other, shews that a different kind of language
is suitable for a composition in metre.
z It is hardly necessary to remark, that I am not defend-
ing or seeking to introduce any unusual or new sense of the
word Poetry; but, on the contrary, explaining and vindi-
cating that which is the most customary among all men
who have no particular theory to support. The mass of
mankind often need, indeed, to have the meaning of a word
(i. e. their own meaning) explained and developed; but
not to have it determined what it shall mean, since that is
determined by their use; the true sense of each word
being, that which is understood by it.

Another indication of the essential difference
between the two kinds of composition, and of
the superior importance of the expression in
Poetry, is, that a good translation of a Poem,
(though, perhaps, strictly speaking, what is so
called is rather an imitation,) is read by one
well-acquainted with the original, with equal
or even superior pleasure to that which it affords
to one ignorant of that original; whereas the
best translation of a Prose-work, (at least of one
not principally valued for beauty of Style,) will
seldom be read by one familiar with the original.
And for the same reason, a fine passage of
Poetry will be reperused, with unabated plea-
sure, for the twentieth time, even by one who
knows it by heart".
According to the views here taken, good
Poetry might be defined," Elegant and deco-
rated language, in metre, expressing such and
such thoughts:" and good Prose composition,
"such and such thoughts expressed in good
language;" that which is primary in each, being
subordinate in the other.

* And accordingly it should be observed that, as all admit,
none but a poet can be qualified to translate a poem.
Hence it is that the want of complete Perspicuity
(such i. e. as puts the reader instantly in possession of the
whole sense) is a far less fault in Poetry than in Prose.
For Poetry, if it be worth reading at all, is worth reading
over and over.

attempt to discriminate between Dancing and
any other kind of movement, I should observe,
that though in performing any ordinary action,—
in walking, for example, across the room, a
person may manifest both grace and agility, yet
if he betrays the least intention of shewing
either, he is sure of offending more or less, and
we never fail to accuse him of some degree of
vanity and affectation. In the performance of
any such ordinary action, every one wishes to
appear to be solely occupied about the proper
purpose of the action; if he means to shew
either grace or agility, he is careful to conceal
that meaning; and in proportion as he betrays
it, which he almost always does, he offends.
In Dancing, on the contrary, every one pro-
fesses and avows, as it were, the intention of
displaying some degree either of grace or of
agility, or of both. The display of one or other,
or both of these qualities, is, in reality, the
proper purpose of the action; and there can
never be any disagreeable vanity or affectation

in following out the proper purpose of any
action. When we say of any particular person,
that he gives himself many affected airs and
graces in Dancing, we mean either that he
exhibits airs and graces unsuitable to the nature
of the Dance, or that he exaggerates those
which are suitable. Every Dance is, in reality,
a succession of airs and graces of some kind or
other, which, if I may say so, profess themselves
to be such.
The steps, gestures, and motions,
which, as it were, avow the intention of ex-
hibiting a succession of such airs and graces, are
the steps, gestures, and motions which are
peculiar to Dancing. ***** The dis-
tinction between the sounds or tones of Singing,
and those of Speaking, seems to be of the same
kind with that between the step, &c. of Dancing,
and those of any other ordinary action. Though
in Speaking a person may shew a very agreeable
tone of voice, yet if he seems to intend to
shew it, if he appears to listen to the sound of
his own voice, and as it were to tune it into
a pleasing modulation, he never fails to offend,
as guilty of a most disagreeable affectation.
In Speaking, as in every other ordinary action,
we expect and require that the speaker should
attend only to the proper purpose of the action,
-the clear and distinct expression of what he
has to say. In Singing, on the contrary, every
-

281
one professes the intention to please by the
tone and cadence of his voice; and he not only
appears to be guilty of no disagreeable affecta-
tion in doing so, but we expect and require
that he should do so. To please by the Choice
and Arrangement of agreeable sounds, is the
proper purpose of all music, vocal, as well as
instrumental; and we always expect that every
one should attend to the proper purpose of
whatever action he is performing. A person
may appear to sing, as well as to dance, affect-
edly; he may endeavour to please by sounds
and tones which are unsuitable to the nature of
the song, or he may dwell too much on those
which are suitable to it. The disagreeable af-
fectation appears to consist always, not in at-
tempting to please by a proper, but by some
improper modulation of the voice.”
It is only
necessary to add, (what seems evidently to have
been in the author's mind, though the Disserta-
tion is left unfinished,) that Poetry has the same
relation to Prose, as Dancing to Walking, and
Singing to Speaking; and that what has been
said of them, will apply exactly, mutatis mu-
tandis, to the other. It is needless to state this
at length, as any one, by going over the pas-
sages just cited, merely substituting for "Sing-
ing," "Poetry," for "Speaking," " Prose," for

"Voice," "Language," &c. will at once per-
ceive the coincidence".
What has been said will not be thought an
unnecessary digression, by any one who con-
siders (not to mention the direct application of
Dr. Smith's remarks, to Elocution) the im-
portant principle thus established in respect of
the decorations of Style: viz. that though it is
possible for a poetical Style to be affectedly
and offensively ornamented, yet the same degree
and kind of decoration which is not only al-
lowed, but required, in Verse, would in Prose
be disgusting; and that the appearance of at-
tention to the Beauty of the expression, and to
the Arrangement of the words, which in Verse
is essential, is to be carefully avoided in Prose.
And since, as Dr. Smith observes, "such a
prose not to design, when it exists, is almost always be-
trayed;" the safest rule is, never, during the
act of composition, to study Elegance, or think
about it at all. Let an author study the best
models-mark their beauties of Style, and dwell
upon them, that he may insensibly catch the
habit of expressing himself with Elegance; and

of ordinary Speaking, and Dancing, of ordinary action.

when he has completed any composition, he
may revise it, and cautiously alter any passage
that is awkward and harsh, as well as those
that are feeble and obscure: but let him never,
while writing, think of any beauties of Style;
but content himself with such as may occur
spontaneously. He should carefully study Per-
spicuity as he goes along; he may also, though
more cautiously, aim, in like manner, at Energy;
but if he is endeavouring after Elegance, he
will hardly fail to betray that endeavour; and
in proportion as he does this, he will be so far
from giving pleasure, to good judges, that he
will offend more than by the rudest simplicity.

General Considerations relative to Elocution.
§. 1.
ON the importance of this branch, it is hardly
necessary to offer any remark. Few need to
be told that the effect of the most perfect com-
position may be entirely destroyed, even by
Delivery which does not render it unintelli-
gible;—that one, which is inferior both in mat-
ter and style, may produce, if better spoken, a
more powerful effect than another which sur-
passes it in both those points; and that even
such an Elocution as does not spoil the effect
of what is said, may yet fall far short of doing
full justice to it. "What would you have
said," observed Eschines, when his recital of
his great rival's celebrated Speech on the Crown
was received with a burst of admiration,-
"what would you have said, had
you heard him
speak it?"

gage attention of the prevailing deficiency of
this, more than of any other qualification of a
perfect Orator, many have complained; and
several have laboured to remove it: but it may
safely be asserted, that their endeavours have
been, at the very best, entirely unsuccessful.
Probably not a single instance could be found
of any one who has attained, by the study of
any system of instruction that has appeared, a
really good Delivery; but there are many, pro-
bably nearly as many as have fully tried the
experiment, who have by this means been to-
tally spoiled;-who have fallen irrecoverably
into an affected style of spouting, worse, in all
respects, than their original mode of Delivery.
Many accordingly have, not unreasonably, con-
ceived a disgust for the subject altogether; con-
sidering it hopeless that Elocution should be
taught by any rules; and acquiescing in the
conclusion that it is to be regarded as entirely a
gift of nature, or an accidental acquirement of
practice. It is to counteract the prejudice
which may result from these feelings, that I
profess in the outset a dissent from the princi-
ples generally adopted, and lay claim to some
degree of originality in my own. Novelty af-
fords at least an opening for hope; and the only
opening, when former attempts have met with
total failure.

The requisites of Elocution correspond in Requisites

Enunciation, in opposition both to indistinct
utterance, and to vulgar and dialectic pronun-

Purity, Grammatical Propriety, and absence of
Obsolete or otherwise Unintelligible words.
These qualities of Style, and of Elocution, being
equally required in common conversation, do
not properly fall within the province of Rhe-
toric. The three qualities, again, which have

book before him ;—to exhibit to them, in short,
by the voice, not only each word, but also all
the stops, paragraphs, italick characters, notes
of interrogation, &c. which his sight presents
to him. His voice seems to indicate to them,
"thus and thus it is written in the book or
manuscript before me." Impressive reading
superadds to this, some degree of adaptation of
a It may be said, indeed, that even tolerable Reading
aloud, supplies more than is exhibited by a book to the eye;
since though italics, e. g. indicate which word is to receive
the emphasis, they do not point out the tone in which it is
to be pronounced; which may be essential to the right un-
derstanding of the sentence; e. g. in such a sentence as in
Genesis i. "God said, Let there be light, and there was
light:" here we can indicate indeed to the eye that the
stress is to be upon "was;" but it may be pronounced in
different tones; one of which would alter the sense, by im-
plying that there was light already. This is true indeed;
and it is also true, that the very words themselves are not
always presented to the eye with the same distinctions as
are to be conveyed to the ear; as, e. g. “abuse,” “refuse,”
"project," and many others, are pronounced differently, as
nouns and as verbs. This ambiguity however in our written
signs, as well as the other, relative to the emphatic words,
are imperfections which will not mislead a moderately
practised reader. My meaning, in saying that such Read-
ing as am speaking of puts the hearers in the same situ-
ation as if the book were before them, is to be understood
on the supposition of their being able not only to read, but
to read so as to take in the full sense of what is written.

the tones of voice to the character of the subject,
and of the style. What is usually termed fine
Reading seems to convey, in addition to these,
a kind of admonition to the hearers respecting
the feelings which the composition ought to
excite in them: it appears to say, "this deserves
your admiration;-this is sublime ;-this is
pathetic, &c." But Speaking, i. e. natural
speaking, when the Speaker is uttering his own
sentiments, and is thinking exclusively of them,
has something in it distinct from all this: it
conveys, by the sounds which reach the ear, the
idea, that what is said is the effusion of the
Speaker's own mind, which he is desirous of
imparting to others. A decisive proof of which
is, that if any one overhears the voice of another,
to whom he is an utter stranger-suppose in
the next room-without being able to catch the
sense of what is said, he will hardly ever be for
a moment at a loss to decide whether he is
Reading or Speaking; and this, though the
hearer may not be one who has ever paid any
critical attention to the various modulations of
the human voice. So wide is the difference of
the tones employed on these two occasions, be
the subject what it mayь.

The difference of effect produced is propor-
with Sym- tionably great the personal sympathy felt
towards one who appears to be delivering his
own sentiments is such, that it usually rivets the
attention, even involuntarily, though to a dis-
course which appears hardly worthy of it. It is
not easy for an auditor to fall asleep while he
is hearing even perhaps feeble reasoning, clothed
in indifferent language, delivered extemporane-
ously, and in an unaffected style; whereas it is
common for men to find a difficulty in keeping
themselves awake, while listening even to a
good dissertation, of the same length, or even
shorter, on a subject, not uninteresting to them,
when read, though with Propriety, and not in
a languid manner. And the thoughts, even of
own immediate sentiments?- I have often tried an ex-
periment to shew the great difference between these two
modes of utterance, the natural and the artificial; which
was, that when I found a person of vivacity delivering his
sentiments with energy, and of course with all that variety
of tones which nature furnishes, I have taken occasion to
put something into his hand to read, as relative to the
topic of conversation; and it was surprising to see what
an immediate change there was in his Delivery, from the
moment he began to read. A different pitch of voice took
place of his natural one, and a tedious uniformity of cadence
succeeded to a spirited variety; insomuch that a blind man
could hardly conceive the person who read to be the same
who had just been speaking." Sheridan, Art of Reading.

those not disposed to be drowsy, are apt to
wander, unless they use an effort from time to
time to prevent it; while, on the other hand,
it is notoriously difficult to withdraw our atten-
tion, even from a trifling talker, of whom we
are weary, and to occupy the mind with reflec-
tions of its own.
Of the two branches of Elocution which
have been just mentioned, it might at first sight
appear as if one only, that of the Speaker, came
under the province of Rhetoric. But it will be
evident, on consideration, that both must be, to
a certain extent, regarded as connected with our
present subject; not merely because many of
the same principles are applicable to both, but
because any one who delivers (as is so com-
monly the case) a written composition of his
own, may be reckoned as belonging to either
class; as a Reader who is the author of what
he reads, or as a Speaker who supplies the
deficiency of his memory by writing. And
again, in the (less common) case where a
Speaker is delivering without book, and from
memory alone, a written composition, either his
own or another's, though this cannot in strictness
be called Reading, yet the tone of it will be
very likely to resemble that of Reading. In
the other case, that where the author is actually
reading his own composition, he will be still

more likely, notwithstanding its being his own,
to approach, in the Delivery of it, to the Elocu-
tion of a Reader; and, on the other hand, it is
possible for him, even without actually deceiv-
ing the hearers into the belief that he is speaking
extempore, to approach indefinitely near to that
style.
The difficulty however of doing this to one
who has the writing actually before him, is
considerable; and it is of course far greater
when the composition is not his own. And as
it is evident from what has been said, that this,
as it may be called, Extemporaneous style of
Elocution, is much the more impressive, it
becomes an interesting inquiry, how the diffi-
culty in question may best be surmounted.

valuable remarks have been thrown out rela-
tive to such qualities in Elocution as might be
classed under the three heads I have laid down,

of Perspicuity, Energy, and Elegance: but
there is one principle running through all their
precepts, which being, according to my views,
radically erroneous, must (if those views be
correct) vitiate every system founded on it.
The principle I mean is, that in order to acquire
the best style of Delivery, it is requisite to
study analytically the emphases, tones, pauses,
degrees of loudness, &c. which give the proper
effect to each passage that is well delivered—
to frame rules founded on the observation of
these and then, in practice, deliberately and
carefully to conform the utterance to these rules,
so as to form a complete artificial system of
Elocution.
That such a plan not only directs us into a
circuitous and difficult path, towards an object
which may be reached by a shorter and
straighter, but also, in most instances, com-
pletely fails of that very object, and even pro-
duces, oftener than not, effects the very reverse
of what is designed, is a doctrine for which it
will be necessary to offer some reasons; espe-
cially as it is undeniable that the system here
reprobated, as employed in the case of Elocu-
tion, is precisely that recommended and taught
in this very Treatise, in respect of the conduct
of Arguments. By analyzing the best com-
positions, and observing what kinds of argu-

ments, and what modes of arranging them, in
each case, prove most successful, general rules
have been framed, which an author is recom-
mended studiously to observe in Composition:
and this is precisely the procedure which, in
Excellence Elocution, I deprecate. The reason for making
such a difference in these two cases is this:
in matter
and in
delivery
to be aimed whoever (as Dr. A. Smith remarks in the
at in op-
posite ways. passage lately cited) appears to be attending
to his own utterance, which will almost in-
evitably be the case with every one who is
doing so, is sure to give offence, and to be
censured for an affected delivery; because every
one is expected to attend exclusively to the
proper object of the action he is engaged in;
which, in this case, is the expression of the
thoughts-not the sound of the expressions.
Whoever therefore learns and endeavours to
apply in practice, any artificial rules of Elocu-
tion, so as deliberately to modulate his voice
conformably to the principles he has adopted,
(however just they may be in themselves,) will
hardly ever fail to betray his intention; which
always gives offence when perceived. Argu-
ments, on the contrary, must be deliberately
framed whether any one's course of reasoning
be sound and judicious, or not, it is necessary,

295
and it is expected, that it should be the result
of thought. No one, as Dr. Smith observes,
is charged with affectation for giving his atten-
tion to the proper object of the action he is
engaged in. As therefore the proper object of
the Orator is to adduce convincing Arguments,
and topics of Persuasion, there is nothing
offensive in his appearing deliberately to aim at
this object. He may indeed weaken the force
of what is urged by too great an appearance of
elaborate composition, or by exciting suspicion
of Rhetorical trick; but he is so far from being
expected to pay no attention to the sense of
what he says, that the most powerful argument
would lose much of its force, if it were supposed
to have been thrown out casually, and at
random. Here therefore the employment of
a regular system (if founded on just principles)
can produce no such ill effect as in the case of
Elocution since the habitual attention which
that implies to the choice and arrangement of
arguments, in such as must take place, at any
rate; whether it be conducted on any settled
principles or not. The only difference is, that
he who proceeds on a correct system, will
think and deliberate concerning the course of
his Reasoning to better purpose than he who
does not he will do well and easily, what the
other does ill, and with more labour. Both

alike must bestow their attention on the
Matter of what they say, if they would produce
any effect; both are not only allowed, but
expected to do so.
The two opposite modes of proceeding there-
fore which are recommended in respect of these
two points, (the Argument and the Delivery,)
are, in fact, both the result of the same circum-
stance; viz. that the Speaker is expected to
bestow his whole attention on the proper
business of his Speech, which is, not the Elocu-
tion, but the Matter d.

to Delivery, at the time, it must not be sup-

is recommended; or that the most perfect

at all on the subject; though it may safely be
affirmed that even this negative plan would
succeed far better than a studied modulation.
a Style occupies in some respects an intermediate place
between these two; in what degree each quality of it
should or should not be made an object of attention at the
time of composing, and how far the appearance of such at-
tention is tolerated, has been already treated of in the
preceding Part.

But it is evident that if any one wishes to
assume the Speaker as far as possible, i. e. to
deliver a written composition with some degree
of the manner and effect of one that is extempo-
raneous, he will have a considerable difficulty
to surmount : since though this may be called,
in a certain sense, the NATURAL MANNER,
it is far from being what he will naturally, i. e.
spontaneously, fall into. It is by no means
natural for any one to read as if he were not
reading, but speaking. And again, even when
any one is reading what he does not wish to
deliver as his own composition, as, for instance,
a portion of the Scriptures, or the Liturgy, it
is evident that this may be done better or worse,
in infinite degrees; and that though (according
to the views here taken) a studied attention to
the sounds uttered, at the time of uttering them,
leads to an affected and offensive delivery, yet,
on the other hand, an utterly careless reader
cannot be a good one.

which makes the meaning fully understood by
the hearers, the great point is that the Reader
(to confine our attention for the present to that
branch) should appear to understand what he
reads. If the composition be, in itself, in-
telligible to the persons addressed, he will make
them fully understand it, by so delivering it.
But to this end, it is not enough that he should
himself actually understand it; it is possible,
notwithstanding, to read it as if he did not.
And in like manner with a view to the quality,
which has been here called Energy, it is not
sufficient that he should himself feel, and be
impressed with the force of what he utters; he
may, notwithstanding, deliver it as if he were
unimpressed.
§. 2.
The remedy that has been commonly proposed
for these defects, is to point out in such a
work, for instance, as the Liturgy, which words
ought to be marked as emphatic,—in what
places the voice is to be suspended, raised,
lowered, &c. One of the best writers on the
subject, Sheridan, in his Lectures on the Art of
Reading, (whose remarks on many points

though he differs from me on the main ques-

lowed with a view to the proposed object,)

different pauses, emphases, &c. and applies

tions, to the greater part of the Liturgy, and to
an Essay subjoined f; recommending that the
habit should be formed of regulating the voice
by his marks; and that afterwards readers
should" write out such parts as they want to
deliver properly, without any of the usual stops;
and, after having considered them well, mark
the pauses and emphases by the new signs
which have been annexed to them, according
to the best of their judgment," &c.
To the adoption of any such artificial scheme
there are three weighty objections; first, that the
proposed system must necessarily be imperfect;
secondly, that if it were perfect, it would be a
circuitous path to the object in view; and
thirdly, that even if both those objections were
removed, the object would not be effectually
obtained.

writing, no variety of marks that could be in-
vented, not even musical notation,—would
suffice to indicate the different tones in which
the different emphatic words should be pro-
nounced; though on this depends frequently
the whole force, and even sense of the ex-
pression. Take as an instance, the words of
Macbeth in the witches' cave, when he is ad-
dressed by one of the Spirits which they raise,
"Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!" on which
he exclaims," Had I three ears I'd hear thee;"
no one would dispute that the stress is to be
laid on the word "three;" and thus much
might be indicated to the reader's eye; but if
he had nothing else to trust to, he might chance
to deliver the passage in such a manner as to
be utterly absurd; for it is possible to pro-
nounce the emphatic word " three," in such
a tone as to indicate that "since he has but
two ears he cannot hear." Again, the following
passage, (Mark iv. 21.)" Is a candle brought to
be put under a bushel, or under a bed," I
have heard so pronounced as to imply that
there is no other alternative: and yet the
emphasis was laid on the right words. It
would be nearly as hopeless a task to attempt
adequately to convey, by any written marks,

precise directions as to the rate,—the degree of
rapidity or slowness,—with which each sentence
and clause should be delivered. Longer and
shorter pauses may indeed be easily denoted; and
marks may be used, similar to those in music,
to indicate, generally, quick, slow, or moderate
time; but it is evident that the variations which
actually take place are infinite-far beyond
what any marks could suggest; and that much
of the force of what is said depends on the
degree of rapidity with which it is uttered;
chiefly on the relative rapidity of one part in
comparison of another: for instance, in such a
sentence as the following, in one of the Psalms,
which one may usually hear read at one uniform
rate; "all men that see it shall say, this hath
God done; for they shall perceive that it is his
work;" the four words" this hath God done,”
though monosyllables, ought to occupy very
little less time in utterance than all the rest of
the verse together.

and sentence should be pronounced according
to the several occasions, the learner might ask,
"but why should this tone suit the awful,---

this, the pathetic,-this, the narrative style? why
is this mode of delivery adopted for a com-
mand,—this for an exhortation,-this, for a sup-
plication?" &c. The only answer that could
be given, is, that these tones, emphases, &c.
are a part of the language;-that nature, or
custom, which is a second nature, suggests
spontaneously, these different modes of giving
expression to the different thoughts, feelings,
and designs, which are present to the mind of
any one who, without study, is speaking in
earnest his own sentiments. Then, if this be
the case, why not leave nature to do her own
work? Impress but the mind fully with the
sentiments, &c. to be uttered; withdraw the
attention from the sound, and fix it on the
sense; and nature, or habit, will spontaneously
suggest the proper Delivery. That this will be
the case is not only true, but is the very
supposition on which the artificial system pro-
ceeds; for it professes to teach the mode of
Delivery naturally adapted to each occasion.
It is surely, therefore, a circuitous path that is
proposed, when the learner is directed, first to
consider how each passage ought to be read;
i. e. what mode of delivering each part of it
would spontaneously occur to him, if he were
attending exclusively to the matter of it; then
to observe all the modulations, &c. of voice,

which take place in such a Delivery; then, to
note these down, by established marks, in
writing; and, lastly, to pronounce according
to these marks. This seems like recom-
mending, for the purpose of raising the hand to
the mouth, that he should first observe, when
performing that action without thought of any
thing else, what muscles are contracted,-in
what degrees, and in what order; then, that
he should note down these observations; and
lastly, that he should, in conformity with these
notes, contract each muscle in due degree, and
in proper order; to the end that he may be
enabled, after all, to-lift his hand to his mouth;
which, by supposition, he had already done.
Such instruction is like that bestowed by Mo-
liere's pedantic tutor upon his Bourgeois Gen-
tilhomme, who was taught, to his infinite surprise
and delight, what configurations of the mouth

and speak, as it were, by note, with the same
fluency and accuracy as are attainable in the
case of singing, still the desired object of a
perfectly natural as well as correct Elocution,
would never be in this way attained. The
reader's attention being fixed on his own
voice, (which in singing, and there only, is
allowed and expected,) the inevitable conse-
quence would be that he would betray more or
less his studied and artificial Delivery; and
would, in the same degree, manifest an offensive

the Liturgy especially, so many gross faults are become
quite familiar to many, from what they are accustomed to

liarly difficult to unlearn, or even detect them; and as an
aid towards the exposure of such faults, there may be great
advantage in studying Sheridan's observations and direc-
tions respecting the delivery of it; provided care be taken,
in practice, to keep clear of his faulty principle, by
withdrawing the attention from the sound of the voice,
as carefully as he recommends it to be directed to that
point.

Many persons are so far impressed with the truth of
the doctrine here inculcated, as to acknowledge that" it is a
great fault for a reader to be too much occupied with thoughts
respecting his own voice;" and thus they think to steer
a middle course between opposite extremes: but it should
be remembered that this middle course entirely nullifies
the whole advantage proposed by the plan recommended.
A reader is sure to pay too much attention to his voice, not
only if he pays any at all, but if he does not strenuously
labour to withdraw his attention from it altogether.
Who for instance, that was really thinking of a resur-
rection from the dead, would ever tell any one that our
Lord "rose again from the dead," (which is so common a
mode of reading the Creed,) as if He had done so more
than once? It is to be observed, however, that it is not
enough for a reader to have his mind fixed on the subject;
without regard to the occasion, &c. It is possible to read
a prayer well, with the tone and manner of a man who is
not praying, i. e. addressing the Deity, but addressing the
audience, and reciting a form of words for their instruction:
and such is generally the case with those who are com-
mended as "fine readers" of the Liturgy. Extemporaneous
prayers are generally delivered, with spirit indeed, but (after

to the impressiveness of the Delivery, he who
not only feels it, but is exclusively absorbed
with that feeling, will be likely to read as if he
felt it, and to communicate the impression to
his hearers. But this cannot be the case if he
is occupied with the thought of what their opi-
nion will be of his reading, and, how his voice
ought to be regulated;-if, in short, he is
thinking of himself, and, of course, in the same
degree, abstracting his attention from that which
ought to occupy it exclusively.
It is not, indeed, desirable, that in reading
the Bible, for example, or any thing which is
not intended to appear as his own composition,
he should deliver what are, avowedly, another's
sentiments, in the same style, as if they were
such as arose in his own mind; but it is
desirable that he should deliver them as if he
were reporting another's sentiments, which
were both fully understood, and felt in all their
force by the reporter; and the only way to do

at all; and if, with this impression, they attempt
to try the experiment of a natural Delivery,
their ill-success will probably lead them to cen-
sure the proposed method, for the failure result-
ing from their own mistake. In truth, it is by
no means a very easy task, to fix the attention
on the meaning, in the manner and to the
degree, now proposed. The thoughts of one
who is reading any thing very familiar to him,
are apt to wander to other subjects, though
perhaps such as are connected with that which
is before him; if, again, it be something new
to him, he is apt, (not indeed to wander to
another subject,) but to get the start, as it were,
of his readers, and to be thinking, while uttering
each sentence, not, of that, but of the sentence
which comes next. And in both cases, if he
is careful to avoid those faults, and is desirous
of reading well, it is a matter of no small diffi-
culty, and calls for a constant effort, to prevent
the mind from wandering in another direction
viz. into thoughts respecting his own voice,—
respecting the effect produced by each sound,-
the approbation he hopes for from the hearers,
&c. And this is the prevailing fault of those

who are commonly said to take great pains
in their reading; pains which will always be
taken in vain, with a view to the true object to
be aimed at, as long as the effort is thus
applied in a wrong direction. With a view,
indeed, to a very different object, the approba-
tion bestowed on the reading, this artificial
delivery will often be more successful than the
natural. Pompous spouting, and many other
descriptions of unnatural tone and measured
cadence, are frequently admired by many as
excellent reading; which admiration is itself a
proof that it is not deserved; for when the
Delivery is really good, the hearers (except
any one who may deliberately set himself to
observe and criticise) never think about it, but
are exclusively occupied with the sense it con-
veys, and the feelings it excites.

CHAP. III.
Considerations arising from the differences between
Reading and Speaking.
§. 1.
Some additional objections to the method I
have recommended, and some further remarks
on the counterbalancing advantages of it, will
be introduced presently, when I shall have first
offered some observations on Speaking, and
on that branch of Reading which the most
nearly approaches to it.
When any one delivers a written composi-
tion, of which he is, or is supposed to profess
himself, the author, he has peculiar difficulties
to encounter", if his object be to approach as
m It must be admitted, however, that (to the members of
our Church) the difficulty of reading the Liturgy with spirit,
and even with propriety, is something peculiar, on account
of (what has been already remarked) the inveterate and
long-established faults to which almost every one's ears are
become familiar; so that such a delivery as would shock
any one of even moderate taste, in any other composition,
he will, in this, be likely to tolerate, and to practise.
Some, e. g. in the Liturgy, read, "have mercy upon us,

nearly as possible to the extemporaneous style.
It is indeed impossible to produce the full
effect of that style, while the audience are aware
that the words he utters are before him but
he may approach indefinitely near to such an
effect; and in proportion as he succeeds in this
miserable sinners;" and others, "have mercy upon us,
miserable sinners;" both, laying the stress on a wrong
word, and making the pause in the wrong place, so as to
disconnect "us" and "miserable sinners," which the con-
text requires us to combine. Every one, in expressing his
own natural sentiments, would say "have mercy, upon us-
miserable-sinners."
Many are apt even to commit so gross an error, as to
lay the chief stress on the words which denote the most
important things; without any consideration of the em-
phatic word of each sentence: e. g. in the Absolution
many read, "let us beseech Him to grant us rue repent-
ance;" because forsooth "true repentance" an important
thing; not considering that, as it has been just mentioned,
it is not the new idea, to which the attention should be
directed by the emphasis; the sense being, that since God
pardoneth all that have true repentance, therefore, we
should "beseech Him to grant it to us."
In addition to the other difficulties of reading the Li-
turgy well, it should be mentioned, that prayer, thanks-
giving, and the like, even when avowedly not of our own
composition, should be delivered as (what in truth they
ought to be) the genuine sentiments of our own minds at
the moment of utterance; which is not the case with the
Scriptures, or with any thing else that is read, not profess-
ing to be the speaker's own composition.

object, the impression produced will be the
Compara- greater. It has been already remarked, how
easy it is for the hearers to keep up their atten-
tion,-indeed, how difficult for them to with-
draw it, when they are addressed by one who
is really speaking to them in a natural and
earnest manner; though perhaps the discourse
may be incumbered with a good deal of the
repetition, awkwardness of expression, and other
faults incident to extemporaneous language;
and though it be prolonged for an hour or two,
and yet contain no more matter than a good
writer could have clearly expressed in a dis-
course of half an hour; which last, if read to
them, would not, without some effort on their
part, have so fully detained their attention.
The advantage in point of Style, Arrangement,
&c. of written, over extemporaneous, discourses,
(such at least as any but the most accomplished
orators can produce,) is sufficiently evident":
n Practice in public speaking, generally,-practice in
speaking on the particular subject in hand,—and (on each
occasion) premeditation of the matter and arrangement,
are all, circumstances of great consequence to a speaker.
Nothing but a miraculous gift can supersede these advan-
tages. The Apostles accordingly were forbidden to use
any premeditation, being assured that "it should be given
them, in that same hour, what they should say:" and
when they found, in effect, this promise fulfilled to them,

and it is evident also that other advantages,
such as have been just alluded to, belong to
the latter. Which is to be preferred on each
occasion, and by each orator, it does not be-
long to the present discussion to enquire: but
it is evidently of the highest importance to
combine, as far as possible, in each case, the
advantages of both.
A perfect familiarity with the rules laid down
in the first part of this Treatise, would be likely,
it is hoped, to give the extemporaneous orator
that habit of quickly methodizing his thoughts
on a given subject, which is essential (at least
where no very long premeditation is allowed) to
give to a speech something of the weight of
argument, and clearness of arrangement, which
characterize good Writing. In order to attain
they had experience, within themselves, of a sensible mi-
racle. This circumstance may furnish a person of sincerity
with a useful test for distinguishing (in his own case) the
emotions of a fervid imagination, from actual inspiration.
It is evident that an inspired preacher can have nothing to
gain from practice, or study of any kind: he therefore who
finds himself improve by practice, either in Argument,
Style, or Delivery, or who observes that he speaks more
fluently and better on subjects on which he has been ac-
customed to speak, or better, with premeditation, than on a
sudden, may indeed deceive his hearers by a pretence to
inspiration, but can hardly deceive himself.
• Accordingly, it may be remarked, that, (contrary to

the corresponding advantage,-to impart to the
delivery of a written discourse, something of the
vivacity and interesting effect of real, earnest,
speaking, the plan to be pursued, conformably
with the principles I have been maintaining, is,
for the reader to draw off his mind as much as
possible from the thought that he is reading, as
well as from all thought respecting his own
utterance ;-to fix his mind as earnestly as pos-
sible on the matter, and to strive to adopt as
his own, and as his own at the moment of utter-
ance, every sentiment he delivers ;—and to say
it to the audience, in the manner which the
occasion and subject spontaneously suggest to
him who has abstracted his mind both from all
consideration of himself, and from the consi-
deration that he is reading.

what might at first sight be supposed,) though the preced-
ing parts, as well as the present, are intended for general
application, yet it is to the extemporary speaker that the
rules laid down in the former part (supposing them correct)
will be the most peculiarly useful; while the suggestions
offered in this last, respecting Elocution, are more espe-
cially designed for the use of the reader.

mind exclusively intent on what he has to say,)
may be estimated from this consideration; that
there are few who do not speak so as to give
effect to what they are saying: some, indeed,
do this much better than others:-some have,
in ordinary conversation, an indistinct or incor-
rect pronunciation, an embarrassed and hesi-
tating utterance, or a bad choice of words: but
hardly any one fails to deliver? (when speaking
earnestly) what he does say, so as to convey
the sense and the force of it, much more com-
pletely than even a good reader would, if those
same words were written down and read. The
latter might, indeed, be more approved; but
that is not the present question; which is, con-
cerning the impression made on the hearers'
minds. It is not the polish of the blade, that
is to be considered, nor the grace with which it
is brandished, but the keenness of the edge, and
the weight of the stroke.
P There is, indeed, a wide difference between different
men, in respect of the degrees of impressiveness with which,
in earnest conversation, they deliver their sentiments; but
it may safely be laid down, that he who delivers a written
composition with the same degree of spirit and energy with
which he would naturally speak on the same subject, has
attained, not indeed, necessarily, absolute perfection, but
the utmost excellence attainable by him. Any attempt to
out-do his own Natural manner, will inevitably lead to
something worse than failure.

On the contrary, it can hardly be denied that
the elocution of most readers, when delivering
their own compositions, is such as to convey
the notion, at the very best, not that the
preacher is expressing his own real sentiments,
but that he is making known to his audience
what is written in the book before him: and,
whether the composition is professedly the
reader's own, or not, the usual mode of delivery,
though grave and decent, is so remote from the
energetic style of real Natural Speech, as to
furnish, if one may so speak, a kind of running
comment on all that is uttered, which says, "I
do not mean, think, or feel, all this; I only
mean to recite it with propriety and decorum:"
and what is usually called fine Reading, only
superadds to this, (as has been above remarked,)
a kind of admonition to the hearers, that they
ought to believe, to feel, and to admire, what is
read.
§. 3.

It is easy to anticipate an objection which
to be con- many will urge against, what they will call, a
colloquial style of delivery; viz. that it is
indecorous, and unsuitable to the solemnity of
a serious, and especially, of a religious discourse.
The objection is founded on a mistake. Those
who urge it, derive all their notions of a Natural

Delivery from two, irrelevant, instances; that
of ordinary conversation, the usual subjects of
which, and consequently its usual tone, are
comparatively light;—and, that of the coarse and
extravagant rant of vulgar fanatical preachers.
But to conclude that the objections against
either of these styles, would apply to the
Natural Delivery of a man of sense and taste,
speaking earnestly, on a serious subject, and
on a solemn occasion, or that he would naturally
adopt, and is here advised to adopt, such a
style as those objected to, is no less absurd than
if any one, being recommended to walk in a
natural and unstudied manner, rather than in
a dancing step, (to employ Dr. A. Smith's
illustration,) or a formal march, should infer
that the natural gait of a clown following the
plough, or of a child in its gambols, were pro-
posed as models to be imitated in walking
across a room. Should any one, on being told
that both tragic-acting and comic-acting ought
to be a natural representation of man, interpret
this to mean that Tragedy ought to be per-
formed exactly like Comedy, he would be
thought very absurd, if he were supposed to be
speaking seriously. It is evident, that what is
natural in one case, or for one person, may be,
in a different one, very unnatural. It would not
be by any means natural, to an educated and

sober-minded man, to speak like an illiterate
enthusiast; nor to discourse on the most im-
portant matters in the tone of familiar conversa-
tion respecting the trifling occurrences of the day.
Any one who does but notice the style in
which a man of ability, and of good choice of
words, and utterance, delivers his sentiments in
private, when he is, for instance, earnestly and
seriously admonishing a friend,-defending the
doctrines of religion,-or speaking on any other
grave subject on which he is intent, may easily
observe how different his tone is from that of
light and familiar conversation,-how far from
deficient in the decent seriousness which befits
the case: even a stranger to the language
might guess that he was not engaged in any
frivolous topic: and when an opportunity oc-
curs of observing how he delivers a written
discourse, of his own composition, on perhaps
the very same, or a similar subject, one may
generally perceive how comparatively stiff, lan-
guid, and unimpressive is the effect.

would employ in conversing across a table, with
equal seriousness, on the same subject: this is
undoubtedly true: and it is evident that it has
been implied in what has here been said; the

Natural-manner having been described as ac-
commodated, not only to the subject, but to
the place, occasion, and all other circumstances;
so that he who should preach exactly as if he
were speaking in private, though with the
utmost earnestness, on the same subject, would
so far be departing from the genuine Natural-
manner; but it may be safely asserted, that
even this would be far the less fault of the two.
He who appears unmindful, indeed, of the place
and occasion, but deeply impressed with the
subject, and utterly forgetful of himself, would
produce a much stronger effect than one, who,
going into the opposite extreme, is, indeed,
mindful of the place and the occasion, but not
fully occupied with the subject, (though he may
strive to appear so ;) being partly engaged in.
thoughts respecting his own voice. The latter.
would, indeed, be less likely to incur censure;
but the other would produce the deeper im-
pression.
The object, however, to be aimed at, (and it
is not unattainable,) is to avoid both faults ;-
to keep the mind impressed both with the
matter spoken, and with all the circumstances
also of each case, so that the voice may spon-
taneously accommodate itself to all; carefully
avoiding all studied modulations, and, in short

all thoughts of self, which, in proportion as
they intrude, will not fail to diminish the effect.
§. 4.
A familiar
delivery
It must be admitted, indeed, that the different
one species kinds of Natural delivery of any one individual
of natu-
ral.
on different subjects and occasions, various as
they are, do yet bear a much greater resem-
blance to each other, than any of them does to
the Artificial-style usually employed in reading;
a proof of which is, that a person familiarly ac-
quainted with the Speaker, will seldom fail to
recognise his voice, amidst all the variations of
it, when he is speaking naturally and earnestly;
though it will often happen that, if he have
never before heard him read, he will be at a
loss, when he happens accidentally to hear
without seeing him, to know who it is that is
reading; so widely does the artificial cadence and
intonation differ in many instances from the
natural. And a consequence of this is, that
the Natural-manner, however perfect, however
exactly accommodated to the subject, place,
and occasion, will, even when these are the
most solemn, in some degree remind the hearers
of the tone of conversation; amidst all the
differences that will exist, this one point of
resemblance, that of the delivery being unforced

321
and unstudied, will be likely, in some degree,
to strike them. Those who are good judges
will perceive at once, and the rest, after being
a little accustomed to the Natural-manner, that
there is not necessarily any thing irreverent or
indecorous in it; but that, on the contrary, it
conveys the idea of the speaker's being deeply
impressed with that which is his proper busi-
ness. But, for a time, many will be disposed
to find fault with such a kind of elocution;
and, in particular, to complain of its indicating
a want of respect for the audience.
Yet even
while this disadvantage continues, a preacher of
this kind may be assured that the doctrine he
delivers is much more forcibly impressed, even
on those who censure his style of delivering it,
than it could be in the other way.
A discourse delivered in this style has been
known to elicit the remark, from one of the
lower orders, who had never been accustomed
to any thing of the kind, that "it was an excel-
lent sermon, and it was great pity it had not
been preached:" a censure which ought to
have been very satisfactory to the preacher :
had he employed a pompous spout, or modu-
lated whine, it is probable such an auditor
would have admired his preaching, but would
have known and thought little or nothing about
the matter of what was taught.

Which of the two objects ought to be pre-
ferred by a Christian Minister, on Christian
principles, is a question, not hard to decide,
but foreign to the present discussion: it is im-
portant, however, to remark, that an Orator is
bound, as such, not merely on moral, but, if
such an expression may be used, on rhetorical
principles, to be mainly, and indeed exclusively,
intent on carrying his point; not, on gaining
approbation, or even avoiding censure, except
with a view to that point. He should, as it
were, adopt as a motto, the reply of Themisto-
cles to the Spartan commander, Eurybiades,
who lifted his staff to chastise the earnestness
with which his own opinion was controverted;
Strike, but hear me."
I would not, indeed undertake to maintain
(like Quinctilian) that no one can be an Orator
who is not a virtuous man; but there certainly
is a kind of moral excellence implied in that
renunciation of all effort after display,-in that
forgetfulness of self,-which is absolutely neces-
sary, both in the manner of writing and in the
delivery, to give the full force to what is said.

also ought to be mentioned, among what many,

more perfect it is, the more will it withdraw,
from itself, to the arguments and sentiments
delivered, the attention of all but those who are
studiously directing their view to the mode of
utterance, with a design to criticise or to learn.

fine elocution, is to be obtained at the expense
of a very moderate share of pains; though at

and, as it is frequently called, nervous sensa-
tion, to which he had before been compara-
tively a stranger. He will find himself in a
new situation,-standing before his audience in

•
a different character-stripped, as it were, of
the sheltering veil of a conventional and Arti-
ficial Delivery;-in short, delivering to them
his thoughts, as one man speaking to other
men; not, as before, merely reading in public.
And he will feel that he attracts a much greater
share of their attention, not only by the novelty
of a manner to which most congregations are
little accustomed, but also, (even supposing
them to have been accustomed to extemporary
discourses,) from their perceiving themselves to
be personally addressed, and feeling that he is
not merely reciting something before them, but
saying it to them. The speaker and the hearers
will thus be brought into a new and closer
relation to each other: and the increased in-
terest thus excited in the audience, will cause
the Speaker to feel himself in a different situa-
tion,-in one which is a greater trial of his con-
fidence, and which renders it more difficult
than before to withdraw his attention from him-
self. It is hardly necessary to observe that this
very change of feelings experienced by the
speaker, ought to convince him the more, if the
causes of it (to which I have just alluded) be
attentively considered, how much greater im-
pression this manner is likely to produce. As
he will be likely to feel much of the bashfulness
which a really extemporary speaker has to

struggle against, so he may produce much of a
similar effect.
After all, however, the effect will never be
completely the same. A composition delivered
from writing, and one actually extemporaneous,
will always produce feelings, both in the hearer
and the speaker, considerably different; even
on the supposition of their being word for word
the same, and delivered so exactly in the same
tone, that by the ear alone no difference could
be detected: still the audience will be differ-
ently affected, according to their knowledge
that the words uttered, are, or are not, written
down and before the speaker's eyes: and the
consciousness of this will produce a correspond-
ing effect on the mind of the speaker. For
were this not so, any one who, on any subject,
can speak (as many can) fluently and correctly
in private conversation, would find no greater
difficulty in saying the same things before a
large congregation, than in reading to them a
written discourse.

guage, and in such a manner, as would be per-
fectly suitable to a certain audience, yet finds
it extremely difficult to address to that audience
the very same words, in the same manner; and
is, in many instances, either completely struck
dumb, or greatly embarrassed, when he attempts
it. It cannot be from any superior deference
which he thinks it right to feel for their judg-
ment; for it will often happen that the single
friend, to whom he is able to speak fluently,
shall be one whose good opinion he more
values, and to whose wisdom he is more dis-
posed to look up, than of all the others toge-
ther. The speaker may even feel that he him-
self has a decided and acknowledged superiority
over every one of the audience; and that he
should not be the least abashed in addressing
any two or three of them, separately; yet still
all of them, collectively, will often inspire him

Another remarkable circumstance, connected Different
language
with the foregoing, is the difference in respect employed
of the style which is suitable, respectively, in the number
addressing a multitude, and two or three even
of the same persons. A much bolder, as well
as less accurate, kind of language is both allow-
able and advisable, in speaking to a consider-
able number; as Aristotle has remarked', in
speaking of the Graphic and Agonistic styles,-
the former, suited to the closet, the latter, to
public speaking before a large assembly. And
he ingeniously compares them to the different
styles of painting; the greater the crowd, he
says, the more distant is the view; so that in
scene-painting, for instance, coarser and bolder
touches are required, and the nice finish, which
would delight a close spectator, would be lost.
He does not, however, account for the pheno-
mena in question.

The solution of them will be found by at-
referred to tention to a very curious and complex play of
sympathies which takes place in a large as-
sembly; and, (within certain limits,) the more,
in proportion to its numbers. First, it is to be
observed that we are disposed to sympathize
with any emotion which we believe to exist in
the mind of any one present; and hence, if we
are at the same time otherwise disposed to feel
that emotion, such disposition is in consequence
heightened. In the next place, we not only
ourselves feel this tendency, but we are sensible
that others do the same; and thus, we sym-
pathize not only with the other emotions of the
rest, but also, with their sympathy towards
us. Any emotion accordingly which we feel,
is still further heightened by the knowledge
that there are others present who not only feel
the same, but feel it the more strongly in con-
sequence of their sympathy with ourselves.
Lastly, we are sensible that those around us
sympathize not only with ourselves, but with
each other also; and as we enter into this
heightened feeling of theirs likewise, the stimulus
to our own minds is thereby still further in-
creased.

obvious illustration of these principles, from the
circumstance that the effects produced are so
open and palpable. If any thing of this nature
occurs, a man is disposed, by the character of
the thing itself, to laugh: but much more, if
any one else is known to be present whom he
thinks likely to be diverted with it; even though
that other should not know of the presence of
the first; but much more still, if he does know
it; because his companion is then aware that
sympathy with his own emotion heightens
that of the other: and most of all will the
disposition to laugh be increased, if many are
present; because each is then aware that they
all sympathize with each other, as well as with
himself. It is hardly necessary to mention the
exact correspondence of the fact with the above
explanation. So important, in this case, is the
operation of the causes here noticed, that hardly
any one ever laughs when he is quite alone:
or if he does, he will find on consideration, that
it is from a conception of the presence of some
companion whom he thinks likely to have been
amused, had he been present, and to whom he
thinks of describing, or repeating, what had
diverted himself. Indeed, in other cases, as
well as the one just instanced, almost every
one is aware of the infectious nature of any
emotion excited in a large assembly. It may

be compared to the increase of sound by a
number of echoes, or of light, by a number of
mirrors; or to the blaze of a heap of firebrands,
each of which would speedily have gone out if
kindled separately, but which, when thrown
together, help to kindle each other.
The application of what has been said to the
case before us, is sufficiently obvious. The
speaker who is addressing a large assembly,
knows that each of them sympathizes both
with his own anxiety to acquit himself well,
and also with the same feeling in the minds
of the rest. He knows also, that every slip he
may be guilty of, that may tend to excite
ridicule, pity, disgust, &c. makes the stronger
impression on each of the hearers, from their
mutual sympathy, and their consciousness of it.
This augments his anxiety. Next, he knows
that each hearer, putting himself, mentally, in
the speaker's places, sympathizes with this
augmented anxiety; which is by this thought
increased still further. And if he becomes at
all embarrassed, the knowledge that there are
so many to sympathize, not only with that em-
barrassment, but also with each other's feelings,
• Hence it is that shy persons are, as is matter of common
remark, the more distressed by this infirmity when in com-
pany with those who are subject to the same.

on the perception of it, heightens the speaker's
confusion to the utmost.
The same causes will account for a skilful
orator's being able to rouse so much more
easily, and more powerfully, the passions of a
multitude: they inflame each other by mutual
sympathy, and mutual consciousness of it.
And hence it is that a bolder kind of language
is suitable to such an audience: a passage
which, in the closet, might just at the first
glance tend to excite awe, compassion, indigna-
tion, or any other such emotion, but which
would, on a moment's cool reflection, appear
extravagant, may
be very
suitable for the
Agonistic style; because before that moment's
reflection could take place in each hearer's
mind, he would be aware that every one around
him sympathized in that first emotion; which
would thus become so much heightened as to
preclude, in a great degree, the ingress of any
counteracting sentiment.
If one could suppose such a case as that of
a speaker, (himself aware of the circumstance,)
addressing a multitude, each of whom believed
himself to be the sole hearer, it is probable that
little or no embarrassment would be felt, and a
much more sober, calm, and finished style of
language would be adopted.

Sympathy
with the ex-
ous speaker
The impossibility of bringing the delivery of
temporane- a written composition completely to a level
with real extemporary speaking, (though, as
has been said, it may approach indefinitely near
to such an effect,) is explained on the same
principle. Besides that the audience are more
sure that the thoughts they hear expressed, are
the genuine emanation of the speaker's mind
at the moment, their attention and interest are
the more excited by their sympathy with one
whom they perceive to be carried forward solely
by his own unaided and unremitted efforts,
without having any book to refer to: they view
him as a swimmer supported by his own con-
stant exertions; and in every such case, if the
feat be well accomplished, the surmounting of
the difficulty affords great gratification; espe-
cially to those who are conscious that they
could not do the same. And one proof, that
part of the pleasure conveyed does arise from
this source, is, that as the spectators of an
exhibition of supposed unusual skill in swim-
ming, would instantly withdraw most of their
interest and admiration, if they perceived that
the performer was supported by corks, or the
like; so would the feelings alter of the hearers
of a supposed extemporaneous discourse, as

Practical deductions from the foregoing views.

The way in which the respective incon-
veniences of both kinds of discourses may best
be avoided, is evident from what has been
already said. Let both the extemporary Speaker,
and the Reader of his own composition, study
to avoid, as far as possible, all thoughts of self,
earnestly fixing the mind on the matter of what
is delivered; and the one will feel the less of that
embarrassment which arises from the thought of
what opinion the hearers will form of him ;

ments, not indeed which at that time first arise
in his own mind, but, which are then really

a growing reluctance to the delivery, as his
own, of any but his own compositions. Doc-
trines, indeed, and arguments he will freely
borrow; but he will be led to compose his own
discourses, from finding that he cannot deliver
those of another to his own satisfaction, without
laboriously studying them, as an actor does his
part, so as to make them, in some measure, his
And with this view, he will generally
find it advisable to introduce many alterations
in the expression, not with any thought of
improving the style, absolutely, but only with
a view to his own delivery. And indeed, even
his own previous compositions, he will be led to
alter, almost as much, in point of expression,
in order to accommodate them to the Natural
manner of delivery. Much that would please
in the closet, much of the Graphic style
described by Aristotle, will be laid aside for
the Agonistic;-for a style somewhat more
blunt and homely,-more simple and, appa-
rently, unstudied in its structure, and, at the
same time, more daringly energetic. And if

script sermon would afford, from the observation of its style,
a tolerably good ground of conjecture as to the author's

for the press, he will find it expedient to reverse
this process, and alter the style afresh.
A mere sermon-reader, on the contrary, will
avoid this inconvenience, and this labour; he
will be able to preach another's discourses
nearly as well as his own; and may send his
own to the press, without the necessity of any
great preparation: but he will purchase these
advantages at the expense of more than half the
force which might have been given to the
sentiments uttered". And he will have no
right to complain that his discourses, though
replete perhaps with good sense, learning, and
eloquence, are received with languid apathy, or
that many are seduced from their attendance on
his teaching, by the vapid rant of an illiterate
fanatic. Much of these evils must, indeed, be
expected, after all, to remain: but he does not
give himself a fair chance for diminishing them,
unless he does justice to his own arguments, in-
structions, and exhortations, by speaking them,
"I have seen somewhere an anecdote of some celebrated
actor being asked by a divine, "How is it that people listen
with so much emotion to what you say, which they know
to be all fictitious, besides that it would be no concern of
their's, even if true; while they hear with comparative
apathy, from us, truths, the most sublime, and the most
important to them?" The answer was, "because we de-
liver fiction like truth, and you deliver truth like fiction."

in the only effectual way, to the hearts of his
hearers; that is, as uttered naturally from his
own *.
The principles here laid down may help to explain a
remarkable fact which is usually attributed to other than
the true causes. The powerful effects often produced by
some fanatical preachers, not superior in pious and sincere
zeal, and inferior in learning, in good sense, and in taste,
to men who are listened to with comparative apathy, are
frequently considered as a proof of superior eloquence;
though an eloquence tarnished by barbarism, and ex-
travagant mannerism. But may not such effects result,
not from any superior powers in the preacher, but merely
from the intrinsic beauty and sublimity, and the measure-
less importance of the subject? Why then, it may be
replied, does not the other preacher, whose subject is the
very same, produce the same effect? The answer is, be-
cause he is but half-attended to. The ordinary measured
cadence of reading, is not only in itself dull, but is what
men are familiarly accustomed to: Religion itself also, is
a subject so familiar, in a certain sense, (familiar, that is,
to the ear,) as to be trite, even to those who know and
think little about it. Let but the attention be thoroughly
roused, and intently fixed on such a stupendous subject,
and that subject itself will produce the most overpowering
emotion. And not only unaffected earnestness of manner,
but, perhaps, even still more, any uncouth oddity, and even
ridiculous extravagance, will, by the stimulus of novelty,
have the effect of thus rousing the hearers from their
ordinary lethargy. So that a preacher of little or no real
eloquence, will sometimes, on such a subject, produce the
effects of the greatest eloquence, by merely forcing the

become an accomplished actor,-possessing the
plastic power of putting himself, in imagination,
so completely into the situation of him whom
he personates, and of adopting, for the moment,
so perfectly, all the sentiments and views of
that character, as to express himself exactly as
such a person would have done, in the supposed
situation. Few are likely to attain such perfec-
tion; but he who shall have succeeded in ac-
complishing this, will have taken a most
circuitous route to his proposed object, if that
object be, not to qualify himself for the Stage,
but to be able impressively to deliver in public,
on real and important occasions, his own senti-
ments. He will have been carefully learning
to assume, what, when the real occasion occurs,
need not be assumed, but only expressed.

not, in order that he may be enabled, on a real

Let all studied recitation therefore, every
kind of speaking which from its nature must
necessarily be artificial,-be carefully avoided,
by one whose object is to attain the only truly
impressive, the Natural Delivery.
It should be observed, that the censure here
pronounced on school-recitations, and all exer-
cises of the like nature, relates, exclusively,
to the effect produced on the style of Elocution.
With any other objects that may be proposed,
the present work has, obviously, no concern.
Nor can it be doubted that a familiarity with
the purest forms of the Latin and Greek lan-
guages, may be greatly promoted by commit-
ting to memory, and studying, not only to
understand, but to recite with propriety, the
best orations and plays in those languages.
The familiar knowledge too, and temporary
adoption, of the characters and sentiments, for
instance, of Terence's plays, can hardly fail to
produce a powerful effect on the moral cha-
racter. If the spectators of a play which
strongly interests them are in any degree dis-
posed (as the Poet expresses it) to “live o'er
each scene, and be what they behold," much
more may this be expected in the actor, who

studies to give the fullest effect to his perform-
ance, by fancying himself, as far as possible,
the person he represents. If any one, therefore,
is more anxious for his son's proficiency in the
Latinity and in the morality of Terence, than
for his excellence in public speaking, he is right
in encouraging such exercises". But let no one
a To those who do wish their sons to imbibe the morality
of Terence, I have, of course, nothing more to say. But if
there are any, as I must hope there are not a few, who would
deprecate such a result, and who yet patronize the practice
in question, I cannot but express my unfeigned wonder at
their doing so. Can they doubt that some effect is likely
to be produced on a young and unformed mind, forwarder in
passions than in reason, by-not reading merely-not
learning by heart merely-but studying as an actor, and
striving to deliver with effect, the part of an accomplished
debauchee? And this too, such a character as Terence's
poetical justice never fails to crown with success and
applause. The foulest obscenity, such as would create
disgust in any delicate mind, would probably be less likely
to corrupt the principles, than the more gentleman-like
profligacy, which is not merely represented, but recom-
mended in Terence; and which approaches but too nearly
to what the youth may find exemplified among the higher
classes in this country.
Will it be answered that because these same boys are
taught to say their Catechism-are sent to Chapel-and
are given to understand that they are not to take Pamphi-
lus as a model, a sufficient safeguard is thus provided,
against the effects of an assiduous effort to gain applause
by a lively and spirited representation of such a character?

seek to attain a natural, simple, and forcible
Elocution, by a practice which, the more he
applies to it, will carry him still the farther from
the object he aims at.
What has been said may perhaps be con-
sidered by some as applicable only in the case
where the design is merely to qualify a man for
extemporaneous speaking;-not for delivering
a written discourse with the effect of one that
is actually extemporaneous. For it may be
urged, that he who attempts this, must be, to a
certain extent, an Actor: he may indeed really
think, and strongly feel at the moment, all that
he is saying; but though, thus far, no disguise
is needed, he cannot, without a distinct effort,
deliver what he is, in fact, reading, with the air
of one who is not reading, but framing each
sentence as he delivers it: and to learn to do

remarks; but a sense of duty forbids their suppression.
If the practice is capable of vindication, let it receive one :

the MOTHERS of the boys, when they come to witness the

this, it may be said, practice is requisite; not
such practice indeed as that of ordinary school-
recitations, which has a directly contrary tend-
ency; but such as might be adopted, on the
principles above laid down. And it must be
admitted, (indeed the remark has been fre-
quently made in the foregoing pages,) that the
task of him who delivers a written discourse,
is very different from that of the truly extem-
porary speaker, supposing the object be to pro-
duce at all a similar effect. For, as I have
formerly observed, what has been here called
the Natural Delivery, is that which is natural
to the real Speaker alone; and is by no means
what will spontaneously suggest itself to one
who has (even his own) written compositions.
before him. To attain the delivery I have been
recommending, he must make a strong and
continual effort so to withdraw his mind, not
only from studied modulation of voice, but from
the knowledge that he is reading, and so to
absorb himself, as it were, not only in the ge-
neral sentiments, but in each separate expres-
sion, as to make it thoroughly his own at the
moment of utterance. And I am far from sup-
posing that in doing this he will not improve
by practice; indeed I have all along implied,
that no one can expect at once to attain per-
fection in it. But whether any such system of

recitation as would afford beneficial practice
could be adopted at schools, I am more doubt-
ful. Supposing the established mode of spout-
ing to be totally exploded, and every effort
used to make a boy deliver a Speech of Cæsar,
for instance, or Lear, in the natural manner,
i. e. according to the Muster's view of what is
natural, the learner himself will be reciting in
a manner, to him, wholly artificial; not merely
because he is reading, or repeating from me-
mory, what he is endeavouring to utter as if
extempore ;-nor again, merely because the
composition is another's, and the circumstances
fictitious; but because the composition, the
situation, and the circumstances could not have
been his own. A School-boy has no natural
way of his own to express himself on the topics
on which he is made to declaim, because as yet
those topics form no part of the furniture of his
mind. And thus the object proposed, viz. to
qualify him for delivering well, on real occa-
sions, his own, or such as his own, written
compositions, will have been defeated; and we
shall have anticipated, and corrupted by a stu-
died elocution, what would have been his own
natural mode of expressing himself on such
occasions.
However serviceable practice may be, there
is none I think that will not do more harm

than good, except the practice of reciting, either
on real occasions, or on such as one can fully
conceive and enter into, expressions either actu-
ally his own, or at least such as he would
naturally have uttered on the occasion. Should
the School-boy be limited to the recitation of
compositions of his own, or of a fellow student,
and that too, compositions not written as a
task on a given subject, but on some real occa-
siou interesting to a youthful mind, (a narrative
e. g. of some recent occurrence, or the like,) a
system of practice might perhaps be adopted
which would prove beneficial.
Such exercises as these, however, would make
but a sorry display, in comparison of the cus-
tomary declamations. The "pomp and cir-
cumstance" of annual public recitations has
much that is attractive to Masters, Parents, and
Scholars; and it is easily believed, by those
who wish to believe it, that for a boy who is
destined hereafter to speak in public, the prac-
tice of making public speeches, and of taking
great pains to deliver them well, must be a very
beneficial exercise.
§. 3.
The last circumstance to be noticed among Natural de-
livery more
the results of the mode of delivery recom- easily
mended, is, that the speaker will find it much
heard.

easier, in this Natural manner, to make himself
heard: he will be heard, that is, much more
distinctly, at a greater distance, and with far
less exertion and fatigue to himself. This is
the more necessary to be mentioned, because it
is a common, if not a prevailing opinion, that
the reverse of this is the fact. There are not a
few who assign as a reason for their adoption of
a certain unnatural tone and measured cadence,
that it is necessary, in order to be heard by a
large congregation. But though such an arti-
ficial voice and utterance will often appear to
produce a louder sound, (which is the circum-
stance that probably deceives such persons,)
yet a natural voice and delivery, provided it be
clear, though it be less laboured, and may even
seem low to those who are near at hand, will
be distinctly heard at a much greater distance.
The only decisive proof of this must be sought
in experience; which will not fail to convince
of the truth of it, any one who will fairly make
the trial.
The requisite degree of loudness will be best
obtained, conformably with the principles here
inculcated, not by thinking about the voice, but
by looking at the most distant of the hearers,
and addressing one's self especially to him.
The voice rises spontaneously, when we are
speaking to a person who is not very near.

It should be added, that a speaker's being
well heard does not depend near so much on
the loudness of the sounds, as on their distinct-
ness, and especially on the clear pronunciation
of the consonants.
That the organs of voice are much less
strained and fatigued by the natural action
which takes place in real speaking, than by any
other, (besides that it is, what might be ex-
pected, a priori,) is evident from daily experi-
ence. An extemporary Speaker will usually
be much less exhausted in two hours, than an
elaborate reciter (though less distinctly heard)
will be, in one. Even the ordinary tone of
reading aloud is so much more fatiguing than
that of conversation, that feeble patients are
frequently unable to continue it for a quarter of
an hour without great exhaustion; even though
they may feel no inconvenience from talking,
with few or no pauses, and in no lower voice,
for more than double that time.

degree than another, by emotions of bashful-
ness; but it will be more speedily and more
completely subdued: the very system pursued,
since it forbids all thoughts of self, striking at
the root of the evil. He will, indeed, on the
outset, incur censure, not only critical but
moral;—he will be blamed for using a collo-
quial delivery; and the censure will very likely
be, as far as relates to his earliest efforts, not
wholly undeserved; for his manner will pro-
bably at first too much resemble that of con-
versation, though of serious and earnest con-
versation but by perseverance he may be sure
of avoiding deserved, and of mitigating, and
ultimately overcoming, undeserved, censure.
He will, indeed, never be praised for a "very
fine delivery;" but his matter will not lose the
approbation it may deserve; as he will be the
more sure of being heard and attended to. He
will not, indeed, meet with many who can be
regarded as models of the Natural manner; and
those he does meet with, he will be precluded,
by the nature of the system, from minutely
imitating; but he will have the advantage of
carrying within him an Infallible Guide, as
long as he is careful to follow the suggestions
of Nature; abstaining from all thoughts re-

And though he must not expect to attain
perfection at once, he may be assured that,
while he steadily adheres to this plan, he is in
the right road to it; instead of becoming, as on
the other plan, more and more artificial, the
longer he studies. And every advance he
makes will produce a proportional effect: it
will give him more and more of that hold on
the attention, the understanding, and the feelings,
of the audience, which no studied modulation
can ever attain. Others indeed may be more

(for it certainly is a formed habit,) of keeping
themselves quite still, or nearly so, when
speaking. This is supposed to be, and perhaps
is, the more rational and dignified way of
speaking: but so strong is the tendency to
indicate vehement internal emotion by some
kind of outward gesture, that those who do not
encourage or allow themselves in any, frequently
fall unconsciously into some awkward trick of
swinging the body', folding a paper, twisting a
string, or the like. But when any one is
reading, or even speaking, in the Artificial
manner, there is little or nothing of this ten-

the practice came to be generally disapproved,
and exploded.
It need only be observed, that, in conformity
with the principles maintained throughout this
Book, no care should, in any case, be taken to
use graceful or appropriate action; which, if
not perfectly unstudied, will always be (as has
been just remarked) intolerable.
But if any
one spontaneously falls into any gestures that
are unbecoming, care should then be taken to
break the habit; and that, not only in public
speaking, but on all occasions. The case, in-
deed, is the same with utterance: if any one
has, in common discourse, an indistinct, hesi-
tating, dialectic, or otherwise faulty, delivery,
his Natural manner certainly is not what he
should adopt in public speaking; but he should
endeavour, by care, to remedy the defect, not
in public speaking only, but in ordinary con-
versation also. And so also, with respect to
attitudes and gestures. It is in these points,
principally, if not exclusively, that the remarks
of an intelligent friend will be beneficial.

If, again, any one finds himself naturally and
spontaneously led to use, in speaking, a mode-
rate degree of action, which he finds from the
observation of others not to be ungraceful or
inappropriate, there is no reason that he should
study to repress this tendency.

It would be inconsistent with the principle
cedes the just laid down, to deliver any precepts for
gesture because the observance of even the
best conceivable precepts, would, by destroying
the natural appearance, be fatal to their object :
but there is a remark, which is worthy of atten-
tion, from the illustration it affords of the
erroneousness, in detail, as well as in principle,
of the ordinary systems of instruction in this
point. Boys are generally taught to employ
the prescribed action either after, or during the
utterance of the words it is to enforce. The
best and most appropriate action, must, from
this circumstance alone, necessarily appear a
feeble affectation. It suggests the idea of a
person speaking to those who do not fully
understand the language, and striving by signs
to explain the meaning of what he has been
saying. The very same gesture, had it come
at the proper, that is, the natural, point of
time, might perhaps have added greatly to the

this being always the case with a real, earnest,

there is a distinction to be made between the
unnatural and the merely improbable: a fiction is unna-
tural when there is some assignable reason against the
events taking place as described,-when men are repre-
sented as acting contrary to the character assigned them,
or to human nature in general; as when a young lady of
seventeen, brought up in ease, luxury, and retirement,
with no companions but the narrow-minded and illiterate,
displays (as a heroine usually does) under the most trying
circumstances, such wisdom, fortitude, and knowledge of
the world, as the best instructors and the best examples
can rarely produce without the aid of more mature age
and longer experience. On the other hand, a fiction is
still improbable, though not unnatural, when there is no
reason to be assigned why things should not take place
as represented, except that the overbalance of chances is
against it; the hero meets, in his utmost distress, most
opportunely, with the very person to whom he had for-
merly done a signal service, and who happens to commu-
nicate to him a piece of intelligence which sets all to rights.
Why should he not meet him as well as any one else? all
that can be said is, that there is no reason why he should.

it would be nothing unnatural, though the most deter-
mined novel-reader would be shocked at its improbability,
if all the hero's enemies, while they were conspiring his
ruin, were to be struck dead together by a lucky flash of
lightning yet many denouements which are decidedly
unnatural, are better tolerated than this would be. We
shall, perhaps, best explain our meaning by examples,
taken from a novel of great merit in many respects.
When Lord Glenthorn, in whom a most unfavourable
education has acted on a most unfavourable disposition,
after a life of torpor, broken only by short sallies of forced
exertion, on a sudden reverse of fortune, displays at once
the most persevering diligence in the most repulsive
studies, and in middle life, without any previous habits
of exertion, any hope of early business, or the example
of friends, or the stimulus of actual want, to urge him,
outstrips every competitor, though every competitor has
every advantage against him; this is unnatural.-When
Lord Glenthorn, the instant he is stripped of his estates,
meets, falls in love with, and is conditionally accepted by,
the very lady who is remotely intitled to those estates;

merely improbable. The distinction which we have been
pointing out may be plainly perceived in the events of real
life; when any thing takes place of such a nature as we
should call, in a fiction, merely improbable, because there
are many chances against it, we call it a lucky or unlucky
accident, a singular coincidence, something very extra-
ordinary, odd, curious, &c.; whereas any thing which,
in a fiction, would be called unnatural, when it actually
occurs, (and such things do occur,) is still called unna-
tural, inexplicable, unaccountable, inconceivable, &c. epi-

"Analogy does not mean the similarity of two things,
but the similarity, or sameness, of two relations. There
must be more than two things to give rise to two relations:
there must be at least three; and in most cases there are
four. Thus A may be like B, but there is no analogy
between A and B: it is an abuse of the word to speak so,
and it leads to much confusion of thought. If A has the
same relation to B which C has to D, then there is an
analogy. If the first relation be well known, it may serve
to explain the second, which is less known: and the
transfer of name from one of the terms in the relation best
known to its corresponding term in the other, causes no
confusion, but on the contrary tends to remind us of the
similarity that exists in these relations; and so assists the
mind instead of misleading it.

their nature may be strictly analogous to one another.
Thus a certain proposition may be called the basis of a
system. The proposition is to the system what the basis
is to a building. It serves a similar office and purpose:
and this last relation being well known is of use to il-
lustrate the other which was less known. E. g. The sys-
tem rests upon it: it is useless to proceed with the argu-
ment till this is well established: if this were removed, the
system must fall. The only cautions requisite in the use
of this kind of analogy are, FIRST, not to proceed to a
comparison of the corresponding terms as they are intrin-
sically in themselves or in their own nature, but merely as
they are in relation to the other terms respectively; and,
SECONDLY, not to presume that because the relation is the
same or similar in one or two points, therefore it is the
same or similar in all.
"The FIRST of these errors cannot be committed in the
instance before us, because the two things are of such
different natures that they have no one point of resem-
blance. But when the first and the third term are not
only corresponding in relation, but chance also to be of a
kindred nature, or when, from the circumstance of one
being visible and the other invisible, their discrepancies do
not strike us, it often happens that a comparison is pur-
sued between the things themselves, and this is one cause
of the promiscuous use of the terms similitude and ana-
logy. As for example, when Locke, having once esta-
blished the comparison, proceeds to talk of Ideas as if they
were really images in the mind, or traces in the brain.
"It is from observing this tendency in men to regard
the metaphorical or analogous name as bringing along
with it something of the nature of the thing it originally
signified, that Mr. Stewart is led to make the remark not

less original than just, that it is well for the understand-
ing, though it may be a loss to the fancy, when a meta-
phorical word has lost its pedigree-that is, when it no
longer excites the primary idea denoted by it, and is re-
duced by custom to a plain and direct appellation in its
secondary sense. He suggests also with equal ingenuity,
in cases where words have not yet been worn down to this
use, the expedient of varying our metaphor when speaking
of the same subject, as a preservative against this danger-
ous and encroaching error. Of the utility of this practice
I have no doubt and I think it may be regarded as an
advantage of the same kind, that the parables of the New
Testament are drawn from such a great diversity of ob-
jects, as to check the propensity in man, especially in mat-
ters of religion, to attach some mystical character to the
images so employed, and to look upon them as emblems
possessing an intrinsic virtue, or at least a secret affinity
with those spiritual truths, to the illustration of which
they are made subservient.
"When the points in which this similarity of relation
holds are of secondary importance—when instead of being
essential and characteristic, they are slight and superficial

litude, as being addressed rather to the fancy than to the

widely from his use of the word. Indeed M. Prevot's etymology, as given in a
passage quoted with approbation by Mr. Stewart, vol. ii. c. iv. sect. 4. appears
to me quite erroneous. Le mot Analogie, dans l'origine, n'exprime que la

judgment, and intended rather to adorn and illustrate,
than to explain. But it would perhaps be better to avoid
the name similitude in these cases, and to regard them as
being, what they really are, analogies, although subsisting
in points of inferior moment.
"Thus when the swallow is called the herald of summer,
or a ship is said to plough the waves, it is easy to resolve
the phrase into the form of analogy or proportion: the
swallow is to the summer what the herald is to his prince;
he announces his approach. So the action of a ship is to
the sea, what the action of a plough is to the land. But
because in these cases the relation is fanciful rather than
real, that is, it consists not in essential points but in mere
circumstances of inferior importance, we leave such things
to the province of taste or amusement, and no considerate
man ever attempts to reason from them.
'I am not of the mind of those speculators,' said Mr.
Burke, who seem assured that all states have the same
period of infancy, manhood, and decrepitude, that are
found in individuals. Parallels of this sort rather furnish
similitudes to illustrate or to adorn, than supply analogies
from whence to reason. The objects which are attempted
to be forced into an analogy are not found in the same
classes of existence. Individuals are physical beings-
commonwealths are not physical but moral essences."
"A remarkable example of this kind is that argument
of Toplady against free-will, who, after quoting the text,
Ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house,
triumphantly exclaims, 'This is giving free-will a stab

under the fifth rib: for can stones hew themselves, and
build themselves into a regular house?'
"Even when we attribute to inanimate things the qua-
lities of animals, the same analysis may be adopted as
before. Thus the rage of the sea denotes a similarity of
effect to the effect of rage in animals. This is even more
the work of fancy than the example before given: for in
reducing it to the form of a proportion, one term is wholly
supplied by the imagination. We do not really believe
there is a principle in the sea producing these effects, an-
swering to rage in animals, but the imagination suggests
such a principle, and transfers the name of rage to it.
"In those cases where the analogy is traced between
things perfectly heterogeneous there is little danger of con-
founding the idea with that of similitude. But when the
subjects we are comparing are of a kindred nature, so that
the things spoken of not only stand in the same relation,
but also bear a close resemblance to each other, then it is
we are most apt to confound them together, and to substi-
tute resemblance for analogy. Thus because the heart or
the tooth of an animal not only serves the same office to
the animal that the heart or the tooth of a man does to
him, but is also an object very nearly resembling it in
structure and outward appearance, we are apt to imagine
that the same name is given to it solely on this last ac-
count. But if we pursue the enquiry throughout the
animal creation, we shall find that the form of the corre-
sponding parts is infinitely varied, although the analogy
remains the same; till at length we arrive at such diver-
sities, that it is only persons conversant with comparative

anatomy who can readily detect the analogy. And long
before the difference has reached this length, in popular
discourse the analogical name is dropped, and the scientific
use of it in such cases sounds pedantic to unlearned ears.
Thus the beak of a bird answers to the tooth of man, and
the shell of a lobster to the bones of other animals. If the
use and office remain the same, no diversity of form im-
pairs the analogy: but we ought from such examples to
learn even when similitude of form does exist, not to regard
it as the true ground of the comparison we make, and of
our affixing the same name.
"Thus too when we speak of qualities of things which
are not cognizable by our senses except in their effects,
we bestow the same name on account of a real or supposed
analogy, not on account of any similarity in the qualities
themselves, which may or may not exist according as the
things we speak of are more or less of a kindred nature.
Sagacity, courage, fidelity, love, jealousy, revenge, are all
predicated of brute animals not less than of man, although
they are not things or existences in themselves, but certain
attributes or affections in them, exhibiting symptoms and
producing effects corresponding with the symptoms and
effects attendant upon those qualities in ourselves. In
these instances, still more than in the former, we are
prone to confound analogy with resemblance-because
as these things have no form or existence of their own—
as the whole essence of them consists in their relation
to something else if the relations be alike, the things are
necessarily alike, and we naturally slide into that form of
speaking which makes no distinction between analogy and
resemblance: but even then we regard the qualities as iden-
tical, only in proportion as the nature of the respective sub-
jects to which they belong may be regarded as the same.


## p. 365 (#389) ############################################

APPENDIX.
365
"The SECOND error above noticed as carefully to be
avoided in the use of analogy is, when we do not indeed
treat the corresponding terms as resembling one another in
their own nature, but when we presume that a similarity
of relation subsists in other points besides those which are
the foundation of the analogy.
"When the analogy consists in slight or superficial cir-
cumstances, still more when it is fanciful only, no attempt
whatever should be made to reason from it; as was exem-
plified in the passage produced from Burke's writings:
but even when the analogy is solid and well-founded we
are liable to fall into error, if we suppose it to extend
farther than it really does. Errors of this nature are
often committed by men of lively fancies, or of ardent
minds, and they are the more seducing because they set
out not only with a shew of reason, but with reason and
truth actually on their side.
"Thus because a just analogy has been discerned be-
tween the metropolis of a country, and the heart in the
animal body, it has been sometimes contended that its
increased size is a disease that it may impede some of its
most important functions or even be the means of its
dissolution.
"Another frequent example of this second error is found
in the use of the same titles of office or dignity in different
nations or in distant times. Although the relation de-
noted by them be the same in one or in several important
particulars, yet it scarcely ever holds throughout; and the
most false notions are in consequence entertained by people
of the nature of these corresponding offices in every coun-
try but their own. We have known what mischief has
been produced by the adoption of the phrase, servant of
the people,' although it cannot be denied that in some

of a servant-that his time for instance, his thoughts, his
abilities, should be devoted to the benefit of the people-
and again, on the other hand, because the duty of a sub-

the duty of a child towards his parent, some speculative

Hence it is become common with story-tellers,

introduce remarks like these; that the tale which they
relate is not old, that it happened but lately, or in their
own time, or that they are yet living who had a part in it,
or were witnesses of it. Proximity of time regards not
only the past, but the future. An event that will probably
soon happen, hath greater influence upon us than what
will probably happen a long time hence. I have hitherto
proceeded on the hypothesis, that the orator rouses the
passions of his hearers, by exhibiting some past trans-
action; but we must acknowledge that passion may be as
strongly excited by his reasonings concerning an event yet
to come. In the judiciary orations there is greater scope
for the former, in the deliberative for the latter; though
in each kind there may occasionally be scope for both.

and have equal weight, whether they relate to the future
or to the past. The only exception that I know of is,
that probability and plausibility are scarcely distinguish-
able, when used in reference to events in futurity. As in
these there is no access for testimony, what constitutes the
principal distinction is quite excluded. In comparing the
influence of the past upon our minds with that of the
future, it appears in general, that if the evidence, the
importance, and the distance of the objects, be equal, the
latter will be greater than the former. The reason, I
imagine, is, we are conscious, that as every moment, the
future, which seems placed before us, is approaching;
and the past, which lies, as it were, behind, is retiring; our
nearness or relation to the one constantly increaseth as the
other decreaseth. There is something like attraction in
the first case, and repulsion in the second. This tends to
interest us more in the future than in the past, and con-
sequently to the present view aggrandizes the one, and
diminishes the other.
}
"What, nevertheless, gives the past a very considerable
advantage, is its being generally susceptible of much
stronger evidence than the future. The lights of the
mind are, if I may so express myself, in an opposite
situation to the lights of the body. These discover clearly
the prospect lying before us, but not the ground we have
already passed. By the memory, on the contrary, that¸
great luminary of the mind, things past are exhibited in
retrospect; we have no correspondent faculty to irradiate
the future: and even in matters which fall not within the
reach of our memory, past events are often clearly dis-
coverable by testimony, and by effects at present existing;
whereas we have nothing equivalent to found our argu-
ments upon in reasoning about things to come. It is for

this reason that the future is considered as the province of
conjecture and uncertainty.
"Local Connexion, the fifth in the above enumeration,
hath a more powerful effect than proximity of time.
Duration and space are two things (call them entities, or
attributes, or what you please) in some respects the most
like, and in some respects the most unlike, to one another.
They resemble in continuity, divisibility, infinity, in their
being deemed essential to the existence of other things,
and in the doubts that have been raised as to their having
a real or independent existence of their own. They differ
in that the latter is permanent, whereas the very essence
of the former consisteth in transitoriness; the parts of the
one are all successive, of the other all co-existent. The
greater portions of time are all distinguished by the me-
morable things which have been transacted in them, the
smaller portions by the revolutions of the heavenly bodies.
the portions of place, great and small, (for we do not here
consider the regions of the fixed stars and planets,) are
distinguished by the various tracts of land and water, into
which the earth is divided and subdivided; the one dis-
tinction intelligible, the other sensible; the one chiefly
known to the inquisitive, the other in a great measure
obvious to all.
"Hence perhaps it arises, that the latter is considered as
a firmer ground of relation than the former. Who is not
more curious to know the notable transactions which have
happened in his own country from the earliest antiquity,
than to be acquainted with those which have happened in
the remotest regions of the globe during the century
wherein he lives? It must be owned, however, that the
former circumstance is more frequently aided by that of
personal relation than the latter. Connexion of place not

only includes vicinage, but every other local relation, such
as being in a province under the same government with
us, in a state that is in alliance with us, in a country well
known to us, and the like. Of the influence of this con-
nexion in operating on our passions we have daily proofs.
With how much indifference, at least with how slight and
transient emotion, do we read in newspapers the accounts
of the most deplorable accidents in countries distant and
unknown? How much, on the contrary, are we alarmed
and agitated on being informed that any such accident
hath happened in our own neighbourhood, and that, even
though we be totally unacquainted with the persons con-
cerned?
"Still greater is the power of relation to the persons
concerned, which was the sixth circumstance mentioned,
as this tie is more direct than that which attacheth us to
the scene of action. It is the persons, not the place, that
are the immediate objects of the passions love or hatred,
pity or anger, envy or contempt. Relation to the actors
commonly produces an effect contrary to that produced by
relation to the sufferers, the first in extenuation, the second
in aggravation, of the crime alleged. The first makes
for the apologist, the second for the accuser.
This, I say,
is commonly the case, not always. A remote relation to
the actors, when the offence is heinous, especially if the
sufferers be more nearly related, will sometimes rather
aggravate than extenuate the guilt in our estimation. But
it is impossible with any precision to reduce these effects
to rules; so much depending on the different tempers and
sentiments of different audiences. Personal relations are
of various kinds. Some have generally greater influence
than others; some again have greater influence with one
person, others with another. They are consanguinity,

affinity, friendship, acquaintance, being fellow-citizens,
countrymen, of the same surname, language, religion,
occupation, and innumerable others.
"But of all the connexive circumstances, the most pow-
erful is interest, which is the last. Of all relations,
personal relation, by bringing the object very near, most
enlivens that sympathy which attacheth us to the concerns
of others; interest in the effects brings the object, if I
may say so, into contact with us, and makes the mind
cling to it, as a concern of its own. Sympathy is but a
reflected feeling, and therefore, in ordinary cases, must be
weaker than the original. Though the mirror be ever so
true, a lover will not be obliged to it for presenting him
with the figure of his mistress, when he hath an oppor-
tunity of gazing on her person. Nor will the orator place
his chief confidence in the assistance of the social and
sympathetic affections, when he hath it in his power to
arm the selfish.
“Men universally, from a just conception of the differ-
ence, have, when self is concerned, given a different name
to what seems originally the same passion in a higher
degree. Injury, to whomsoever offered, is to every man
that observes it, and whose sense of right is not debauched
by vicious practice, the natural object of indignation.
Indignation always implies resentment, or a desire of
retaliating on the injurious person, so far at least as to
make him repent the wrong he hath committed. This
indignation in the person injured, is, from our knowledge
of mankind, supposed to be, not indeed universally, but
generally, so much stronger, that it ought to be distin-
guished by another appellation, and is accordingly deno-
minated revenge. In like manner, beneficence, on whom-
soever exercised, is the natural object of our love; love

​always implies benevolence, or a desire of promoting the
happiness of the beneficent person; but this passion in the
person benefited is conceived to be so much greater, and
to infer so strong an obligation to a return of good offices
to his benefactor, that it merits to be distinguished by the
title gratitude. Now by this circumstance of interest in
the effects, the speaker, from engaging pity in his favour,
can proceed to operate on a more powerful principle, self-
preservation. The benevolence of his hearers he can work
up into gratitude, their indignation into revenge.
"The two last-mentioned circumstances, personal rela-
tion and interest, are not without influence, as was hinted
in the enumeration, though they regard the speaker only,
and not the hearers. The reason is, a person present with
us, whom we see and hear, and who by words, and looks,
and gestures, gives the liveliest signs of his feelings, has
the surest and most immediate claim upon our sympathy.
We become infected with his passions. We are hurried
along by them, and not allowed leisure to distinguish

'I knew that thou didst die to save me from such suf-

brought thee the refuse and sweepings of a body that has
been corrupted and brutalized in the service of profligacy
and drunkenness,-even the body which thou didst de-
clare should be the temple of thy Holy Spirit.' The poor
Indian will, perhaps, shew his hands, reeking with the
blood of his children, saying, 'I thought this was the
sacrifice with which God was well pleased:' and
you, the
Christian, will come forward with blood upon thy hands
also, I knew that thou gavest thy Son for my sacrifice,
and commandedst me to lead my offspring in the way of
everlasting life; but the command was too hard for me,
to teach them thy statutes and to set them my humble
example: I have let them go the broad way to destruction,
and their blood is upon my hand—and my heart—and my
head.' The Indian will come forward, and say, ' Behold,
I am come from the wood, the desert, and the wilderness,
where I fled from the cheerful society of my fellow-mortals,
because I thought it was pleasing in thy sight.' And the
Christian will come forward, and say, 'Behold, I come
from my comfortable home and the communion of my
brethren, which thou hast graciously permitted me to
enjoy; but I thought it too hard to give them a share of
those blessings which thou hast bestowed upon me; I

poor Indian, none can presume to say. That he was sadly
mistaken in the means of salvation, and that what he had
done could never purchase him everlasting life, is beyond
a doubt; but yet the Judge may say, "Come unto me,
thou heavy-laden, and I will give thee the rest which thou
couldst not purchase for thyself." But, to the Christian,
"Thou, who hadst my easy yoke, and my light burden;
thou, for whom all was already purchased."-Thank
God! it is not yet pronounced:-begone! and fly for

Suppose it were suddenly revealed to any one among
you, that he, and he alone of all that walk upon the face
of this earth, was destined to receive the benefit of his
Redeemer's atonement, and that all the rest of mankind
was lost-and lost to all eternity; it is hard to say what
would be the first sensation excited in that man's mind by
the intelligence. It is indeed probable it would be joy-to
think that all his fears respecting his eternal destiny were
now no more; that all the forebodings of the mind and
misgivings of the heart-all the solemn stir which we feel
rising within us whenever we look forward to a dark
futurity, to feel that all these had now subsided for
ever, to know that he shall stand in the everlasting
sunshine of the love of God! It is perhaps impossible that
all this should not call forth an immediate feeling of
delight but if you wish the sensation to continue, you
must go to the wilderness; you must beware how you
come within sight of a human being, or within sound of a
human voice; you must recollect that you are now alone
upon the earth; or, if you want society, you had better

look for it among the beasts of the field than among the
ruined species to which you belong; unless indeed the
Almighty, in pity to your desolation, should send his
angels before the appointed time, that you might learn to
forget in their society the outcast objects of your former
sympathies. But to go abroad into human society,-to
walk amongst beings who are now no longer your fellow-
creatures,―to feel the charity of your common nature
rising in your heart, and to have to crush it within you
like a sin,-to reach forth your hand to perform one of
the common kindnesses of humanity, and to find it withered
by the recollection, that however you may mitigate a
present pang, the everlasting pang is irreversible; to turn
away in despair from these children whom you have now
come to bless and to save (we hope and trust both here
and for ever)!—perhaps it would be too much for you;
at all events, it would be hard to state a degree of exertion
within the utmost range of human energy, or a degree
of pain within the farthest limit of human endurance, to
which you would not submit, that you might have one
companion on your lonely way from this world to the
mansions of happiness. But suppose, at that moment, that
the angel who brought the first intelligence returns to tell
you that there are beings upon this earth who may yet
be saved, that he was before mistaken, no matter how,-
perhaps he was your guardian angel, and darted from the
throne of grace with the intelligence of your salvation
without waiting to hear the fate of the rest of mankind,—
no matter how,-but he comes to tell
that there are
beings upon the earth who are within the reach of your
Redeemer's love, and of your own,-that some of them

In Dr. Campbell's ingenious dissertation (Rhetoric, book
ii. c. vii.)" on the causes that nonsense often escapes being
detected, both by the writer and the reader," he remarks,
(sec. 2,) that "there are particularly three sorts of writing
wherein we are liable to be imposed upon by words without
meaning."
"The first is, where there is an exuberance of metaphor.
Nothing is more certain than that this trope, when tem-
perately and appositely used, serves to add light to the
expression, and energy to the sentiment. On the contrary,
when vaguely and intemperately used, nothing can serve
more effectually to cloud the sense, where there is sense,
and by consequence to conceal the defect, where there is
no sense to shew. And this is the case, not only where
there is in the same sentence a mixture of discordant meta-
phors, but also where the metaphoric Style is too long
continued, and too far pursued. [Ut modicus autem atque
opportunus translationis usus illustrat orationem: ita fre-
quens, et obscurat et tædio complet; continuus vero in alle-
goriam et ænigmata exit. Quint. lib. viii. c. vi.] The
reason is obvious. In common speech the words are the
immediate signs of the thought. But it is not so here;
for when a person, instead of adopting metaphors that
come naturally and opportunely in his way, rummages the
whole world in quest of them, and piles them one upon

APPENDIX.
another, when he cannot so properly be said to use meta-
phor, as to talk in metaphor, or rather when from meta-
phor he runs into allegory, and thence into enigma, his
words are not the immediate signs of his thought; they
are at best but the signs of the signs of his thought. His
writing may then be called, what Spenser not unjustly
styled his Fairy Queen, a perpetual allegory or dark con-
ceit. Most readers will account it much to bestow a tran-
sient glance on the literal sense, which lies nearest; but
will never think of that meaning more remote, which the
figures themselves are intended to signify. It is no wonder
then that this sense, for the discovery of which it is neces-
sary to see through a double veil, should, where it is, more
readily escape our observation, and that where it is wanting
we should not so quickly miss it." **
“There is, in respect of the two meanings, considerable
variety to be found in the tropical Style. In just allegory
and similitude there is always a propriety, or, if you choose
to call it, congruity, in the literal sense, as well as a dis-
tinct meaning or sentiment suggested, which is called the
figurative sense. Examples of this are unnecessary. Again,
where the figurative sense is unexceptionable, there is
sometimes an incongruity in the expression of the literal
sense. This is always the case in mixed metaphor, a thing
not unfrequent even in good writers. Thus, when Ad-
dison remarks that there is not a single view of human
nature, which is not sufficient to extinguish the seeds of
pride,' he expresses a true sentiment somewhat incongru-
ously; for the terms extinguish and seeds here meta-
phorically used, do not suit each other. In like manner,
there is something incongruous in the mixture of tropes
employed in the following passage from Lord Bolingbroke:
'Nothing less than the hearts of his people will content a

APPENDIX.
377
patriot Prince, nor will he think his throne established, till
it is established there.' Yet the thought is excellent.
But in neither of these examples does the incongruity of
the expression hurt the perspicuity of the sentence. Some-
times, indeed, the literal meaning involves a direct ab-
surdity. When this is the case, as in the quotation from
The Principles of Painting given in the preceding chapter,
it is natural for the reader to suppose that there must be
something under it; for it is not easy to say how absurdly
even just sentiments will sometimes be expressed. But
when no such hidden sense can be discovered, what, in the
first view conveyed to our minds a glaring absurdity, is
rightly on reflection denominated nonsense. We are satis-
fied that De Piles neither thought, nor wanted his readers
to think, that Rubens was really the original performer,
and God the copier. This then was not his meaning.
But what he actually thought and wanted them to think,
it is impossible to elicit from his words. His words then
may justly be styled bold, in respect of their literal im-
port, but unmeaning in respect of the author's intention.
6
"It may be proper here to observe, that some are apt
to confound the terms absurdity and nonsense as synony-
mous; which they manifestly are not.
An absurdity, in
the strict acceptation, is a proposition either intuitively or
demonstratively false. Of this kind are these: Three
and two make seven.' All the angles of a triangle are
greater than two right angles.' That the former is false
we know by intuition; that the latter is so, we are able to
demonstrate. But the term is further extended to denote
a notorious falsehood. If one should affirm, that at the
vernal equinox the sun rises in the north and sets in the
south,' we should not hesitate to say, that he advances an
absurdity; but still what he affirms has a meaning; inso-

much, that on hearing the sentence we pronounce its
falsity. Now nonsense is that whereof we cannot say
either that it is true, or that it is false. Thus, when the
Teutonic Theosopher enounces, that all the voices of the
celestial joyfulness, qualify, commix, and harmonize in the
fire which was from eternity in the good quality,' I should
think it equally impertinent to aver the falsity as the truth
of this enunciation. For, though the words grammatically
form a sentence, they exhibit to the understanding no
judgment, and consequently admit neither assent nor dis-
sent. In the former instances I say the meaning, or what
they affirm, is absurd; in the last instance I say there is
no meaning, and therefore properly nothing is affirmed.
In popular language, I own, the terms absurdity and non-
sense are not so accurately distinguished. Absurd posi-
tions are sometimes called nonsensical. It is not common,
on the other hand, to say of downright nonsense, that it
comprises an absurdity.
"Further, in the literal sense there may be nothing
unsuitable, and yet the reader may be at a loss to find a
figurative meaning, to which his expressions can with
justice be applied. Writers immoderately attached to the
florid, or highly figured diction, are often misled by a
desire of flourishing on the several attributes of a metaphor,
which they have pompously ushered into the discourse,
without taking the trouble to examine whether there be
any qualities in the subject, to which these attributes can
with justice and perspicuity be applied. This immo-
derate use of metaphor," Dr. Campbell observes," is the
principal source of all the nonsense of Orators and Poets.
"The second species of writing wherein we are liable
to be imposed on by words without meaning, is that
wherein the terms most frequently occurring, denote

379
things which are of a complicated nature, and to which
the mind is not sufficiently familiarized. Many of those
notions which are called by Philosophers mixed modes,
come under this denomination. Of these the instances
are numerous in every tongue; such as government,
church, state, constitution, polity, power, commerce, legis-
lature, jurisdiction, proportion, symmetry, elegance. It
will considerably increase the danger of our being de-
ceived by an unmeaning use of such terms, if they are
besides, (as very often they are,) of so indeterminate, and
consequently equivocal significations, that a writer, unob-
served either by himself or by his reader, may slide from
one sense of the term to another, till by degrees he fall
into such applications of it as will make no sense at all.
It deserves our notice also, that we are in much greater
danger of terminating in this, if the different meanings of
the same word have some affinity to one another, than if
they have none. In the latter case, when there is no
affinity, the transition from one meaning to another is
taking a very wide step, and what few writers are in any
danger of; it is, besides, what will not so readily escape
the observation of the reader. So much for the second
cause of deception, which is the chief source of all the
nonsense of writers on politics and criticism.
“The third and last, and, I may add, the principal
species of composition, wherein we are exposed to this
illusion by the abuse of words, is that in which the terms
employed are very abstract, and consequently of very
extensive signification. It is an observation that plainly
ariseth from the nature and structure of language, and
may be deduced as a corollary from what hath been said
of the use of artificial signs, that the more general any
name is, as it comprehends the more individuals under it,

and consequently requires the more extensive knowledge
in the mind that would rightly apprehend it, the more it
must have of indistinctness and obscurity. Thus the word
lion is more distinctly apprehended by the mind than the
word beast, beast than animal, animal than being. But
there is, in what are called abstract subjects, a still greater
fund of obscurity, than that arising from the frequent
mention of the most general terms. Names must be as-
signed to those qualities as considered abstractly, which
never subsist independently, or by themselves, but which
constitute the generic characters and the specific differences
of things. And this leads to a manner which is in many
instances remote from the common use of speech, and
therefore must be of more difficult conception." (Book ii.
sec. 2. p. 102, 103.)
It is truly to be regretted that an author who has
written so justly on this subject, should within a few
pages so strikingly exemplify the errrors he has been treat-
ing of, by indulging in a declamation against Logic, which
could not even to himself have conveyed any distinct
meaning. When he says that a man who had learned
Logic was “qualified, without any other kind of know-
ledge, to defend any position whatever, however contra-
dictory to common sense;" and that "that art observed the
most absolute indifference to truth and error," he cannot
mean that a false conclusion could be logically proved
from true premises; since, ignorant as he was of the
subject, he was aware, and has in another place distinctly
acknowledged, that this is not the case; nor could he
mean merely that a false conclusion could be proved from
a false premiss, since that would evidently be a nugatory
and ridiculous objection. He seems to have had, in truth,
no meaning at all; though, like the authors he had been

so ably criticising, he was perfectly unaware of the empti-
ness of what he was saying.

"Moses stretched forth his hand, and the waters were
divided, and became a wall unto the children of Israel, on
the right hand and on the left. Moses smote the rock
with his rod, and the waters flowed withal, and the chil-
dren of Israel were refreshed in the wilderness, and were
saved from death. But what was there in the arm of
Moses, that the sea should obey it and stand still? Or
what in the rod of Moses, that it should turn the flinty
rock into a living fountain? Let me freely, though reye-
rently, speak to you of the patriarch Moses. He was
indeed great, because he was indeed good, in his genera-
tion. But except in the matter of his goodness-except
in his superior faith and trust in his Maker-except in his
more ready obedience to the holy desires which the spirit
of the Lord inspired into his soul, he was no more than
the rest of the Israelites, and the rest of men. Like them,
like us, like every human being that is born of woman, he
was compassed with infirmities, and tried with afflictions,
and subject to terror, and surrounded with sorrow.
himself he was able to do nothing, but all the mighty acts
which he did, he did because "it was God which worked
in him both to will and to do of his good pleasure,” and
because Moses did not resist the will of God, or neglect or
abuse the power with which he was endued. If to the
Jew God was very liberal, we have the promise of his
beloved Son, that to Christians, in all spiritual and neces-
sary things, he will be still more so. Over the world
without us he will perhaps give us no power-because we

upon to save ourselves, and he will give us a power over
the rebellious world that is within us. Stretch forth but
your hands in faith and sincerity to God, and surely he
will separate between you and your lusts. He will divide
the tumultuous sea of your passions, and open for you a
way to escape from your enemies into the land of eternity.
He will cause the waves thereof to stand still and harmless
on your right hand and on your left, and make you to
walk in safety and unhurt through the overflowings of
ungodliness, which, without his controlling arm, would
have drowned your souls in perdition and destruction.
Be ye never so faint and weary in the wilderness of sin,

you with the living waters of the comfort of the Spirit,

"In the latter part of the first period, but confess
them with an humble lowly penitent and obedient heart,
to the end that we may obtain, forgiveness of the same,
by his infinite goodness and mercy,' there are several faults
committed. In the first place, the four epithets preceding
the word 'heart,' are huddled together, and pronounced
in a monotone, disagreeable to the ear, and enervating to
the sense; whereas each word rising in force above the
other, ought to be marked by a proportional rising of the
notes in the voice; and, in the last, there should be such
a note used as would declare it at the same time to be the
last-with an humble' lowly' penitent and obedient heart,'
&c. At first view it may appear, that the words 'humble'
and lowly,' are synonymous; but the word lowly,' cer-
tainly implies a greater degree of humiliation than the
word humble.' The word 'penitent' that follows, is of
stronger import than either; and the word obedient,'
signifying a perfect resignation to the will of God, in con-
sequence of our humiliation and repentance, furnishes the
climax. But if the climax in the words be not accom-
panied by a suitable climax in the notes of the voice, it
cannot be made manifest. In the following part of the
sentence, to the end that we may obtaìn' forgiveness of
the same" there are usually three emphases laid on the
words, end, obtain, same, where there should not be any,
and the only emphatic word, forgiveness, is slightly passed
over; whereas it should be read to the end that we

may obtain forgiveness of the same,' keeping the words,
obtain, and forgiveness, closely together, and not disuniting
them, both to the prejudice of the Sense and Cadence,
&c. &c.
"I shall now read the whole, in the manner I have re-
commended; and if you will give attention to the marks,
you will be reminded of the manner, when you come to

The generality of the remarks respecting the way in
which each passage of the Liturgy should be read, are
correct; though the mode recommended for attaining the
proposed end is totally different from what is suggested in
the present treatise. In some points, however, the author
is mistaken as to the emphatic words: e. g. in the Lord's
Prayer, he directs the following' passage to be read thus;
"thy will be done' on earth' as it is' in Heaven," with
CC

the emphasis on the words "be" and "is;" these, how-
ever, are not the emphatic words, and do not even exist,
in the original Greek, but are supplied by the translator;
the latter of them might, indeed, be omitted altogether
without any detriment to the sense; "thy will be done, as
in Heaven, so also on earth," which is a more literal trans-
lation, is perfectly intelligible. A passage in the second
Commandment again, he directs to be read, according
indeed to the usual mode, both of reading and pointing
it," visit the sins of the fathers' upon the children' unto
the third and fourth generation of them that hate me;"
which mode of reading destroys the sense, by making a
pause at "children," and none at "generation;" for this
implies that the third and fourth generations, who suffer
these judgments, are themselves such as hate the Lord,
instead of being merely, as is meant to be expressed, the
children of such; "of them that hate me," is a genitive
not governed by "generation," but by "children:" it
should be read (according to Sheridan's marks) “visit the
sins of the fathers' upon the children unto the third and
fourth generation' of them that hate me:" i. e. " visit the
sins of the fathers who hate me, upon the third and fourth
generations of their descendants." The same sanction is
given to an equally common fault in reading the fifth
Commandment; "that thy days' may be long in the land'
which the Lord thy God giveth thee:" the pause should
evidently be at " long,” not at “land." No one would say
in ordinary conversation, " I hope you will find enjoyment
in the garden'—which you have planted." He has also
strangely omitted an emphasis on the word "covet," in
the tenth Commandment. He has, however, in the nega-
tive or prohibitory commands avoided the common fault
of accenting the word "not." And here it may be worth

387
while to remark, that in some cases the Copula ought to
be made the emphatic word; (i. e. the " is," if the proposi-
tion be affirmative, the “not,” if negative ;) viz. where the
proposition may be considered as in opposition to its con-
tradictory. If, e. g. it had been a question, whether we
ought to steal or not, the commandment, in answer to
that, would have been rightly pronounced, "thou shalt
not steal:" but the question being, what things we are
forbidden to do, the answer is, that "to steal" is one of
them," thou shalt not steal." In such a case as this, the
proposition is considered as opposed, not to its contra-
dictory, but to one with a different Predicate: the ques-
tion being, not, which Copula (negative or affirmative)
shall be employed, but what shall be affirmed or denied of
the subject: e. g. "it is lawful to beg; but not to steal:"
in such a case, the Predicate will be the emphatic word,
not the Copula.
One fault worth noticing on account of its commonness
is the placing of the emphasis on "neighbour in the ninth
and tenth Commandments; as if there might be some
persons precluded from the benefit of the prohibitions.
One would think the man to whom our Lord addressed
the parable of the good Samaritan, had been used to this
mode of delivery, by his asking "and who is my neigh-
bour."
The usual pronunciation of one part of the "Apostles'
Creed" is probably founded on some misapprehension of
the sense of it': "The holy Catholic Church, the Com-
munion of Saints," is commonly read as if these were two
distinct articles; instead of the latter clause being merely
an explanation of the former: "The holy Catholic
Church, [viz.] the Communion of Saints."
