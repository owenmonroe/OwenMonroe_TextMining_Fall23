PREFACE.
This book is presented to the public in obedience to
that trite commercial maxim, "The demand will sum-
mon the supply."
The need of better readers and speakers was never
more urgent than now.
Deficiency in expressive reading and effective speak-
ing has been observed and deplored for years.
Au impression has prevailed that clear, strong sense
reading is a natural endowment, and therefore unat-
tainable by those not favored by nature. This im-
pression is strengthened by the fact that the daily
study of readers, arithmetics, geographies, grammars,
etc., by our youth,- all requiring the exercise of
reading, — gives them but little skill in rendering the
thoughts contained on the printed page. Let it be
remembered, however, that the energy of this daily
exercise, from the Primary department upward, is ex-
pended upon the mere naming of words, with little or
no expression of their related significance; that the
teacher, in most cases, is the text-book, and that few
text-books go far beyond rules for inflection, emphasis
and pauses.
A similar idea regarding writing formerly had many

advocates. Commercial Colleges have effectually ex-
ploded this theory by proving that rapid, easy, grace-
ful writing is the result of skillful instruction, based
upon a well defined method, and that it is attainable
by all who are capable of receiving rational instruction.
Within the last ten years schools of oratory and
many institutions of less pretentious title have demon-
strated the assertion that, "Good reading is attain-
able by the masses.
22
The experience of the author with boys and girls
shows that by the same method of instruction employed
by professional readers, children are capable of be-
coming good readers in a shorter time than adults.
The question now arises, "How can these methods
be so presented in text-books that the untrained
teacher can secure the desired results."
In the preparation of the present volume this ques-
tion has constantly appeared at the head of each page.
How far it has been answered will appear from a con-
sideration of the following statements :
――――
1. The act of reading aloud depends, first, upon a
copious supply of breath under the control of the will;
and, second, upon a clear, pleasant and decided articu-
lation, the process of which appears to be no part of
the reader's concern. To secure these requisites, ex-
ercises have been imposed that render progress in
pages impossible till principles are mastered.
2. The exercise of reading is a continued applica-
tion of the laws of logic; therefore, the first step in
securing intelligible reading is to lead the pupil to dis-

cover that every thought, sentiment, passion and
emotion has its peculiar method of manifestion, re-
quiring the employment of appropriate Quality, Force,
Stress, Pitch, Movement, Slides, Pauses and Group-
ing. This principle is the science of expression; its
application is the art of reading. To aid the pupil
in mastering both this science and art, illustrations in
nature are cited, concise directions are given and
numerous examples from representative writers are
introduced. These selections illustrate nearly every
human idea; and their thorough study and frequent
reading, with the aid of the appended KEY, will ac-
complish more than the unguided perusal of many
volumes of miscellaneous reading matter.
3. Finally, to read with that effectiveness which
shall convey to the hearers fully and clearly the mean-
ing of an author requires absolute command of those
elements of expression which are peculiarly adapted to
the thought to be expressed. A knowledge of these
elements, and facility in their correct use is attained
by simple definition and appropriate exercises.
4. Part IV. is devoted to Action. It is intended
as a guide in securing a more healthful and graceful
position in reading, and in cultivating a correct taste
in the application of gesture to public speaking. The
subject is philosophically developed by referring the
learner to nature for the reason of every action em-
ployed in the illustration of thought.
5. Part V. seeks to develop intelligent reading by the
perception and conception of the thought through a

rigid analysis of the sentence, termed Grouping. The
process involves good taste and judgment, is an in-
valuable literary drill, and is not beyond the capacity
of the average grammar school pupil.
This book is designed to be supplementary to the
Fourth and Fifth Readers. It may be used advanta-
geously instead of the latter.
That "Common School Elocution" may contribute
something towards elevating the art of reading from
the mechanical process of word naming to its highest
logical and intellectual development, is the sincere
wish of the
AUTHOR.
AUGUST 5, 1882.
PREFACE TO REVISED EDITION.
Acting upon the solicited hints of more than a
hundred teachers now using the "Common School
Elocution," many new features have been inserted in
the body of this work, and a Part VI., devoted to
Original Discourse and Extemporaneous Speech, has
been added, thus supplying a very general want among
students preparing for public life.

COMMON SCHOOL
ELOCUTION AND ORATORY.
INTRODUCTION-GENERAL OUTLINE.
1. ELOCUTION.
1. ELOCUTION (from e, out, and loqui, to speak)
is the expression of feeling and thought by means of
the voice.
2. As now applied by elocutionists, it includes the
science and art of conveying thought by all the organs
of the body, in an easy, graceful, and forcible manner.
3. Its study and systematic practice, based upon
principles of nature, make the voice clear, strong,
flexible, and melodious; and give the body and limbs
a pliancy and harmony of motion that render the
position and action of the speaker or reader at once
graceful and natural.
4. The complete mastery of its principles enables
the speaker not only to express his thoughts clearly
and easily, but to so vivify and illuminate those
thoughts that his hearers see, hear, and feel the
unquestioned truth of his argument.
5. The gift of reason to the human race derives its
value from the gift of speech; but the speech of nature
(1)


## p. 2 (#28) ###############################################

COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
is so trammeled by habit and corrupted by associations,
that the promptings of our God-nature, as revealed
in speech, are practically ignored. Nature, in most
cases, means habit, and has been very properly desig-
nated, "second nature."
6. Elocution calls into action the most vital organs
of the body, in a manner, too, that stimulates them to
their most exalted capabilities and consequent develop-
ment; hence, the importance of studying it in youth.
7. A single sentence may be the exponent of years
of study and experience, as in the case of Sheridan;
but its utterance with the astounding effect peculiar to
that great master of oratory, comes only with the most
careful practice.
8. Correct elocutionary training has for its object
the complete subordination of the physical being to the
service of the mind and spirit, thought being the pro-
duct of the inner spiritual man, and speech and gesture
its natural outlet through the exterior or physical
man.
2. Requirements of Good Elocution.
1. A full and free respiration ;
2. A correct and distinct articulation;
3. A thorough knowledge and perfect control of all
the elements of vocal expression;
4. Complete control of every muscle of the face,
hands, feet, and body;
5. A thorough understanding of the thought to be
expressed.
6. Perfect self-possession.

3. Division of the subject.
These six requisites divide the subject of elocution
naturally into six parts, which are designated as fol-
lows:
PART I. Respiration.
PART II. Articulation.
PART III. Elements of Vocal Expression.
PART IV. Action.
PART V. Grouping.
PART VI. Original Discourse.
"
THE READER'S POSITION.
Book in the left hand, thumb
and little finger in front, first,
second and third fingers at the
back of the book; the elbow
not touching the side. The
book should be held in such a
manner that a line drawn from
the eyes toward the page would
intersect the plane of the book
at right angles. The full face
of the pupil should be seen
by the teacher. The weight
of the body should be sup-
ported, while reading, on both
feet, the left heel two or three
inches in advance of the hollow
of the right foot. The chest
should be elevated and ex-
panded, the position erect and
easy.

COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
4. SUGGESTIVE HINTS TO TEACHERS,
1. Whatever indifference or languor the pupil ex-
hibits in other exercises, no feeble effort is to be toler-
ated in elocution. Require a constant and vigorous
mental and bodily activity, or excuse the laggard from
participation.
2. The exercise should be performed according to
the text, mastering each principle as it is presented.
When the book is completed review the examples
whose elements are given in the key, with all accom-
panying requisites to secure the most effective expres-
sion possible.
3. The exercises in Respiration are not only benefi-
cial in the cultivation of voice power, but are healthful
and invigorating, and should not be abridged.
4. The mere pronunciation of the words in articula-
tion will not repay the time occupied in the act. The
elements must be accurately and vigorously uttered
alone each articulated with that incisive energy that
implies a finality.
5. The questions placed at the close of certain topics
are not to be asked by the teacher, but should be used
in the following manner: each pupil rises as called,
and, holding the book open, reads and answers as
many questions as the teacher may assign to him.
6. READ THE LESSON OCCASIONALLY FOR THE CLASS.
Group the words of a paragraph or an entire selection;
read each group separately, stopping for the class to
repeat it with appropriate expression.
――


## p. 5 (#31) ###############################################

SUGGESTIVE HINTS TO TEACHERS.

7. The selections are admirably adapted for declama-
tion, and if used as such, after their component ele-
ments of expression are mastered, they will lay the
foundation of an effective oratorical power.
8. The process of Grouping can be profitably used
as a syntactical and rhetorical drill. As a blackboard
exercise, permitting class criticism, it will be very in-
teresting and valuable.
9. No amount of instruction will compensate for a
meagre drill. The highest excellence in reading or
speaking requires the same conditions as music, paint-
ing, and poetry, Practice, Practice, PRACTICE.

PART I.
5. RESPIRATION.
1. RESPIRATION, or breathing, is the act of taking
air into the lungs and expelling it from them.
2. Voice is dependent upon a proper and sufficient
supply of air for its purity, power, and flexibility;
hence, habits of correct breathing should be acquired
early and adhered to faithfully.
3. The organs concerned in respiration are, the
Diaphragm, Abdominal Muscles, Thoracic (chest)
Muscles, Larynx (Adam's Apple), the Trachea (wind-
pipe), the Bronchia (branches of the windpipe), and
the Lungs. These should be kept in a healthy condi-
tion by judicious use and frequent practice. They are
capable of being subjected to the will to such an ex-
tent that respiration is said to be suspended by the
pearl fishers of India from three to four minutes.
―
NOTE. The longer a reader can hold his breath the more effec-
tive will be his delivery of those complex sentences that become al-
most meaningless if broken by spasmodic gaspings for breath.

upon the organ in action. Estimate each day your
improvement upon the previous accomplishments.
5. Bear in mind that as voice is dependent upon a
copious supply of air, under the control of the will, so
effective breathing is dependent upon pure blood,
which, in turn, owes its existence to proper and suffi-
cent food and physical exercise.
6. As a reward for your faithful practice of these ex-
ercises in respiration, you are promised an increased
activity and buoyancy of spirits, a command of voice
that will be pleasing to your friends, and above all, a
vigor of mind and body that can accompany only. per-
fect health.
6. Position of the Body.
Stand erect, without constraint, with one foot slightly
in advance of the other, with the body mainly sup-
ported by the rear foot. Throw the shoulders backward
and downward. Project the chest as fully as may be
without a sense of effort. Keep the mouth shut unless
directed otherwise. In this connection, the pupil is
reminded that the mouth should be kept closed at all
times when not in actual use. Breathing must be per-
formed through the nostrils, and not through the
mouth.

muscles. Take a full breath, forcing the abdominal
muscles outward, then let the muscles sink in as the
breath comes out. Hold the shoulders firm.
2. CHEST BREATHING. Relax the muscles of the
chest. Take a full breath, and expand the chest to its
full capacity. Exhale slowly; direct the thoughts to
the object to be accomplished in this, as in all other
exercises.
3. DORSAL (BACK) BREATHING. Place the fingers
at the back of the dorsal muscles, and thumbs on the
sides. Take a full breath, trying to expand the mus-
cles under your fingers as much as possible. Exhale
slowly and evenly. This method of breathing is par-
ticularly healthful, and care should be taken to dress
so that its free action be not impeded.
4. COSTAL (RIB) BREATHING.
Place the fingers
on the costal muscles and the thumbs at the back.
Take a full breath, distending the muscles of the ribs
as much as possible. In exhaling, let the sides sink
in to their full extent.
5. WAIST BREATHING. With hands hanging by the
sides inhale with a view of distending the entire circle
of the waist. Let the breathing be full and deep.
6. HOLDING THE BREATH. A valuable exercise for
controlling the breathing is to practice the “Waist
Breathing" method for a few seconds, until the muscles
employed are under the control of the will, and then
observe, by noticing the second-hand of a watch, how
long you can hold your breath.
7. EFFUSIVE BREATHING. Inhale naturally, filling

the lungs, then exhale through the mouth gently and
gradually in the sound of the letter h, giving out only
sufficient breath to keep the sound audible.
8. EXPULSIVE BREATHING. Inhale as before, and
expel the air forcibly but gradually through the mouth
in the sound of the letter h.
9. EXPLOSIVE BREATHING. Inhale as before to your
utmost capacity, and send forth the breath from the
mouth as suddenly as possible in the sound of the
letter h.
SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS.
1. Of the foregoing exercises, the Abdominal Method
is the most important.
2. Keep the chest expanded at all times; be careful
not to elevate the shoulders.
3. Breathe fully and vigorously pure air; this will
give you increased mental energy and activity.
4. The abdominal walls should be supported by the
abdominal muscles.
5. Permit no air to enter the mouth; inhale through
the nostrils. Gaping and yawning result from imper-
fect respiration; attention to proper breathing for a
few months will dispense with their necessity.
6. Do not read or speak when the lungs are exhausted.
7. Waste no breath; use a pure tone quality. [See
46.7
8. Acquire such control of respiration that you can
utter three hundred syllables without taking breath.
TEST: Read the 1st and 2nd paragraphs of "Two
BOOT-BLACKS," or all of No. 11, page 52, in one breath.

MISCELLANEOUS RESPIRATORY EXERCISES.
1. The following breathing exercises are designed, in
connection with appropriate calisthenics and gesture,
to develop a strong, vigorous physique, intellectual
activity, and command of voice, and to protect the
student from lung and throat diseases.
2. To secure the greatest benefit from their practice
they should receive constant attention. In order that
the student may practice some method at all times.
without interference with other duties, they are made
to embrace the utmost variety of forms of respiration.
He who aspires to the greatest command of his natural
powers should attend to all.
3. Stand erect; expand and project the chest; do
not elevate the shoulders; inhale through the nostrils.
This position is termed active chest; maintain it in
standing, walking, and sitting.
4. When walking assume the active chest. Hold the
shoulders firm. Imagine yourself drawn forward by
some unseen power with a cord about your waist.
5. When you retire lie upon your back, slightly
project the chest, tightly compress the lips, inhale
deeply and evenly until you fall asleep. This practice
will in a few weeks become a habit, and as a result
of its observance you will sleep soundly and awake
refreshed, without the unpleasant taste so common to
mouth breathers and snorers.
6. Select any composition with many long and
involved sentences, and endeavor to read it without

permitting any air to enter the mouth, inhaling always
through the nostrils.
7. Take a full breath and vocally prolong the syl-
lable ah, at first ten seconds, and gradually increase
the time until you can continue the sound sixty seconds
without discomfort or a perceptible tremor of voice
8. Assume active chest. Inhale and exhale a number
of times as in abdominal breathing, after which repeat
the alphabet, distinctly pronouncing each letter, as
many times as you can without taking breath. Prac-
tice will enable you to repeat the alphabet from eight
to ten times with a single breath.
9. Repeat the vowels ă ĕ ĭ ŏ ŭ in rapid succession
as many times as you can in one breath, keeping
count by marking with a pencil. In addition to the
respiratory benefit accruing from this exercise it gives
command of the Radical Stress (page 112), an accom-
plishment of great importance to the speaker.
10. Assume the active chest. Inhale and exhale vig-
orously for a few minutes, then laugh out explosively
the syllables ha ha ha! Continue the exercise from
twenty to thirty seconds without taking breath.
11. No medicated tonic is equal to copious inhala-
tions of pure air. Upon going into the fresh air after
rising from sleep, never fail to engage in a vigorous
respiratory exercise, including all forms of breathing.
When opportunity is afforded add the whole arm
movement on page 240, or any other muscular motion
permitting rhythmic execution.

PART II.
8. ARTICULATION.
1. ARTICULATION is the utterance of the elementary
sounds of a language by the proper organs of speech.
2. A distinct and ready articulation is not natural
to all, and can be acquired only by frequent and long-
continued drill upon elementary sounds, either alone
or in combination. No elocutionary exercise should
be ended without devoting some portion of it to the
development of a clear, sharp-cut and decided articu-
lation.
3. An elementary sound is a sound produced by a
single impulse of the voice.
4. The organs employed in the production of ele-
mentary sounds are, the Lips, Teeth, Tongue, Palate
and Nasal organs, assisted by the respiratory organs.
5. Vocals, or Tonics, consist of tone unmodified by
the organs of speech.
6. Subvocals are tones produced by the voice [See
Art. 39.] and speech organs combined.
7. Aspirates are mere breathings modified by the
organs of speech.
8. Vowels must be distinguished from vocals.
Sounds are divided into vocals, subvocals and aspir-

17. Exercises in Articulation.
1. No single subject taught in connection with elo-
cution and reading is of greater importance than artic-
ulation; and yet, the exercises prepared for drill are
usually regarded so irksome and profitless as to receive
but little attention at the hands of the instructor and
pupil. This neglect is due, first, to a want of appre-
ciation of the great benefit derived from a persistent
and intelligent use of the tables, and second, to a want
of method in conducting the exercise.
2. To furnish a method that will prove interesting
and productive of desirable results, the following sug-
gestion is given; and those who aspire to a clear, easy,
and pleasant delivery are urged to follow it.
3. Instead of merely pronouncing the element and
word designed for practice in a spiritless, feeble man-
ner, spell by sound the entire word distinctly and with
force sufficient to fill a large room. In this manner
conduct every exercise in articulation; and by the
time the prescribed exercises are completed you will
have attained an enviable skill in distinctness of utter-
ance.
4. To this suggestion may be added the hint that
every exercise in conversation and reading should be
made an exercise in articulation.
5. Stand erect, keep the head up, the eyes to the
front, the chest expanded, the shoulders thrown back,
and your mind upon what you are doing.

NOTE. Read the following with the greatest rapidity of move-

TWO BOOT-BLACKS.
1.
A day or two ago, during a lull in business, two little
boot-blacks, one white and one black, were standing at the
corners doing nothing, when the white boot-black agreed to
black the black boot-black's boots. The black boot-black
was of course willing to have his boots blacked by his fellow
boot-black, and the boot-black who had agreed to black the
black boot-black's boots went to work.
When the boot-black had blacked one of the black boot-
black's boots till it shone in a manner that would make any
boot-black proud, this boot-black who had agreed to black
the black boot-black's boots refused to black the other boot
of the black boot-black until the black boot-black, who had
consented to have the white boot-black black his boots,
should add five cents to the amount the white boot-black

had made blacking other men's boots. This the boot-black
whose boot had been blacked refused to do, saying it was
good enough for a black boot-black to have one boot blacked,
and he didn't care whether the boot that the boot-black
hadn't blacked was blacked or not.
This made the boot-black who had blacked the black boot-
black's boot as angry as a boot-black often gets, and he
vented his black wrath by spitting upon the blacked boot
of the black boot-black. This roused the latent passions of
the black boot-black, and he proceeded to boot the white
boot-black with the boot which the white boot-black had
blacked. A fight ensued, in which the white boot-black who
had refused to black the unblacked boot of the black boot-
black, blacked the black boot-black's visionary organ, and
in which the black boot-black wore all the blacking off his
blacked boot in booting the white boot-black.

frequent drill upon them is essential to secure their
correct pronunciation. Their notation is omitted, that
the pupil may be required to avail himself of the dic-

pronunciation. Every word should be looked up in
the dictionary. It must not be assumed that the pu-
pil can pronounce them correctly because they are
familiar. Nothing makes a reader or speaker, who has
some pretensions as such, more ridiculous than faulty
pronunciation:

PART III.
34. VOCAL EXPRESSION.
1. We come now to the third requisite of good elo-
cution, the elements of vocal expression.
2. Respiration is essential to the production of voice,
and a distinct and correct articulation must be acquired
to render the vocal utterance in the least degree intel-
ligible; but, in addition to these, the speaker who
would convey to his hearers in colors of living light,

QUALITY, FORCE, STRESS, PITCH, MOVEMENT, QUAN-
TITY, SLIDES, WAVES, MELODY, SLUR, EMPHASIS,
PAUSES, CADENCE, CLIMAX, ANTI-CLIMAX.
36. ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS.
1. The first five of these, viz., Quality, Force, Stress,
Pitch and Movement, are called ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS,
or ATTRIBUTES, because they are found in the utter-
ance of every sentence. The other elements are
(27)

termed ACCIDENTAL ELEMENTS, or ACCIDENTS, because
they may or may not exist in any given sentence.
2. A knowledge of these elements and their applica-
tion, according to the unvarying laws of nature,
is necessary to the orator and reader who would
correctly portray the thoughts and passions that ani-
mate the human soul.
3. Their importance is shown in the fact that we
are instinctively attracted or repelled by their use
while in conversation with another. The animals un-
derstand their significance though the words we utter
be in a language before unheard.
4. A knowledge of their use and value is not con-
fined to the public speaker. Their influence in our daily
and business intercourse is of the utmost importance.
5. THE TEACHER in the school-room, whose tones
are shrill, nasal, throaty or husky, and whose pitch is
high, piercing the ears of his pupils, as if probing for
attention, may make himself heard; but the "ways of
wisdom through his instrumentality will not be ways
of pleasantness," nor will his pupils get far on the
way.
6. THE SALESMAN behind the counter, whose tones
are loud and swelling while extolling the merits of his
goods, may convince customers of his ox-driving qual-
ifications and by-standers of his egotism; but he will
not sell as many goods as he who understands when
and how to use his voice.

highest pitch, and continues to pour into the ears of a

jury the piping tones of an unvarying monotone, may
satisfy himself of his capacious lung power; but the
weary jury will sigh with relief when he ceases, and
will punish his attack upon their nervous system by
giving his opponent the benefit of all doubts.
8. THE MOTHER, ignorant of the far-reaching influ-
ence of those soft, sweet, melodious tones that in after
years impart the sanctity of heaven to the recollec-
tions of childhood, may enforce a temporary obedience
to her will by that sharp, piercing command which
startles the youthful loiterer from his reveries; but
the abiding influence of her motherly counsel that
should follow the man through temptation and trial in
later life is lost by this ignorance.
9. A KNOWLEDGE of the effect of these elements
upon the hearer is indispensable to all who aspire to
success in life; hence, the importance of acquiring a
knowledge of their correct application, and the ability
to use them readily and impressively.
37. The Vocal Apparatus.
It is not within the scope of the present work to
give a minute description of the organs concerned in
producing voice, nor of their mechanical movements in
the modifications of the various elements of vocal ex-
pression. While a knowledge of their anatomy, physi-
ology, and hygiene is desirable in the professional
elocutionist, it is not essential to excellence in vocal
expression. For the benefit of those who desire to
qualify themselves in the work beyond the limits of
this Manual, the organs are named and defined, so that

30
COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
they may be studied from works prepared for that pur-
pose.
38. The Voice Organs
May be divided into two classes: First, those which
act in the production of sound; and, second, those used
to modify the sound in articulated speech.
39. The Voice-Producing Organs are:
1. The Abdominal and Thoracic Muscles, which as-
sist the motion of the diaphragm, and give greater
capacity to the chest.
2. The DIAPHRAGM, the partition which separates
the abdomen from the chest.
3. The THORAX, the cavity of the chest, with its
muscles. Its capacity determines the voice power.
4. The PLEURA, the envelope of the lungs, acts in
connection with the diaphragm.
5. The LUNGS. They serve as a bellows for supply-
ing the air, which, passing through the larynx, is con-
verted into sound.
6. The TRACHEA, or windpipe, is the tube through
which the air passes from the lungs into the larynx.
7. The LARYNX, (Adam's Apple) is the immediate
instrument of vocal sound.
40. The Voice-Modifying or Speech Organs are:—
1. The LARYNX, which belongs to both classes.
2. The PHARYNX (swallow), the cavity behind the
larynx, extending up behind the veil of the palate.
Its size determines the fullness and richness of the
voice,


## p. 31 (#57) ##############################################

THE VOICE MODIFYING ORGANS.
31
3. The NASAL PASSAGES, which open into the
pharynx. These passages lying behind the external
orifices of the nose, with the pharynx form part of the
resonance chamber of the voice apparatus.
NOTE. The term "resonance," as used in elocution, implies the
place from which the vocal sound appears to come. It is the dis-
tinctive characteristic of Quality of Voice.
4. The CAVITY OF THE MOUTH, including the palate.
This is the space covered by the roof of the mouth,
which extends from the upper front teeth to the thin
veil separating the mouth from the pharynx.
5. The INTERNAL TUBES OF THE EARS, tubes starting
from each side of the root of the tongue and communi-
cating with the ears.
6. The TONGUE.
7. The TEETH, which materially aid in giving dis-
tinctness to articulation.
8. The LIPS.
VOICE CULTURE AND MANAGEMENT.
1. The highest skill in speech is attained only by a
perfect control of the voice and speech organs.
2. The first requisite in securing great vocal power
is an erect and easy posture of the body, giving
expansiveness to the chest and freedom to the limbs,
and that absolute command of breath which will enable
the reader to utter one hundred or more syllables in a
single breath.
3. Huskiness, harshness, and hardness of tone result
from the contact of inhaled air during vocal exercise


## p. 32 (#58) ##############################################

32
COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
with the lining mucous membrane of the speech organs;
hence, in the process of utterance no air whatever
should enter the mouth.
4. The nasal passages should be kept constantly
open. Proper breathing and cleanliness will secure
this condition.
5. Fullness, depth, and richness of tone are so
largely dependent upon the control of the tongue,
throat, and jaw muscles that constant attention should
be given to the free action of these muscles.
6. To render words most easily understood by those
remote from the speaker, the mouth should be opened
freely and fully, and should not be closed too suddenly
in finishing syllables.
7. During reading and speaking care should be exer-
cised to avoid a continued pitch too high, too low, or a
monotone. The last reacts upon the speaker, ren-
dering his delivery dull and lifeless; a pitch too low
usually prevents understanding the words; while a
prolonged high pitch exhausts the speaker and wearies
an audience beyond its capacity of enjoyment. The
pitch should follow the general law of thought devel-
opment — curves, slides, and waves - few planes.
8. To prevent embarrassment arising from nervous-
ness, inhale and exhale to your utmost capacity a
number of times before attempting to use the voice in
public. The same precaution will materially prevent
incoherency, stuttering and stammering in extempora-
neous speech.

9. To command the greatest physical power and
intellectual vigor and buoyancy of spirit, stand erect
with active chest, and inhale fully and deeply-
always through the nostrils - never through the
mouth.
41. QUALITY OF VOICE.
1. The quality of the voice is the nature, character,
or kind of tone used.
43. Normal Qualities.
2. Different qualities arise from the ever-changing
sentiment that animates the human mind and the varied
physical conditions to which the body is constantly
subjected. By careful culture these qualities may be
secured by all, and they are indispensable in giving
expression to the varied emotions and passions. No
one need hope for excellence in reading or speaking
who cannot attune his voice quality to the sentiment
to be expressed. As a means of transmitting the
inward emotions from soul to soul they are more
potent than the language which they clothe.
42. CLASSIFICATION.
As the quality of voice depends upon the nature of
the sentiment to be expressed, and this, in turn, upon
the condition of the mind or body from which the
thought or feeling emanates, the qualities may be
divided into two primary classes, NORMAL and ABNOR-
MAL.
-
Pure Tone.
Orotund.
3


## p. 34 (#60) ##############################################

34
COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
44. Abnormal Qualities.
Plaintive.
Pectoral.
Guttural.
Aspirate.
Nasal.
Falsetto.
45. Normal Qualities.
All those qualities of voice used in the expression of
thoughts originating in a natural condition of mind and
bodily organs, working in harmony with the laws of
our being, are styled NORMAL QUALITIES. They are
marked in their vocal expression by a clear, smooth,
melodious resonance, conveying to the listener a sensa-
tion of sympathy and a conviction of the speaker's sin-
cerity and earnestness. The NORMAL QUALITIES are
divided into PURE TONE and OROTUND.
46. PURE TONE.
1. The Pure Tone is a clear, smooth, musical tone,
with the resonance in the central part of the mouth
cavity.
2. In its production, all the breath is converted into
sound, free from any aspiration or harshness, the
resonance being confined wholly within the cavity of
the mouth.
3. This is the quality required in ordinary vocal
commerce; and, as it forms the basis of pure conver-
sation and of all the other qualities, it should be under-
stood, and practiced till its use becomes a habit.
4. In this connection it may be said that it is the

tone of nature, and should be used by our youth. An
examination by the author, of thirty-two boys, ranging
in age from twelve to sixteen years, revealed the un-
pleasant fact that but six of these used the Pure
Tone in reading: bad habits of various kinds had
marred the vocal quality of the other twenty-six.
5. Purity of quality may be secured by those who
never had it and regained by those who have lost it,
by frequent practice and constant attention to the
following: -
47. Direction for Securing Pure Tone Quality.
Shape the mouth and lips in such a manner as to form
the sound of oo in ooze, and utter the sound several
times with your natural pitch.
Be careful to convert all breath used into tone.

TEST OF CORRECTNESS.
Place the hand within two or three inches of the
mouth while uttering the element. If any air is felt
to strike it you have not the Pure Tone. Purse the
lips less and try again. In this way utter the long
vowels a, e, i, o, u, several times, using no more force
than is necessary in speaking in a small room. Observe
the character of the sound produced, and regulate your
tones accordingly.

49. ILLUSTRATIONS IN NATURE.
The Pure Tone, in its various degrees of force, is
illustrated in nature by the cooing of the dove, the
solemn tones of the Æolian harp, the joyous songs of
the birds, the merry sound of the babbling brook and
the happy, ringing laugh of childhood. From these
illustrations we derive its
50. LAW OF USE.
The Pure Tone is used in the expression of solemn,
serious, tranquil, narrative, didactic, and descriptive
thought and joyous and mirthful emotions.
NOTE TO TEACHERS To secure the highest excellence conduct
all reading exercises as follows: Have all students write in order
of preference the names of three or more readers whom they
think bring out most correctly the element under consideration,
omitting all others. Have the votes, together with your own,
counted, and place the names of the three highest upon the black-
board. Proper management will insure every student's name
appearing on the board once or oftener each month.

Upon the earth, decked in her robe of snow.

And now, with noiseless step, sweet memory comes
And leads me gently through her twilight realms.
What poet's tuneful lyre has ever sung,
Or delicatest pencil e'er portrayed

The enchanted, shadowy land where memory dwells?
It has its valleys, cheerless, lone, and drear,
Dark-shaded by the mournful cypress tree;
And yet its sunlit mountain tops are bathed
In Heaven's own blue. Upon its craggy cliffs,
Robed in the dreamy light of distant years,
Are clustered joys serene of other days.
Upon its gently sloping hill-sides bend
The weeping willows o'er the sacred dust
Of dear departed ones; yet in that land,
Where'er our footsteps fall upon the shore,
They that were sleeping rise from out the dust
Of death's long, silent years, and round us stand
As erst they did before the prison tomb
Received their clay within its voiceless halls.

DESCRIPTION.

Mark Twain (S. L. Clemens).]
[From "Damascus.".
66
Damascus is the oldest city in the world. Tyre and
Sidon have crumbled on the shore; Baalbec is a ruin;
Palmyra is buried in the sands of the desert; Nineveh and
Babylon have disappeared from the Tigris and Euphrates;
Damascus remains what it was before the days of Abraham,
a centre of trade and travel, an island of verdure in a desert,
a predestined capital," with martial and sacred associa-
tions extending through more than thirty centuries.
It was
near Damascus that Saul of Tarsus saw the light from
heaven, above the brightness of the sun. The street which
is called Straight, in which it was said he prayed, still runs
through the city. The caravan comes and goes as it did
three thousand years ago; there are still the sheik, the ass,
and the water-wheel; the merchants of the Euphrates and
the Mediterranean still "occupy these with the multitudes
of their wares.'
The city which Mohammed surveyed from a neighboring
height and was afraid to enter because it was given to have
but one paradise, and for his part he was resolved not to
have it in this world, is to this day what Julian called "the
eye of the East," as it was in the time of Isaiah, "the head
of Syria." From Damascus came the damson, or dama-
scene, or blue plum, and the delicious apricot of Portugal,
called the damasco; damask, our beautiful fabric of cotton
and silk, with vines and flowers raised upon a smooth, bright
ground; the damask rose, introduced into England in the

time of Henry VIII.; the Damascus blade, so famous the
world over for its keen edge and wonderful elasticity,
the secret of whose manufacture was lost when Tamerlane
carried off the arts into Persia; and the beautiful art of
inlaying wood and steel with silver and gold, a kind of Mosaic,
engraving and sculpture united-called damaskeening-
with which boxes, swords, guns, and bureaus are ornamented.
–
It is still a city of flowers and bright waters; the "rivers
of Damascus," the "streams from Lebanon," the "rivers
of gold," still murmur and sparkle in the wilderness of
Syrian Gardone."
The early history of Damascus is shrouded in the hoary
mists of antiquity. Leave the ma ers written of it in the
first eleven chapters of the Old Testament out, and no
recorded event had occurred in the whole to show that
Damascus was in existence to receive it. Go back as far as
you will into the vague past, there was always a Damascus.
In the writings of every country for more than four thousand
years, its name has been mentioned and its praises sung.
To Damascus years are only moments: decades, only flitting
trifles of time. She measures time not by days and months,
but by the empires she has seen rise and prosper, then crum-
ble to ruin. She is a type of immortality. She saw the
foundation of Baalbec and Thebes and Ephesus laid; she saw
them grow into mighty cities, and amaze the world with their
grandeur, and she has lived to see them desolate, deserted,
and given to the owls and the bats. She saw the Israelitish
empire exalted and she saw it annihilated. She saw Greece
rise and flourish for two thousand years, and die. In her
old age she saw Rome built; she saw it overshadow the
world with its power; she saw it perish. The few hundred
years of Genoese and Venetian might and splendor were to

membering. Damascus has seen all that has occurred on
earth and still lives. She has looked upon the dry bones of
a thousand empires, and she will live to see the tomb of a
thousand more before she dies. Though another claims the
name, old Damascus is, by right, the Eternal City.

tone, deepened and intensified to its utmost magni-
tude, with the resonance in the chest.
―――――――
2. The Orotund Quality is most pleasing to the ear
and highly beneficial to the speaker. The exercise of
the voice in acquiring this quality and the actual use
of it, impart, more than almost any other exercise,
fullness, strength and clearness to the tones of the
speaker. It may be justly termed, in its full develop-
ment, the highest character of human utterance; and
therefore implies the consciousness of the most exalted
emotions, excited by a power and energy of gigantic
conceptions.
3. The Orotund Quality is naturally possessed by
very few, rarely by uncultivated voices; and though
it may be acquired by most persons, much time and
practice are requisite to secure that depth, fullness
and richness which Murdoch describes as "the blend-
ing of volume and purity in one vast sphere of
sound."
53. Directions for Acquiring Orotund Quality.
1. Stand erect in such a manner that the chest is
elevated and expanded to its utmost capacity. De-
press and enlarge the larynx as if trying to force down
some large object; then prolong the sound of long o, as
heard in old, using a low pitch. Be careful not to con-
tract the muscles of the throat, or the very opposite of
Orotund will be produced-the Guttural, a quality
by no means to be desired at this stage of progress.
2. Practice the following exercises as directed above,

of earnest, bold, grand and lofty thought, and in giv-

reverence, adoration, devotion, daring, warning, cour-
age, and inspiration.

[Speech of Spartacus to the Gladiators. - Kellogg.]
It had been a day of triumph in Capua. Lentulus,
returning with victorious eagles, had amused the populace
with the sports of the amphitheatre to an extent hitherto
unknown even in that luxurious city. The shouts of revelry
had died away; the roar of the lion had ceased; the last
loiterer had retired from the banquet, and the lights in the
palace of the victor were extinguished. The moon, piercing
the tissue of fleecy clouds, silvered the dew-drops on the
corselet of the Roman sentinel, and tipped the dark waters
of the Vulturnus with a wavy, tremulous light. No sound
was heard save the last sob of some retiring wave, telling its
story to the smooth pebbles of the beach; and then all was
still as the breast when the spirit has departed. In the deep
recesses of the amphitheatre a band of gladiators were
assembled, their muscles still knotted with the agony of
conflict, the foam upon their lips, the scowl of battle yet
lingering on their brows, when Sparticus, starting forth
from amid the throng, thus addressed them:

"Ye call me chief; and ye do well to call him chief who,
for twelve long years, has met upon the arena every shape
of man or beast the broad empire of Rome could furnish,
and who never yet lowered his arm.
If there be one among
you who can say that ever, in public fight or private brawl,
my actions did belie my tongue, let him stand forth and say
it. If there be three in all your company dare face me on
the bloody sands, let them come on. And yet I was not
always thus hired butcher, a savage chief of still more
savage men! My ancestors came from old Sparta, and

settled among the vine-clad rocks and citron groves of Syra-
sella. My early life ran quiet as the brooks by which I
sported; and when, at noon, I gathered the sheep beneath
the shade and played upon the shepherd's flute, there was a
friend, the son of a neighbor, to join me in the pastime.
"We led our flocks to the same pasture, and partook
together our rustic meal. One evening, after the sheep
were folded, and we were all seated beneath the myrtle
which shaded our cottage, my grandsire, an old man, was
telling of Marathon and Leuctra, and how, in ancient times,
a little band of Spartans, in a defile of the mountains, had
withstood a whole army. I did not then know what war
was, but my cheeks burned, I knew not why, and I clasped
the knees of that venerable man, until my mother, parting
the hair from off my forehead, kissed my throbbing temples,
and bade me go to rest, and think no more of those old
tales and savage wars. That very night the Romans landed
on our coast. I saw the breast that had nourished me
trampled by the hoof of the war-horse, the bleeding body
of my father flung amid the blazing rafters of our dwelling!
"To-day I killed a man in the arena, and when I broke
his helmet-clasps, behold, he was my friend. He knew me,
smiled faintly, gasped, and died; the same sweet smile upon
his lips that I had marked when, in adventurous boyhood,
we scaled the lofty cliff to pluck the first ripe grapes and
bear them home in childish triumph. I told the prætor that
the dead man had been my friend, generous and brave, and
I begged that I might bear away the body, to burn it on a
funeral pile and mourn over its ashes. Ay, upon my knees,
amid the dust and blood of the arena, I begged that poor
boon, while all the assembled maids and matrons, and the
holy virgins they call Vestals, and the rabble, shouted in
derision, deeming it rare sport, forsooth, to see Rome's

piece of bleeding clay! And the prætor drew back as I
were pollution, and sternly said, 'Let the carrion rot; there
are no noble men but Romans! And so, fellow-gladiators,
must you, and so must I, die like dogs. O Rome! Rome!
thou hast been a tender nurse to me. Ay, thou hast given
to that poor, gentle, timid shepherd lad, who never knew a
harsher tone than a flute-note, muscles of iron and a heart
of flint; taught him to drive the sword through plaited mail
and links of rugged brass, and warm it in the marrow of his
foe; to gaze into the glaring eyeballs of the fierce Numidian
lion, even as a boy upon a laughing girl. And he shall pay
thee back, until the yellow Tiber is red as frothing wine,
and in its deepest ooze thy life-blood lies curdled!
"Ye stand here now like giants, as ye are.
The strength
of brass is in your toughened sinews; but to-morrow some
Roman Adonis, breathing sweet perfume from his curly
locks, shall with his lily fingers pat your red brawn and bet
his sesterces upon your blood. Hark! hear ye yon lion
roaring in his den? 'Tis three days since he tasted flesh,
but to-morrow he shall break his fast upon yours, and a
dainty meal for him ye will be. If ye are beasts, then stand
here like fat oxen, waiting for the butcher's knife! If ye are
men, follow me!
Strike down yon guard, gain the moun-
tain passes, and there do bloody work, as did your sires at
old Thermopyla! Is Sparta dead? Is the old Grecian
spirit frozen in your veins, that you do crouch and cower
like a belabored hound beneath his master's lash? Oh,
comrades! warriors! Thracians! if we must fight, let us
fight for ourselves! If we must slaughter, let us slaughter
our oppressors! If we must die, let it be under the clear
sky, by the bright waters, in noble, honorable battle."

Ministers proclaim to you the glad tidings of great joy,
and point out to you the path to heaven. The Sabbath
faithfully returns its mild and sweet seasons of grace, that
earthly objects may not engross your thoughts and prevent
your attention to immortality. The sanctuary unfolds its
doors and invites you to enter in and be saved.
The Gospel still shines to direct your feet and to quicken
your pursuit of the inestimable prize. Saints wait with
fervent hope of renewing their joy over your repentance.
Angels spread their wings to conduct you home. The Father
holds out the golden scepter of forgiveness that you may
touch and live. The Son died on the cross, ascended to
heaven, and intercedes before the throne of mercy that you
may be accepted. The Spirit of grace and truth descends
with his benevolent influence to allure and persuade you.

honest misconception both of friends and foes. Ambi-

58. ABNORMAL QUALITIES,
1. The human mind and physical organism are sub-
ject to wonderful and varied changes. The mind has
its moods of fear, aversion, contempt, hatred, anger,

horror, despair and grief; and the body is subject to
numerous ailments, all at variance with the genial
tranquillity of an unruffled life. As language and
action are the mirrors of the human soul, so they
should faithfully reflect the thoughts and passions which
exist within.
2. Every change of the mind, from the peaceful
contemplation of a well ordered state of affairs, every
change in the vital functions from a state of perfect
health, manifests itself, not more distinctly in the
actions and manner of the individual than in the tones
of his voice.
3. Accordingly, those tones, or qualities of voice,
with which one expresses his thoughts and emotions,
while under the influence of such mental or physical
disturbance, are termed Abnormal Qualities.
4. Under the various conditions of mind and body,
these qualities will be, Plaintive, Pectoral, Guttural,
Aspirate, Nasal, and Falsetto. Two or more of these
may be combined, according to the prevailing trait or
the intensity of the emotion they express.
5. These qualities are all more or less impure, that
is mingled with breath, and are, hence, sometimes
styled "impure qualities."
6. On account of the impurity of the Abnormal
Qualities, they have not received favorable attention
from teachers of elocution; but as almost every literary
work extant contains sentiments and emotions whose
correct rendering demands their use, the reader can
not ignore them. Their frequent practice by the

student of elocution, strengthens the voice to a degree
that would justify their cultivation if there were no
other reason for their use.
7. That the pupil may know when to use these
abnormal qualities, as well as when to avoid them,
particular attention is called to the definition of each
quality, and the character of sentiment contained in
each example used for its illustration.
59. PLAINTIVE QUALITY.
1. The Plaintive is that quality of voice in which
the sound is uttered in a thin, feeble tone, with the
resonance in the forward part of the mouth.
2. In the production of this quality the organs seem
to labor under a painful effort; and though it some-
times expresses the most exalted emotions, the weak-
ness of the vocal organs prevents the conversion of all
the breath used into tone, and the quality is therefore
impure.
ILLUSTRATIONS IN NATURE.
This quality is illustrated in nature by the moaning
of the soft winds and in the groans accompanying
death.
60. Direction for producing the Plaintive Qual-
ity.
Draw in the cheeks so as to reduce the size of the
resonance chamber of the mouth, gently compress the
lips, and prolong the sound of long o, in high pitch,

with subdued force. This will give you the quality,
when you can reproduce it in the exercises following.
61. LAW OF USE.
The Plaintive Quality is used, with various degrees
of force, to express feebleness, exhaustion, languor,
acute pain and affectation.
NOTE. The last mentioned use is worthy of particular atten-
tion. A few young people of the gentler sex have educated them-
selves into the fancy that a clear, ringing tone of voice is
"indelicate 99 or "unæsthetic." To evince their refinement and
high state of culture, they purse the lips, and utter their small talk
with a daintiness that in its violation of good taste is equalled only
by their fellow-exalted-culturists, who mince their sweet-scented
words in a manner that would have thrown an effeminate Roman
into a paroxysm of envy.
CAUTION.
The student is cautioned against using this quality
in any case except where it may be needed in persona-
tion. Its use by an able-bodied man or woman is an
infallible indication of affectation or degeneracy.
62. Examples: FEEBLENESS AND EXHAUSTION.

I am dying of hunger and cold, mother,
Dying of hunger and cold,
And half the agony of such a death
My lips have never told.
It has gnawed like a wolf, at my heart, mother,
A wolf that is fierce for blood,
-
All the livelong day, and the night beside,
Gnawing for lack of food.
I dreamed of bread in my sleep, mother,
And the sight was heaven to see;
I awoke with an eager, famishing lip,
But you had no bread for me.
How could I look to you, mother,
How could I look to you,
For bread to give to your starving boy,
When you were starving too?
For I read the famine in your cheek,
And in your eye so wild,
And I felt it in your bony hand
you laid it on your child.

Come nearer to my side,
And hold me fondly, as you held
My father when he died;

My breath is almost gone;

Give me three grains of corn.
63. PECTORAL QUALITY.
1. The Pectoral Quality (from pectoris, the breast)
is a rough, harsh, husky, hollow tone, resembling the

Orotund, with the resonance in the upper part of the
chest.
2. The Pectoral is low in pitch, and usually slow in
movement. It arises from a debilitated or relaxed
condition of the vocal chords and a feeble action of the
abdominal muscles.
3. It is exhibited in persons addicted to dissipation,
intemperance, and the use of various stimulants and
narcotics.
64. ILLUSTRATIONS IN NATURE.
The Pectoral Quality is illustrated in nature by the
low growl of the lion and the harsh roar of the
tempest.
65. Directions for Producing the Pectoral.
1. Take the position required in producing the Oro-
tund. Practice the Orotund a few seconds on the
sound of long o, then relax the muscles about the throat
and waist, lower the pitch to the lowest note that will
permit tone, retaining the same force, and continue
the sound of long o, in a harsh, hollow, husky tone.
2. This will give you the Pectoral Quality. Con-
tinue the exercise as a key till you can strike the right
quality, then practice with the same quality on the
vowels,
ă, ē, I, ō, ũ.
66. LAW OF USE.

spair, dread, deep solemnity mingled with awe, re-

68. GUTTURAL QUALITY.
1. The Guttural Quality (from guttur, throat) is a
rough, harsh, grating, rattling, discordant sound pro-
duced by a rigid compression of the muscles of the

neck and partial closing of the throat above the glottis,
with the resonance in the throat.
2. The Guttural originates from an agitation of the
most intense and malignant passions. The sound is cut
off from communication with the chest by an ob-
structed throat, as in a person suffering from intense
rage. The sound issues apparently from the pharynx,
or swallow, instead of the larynx.
3. The Guttural Quality, in a modified form, is very
prevalent among persons with large, flaccid, vocal or-
gans and in the aged. Its use, except in the expres-
sion of the appropriate passions, should be carefully
avoided.
69. ILLUSTRATIONS IN NATURE.
The Guttural is illustrated in nature by the threaten-
ing and growling utterances of the lower animals.
70. Directions for Producing the Guttural Quality.
1. Assume a somewhat relaxed position of the body,
the shoulders leaning rather forward than backward,
then compress and elevate the abdominal muscles, so
as to throw the greatest amount of breath into the
throat. Compress by a rigid contraction, the muscles
about the throat and neck, and produce the sound of
ä, as in ah, in a grating tone, as if endeavoring to clear
the pharynx of an accumulation of phlegm.
2. Use this sound as a key until you can instantly
and correctly strike the Guttural on the long vowels,

INTENSE LOATHING, HATRED AND SCORN.
[From "The Seminole's Defiance." — G. W. Patten.]

[From "Merchant of Venice."-Shakespeare.]
Shy. To bait fish withal; if it will feed nothing else,
it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and hin-
dered me of half a million: laughed at my losses, mocked at
my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my bargains, cooled
my friends, heated my enemies; and what's his reason?-I
am a Jew. Hath not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands,
organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions?-fed with
the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the
same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and
cooled by the same winter and summer, as a Christian is?
If you prick us, do we not bleed? - if you tickle us, do we
not laugh? if you poison us, do we not die? and if you
wrong us, shall we not revenge? If we are like you in the
rest, we will resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Chris-
tian, what is his humility? revenge! If a Christian wrong a
Jew, what should his sufferance be by Christian example?

SCORN AND DEFIANCE.
[From "Paradise Lost."- Milton.]
Satan [to Death]. "Whence and what art thou, execrable
shape!
That dar'st, though grim and terrible, advance
Thy miscreated front athwart my way
-
To yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass,
That be assured, — without leave asked of thee:
Retire! or taste thy folly; and learn by proof,
Hell-born! not to contend with spirits of heaven.”
Death [in reply].
"Back to thy punishment,
False fugitive! and to thy speed add wings;
Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue
Thy lingering, or, with one stroke of this dart,
Strange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before!"
74. ASPIRATE QUALITY.
1. The Aspirate Quality is articulated breath, and
ranges from a mere whisper to the least audible tones
of the Plaintive, Pectoral and Guttural Qualities.
2. The true aspirate is unmixed breath, but as the
term is commonly used, it is combined with other ab-
normal qualities to aid their intensity of utterance.
3. The practice of the Aspirate Quality alone and in
combination with other abnormal qualities, with Full
Force, is highly beneficial in strengthening the vocal
organs.

4. The use of this quality is indispensable in giving
correct expression to sentiments arising from secrecy,
caution, amazement and suppressed fear, and those in-
tense emotions caused by an overwhelming dread and
horror.
75. ILLUSTRATIONS IN NATURE.
The Aspirate Quality is illustrated in nature by the
whispering of the winds, the hissing of serpents and
the whirring sound made by certain birds when
startled.
76. Directions for Producing the Aspirate Quality.
1. The simple Aspirate Quality is an unmodified
whisper without vocality. To produce the Aspirate in
combination with Plaintive, Pectoral, or Guttural, utter
the sound of long o, first in Pure Tone, then gradually
lower your pitch and aspirate the utterance so that the
sound will partake largely of breath, and yet contain
sufficient vocality to be heard across a large room.
2. Practice this on the vowels a, e, i, o, u, until you
can strike the four impure qualities at pleasure.
77. LAW OF USE.
The Aspirate Quality alone and in combination with
other qualities is used to express secrecy, surprise,
fear, caution, awe, dread and expiring life.

The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee:

A dagger of the mind; a false creation,
Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
I see thee yet, in form as palpable
As this which now I draw.

Shakespeare.]

Whose howl's his watch, thus, with his stealthy pace,
With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
Moves like a ghost.

79. NASAL QUALITY.
1. The Nasal Quality (from nasus, the nose) is a
harsh, thin, twangy tone, with the resonance in the
nose.
2. The Nasal is an abnormal quality, because its
production arises from some vocal disability, as a cold,
or a mal-formation of the organs of speech.
3. The pupil will have no occasion for using the Na-
sal except in mimicry or burlesque; but a perfect com-
mand of all the qualities requires a drill upon this,
both for the purpose of personation and avoiding its
use where improper.
80. ILLUSTRATIONS IN NATURE.
The Nasal Quality is illustrated in nature by the
familiar honk" of the wild goose.
81. Directions for Producing the Nasal Quality.
Place the organs in position to pronounce the sylla-
ble on with high pitch: now depress the lower jaw and
prolong the syllable ong, retaining the sound so as to
cause the reverberation to be heard in the back part
of the mouth and nose.

his eyes were red and inflamed, and his nose was nearly
twice its usual size, and shone with a lustre that would have
appeared to much better advantage on a door-plate. Singu-
larly enough, the young lady was similarly conditioned.
She ushered him into the parlor, and without any preliminary
ceremony they were seated on the same sofa together. He
took out his handkerchief and finding a dry section, wiped
his nose.
This reminded her of a duty she owed herself,
and she attended to it at once. He held one of her hands
in his, and his handkerchief in the other. Then he
spoke :-
66
-
Susad, I cub to dide to talk of subthig dearer - ah ah-
ooh (a prompt application of the handkerchief cut off the
sneeze in its bud) dearer to be thad libe- ah ah — thad
id-oo-ooh-ker chew, ker chew, ker chew." A moment's
pause. "I've god ad awful code," he explains, with due
solemnity.
"Sobe I," she replies.
A moment is devoted to the silent use of handkerchiefs,
and then he continues:
"Darlig, you bust hab seed all the tibe how mudge -
ooh-oon-ker (the handkerchief again saves him) how
mudge I have thought ob you. Every hour ob the day or
dide-ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ker chew, ker chew."

――――
She wiped her eyes and then her nose, and made an
honest endeavor to look languishingly, but owing to the
watery condition of the former, and the fiery glow of the
latter, she appeared to an unhappy advantage. But he did
not notice it.
"Susad," he began again, grasping her hand with fervor,
and clutching his handkerchief with equal earnestness,
"what is libe without love? Dothig. Darlig, do you, cad

"I will, Hedry, I will," she hoarsely whispered.

eyes blinking in sweet, holy ecstasy upon each other.
66
'My poor darlig has god sudge a code," he sympathiz-
ingly murmured.
"So id my Hedry," she softly whispered back.
“You must take sub bedicid for that code, to dide,” she
said.
"So bust you,” he added.
"Yes, ad you'll soak your feet in hod water?'
"I will; ad you'll soak yours?" he eagerly asked.
"I will," she replied.

'Heaved bless you, by darlig, by precious darlig," clasp-
ing her again to his breast. And then he stole out into the
darkness; and she lingered a moment at the door, and heard
his dear voice ring out on the night air as he passed away -
"Ker chew, ker chew."

84. FALSETTO QUALITY.
1. The Falsetto Quality (from falsus, false) is a
high, thin tone, pitched far above the natural, with the
resonance in the head.
2. In producing this quality of voice, the veil of
the palate is raised very high and the uvula is forced
into the veil, becoming completely hidden from view.

The Falsetto is illustrated in nature by the sharp,
shrill, shriek of the owl.

till the purity of voice breaks, and the quality that
follows will be Falsetto.
87. LAW OF USE.
The Falsetto Quality, like the Nasal, is used in
mimicry, to denote excitement, irritability, scolding,
invective, mockery, fright, anger, pain and terror.

Upon the roofs. The barn is weak;
I greatly fear the roof will break.
So hand me up the spade, my dear-
I'll mount the barn, the roof to clear."

And if you slip, and fall, and die,
How will my living be secured?
Stephen, your life is not insured.
But tie a rope your waist around,

Then cut the rope, and let him go;
He cannot miss the pile of snow.'

Armed with a chair and carving-knife,
And, ere he is aware, perceives
His head ascending to the eaves;
And, guessing what the two are at,
Screams from beneath the roof, 66
Stop that!
You make me fall too far, by half!"
But Phebe answers with a laugh,
"Please tell a body by what right
You've brought your wife to such a plight?

She cuts the rope and down he goes.

They scrape away a little snow:
What's this? A hat! Ah! he's below.

89. FORCE.
1. Force is the degree of energy with which sound
is sent forth from the vocal organs. This energy
depends upon the intensity of the emotions. [See 5
Art. 89.]
2. Force is not loudness. Words may be uttered
with full force in a whisper. Loudness depends partly
upon force; but there are other elements that con-
tribute to make sounds loud or soft. These will be
considered in their proper place.
-
3. Volume, a term that signifies the fullness or
mellowness of tone, also depends, in part, upon the
degree of force applied to the vocal organs.


## p. 85 (#111) #############################################

FORCE.
85
4. Both loudness and volume depend upon the
quantity of breath employed, a fact that proves the
importance of a proper management of the breath in
vocal culture.
5. The degree of force employed in the expression
of the various sentiments and emotions corresponds,
with one exception, to the strength of the sentiments or
emotions that occasion speech. Sometimes we are so
overpowered by passion, fright, or other overwhelming
emotion, that the energy required to express our feel-
ings is consumed in maintaining our very conscious-
ness.
6. Few subjects treated by the elocutionist are of
greater importance in developing a full, deep, flexible,
and powerful voice than that of force; hence, prac-
tice - much practice, and intelligent practice is essen-
tial in this department of vocal culture.
7. The pupil should increase his force by degrees.
Sudden transitions are injurious to one not accustomed
to a severe use of the voice. Every new acquisition of
power will enable him to go beyond his present attain-
ments. When that degree of force is obtained beyond
which the voice cannot go without breaking, the effort
to increase the force should be discontinued, and a few
minutes' practice should be had with that degree of
force.
8. In the exercises following, avoid any change of
pitch while increasing the force. If the pitch is raised,
begin again with the element and endeavor to complete
the fullest degree of force with the same pitch with
which that element is begun.


## p. 86 (#112) #############################################

86
COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
9. Repeat each element in all degrees of force before
changing the pitch, then raise or lower the pitch and
repeat the elements in the pitch selected.
90. DIVISION OF FORCE.
Force may be divided into three classes, namely,
SUBDUED FORCE,
MODERATE FORCE,
FULL FORCE,
each of which, for convenience, may be further sub-
divided into three degrees.
91. Subdued Force.
Subdued includes every degree of force employed
in producing sound, from the least audible to the milder
tones of conversation.
92. Moderate Force.
Moderate is the degree of force employed in ordi-
nary conversation, unemotional description, and narra-
tion.
93. Full Force.
Full Force, with various degrees of energy, is em-
ployed in expressing the most violent and impetuous
emotions and passions.
94. Exercises.
The pupil will repeat the long vowels a, e, i, o, u,
with nine degrees of Force without change of pitch,
as marked in the following diagram. Begin with the

It must be sweet in childhood, to give back
The spirit to its Maker; ere the heart
Has grown familiar with the paths of sin,
And sown, to garner up its bitter fruits.
I knew a boy whose infant feet had trod
Upon the blossoms of some seven springs,
And when the eighth came round, and called him out
To revel in its light, he turned away,
And sought his chamber, to lie down and die.
'Twas night; he summoned his accustomed friends,
And on this wise bestowed his last bequest:
"Mother, I'm dying now!
There's a deep suffocation in my breast,
As if some heavy hand my bosom pressed:
And on my brow,
@
I feel the cold sweat stand;
My lips grow dry and tremulous, and my breath
Comes feebly on.
O! tell me, is this death?

Where the pure waters wander through valleys of gold,
And life is a treasure sublime;
'Tis the land of our God, 'tis the home of the soul,
Where the ages of splendor eternally roll,—
Where the way-weary traveler reaches his goal,
On the evergreen Mountains of Life.
Our gaze cannot soar to that beautiful land,
But our visions have told of its bliss;
And our souls by the gale from its gardens are fanned,
When we faint in the desert of this;
And we sometimes have longed for its holy repose,
When our spirits were torn with temptations and woes,
And we've drank from the tide of the river that flows,
From the evergreen Mountains of Life.
Oh! the stars never tread the blue heavens at night,
But we think where the ransomed have trod;
And the day never smiles from his palace of light,
But we feel the bright smile of our God.
We are traveling homeward, through changes and gloom,
To a kingdom where pleasures unceasingly bloom,
And our guide is the glory that shines through the tomb,
From the evergreen Mountains of Life.

To be, or not to be? That is the question:
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And, by opposing, end them? To die; to sleep;
No more: and, by a sleep, to say we end

Devoutly to be wished. To die; to sleep;
To sleep! perchance to dream!-ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come,
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause. There's the respect
That makes calamity of so long life;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despis'ed love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,
To groan and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,—
That undiscover'd country, from whose bourn
No traveler returns, puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear the ills we have,
Than fly to others that we know not of?
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;
And enterprises of great pith and moment,
With this regard their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action.

[From "Cromwell's Expulsion of the Parliament.” — Lingard.]
At this eventful moment, big with the most important
consequences to himself and his country, whatever were the
workings of Cromwell's mind, he had the art to conceal
them from the eyes of the beholders. Leaving the military
in the lobby, he entered the Parliament House and com-
posedly seated himself on one of the outer benches. His
dress was a plain suit of black cloth, with gray worsted
stockings. For a while he seemed to listen with interest to
the debate, but when the Speaker was going to put the
question, he whispered to Harrison, "This is the time; I
must do it; " and rising, put off his hat to address the
House.
At first his language was decorous, and even laudatory.
Gradually he became more warm and animated. At last
he assumed all the vehemence of passion, and indulged in
personal vituperation. He charged the members with self-
seeking and profaneness, with the frequent denial of justice
and numerous acts of oppression; with idolizing the lawyers,
the constant advocates of tyranny; with neglecting the men
who had bled for them in the field, that they might gain the
Presbyterians, who had apostatized from the cause; and
with doing all this in order to perpetuate their own power,
and to replenish their own purses. But their time was
come; the Lord had disowned them; he had chosen more
worthy instruments to perform his work.
Here the orator was interrupted by Sir Peter Wentworth,
who declared that he had never heard language so unpar-
liamentary-language, too, the more offensive because it

was addressed to them by their own servant, whom they had
made what he was. At these words Cromwell put on his
hat, and springing from his place, exclaimed, "Come, come,
sir, I will put an end to your prating!" For a few seconds,
apparently in the most violent agitation, he paced forward
and backward, and then stamping on the floor, added, “You
are no Parliament! I say you are no Parliament! Bring
them in, bring them in! Instantly the door opened, and
Colonel Worsley entered, followed by more than twenty
musketeers.
"This,'
," cried Sir Henry Vane, "is not honest; it is
against morality and common honesty." "Sir Henry
Vane," replied Cromwell; "oh, Sir Henry Vane! The
Lord deliver me from Sir Henry Vane! He might have
prevented this, but he is a juggler, and has not common
honesty himself!" From Vane he directed his discourse
to Whitelock, on whom he poured a torrent of abuse; then
pointing to Chaloner, "There," he cried, "sits a drunk-
ard!" and afterward selecting different members in succes-
sion, he described them as dishonest and corrupt livers, a
shame and scandal to the profession of the Gospel.
Suddenly, however, checking himself, he turned to the
guard, and ordered them to clear the House. At these
words Colonel Harrison took the Speaker by the hand and
led him from the chair; Algernon Sydney was next com-
pelled to quit his seat; and the other members, eighty in
number, arose and moved toward the door. Cromwell now
resumed his discourse. "It is you," he exclaimed, "that
have forced me to do this. I have sought the Lord both
day and night, that he would rather slay me than put me on
the doing of this work."
Alderman Allan took advantage of these words to observe
that it was not yet too late to undo what had been done;

but Cromwell instantly charged him with peculation, and
gave him into custody. When all were gone, fixing his eye
on the mace, "What," said he, "shall we do with this fool's
bawble? Here, carry it away." Then taking the act of
dissolution from the clerk, he ordered the doors to be locked,
and accompanied by the military, returned to Whitehall.
That afternoon the members of the Council assembled in
their usual place of meeting. Bradshaw had just taken the
chair, when the Lord-General entered and told them that
if they were there as private individuals, they were welcome,
but if as the Council of State, they must know that the
Parliament was dissolved, and with it also the Council.
"Sir," replied Bradshaw, with the spirit of an ancient
Roman, we have heard what you did at the House this
morning, and before many hours all England will know it.
But sir, you are mistaken to think that the Parliament is
dissolved. No power under heaven can dissolve it but
itself; therefore, take you notice of that."
66
After this protest they withdrew. Thus, by the parricidal
hands of its own children, perished the Long Parliament,
which, under a variety of forms, had for more than twelve
years defended and invaded the liberties of the nation. It
fell without a struggle or a groan, unpitied and unregretted.
The members slunk away to their homes, where they sought
by submission to purchase the forbearance of their new
master; and their partizans --if partizans they had re-
served themselves in silence for a day of retribution, which
came not before Cromwell slept in his grave.

we were not caring for these things-they did not interest
us in the least. We were in a fever of impatience; we
were dying to see the renowned cathedral! We watched
in this direction and that- - all around-everywhere. We
needed no one to point it out—we did not wish any one to
point it out—we would recognize it, even in the desert of
the great Sahara.
-
At last a forest of graceful needles, shimmering in the
amber sunlight, rose slowly above the pigmy house-tops, as
one sometimes sees, in the far hori`zon, a gilded and pinnacled
mass of cloud lift itself above the waste of waves at sea
the Cathedral! We knew it in a moment.
-
Half of that night, and all of the next day, this archi-
tectural autocrat was our sole object of interest. What a
wonder it is! So grand, so solemn, so vast! And yet' so
delicate, so airy', so graceful! A very world of solid weight';
and yet it seems, in the soft moonlight, only a fairy delusion
of frost-work, that might vanish with a breath'! How
sharply its pinnacled angles and its wilderness of spires were
cut against the sky'; and how richly their shadows fell upon
its snowy roof! It was a vision'! a miracle'! an anthem
sung in stone, a poem wrought in marble'!
Howsoever you look at the great Cathedral, it is noble,
it is beautiful! Wherever you stand in Milan, or within
seven miles of Milan, it is visible—and when it is visible, no
other object can claim your whole attention. Leave your
eyes unfettered by your will but a single instant, and they
will surely turn to seek it. It is the first thing you look for
when you rise in the morning, and the last your lingering
gaze rests upon at night. Surely it must be the most
princely creation that ever brain of man conceived.
At nine o'clock in the morning we went and stood before
this marble colossus. The central one of its five great

doors is bordered with a bäs-relief of birds, and fruits, and
beasts, and insects, which have been so ingeniously carved
out of marble that they seem like living creatures; and the
figures are so numerous, and the designs so complex, that
one might study it a week without exhausting its interest.
-
On the great steeple surmounting the myriad of
spires-inside of the spires-over the doors, the win-
dows-in nooks and corners - everywhere that a niche or a
perch can be found about the enormous building, from sum-
mit to base, there is a marble statue, and every statue is a
study in itself! Raphael, Angelo, Canova-giants like
these gave birth to the designs, and their own pupils carved
them. Every face is eloquent with expression, and every
attitude is full of grace. Away above, on the lofty roof,
rank on rank of carved and fretted spars spring high in the
air, and through their rich tracery one sees the sky beyond.
In their midst the centre steeple towers proudly up like the
main-mast of some great Indiaman among a fleet of coasters.
We wished to go aloft. The sacristan showed us a mar-
ble stairway (of course it was marble, and of the purest
and whitest- there is no other stone, no brick, no wood,
among its building materials), and told us to go up one hun-
dred and eighty-two steps, and stop till he came.

how.
This was the roof. Here, springing from its broad mar-
ble flagstones were the long files of spires, looking very
tall close at hand, but diminishing in the distance like the
pipes of an organ. We could see, now, that the statue on
the top of each was the size of a large man, though they all
looked like dolls from the street. We could see, also,
from the inside of each and every one of these hollow spires,

from sixteen to thirty-one beautiful marble statues looking
out upon the world below.
From the eaves to the comb of the roof stretched in end-
less succession, great curved marble beams, like the fore
and aft braces of a steamboat; and along each beam, from end
to end, stood up a row of richly carved flowers and fruits
each separate and distinct in kind, and over fifteen thousand
species represented. At a little distance these rows seem to
close together like the ties of a railroad track; and then the
mingling together of the buds and blossoms of this marble
garden forms a picture of exceeding beauty.
We descended and entered. Within the church, long
rows of fluted columns, like huge monuments, divided the
building into broad aisles; and on the figured pavement fell
many a soft blush from the painted windows above. I knew
the church was very large, but I could not fully appreciate
its great size until I noticed that the men standing far down
by the altar looked like boys, and seemed to glide rather
than walk.
We loitered about, gazing aloft at the monster windows
all aglow with brilliantly colored scenes in the lives of
the Savior and his followers. Some of these pictures are
mosaics; and so artistically are their thousand particles of
tinted glass or stone put together, that the work has all the
smoothness and finish of a painting. We counted sixty
panes of glass in one window, and each pane was adorned
with one of these master achievements of genius and patience.
For the purpose of viewing the treasures of the church,
we followed a priest into a large room filled with tall wooden
presses like wardrobes. He threw them open, and behold!
the cargoes of crude bullion of the assay offices of Nevada
faded out of my memory. There were Virgins and bishops
there, above their natural size, made of solid silver, each

worth, by weight, from one hundred and sixty thousand to
three hundred thousand dollars, and bearing gemmed books
in their hands worth fifteen thousand: there were bäs-reliefs
that weighed six hundred pounds, carved in solid silver;
crosiers and crosses, and candlesticks six and eight feet high,
all of virgin gold, and brilliant with precious stones: and
beside these were all manner of cups and vases, and other
things, rich in proportion. It was an Aladdin's palace!
The treasures here, by simple weight, without counting
workmanship, were valued at ten millions of dollars!
I like to revel in the dryest details of the great cathe-
dral. The building is nearly five hundred feet long, by
three hundred feet wide; and the principal steeple is in the
neighborhood of four hundred feet high. It has more than
seven thousand marble statues, and will have upward of
three thousand more when it is finished. In addition, it has
one thousand five hundred bäs-reliefs. It has one hundred
and thirty-six spires - twenty-one more are to be added.
Each spire is surmounted by a statue six and a half feet
high. It is estimated that it will take a hundred and twenty
years yet to finish the cathedral; and already the mere
workmanship alone has cost considerably over a hundred
millions of dollars. The building looks complete, but is far
from being so. We saw a new statue put in its niche yes-
terday, alongside of one which had been standing these four
hundred years.
There are four staircases leading up to the main steeple,
each of which, with the four hundred and eight statues
which adorn them, cost a hundred thousand dollars. Marco
Campioni was the architect who designed this wonderful
structure, more than five hundred years ago; and it took
him forty-six years to work out the plan, and get it ready to
hand over to the builders. The building was begun a little

But Marmion stopped to bid adieu:

"Of cold respect to stranger guest,
Sent hither by your king's behest,
While in Tantallon's towers I staid;
Part we in friendship from your land,
And, noble earl, receive my hand."
But Douglas round him drew his cloak,
Folded his arms, and thus he spoke:

Be open at my sovereign's will,
To each one whom he lists, howe'er

has ever been odious to the tyrant, and to all the minions
of licentious power; but can we ever forget how eloquent,
how enchanting the voice of that same freedom of speech
has, in all ages, been, wherever its tones have fallen on the
ear of freemen?
Free discussion, and liberty itself, eloquence and freedom
of speech, are contemporaneous fires, and brighten and blaze,
or languish and go out, together. Athenian liberty was, for
years, protracted by that free discussion, which was sus-
tained and continued in Athens. Freedom was prolonged by
eloquence. Liberty paused and lingered, that she might
listen to the divine intonations of her voice. Free discussion,
the eloquence of one man, rolled back the tide of Macedonian
power, and long preserved his country from the overwhelm-
ing deluge.
When the light of free discussion had, throughout all the
Grecian cities, been extinguished in the blood of those
statesmen by whose eloquence it had been sustained, young
Tully, breathing the spirit of Roman liberty on the expiring
embers, relumed and transmitted, from the banks of the
Ilissus to those of the Tiber, this glorious light of freedom.
This mighty master of the forum, by his free discussions,
both from the rostrum and in the senate-house, gave new
vigor, and a longer duration of existence, to the liberty of
his country. Who, more than Marcus Tullius Cicero, was
loved and cherished by the friends of that country? Who
more feared and hated by traitors and tyrants?
Freedom of speech, Roman eloquence, Roman liberty, ex-
pired together, when, under the proscription of the second
triumvirate, the hired bravo of Mark Antony placed in the
lap of one of his profligate minions the head and the hands of
Tully, the statesman, the orator, the illustrious father of his
country. After amusing herself some hours by plunging her

a State Necessity! No, my Lords, that imperial tyrant,
genuine State Necessity, is yet a generous despot-and
when he acts he is bold in his demeanor, rapid in his deci-

tries to steal a pitiful justification from whispered accusa-
tions and fabricated rumors no, my Lords, that is no State
Necessity! Tear off the mask, and you see coarse, vulgar
avarice lurking under the disguise.
"The State Necessity of Mr. Hastings is a juggle. It is
a being that prowls in the dark. It is to be traced in the
ravages which it commits, but never in benefits conferred or
evils prevented. I can conceive justifiable occasions for the
exercise even of outrage, where high public interests demand
the sacrifice of private right. If any great man, in bearing
the arms of his country-if any admiral, carrying the ven-
geance and the glory of Britain to distant coasts, should be
driven to some rash acts of violence, in order, perhaps, to
give food to those who are shedding their blood for their
country there is a State Necessity in such a case, grand,
magnanimous, and all-commanding, which goes hand in hand
with honor.
"If any great general, defending some fortress, barren,
perhaps, itself, but a pledge of the pride and power of
Britain-if such a man, fixed like an imperial eagle on the
summit of a rock, should strip its sides of the verdure and
foliage with which it might be clothed, while covered on the
top with that cloud from which he was pouring down his
thunders on the foe-would he be brought by the House of
Commons to your bar? No, my Lords, never would his
grateful and admiring countrymen think of questioning
actions which, though accompanied by private wrong, yet
were warranted by real necessity. But is the State Neces-
sity which is pleaded by the prisoner, in defence of his con-
duct, of this description? I challenge him to produce a
single instance in which any of his private acts were produc-
tive of public advantage, or averted impending evil.”

103. STRESS.
1. Stress is the application of Force to some par-
ticular part of a syllable or word.
2. Stress differs from accent in this particular;
stress is limited to only a part of a syllable, while
accent includes the entire syllable.
3. In the utterance of an elementary sound which
consists of but a single impulse of the voice, the force
may lie prominently on the first or on the last part, on
the middle or on both extremes, or it may be distrib-
uted with an equal degree throughout the sound.

104. RADICAL STRESS.
1. Radical Stress
of Force to the first part of a syllable or word.
2. In applying this stress to a word the sound will
burst instantaneously upon the first part of the syllable,
and the succeeding part of the syllable will be uttered
with a slight aspiration if the vocal organs are not
under perfect control.
105. LAW OF USE.
The degree of Radical Stress is determined by the
intensity of emotion. It is used, first, to express nar-
rative, didactic, and descriptive thought; and, second,
to express sudden anger, fear, impetuous and startling
emotions; and, third, in the delivery of vigorous and
earnest argument.

The Benedicks think that their senses are small,
Whilst women affirm they have no sense at all,
But are curious compounds of very strange stuff,
Inflexible, hard, and exceedingly tough: -

The old ones have wigs', and the young ones have hair,
And they scent it', and curl it', and friz it with care,
And turn it to dark' should it chance to be fair.
They are ramblers' and wanderers, never at home,
Making sure of a welcome wherever they roam;
And every one knows that the Bachelor's den
Is a room set apart for these singular men
A nook in the clouds, perhaps five by four,
Though sometimes, indeed, it may be rather more --
With skylight, or no light, ghosts, goblins, and gloom,
And everywhere known as the Bachelor's Room.
These creatures, 'tis said, are not valued at all,
Except when the herd give a Bachelor's ball;
Then dress'd in their best, in their gold-broidered vest,
'Tis allowed, as a fact, that they act with much tact,
And they lisp out, "How do?" and they coo, and they sue,
And they smile for a while, their guests to beguile,
Condescending and bending, for fear of offending:
Though inert, they expect to be pert, and to flirt,
And they turn and they twist, and are great hands at whist;
And they whirl and they twirl, and they whisk, and are brisk,
And they whiz and they quiz, and they spy with their eye,
And they sigh as they fly,
For they meet to be sweet, and are fleet on their feet,
Pattering, and flattering, and chattering —
Spluttering, and fluttering, and buttering —
Advancing, and glancing, and dancing, and prancing,
And bumping, and jumping, and stumping, and thumping -

Sounding and bounding around and around,
And sliding and gliding with minuet pace-
Pirouetting, and sitting with infinite grace.
They like dashing and flashing, lashing and splashing,
Racing and pacing, chasing and lacing;
They are flittering and glittering, gallant and gay,
Yawning all morning, and lounging all day;
Love living in London, life loitering away
At their clubs in the dubs, or with beaux in the rows,
Or, what's propera, at the opera,
Reaching home in the morning-fie! fie! sirs, for shame-
At an hour, for their sakes, I won't venture to name.
But when the bachelor-boy grows old,
And these butterfly days are past-
When threescore years their tale have told,
And the days are wet, and the nights are cold,
And something more is required than gold
His heart to cheer, and his hearth uphold-
When, in fact, he finds he's completely sold,
And the world can grumble, and women can scold –
His sun setting fast, and his tale being told-
He then repents at last!

When he, at length, is an odd old man,
With no warmer friend than a warming-pan,
He is fidgety, fretful, and frowsty-in fine,
Loves self, and his bed, and his dinner, and wine;
And he rates and he prates, and reads the debates,
And abuses the world, and the women he hates,
And is cozing and prosing, and dozing all day,
And snoring, and roaring, and boring away;

Sneezing, and wheezing, and teasing, and freezing,
And grumbling, and fumbling, and mumbling, and stumbling;
Falling, and bawling, and crawling, and sprawling,
Withering, and dithering, and quivering, and shivering,
Waking, and aching, and quaking, and shaking,
Ailing, and wailing, and always bewailing,
Weary and dreary, and nothing that's cheery,
Groaning, and moaning, his selfishness owning;
And crying, and sighing, while lying and dying,
Grieving and heaving, though naught he is leaving
But wealth, and ill-health, and his pelf, and himself.
Then he sends for a doctor to cure or to kill,
With his wonderful skill,
And a very big bill,
All of which is worth nil,
But who gives him offense, as well as a pill,
By dropping a hint about making his will;
For the game's up at last,
The grave die is cast,
Never was fretful antiquity mended —
So the lonely life of the bachelor's ended.
Nobody mourns him', nobody sighs,
Nobody misses him', nobody cries;
For, whether a fool', or whether he's wise,
Nobody grieves' when a bachelor dies.
Now, gentlemen! mark me, for this is the life
That is led by a man never bless'd with a wife;
And this is the way that he yields up his breath,
Attested by all who are in at the death.

["The Rising-1776."- T. B. Read.]
Out of the North the wild news came
Far flashing on its wings of flame,
Swift as the boreal light which flies
At midnight through the startled skies.
And there was tumult in the air,
The fife's shrill note, the drum's loud beat,
And through the wide land everywhere
The answering tread of hurrying feet;
While the first oath of Freedom's gun
Came on the blast from Lexington;
And Concord roused, no longer tame,
Forgot her old baptismal name,
Made bare her patriot arm of power,
And swelled the discord of the hour.
Within its shade of elm and oak
The church of Berkley Manor stood;

There Sunday found the rural folk,
And some esteemed of gentle blood.
How sweet the hour of Sabbath talk,
The vale with peace and sunshine full,
Where all the happy people walk,
Decked in their homespun flax and wool!
Where youths' gay hats with blossoms bloom;
And every maid with simple art,
Wears on her breast, like her own heart,
A bud whose depths are all perfume;
While every garment's gentle stir
Is breathing rose and lavender.
The pastor came: his snowy locks
Hallowed his brow of thought and care;
And calmly, as shepherds lead their flocks,
He led into the house of prayer.
""
The pastor rose: the prayer was strong;
The psalm was warrior David's song;
The text, a few short words of might —
"The Lord of hosts shall arm the right!
He spoke of wrongs too long endured,
Of sacred rights to be secured;
Then from his patriot tongue of flame
The startling words for Freedom came.
The stirring sentences he spake
Compelled the heart to glow or quake;
And, rising on his theme's broad wing.
And grasping in his nervous hand
The imaginary battle-brand,
In face of death he dared to fling
Defiance to a tyrant king.

Even as he spoke, his frame, renewed
In eloquence of attitude,
Rose, as it seemed, a shoulder higher;
Then swept his kindling glance of fire
From startled pew to breathless choir;
When suddenly his mantle wide
His hands impatient flung aside,
And, lo! he met their wondering eyes
Complete in all a warrior's guise.
A moment there was awful pause -
When Berkley cried, "Cease, traitor! cease!
God's temple is the house of peace!”
The other shouted, "Nay, not so;
When God is with our righteous cause,
His holiest places then are ours,
His temples are our forts and towers

In this the dawn of freedom's day,
There is a time to fight and pray!'

The enlisting trumpet's sudden roar
Rang through the chapel, o'er and o'er,

Of dusty death must wake and hear.
And there the startling drum and fife
Fired the living with fiercer life;
While overhead, with wild increase,
Forgetting its ancient toll of peace,
The great bell swung as ne'er before.

I ask you, then struck with dismay, I ask it, not sepa-

same predicament I ask you if Jesus Christ were to appear
in this temple, in the midst of this assembly, in judgment,
and separate the sheep from the goats, think you the larger
portion of us here present would be placed on the right?
Think you there would be half? Do you believe there would
be simply ten righteous, which God once did not find in
five entire cities? I ask you - you know not. I too am
ignorant: thou only, O God! knowest who are thine.
But if we know not who belong to God, we are at least
certain that the wicked do not. Who, then, are the right-
eous in this assembly? Titles, and rank, and riches must be
reckoned as nothing; you will be stripped of them in the
presence of Jesus Christ. Who, then, are here? Many
sinners who will not be converted; a still larger number who
would, but delay their conversion; some who repent but to

[From "National Character."
-Maxey]
The loss of a firm national character, or the degradation
of a nation's honor, is the inevitable prelude to her de-
struction. Behold the once proud fabric of a Roman
empire an empire carrying its arts and arms into every
part of the eastern continent; the monarchs of mighty king-
doms dragged at the wheels of her triumphal chariots; her
eagle waving over the ruins of desolated countries. Where
is her splendor, her wealth, her power, her glory? Extin-
guished forever. Her moldering temples, the mournful
vestiges of her former grandeur, afford a shelter to her mut-
tering monks. Where are her statesmen, her sages, her
philosophers, her orators, her generals? Go to their solitary
tombs and inquire. She lost her national character, and her
destruction followed. The ramparts of her national pride
were broken down, and vandalism desolated her classic
fields.

Such, the warning voice of antiquity, the example of all
republics proclaim, may be our fate. But let us no longer
indulge these gloomy anticipations. The commencement of

our liberty presages the dawn of a brighter period to the
world. That bold, enterprising spirit which conducted our
heroes to peace and safety, and gave us a lofty rank amid
the empires of the world, still animates the bosoms of their
descendants. Look back to that moment when they un-
barred the dungeons of the slave and dashed his fetters to
the earth; when the sword of a Washington leaped from its
scabbard to avenge the slaughter of our countrymen. Place
their example before you. Let the sparks of their veteran
wisdom flash across your minds, and the sacred altar of your
liberty, crowned with immortal honors, rise before you.
Relying on the virtue, the courage, the patriotism, and the
strength of our country, we may expect our national charac-
ter will become more energetic, our citizens more enlight-
ened, and we may hail the age as not far distant when will
be heard, as the proudest exclamation of man, I AM AN
AMERICAN!
108. MEDIAN STRESS.
1. The Median Stress (
) is the appli-
cation of force to the middle of the syllable or word.
2. The Median Stress consists of a gradual swelling
of voice to the middle of the syllable or word, and
then a gradual diminution of force and pitch to the
end.
109. LAW OF USE.
The Median Stress is used in the expression of
grandeur, sublimity, pathos, reverence and devotion.
The intensity of the stress varies with the degree of
emotion.

111. FINAL STRESS.
1. The Final Stress
is the applica-
tion of Force to the last part of the syllable or word.
2. The Final Stress consists of a gradual increase of
force till the end of the syllable or word is reached,
when the force culminates in a violent explosive utter-
ance.
112. LAW OF USE.
1. The Final Stress is used in expressing a dogged
determination, contempt, rebuke, disgust, revenge, de-
fiance and hatred.
2. This is emphatically the stress of decisive state-
ments. Its use, with those to whom it is natural, ad-
mits of no equivocation.
3. In this connection, the pupil may profitably
select any ten persons of his acquaintance, and observe
their conversation for a time; he will be surprised to
notice what a wonderful index their voice-elements are
to their peculiar temperaments. Stress, quality,
pitch and voice slides are significant exponents of
character.

termined purpose, earnest resolve, manly protest,

I do not rise to fawn or cringe to this house; I do not
rise to supplicate you to be merciful toward the nation to
which I belong, - toward a nation which, though subject to
England, yet is distinct from it. It is a distinct nation:
it has been treated as such by this country, as may be
proved by history and by seven hundred years of tyranny.
I call upon this house, as you value the liberty of England,
not to allow the present nefarious bill to pass. In it are
involved the liberties of England, the liberty of the press,
and of every other institution dear to Englishmen.
Against the bill I protest in the name of the Irish people,
and in the face of Heaven. I treat with scorn the puny and
pitiful assertions that grievances are not to be complained
of, that our redress is not to be agitated; for in such cases
remonstrances cannot be too strong, agitation cannot be too
violent, to show to the world with what injustice our claims
are met, and under what tyranny the people suffer.

assembled multitude, listening to the impassioned ap-
peals of a skillful orator, pleading the cause of suf-
fering humanity, or denouncing insatiate ambition,
unbridled licentiousness or unchecked tyranny, is won-
derful and beyond our comprehension. If, however,
employed in the expression of common-place ideas and
trivial thoughts, it can excite in cultivated minds only
ridicule and disgust.
5. Children are usually deficient in the power of
Thorough Stress, and on attempting to apply it to one
or more words, are apt to run into a high, monotonous
chant that is extremely unpleasant to hearers. To
avoid this tendency, examples should be used for the
practice of this stress containing words at their close
which require some other stress.
[See first example below; the words, "he said,"
require Radical Stress.]
120. LAW OF USE.
The Thorough Stress is employed to express lofty

With all the hopes of future years,

What workmen wrought thy ribs of steel,
Who made each mast, and sail, and rope,
What anvils rang, what hammers beat,
In what a forge, and what a heat,
Were shaped the anchors of thy hope.
Fear not each sudden sound and shock,
'Tis of the wave, and not the rock;
'Tis but the flapping of the sail,
And not a rent made by the gale.

[From "Chatham's Rebuke of Lord Suffolk."]
"These abominable principles, and this more abominable

vindicate the religion of their God, to defend and support the
justice of their country. I call upon the bishops to inter-

curses it in the worlds of eternal despair! Speak out, my
friends: would you exchange it for the demon's drink, ALCO-
HOL?" A shout, like the roar of a tempest, answered "No!"
127. PITCH.
1. Pitch is the degree of elevation or depression of
sound.
2. We say that one tone is higher than another
when the number of vibrations produced in the utter-
ance of one is greater than the other.
3. Pitch in music is determined by the unvarying
musical scale, and transitions from high to low or the
reverse, are made by steps; while in speech the appro-
priate pitch depends upon the sentiment to be ex-
pressed and the construction of the vocal organs of the
speaker; and the various changes are made by slides
of the voice called the concrete movement.
4. A number of persons singing the same piece of
music would employ the same pitch, but if these same
persons read the same selection, though it require a
high or low pitch, there is scarcely any probability
that their voices would be pitched upon the same key;
and yet, each, using his appropriate pitch for the senti-
ment, would read it correctly. In the first instance
the pitch is determined by musical instruments; in the
latter by the voices of the respective individuals.
5. All that has been said concerning the influence of
emotion in determining the appropriate element in
vocal expression applies to pitch. These conditions
operate directly upon the vocal organs, - tension of
the vocal chords, producing a high pitch, arises from


## p. 136 (#162) ############################################

136
COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
exaltation of spirit; relaxation of these chords, produc-
ing low pitch, accompanies mental depression; while
a tranquil state of mind leaves the vocal chords in their
natural condition, and a pitch midway between high
and low will be selected.
128. DIVISIONS OF PITCH.
1. Since the sentiment determines the appropriate
Pitch, three divisions are naturally formed, which we
designate High, Middle and Low.
2. These divisions are not absolute, and have no
definite place on the musical scale. They vary accord-
ing to intensity of feeling and the natural key of dif-
ferent voices.
3. Each of these divisions has an extended compass,
since many emotions that are classed as exciting, differ
widely in degree and in their influence upon individ-
uals; hence, we may have pitch high, moderately high,
and very high, and the same is true of low pitch.
The pupil must decide from the intensity of the sen-
timent what degree of high or low pitch he shall use,
bearing in mind that the greater the agitation from
joyous or angry emotions, the higher the pitch; and,
conversely, the greater the depression from emotions.
of solemnity or grief, the lower the pitch.
129. Exercises.—
NOTE. In the practice of these exercises the pupil must pre-
serve the same Quality throughout the various divisions. Utter
each element in Low, Middle and High Pitch, next in the order
Middle, High and Low, then give the sounds in the order High,
Low, Middle.

[From "Robinson Crusoe Finds his Man Friday."― Defoe.]
I smiled at him, and looked pleasantly, and beckoned to
him to come still nearer: at length he came close to me;
and then he kneeled down again, kissed the ground, and laid
his head upon the ground, and taking me by the foot, set my
foot upon his head: this, it seems, was in token of swearing
to be my slave forever. I took him up, and made much of
him, and encouraged him all I could. But there was more
work to do yet; for I perceived that the savage whom I
knocked down was not killed, but stunned with the blow, and
began to come to himself; so I pointed to him, and showed
him the savage, that he was not dead; upon this he spoke
some words to me, and though I could not understand them,
yet I thought they were pleasant to hear; for they were the
first sound of a man's voice that I had heard, my own
excepted, for above twenty-five years.

The light consisted of fifteen argand lamps, placed within
smooth concave reflectors twenty-one inches in diameter,
and arranged in two horizontal circles one above the
other, facing every way excepting directly down the Cape.
These were surrounded, at a distance of two or three feet,
by large plate-glass windows, which defied the storms with
iron sashes, on which rested the iron cap.
All the iron-work, except the floor, was painted white.
And thus the light-house was completed. We walked slowly
round in that narrow space as the keeper lighted. each lamp
in succession, conversing with him at the same moment that
many a sailor on the deep witnessed the lighting of the High-
land Light. His duty was to fill and trim and light his
lamps, and keep bright the reflectors. He filled them every
morning, and trimmed them commonly once in the course of
the night.
DIDACTIC THOUGHT.

["A Psalm of Life."-Longfellow.]
Tell me not, in mournful numbers,
"Life is but an empty dream!'
For the soul is dead that slumbers,
And things are not what they seem.
""
Life is real! life is earnest!
And the grave is not its goal;
"Dust thou art, to dust returnest,"
Was not spoken of the soul.
Not enjoyment, and not sorrow,
Is our destined end or way;
But to act, that each to-morrow
Find us farther than to-day.

Be not like dumb, driven cattle!
Be a hero in the strife!
Trust no Future, howe'er pleasant!
Let the dead Past bury its dead!
Act act in the living Present!

Lives of great men all remind us
We can make our lives sublime,
And, departing, leave behind us
Footprints on the sands of time.
Footprints, that perhaps another,
Sailing o'er life's solemn main,
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother,
Seeing, shall take heart again.
Let us, then, be up and doing,
With a heart for any fate;
Still achieving, still pursuing,
Learn to labor and to wait.

As it runs through the realm of tears,
With a faultless rhythm and a musical rhyme
And a broader sweep and a surge sublime,
As it blends in the ocean of years!
How the winters are drifting like flakes of snow,
And the summers like birds between,
And the years in the sheaf, how they come and they go
On the river's breast with its ebb and flow,
As it glides in the shadow and sheen!
There's a Magical Isle up the river Time,
Where the softest of airs are playing.
There's a cloudless sky and tropical clime,
And a song as sweet as a vesper chime,
And the Junes with the roses are straying.
And the name of this Isle is "the Long Ago,"
And we bury our treasures there;
There are brows of beauty and bosoms of snow,
There are heaps of dust- -oh! we love them so
And there are trinkets and tresses of hair.

Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood,
And do such business as the bitter day
Would quake to look on. Soft-now to my mother,
Oh! heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:

EXERCISES IN PITCH.
1. So much of the speaker's skill in the application
of the other elements depends upon his command of
every degree of pitch, that the following exercises are
added to secure greater compass than is afforded by
preceding examples.
2. Pronounce each name in the following list with
pure tone, moderate force, radical stress, as you
would if calling to the individuals situated at dis-
tances indicated by the number of feet opposite his
name. Repeat the names in reverse order, and after-
ward promiscuously, always imagining the distance to
which your voice is to be heard:-

3. Begin with one and count to ten, starting with
your lowest pitch, and ending with your highest. Re-
verse the order. Maintain a moderate force. Avoid
the musical scale.
136. MOVEMENT.
1. Movement is the degree of rapidity or slowness
with which words are uttered in continuous discourse.
2. Movement, like other elements of vocal expres-
sion, depends upon the nature of the thought to be
spoken; and as the moods of mind, like an April sky,
are constantly changing, now buoyant with hope or
exhilarated with joy, and anon sobered in serious con-
templation or depressed by grief, there is necessarily
little uniformity in the rate of human speech.
3. The slow and measured tread, timed in unison
with the mournful dirge, suggests gloom and sorrow;
while the lively step of the merry dancers in fling or
reel, betray the utmost exhilaration of mind and body.
"The grave psalm and the song of serious sentiment
express, in their measured regularity, the adaptation
of gentle and moderate movement to tranquil and
sedate feeling."
4. A perfect command of every degree of move-
ment is essential to correct and effective reading or
speaking. Ignorance of this element gives the read-
ing and declamation of our pupils that monotonous
drawl which renders exercises so insipid and tedious
to visitors.
5. Appropriate movement is indispensable in rousing

and retaining the attention of an audience; hence, no
pains should be spared to adapt the movement of every
selection to the sentiment intended to be conveyed.
137. CLASSES OF MOVEMENT.
The natural divisons of Movement are, RAPID,
MODERATE and SLOW, with the further subdivisions of
very rapid and very slow.
138. MODERATE MOVEMENT.
1. Moderate Movement is used in unimpassioned
discourse, in the expression of narrative, descriptive
and didactic thought.
2. The term "Moderate" must not be understood
as representing a uniform rate. It includes a rate of
movement that is constantly varying with the senti-
ment between rapid and slow.

[“Trial of Hastings.” - Macaulay.]
On October 13, 1788, the sittings of the court commenced.
The place was worthy of such a trial. It was the great hall
of William Rufus - the hall which had resounded with the
acclamations at the inauguration of thirty kings. Neither
military nor civil pomp was wanting. The gray old walls
were hung with scarlet. The long galleries were crowded by

such an audience as has rarely excited the fears or the emu-
lation of an orator.
There were gathered together, from all parts of a great,
free, enlightened, and prosperous empire, grace and female
loveliness, wit and learning, the representatives of every
science and of every art. There were seated round the
queen the fair-haired young daughters of the house of
Brunswick. There the ambassadors of great kings and
commonwealths gazed with admiration on a spectacle which
no other country in the world could present. There Sid-
dons, in the prime of her majestic beauty, looked with
emotion on a scene surpassing all the imitations of the stage.
There the historian of the Roman empire (Gibbon) thought
of the days when Cicero plead the cause of Sicily against
Verres, and when, before a Senate that still retained some
show of freedom, Tacitus thundered against the oppressor
of Africa. There were seen, side by side, the greatest
scholar and the greatest painter of the age. The spectacle
had allured Reynolds from that easel which has preserved to
us the thoughtful foreheads of so many writers and statesmen,
and the sweet smiles of so many noble matrons. It had in-
duced Parr to suspend his labors in that dark and profound
mine from which he had extracted a vast treasure of erudi-
tion.
DESCRIPTION.

["Gibraltar.” Mark Twain.]
We were approaching the famed Pillars of Hercules, and
already the African one, "Ape's Hill," a grand old moun-
tain with summit streaked with granite ledges, was in sight.
The ancients considered the Pillars of Hercules the head

of navigation and the end of the world. The information
the ancients did not have was very voluminous. In a few
moments a lonely and enormous mass of rock, standing
seemingly in the centre of the wide strait and apparently
washed on all sides by the sea, swung magnificently into
view, and we needed no tedious traveled parrot to tell us it
was Gibraltar. There could not be two rocks like that in
one kingdom.
The Rock of Gibraltar is about a mile and a half long,
by fourteen hundred to fifteen hundred feet high, and a
quarter of a mile wide at its base. One side and one end
of it come about as straight up out of the sea as the side of
a house; the other end is irregular, and the other side is
a steep slant which an army would find it very difficult to
climb. At the foot of this slant and occupying a part of it
is the walled town of Gibraltar.
Everywhere on hillside, in the precipice, by the sea, on
the heights everywhere you choose to look, Gibraltar is
clad with masonry and bristling with guns. Pushed out
into the sea on the end of a flat, narrow strip of land, it
makes a striking and lively picture from whatsoever point
you contemplate it. A few hundred yards of this flat
ground at its base belongs to the English, and then,
extending across the strip from the Atlantic to the Med-
iterranean, a distance of a quarter of a mile, comes the
"neutral ground," a space two or three hundred yards wide,
which is free to both parties.

"Are you going through Spain to Paris?" That question
had been bandied about the ship, day and night, from Fayal
to Gibraltar, and I thought I could never get so tired of
hearing any one combination of words again, or more tired
of answering, "I don't know." At the last moment six or
seven of our number had sufficient decision of character to

make up their minds to go, and did go, and I felt a sense
of relief at once; it was forever too late, now, and I could
make up my mind at my leisure not to go. I must have a
prodigious quantity of mind; it takes me as much as a week
sometimes to make it up.
But behold how annoyances repeat themselves! We had
no sooner got rid of the Spain distress than the Gibraltar
guides started another, a tiresome repetition of a legend
that had nothing very astonishing about it even in the first
place: “That high hill yonder is called the Queen's Chair;
it is because one of the queens of Spain placed her chair
there when the French and Spanish troops were besieging
Gibraltar, and said she would never move from the spot till
the English flag was lowered from the fortresses. If the
English had not been gallant enough to lower the flag for a
few hours one day, she would have had to break her oath or
die up there."
We rode on mules up the steep, narrow streets, and entered
the subterranean galleries the English have blasted out in the
rock. Here, at short intervals, great guns frown out upon
the sea and town, through portholes five and six hundred
feet above the ocean. These guns command the peninsula
and the adjacent harbors. From the lofty portholes you
get superb views of the sea. At one place, where a jutting
crag was hollowed out into a great chamber, whose furniture
was huge cannon, and whose windows were portholes, a
glimpse was caught of a hill not far away, and a soldier
said: "That high hill yonder is called the Queen's Chair;
it is because a queen of Spain placed her chair there once
when" et cetera, et cetera.
On the topmost pinnacle of Gibraltar we halted a good
while, and no doubt the mules were tired. They had a right

to be. The military road was good, but rather steep, and
there was a good deal of it. The view from the narrow
ledge was magnificent; from it vessels seeming like tiniest
little toy-boats were turned into noble ships by the tele-
scope, and other vessels that were fifty miles away, and
even sixty, they said, and invisible to the naked eye, could
be clearly distinguished. Below, on one side, we looked
down upon an endless mass of batteries, and on the other
straight down to the sea.
While I was resting comfortably on a rampart, and cooling
my baking head in the delicious breeze, an officious guide
belonging to another party came up and said:
“That high
hill, yonder, sir, is called the Queen's Chair." "Sir," said
I, interrupting him—"sir, I am a helpless orphan, in a for-
eign land. Have pity on me. Don't- now don't-inflict
that most tiresome old legend on me any more to-day."
DIDACTIC THOUGHT.
[From "Shun Debt.'
Bulwer.]
Easy to keep out of debt! No, my young friend, it is
difficult. Are you rich? The bland tradesman cries, "Pay
when you please." Are you poor? Still your character is
as yet without stain, and your character is a property on
which you can borrow a trifle. But when you borrow on
your character, it is your character that you leave in pawn.
Young friend, learn to say No. The worst that the "No"
can inflict on you is a privation ·
always short of
starvation. No young man with the average health of youth
need be in danger of starving. Be contented. Say No!
Keep out of peril your honor. Shake hands; we are agreed.

The world was void:
The populous and the powerful was a lump,
Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless;
A lump of death, a chaos of hard clay.
The rivers, lakes, and ocean all stood still,
And nothing stirred within their silent depths.
Ships, sailorless, lay rotting on the sea,
And their masts fell down piecemeal; as they dropped
They slept on the abyss, without a surge.
The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave;
The moon, their mistress, had expired before;
The winds were withered in the stagnant air,
And the clouds perished: Darkness had no need
Of aid from them-she was the universe.

Spare me and mine; or let us need the wrath

would fail to express; accordingly, words are uttered
in LONG, SHORT or MEDIUM QUANTITY, according to
the significance or intensity of the ideas they are em-
ployed to express.
4. It is the application of this principle― coupled
with the proper movement and pauses that gives such
majesty and power to the rendition of Shakespeare's
great compositions, when such a master artist as a
Macready, Kean or Booth throws his conceptions into
the delivery.
147. LONG QUANTITY.
Long Quantity is an indefinite prolongation of single
syllables and words.
148. LAW OF USE.
Long Quantity is applied to words of dignity and
strength, according to the intensity of sentiment and
attendant circumstances, in the expression of tender-
ness, reverence, adoration, solemnity, sublimity, shout-
ing, calling and commanding.

[From "Claribel's Prayer.” — Linde Palmer.]
The day, with cold, gray feet, clung shivering to the hills,
While o'er the valley still night's rain-fringed curtains fell;
But waking Blue Eyes smiled, ""Tis ever as God wills;
He knoweth best; and be it rain or shine, 'tis well.
Praise God!" cried always little Claribel.
Then sank she on her knees, with eager, lifted hands;
Her rosy lips made haste some dear request to tell:
"Oh Father, smile, and save this fairest of all lands,
And make her free, whatever hearts rebel.
Amen! Praise God!" cried little Claribel.
-
"And, Father," still arose another pleading prayer,
"O, save my brother, in the rain of shot and shell;
Let not the death-bolt, with its horrid, streaming hair,
Dash light from those sweet eyes I love so well.
Than he whose golden hair I love so well.
Amen! Praise God!" cried little Claribel.
―――
"But, Father, grant that when the glorious fight is done,
And up the crimsom sky the shouts of Freedom swell,
Grant that there be no nobler victor 'neath the sun
When the gray and dreary day shook hands with grayer
night,
The heavy air was filled with clangor of a bell.
"O, shout!" the herald cried, his worn eyes brimmed with
light;
""Tis victory! O, what glorious news to tell!'
"Praise God! He heard my prayer," cried Claribel.

“But, pray you, soldier, was my brother in the fight?
And in the fiery rain? O, fought he brave and well?”
"Dear child," the herald cried, "there was no braver sight
Than his young form, so grand 'mid shot and shell."
"Praise God!" cried trembling little Claribel.
"And rides he now with victor's plumes of red,
While trumpet's golden throats his coming steps foretell?"
The herald dropped a tear. "Dear child," he softly said,
"Thy brother evermore with conquerors shall dwell."
"Praise God! He heard my prayer," cried Claribel.
"With victors wearing crowns and bearing palms," he said,
A snow of sudden fear upon the rose lips fell;
"O, sweetest herald, say my brother lives," she plead.
"Dear child, he walks with angels, who in strength excel,
Praise God, who gave this glory, Claribel."
The cold, gray day died sobbing on the weary hills,
While bitter mourning on the night wind rose and fell.
"O, child,” - the herald wept, "'tis as the dear Lord

He knoweth best, and, be it or death, 'tis well.”
"Amen! Praise God!" sobbed little Claribel.

housekeeper, without a sense of boyish delight, which would
bring down on me the reproving looks and grave admonitions
from all who have an awful sense of the proper dignity of
ministers. But I have no doubt soda and acids come to-
gether with the very best of resolutions. They are deter-
mined to restrain themselves and not foam over. Yet the
very first drop of water sets them off, and they make bub-
bles and throw them in each other's face at a furious rate,
in spite of the efforts at self government. Now what is to
be done about it? Were they not made so? And are not
some people made so as to effervesce easily? Why they were
made so is a question that should be addressed to another
quarter.
Well, I was saying that the discovery of hidden eggs was
always an excitement, and there have been times when the
excitement was prolonged and extreme. It chanced in this
wise, and in the goodly State of Indiana.
No more neat, careful, exact, and scrupulous housekeeper
ever was seen in the Hoosier State than our fair landlady,
who had us in special charge during the absence of our
proper head and queen, who sought health on the seaboard.
An old-fashioned barn there was, huge in the middle, with a
variety of sheds, lean-tos, stables, and carriage houses pro-
jecting on every side of it, as if the barn had settled a
family of little barns all around it. It was a family barn,
beloved of hens and boys. For in its roomy interior and in
the passages, bins, nooks and corners, all sorts of frolics
might be carried on; while an occasional peak at the
cracks would keep them informed when the old man was
coming.

But hens, who have a secretive tendency, a modesty of the
nest, find their paradise in such a voluminous barn. Here
they may lay in silence, and proclaim it in vociferous cackle,

Again and again came the exultant cackle, and again and
again we were without custards!
And so, one mellow autumn day, we wandered through
the garden and strolled into the barn. It was not so full
but that it had the sense of great space. It was festooned
with cobwebs, and had all the tribes of spiders that hide in
half lights. We climbed the beams, we jumped down from
far up on the hay, and finally, after sundry amusements, lay
down by the side where the shrunk boards gave us an in-
spection-crack, from which we swept the neighborhood-
saw and were unseen. Soon we heard the least possible
sound of a foot on the hay. Turning our head, we beheld
the productive but unprofitable hen stealing toward her
secret nest. It was the one time too often. We knew as
much as she did.

How rapacious are all conquerors! There was the
rounded nest, well sunk in the corner, full, brimful of
eggs thirteen, besides one for a nest egg! As Oriental
kings despoil a captured city, rob from a people, pull down
their choice architecture and quite discrown its beauty, so
we found the nest glowing white as marble, and left it
like hay.
Is there not a Providence for hens? Is there not a fate
that follows the most obscure and unwatched violence?
We put the eggs safely in our coat-tail pocket, and walked
cautiously. It recalled a piece of disreputable carelessness

on our father's part, who once sat down on a dozen eggs,
and went up as if every egg was a bomb, and every bomb an
explosion. But then he was a notoriously absent-minded
man. His very example was our safety. And yet we dwelt
with some inward mirth, as we walked to the house, on the
ludicrous figure which our father cut. Dinner was spread as
we came in. Some questions came up which diverted our
thoughts from the discovery of the nest indeed, we forgot
that we had eggs about us, and drew up to the table and sat
down with an alacrity which was only equalled by the spring
with which we got up.

filling their pockets with unlawful wealth which other men
earned, I say, "You will sit down on those eggs yet.”

shrewdness has achieved, I say to myself, "Fill your

156. SLIDES.
1. Slides are changes of Pitch, either upward or
downward, on a single note or sound. They vary in
degree of elevation or depression, according to the
nature of the sentiment.
2. Slides, also called inflections, should be distin-
guished from waves, which are sometimes termed
compound slides. The slides have but one direction
of movement, either upward or downward; while the
waves, from the peculiar significance given certain
words, by triple or double voice slides, are used to
represent the utmost variety of inflection.
3. The number of degrees of pitch through which
the voice slides, is dependent wholly upon the inten-
sity of the thought that occasions the movement. A
knowledge of this principle dispenses with a multiplic-
ity of rules, many of which are of such doubtful ap-
plication as to perplex more than aid the learner.
4. The pupil is reminded of the importance of
Slides in rendering the sense of a passage intelligible,
and he should bear in mind that a thorough under-
standing of their force and proper application will con-
tribute as much to his general delivery as any element
employed in expression.
5. Many teachers, appreciating the value of the
slides in breaking up the monotonous drawl of some
pupils, have succeeded in making passable readers by
requiring the appropriate slides to be marked in the
pupils' books, and insisting upon their use.

SLIDES.
181
6. While this method of determining the required
slide is permissible with young pupils and those un-
trained in the principles of elocution, its practice
should not be continued beyond the mastery of the
subjects of Slides and Waves.
7. The Slides are designated
157. Upward Slide and Downward Slide,
and may be represented to the eye thus:-
UPWARD SLIDE: Did he bring the
―――
book?
book.
DOWNWARD SLIDE: He did not bring the
8. In the Upward Slide the voice drops momen-
tarily on the word immediately preceding the required
elevation, and then rises above the prevailing pitch
one or more notes according to the intensity of the
sentiment.
9. In the Downward Slide there is a slight eleva-
tion of pitch on the word immediately preceding the
slide word, and then a downward movement from this
note to the general key, or one or more notes below,
according to the nature of the sentiment.
10. The extent of both slides depends upon the de-
gree of emotion prompting them; but in every instance
the space swept by the voice is marked by some one
of the musical intervals of a major scale, viz.: a
66
third," "fifth" or "octave ;" that is, the voice
slides through an interval of three, five or eight
notes.


## p. 182 (#208) ############################################

182
COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
158.
UPWARD SLIDE
The Upward Slide is an elevation of voice through
the concrete change of pitch.
2. The degree of elevation to which the voice rises
depends upon the earnestness of the speaker.
3. A mild interrogation, indicating but little inter-
est in the answer to be elicited, would require the
slide of a rising third; as,
Will you go the Falls this summer?
4. Questions arising from moderate emotion, earn-
estness, or doubt, require a rising fifth; as,
Will he condemn his own brother?
Did he die on the field of battle?
Can he leave me thus in doubt?
5. Exclamations and interrogations of intense sur-
prise, violent agitation, and overwhelming astonish-
ment, require the rising octave; as,
He did this?
What, looked he frowningly?
Seems, madame?
Nay, it is; I know not seems!
Saw who?
My lord, the king, your father.
The king? My father?
159. DOWNWARD SLIDE
1. The Downward Slide is a downward movement
of voice through the concrete change of pitch.


## p. 183 (#209) ############################################

DOWNWARD SLIDE.
183
2. The degree of depression to which the voice.
slides depends upon the completeness, exactness, or
definiteness of the thought in the speaker's mind.
3. A general statement of facts where no contradic-
tion is anticipated requires a Downward Slide of the
third; as,
Honesty will be rewarded.
4. Statements implying a settled determination and
a confidence in the speaker's ability to perform what
he proposes, require a Downward Slide of the fifth;
as,
I am determined to go.
What I purpose that I perform.
You can depend upon my promise.
5. Expressions of strong emotion, such as unques-
tioned authority, denunciation, and hatred, require the
Downward Slide of the octave; as,
Begone! Away with you!
Woe unto you Pharisees! Woe unto you Scribes?
The furies curse you.
Poison be their drink.
Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest meat they eat.
160. General Rules for the Use of Both Slides.
UPWARD SLIDE. The Upward Slide, with degrees of
elevation varying with the intensity of thought, is
employed upon the accented syllable of those words
used singly, in phrases or sentences denoting (1)
incompleteness of thought, (2) indifference, (3) un-
certainty, (4) doubt, (5) contingency, and (6)
negation; as,

1. We came over this morning to'—
2. He can take his choice'.
3. The task seems difficult'.
4. What if we are opposed in our plans'?
5. Though he sla'y me, I shall love him.
6. I do not doubt your word'.
161. DOWNWARD SLIDE.
The Downward Slide, with degrees of depression
corresponding to the intensity of thought, is employed
upon the accented syllable of those words used singly,
in phrases or in sentences denoting (1) complete-
ness of thought, (2) determination, (3) certainty,
(4) positive and decisive declaration, (5) emphatic
exclamation; as,
1. Garfield was mourned by many nations.
2. We shall attack the fort at sunrise.
3. I know that my Redeemer liv`eth.
4. Thine eyes shall see the truth of what I say.
5. I dare accusation! I defy' the honorable gentle-
man.
162. Specific Rules for the Slides.
Although the general rules will be sufficient for the
determination of the appropriate Slide in most cases,
yet sentences frequently occur in which the application
of the principles is not apparent. The following spe-
cific rules will render the selection of the proper Slide
simple for the youngest pupil:
RULE I.
Questions seeking the answer yes or no (the speaker

not knowing which) receive the Upward Slide, and
their answers, generally, the Downward Slide; as,
Will you meet me at the hotel'? Yes'.
NOTE. The answer might have been given, "Yes',- I guess so',"
if the individual addressed was indifferent about going.
RULE II.
Questions seeking the answer yes or no (the speaker
knowing which) receive the Downward Slide, and their
answers, generally, the same; as,
Is not that a magnificent tree,? Yes,.
Haven't I treated you as a gentleman? Yes,.
Did I ever wrong you? No,.
RULE III.
Questions which cannot be answered by yes or no
receive the Downward Slide, and their answers the
same; as,
When did you arrive? Yesterday.
NOTE. If the question asks for a repetition of an answer not
understood, the emphasis on "when" will change the Slide; as,
When did you say'?
If, however, the question receives no answer, and is
repeated, the Slide not only remains the same, but
passes downward through another interval; as,
When did you arrive?
-


## p. 186 (#212) ############################################

COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
RULE IV.
A completion of sense contained in a phrase or a
clause, whether at the close of a sentence or not, re-
quires the Downward Slide; as,
"And everywhere it is a thing of beauty — gleaming
in the dew-drop; singing in the summer ra'in; shin-
ing in the ice-gem, till the trees all seem turned to
living jewels—whose warp is the rain-drop of earth',
whose woof is the sun-beam of heaven, all checked
over the celestial flowers, by the mystic hand of re-
fraction."
RULE V.
Words expressing a contrast have opposite Slides
usually the first word receives the Upward and the
second, the Downward Slide; as,
I have experienced plea'sure and pain, joy' and sor-
ro'w, and I know the uncertainties of life.
NOTE. When one side of the contrast is affirmed and the other
denied, the latter has the Upward and the former the Downward
Slide, regardless of the order in which they occur; as,
I am here to act', not to talk.
-
RULE VI.
Words expressing pity, kindness, gentle reproof, en-
treaty and tender emotions, usually require the Upward
Slide of the third; as,
Poor little child! how she suffers'.
O John! Do come away'.

WAVES.
187
Is your father well', the old man of whom ye spa'ke?
Is he' yet aiiv'e?
163. WAVES.
1. The Wave, sometimes termed circumflex, from
the twisting motion of the tone in passing over the
vowels, is a compound movement of voice on a single
syllable, word, or sentence.
2. The number and character of waves are as indefi-
nite as human sentiments, emotions, and passions.
Hence, no rule for their exact application can be given
beyond the
164. GENERAL LAW OF USE.
The Waves are employed to express contrast, or
comparison, double meaning, insinuation, wit, jest,
drollery, irony, sarcasm, sneer and contempt.
EXERCISES IN WAVES.
――
1. The student will study carefully each sentence
and endeavor to apply the waves in the manner indi-
cated by the diagram following it.
2. To secure facility in expression, the student
should concentrate his mental powers upon all the
conditions surrounding the supposed speaker of these
sentences.
NOTE. The breaks in the diagrams mark the different words.
1. AFFECTATION: I am so fatigued.
2. ANXIETY: Where can he be?

165. MELODY.
1. Melody (Gr. sweet song) is a succession of
pleasing tones having but a limited compass above or
below the initial note.
2. Melody is one of the most valuable elements the
speaker may employ in attracting and retaining the
attention of an audience.
3. The element is employed in those rhythmical com-
positions, whether prose or poetry, expressing pathos,
tranquil pleasure, and peaceful repose.
4. To cultivate melodious tones, practice frequently
upon such words as calm, name, mine, thine, wailing,
gone, moaning, mound, home, throne, wandering, etc.,
with pure tone, subdued force, median stress, and
long quantity, imparting to your utterance a rich
musical intonation.

166. SLUR.
1. Slur is a smooth, rapid, subdued movement of
voice over certain words, phrases and clauses of less im-
portance than others with which they stand associated.
2. The object of Slur is to bring out the principal
thought of a passage as contained in the leading clause

COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
by a subdued force and rapid movement over the sub-
ordinate, or auxiliary clauses.
167. LAW OF USE.
The Slur is applied to passages expressing contrast,
repetition, explanation, modifications of persons, things,
time, place, cause, manner and degree, and all paren-
thetical expressions.
168. Examples:
[The Slurred passages are printed in Italic letters
and should be read more rapidly and with lower pitch
and less force than the rest.]
――――
1. The Assyrian came down like a wolf on the fold.
2. It is a common thing, in speaking of the sea, to
call it a waste of waters.'
""
3. If, like a desert itself, the ocean makes all the
other wildernesses of the earth to bud and blossom as
a rose, it ought not to be termed a waste.
4. That boy was well trained who when asked why
he did not pocket some pears, for nobody was there to
see, replied, "Yes, there was somebody; I was there
to see myself, and I don't intend ever to see myself
do a dishonest thing."
5. Bring into subjection while the task is easy, all
the powers God has given you.

day, and, like a wise man, have passed by the taverns
and stopped at the running brooks and well-curbs.

169. EMPHASIS.
1. Emphasis is that peculiar utterance of words,
phrases and clauses which renders them especially
prominent or significant.
2. The importance of Emphasis in determining the
meaning of a sentence may be inferred from an exami-
nation of the following sentence, which by placing the
Emphasis upon the marked words, is capable of ex-
pressing six different meanings:
1. John did not say you bought that book; Henry
said so.
2. John did not say you bought that book; he wrote it.
3. John did not say you bought that book; but
that your sister bought it.
4. John did not say you bought that book; but that
you found it.
5. John did not say you bought thut book; but this
book.
6. John did not say you bought that book; it was
your slate.
The following anecdote, related by Sheridan in his
"Art of Speaking," will illustrate the value of a
knowledge of the principles of Emphasis to those oc-
cupying public positions :-
"A clergyman's curate, having occasion to read in the
church our Savior's sayings to the disciples, Luke xxiv: 26,
13

COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
"Oh, fools, and slow of heart [that is, backward] to believe
all that the prophets have written of me!" placed the em-
phasis upon the word believe; as if Christ had called them
fools for believing. Upon the rector's finding fault, when he
read it next, he placed the emphasis upon all; as if it had
been foolish in the disciples to believe all. The rector again
blaming this manner of placing the emphasis, the good
curate accented the word prophets; as if the prophets had
been persons in no respect worthy of belief."
3. Emphasis is effected by a change of Quality,
Force, Stress, Pitch or Movement, or by a combina-
tion of two or more of these elements.
4. Perfect command of every variety of Emphasis
depends upon an accurate perception of the sentiment
and its relation to and connection with every other
thought with which it is associated, and skill in the
control of all the elements of vocal expression pre-
viously explained.
5. The most common method of applying Emphasis
is by an increase of Force, but that is by no means
the only method. Pupils should guard against its use
where it would not be indicated by the sentiment.
Many instructors teach their pupils that "Emphasis
is an increase of Force." It is not always an increase
of Force. The etymology of the word signifies "to
show," to indicate ;" and it is observed, even among
illiterate persons, that special prominence or peculiar
significance is given to words by other elements than
Force. In our conversation, while under the influence
of natural impulses, we employ such variety of Em-

EMPHASIS OF QUALITY.
195
phasis as is appropriate to the thought we express.
It is in our reading, performed according to the mechan-
ical and erroneous teachings of our youth, that we lay
on the force, stroke upon stroke, regardless of the
nature of the sentiment we are endeavoring to express.
170. LAW OF USE.
Emphasis, effected by the use of that Element in-
dicated by the sentiment, is employed to intensify the
meaning of important words and phrases, to express
contrast and in repetition.
171. EMPHASIS OF QUALITY.
1. Emphasis of Quality is a change in the utterance
of certain words from the general Quality of the
sentiment.
2. The Quality employed in giving the Emphasis
depends upon the nature of the peculiar thought that
occasions the emphasis. The change is usually made
from the Normal to one, or a combination of several
of the Abnormal Qualities.
172. Examples:
1. I hate him, for he is a Christian.
2. Give me liberty or give me death.
3. I repeat it, sir, the charge is false.
4. Whence and what art thou, execrable shape?
5. Quoth the raven, "Nevermore."

6. Let that plebeian talk; 'tis not my trade.

7. The guide, turning quickly, cried out, " Hush!"
8. Or whispering with white lips - "The foe!
They come ! they come!"


## p. 196 (#222) ############################################

COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
173. EMPHASIS OF FORCE.
Emphasis of Force is an increase or a decrease of
force on individual words from that which prevails in
the sentence.
174. Examples:
1. I said up, not down.
2. Why do you call him our friend?
3. Is it so nominated in the bond?
4. Whence, then, cometh wisdom?
5. But on the way it burst, it fell; and lo!
A skeleton! (a decrease of force.)
175. EMPHASIS OF STRESS.
Emphasis of Stress is a change in the intensity of
the prevailing stress, or the substitution of some other
stress which is appropriate to the thought to be empha-
sized.
176. Examples:
1. I see I am not cut out to be a good wife.
2. On what compulsion must I? Tell me that.
3. It is not so expressed; but what of that?
'Twere good you do so much in charity.
4. Back to thy punishment, false fugitive.
5. Ah, why should we in the world's riper years,
Neglect God's ancient sanctuaries?
6. 'Tis said his arrows never miss!
Indeed! I'll take exquisite vengeance.
7. Ecstasy! My pulse, as yours, doth temperately
keep time.

177. EMPHASIS OF PITCH.
Emphasis of Pitch is an elevation or depression of
voice on those words that express sudden fright or joy,
sadness, or dejection.
178. Examples:
1. Then the shout was heard before our door,
"Fire! fire! fire!"
66
2. It snows! cries the school-boy, “ Hurrah!” and
his shout

Is ringing through parlor and hall.
3. Read on her urn, "A broken heart."
This tells her tale. (lowering of pitch.)
179. EMPHASIS OF MOVEMENT.
Emphasis of Movement is an increase or a decrease in
the prevailing rate of Movement.
180. Examples:
1. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced
it to you, trippingly on the tongue.
2. Cyrus Drew!"— then a silence fell —

This time no answer followed the call.
3. There, on a snow-white couch,

THE PURPOSES OF EMPHASIS.
-
The object of the speaker in the application of em-
phasis may be to bring out the importance of a single
word, to contrast one word with another, or to present
a succession of ideas in the order of a climax.


## p. 198 (#224) ############################################

198
COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
ABSOLUTE EMPHASIS.
Absolute Emphasis makes prominent the leading
idea of sentences without contrast; as
1. A full purse never lacks friends.
2. Idleness is the parent of want and shame
3. The offender never pardons.
4. Humility is the foundation of all virtue.
ANTITHETIC EMPHASIS.
―――――――――――
Antithetic Emphasis expresses a contrast or relation
of two or more ideas; as
1. Deliberate slowly; act promptly.
2. Example teaches more than precept.
3. When drink enters, wisdom departs.
4. I fear not death; and shall I fear thee?
―――――――
CUMULATIVE EMPHASIS.
Cumulative Emphasis is a succession of emphatic
words, each having its peculiar style of emphasis
more marked than the preceding; as-
1. You call me misbeliever, CUT-THROAT DOG.
2. Nearer, CLEARER, DEADLIER than before.
3. "Forward, the LIGHT BRIGADE!
CHARGE FOR THE GUNS!" he said.

181. PAUSES.
1. Pauses are temporary suspensions of the voice
between words, phrases and sentences.
2. Pauses are used for the purpose of indicating the
syntactical structure of sentences, thus serving as a
guide to the author's meaning; or to give intensity, viv-
idness, clearness, embellishment, or impressiveness to


## p. 199 (#225) ############################################

PAUSES.
199
the words between which they occur.
The former are
called Grammatical Pauses, the latter, Rhetorical
Pauses.
3. The Grammatical Pauses, as the comma, semi-
colon, colon and period, although used in determining
the relative closeness of connection of words with each
other in thought, have no absolute length of time: a
period may represent the time occupied in uttering one
syllable, or it may represent the time of a dozen syl-
lables, according to the nature of the thought in which
it is used. The period in "The Isle of Long Ago,"
or "The Closing Year," would require twice or thrice
the pause required by the same mark in "Sheridan's
Ride or the first stanza of "The Bells"
""
4. The reader determines the meaning of a passage
by the grammatical pauses and applies the rhetorical
pause according to the nature of the sentiment which
the words express. There will be many more pauses
than punctuation marks, so that while these should
be consulted to know the sense of the passage, they
must not determine or even locate the pauses. In
the sentence, "No, sir, there is none," any pause be-
tween "no" and "sir" would be improper, while
the pause after "sir" is of indefinite length, accord-
ing to the circumstances attending the utterance of
the sentence.
5. Frequent and appropriate pauses are essential to
good reading and speaking. They rouse and rivet the
attention by giving a freshness and originality to con-

tinued utterance that cannot be secured in any other
manner.
6. Definite Rules for pauses cannot be given, for the
reason that the influence of time, place, and circum-
stance is so varied that few rules could be made appli-
cable by the pupil.
7. The following comprehensive rule will guide the
intelligent learner in using the proper Pauses.
182. General Rule.
Ordinary conversation employed in description, nar-
ration, and didactic thought require moderate pauses;
lively, joyous, and excited emotions, very short pauses;
while the language of solemnity, sublimity, grandeur,
and reflective thought usually demand long, and some-
times very long pauses. Impassioned discourse re-
quires long or short pauses, according to the rapidity
or intensity of the thought.
183. Examples: GRAPHIC DESCRIPTION.
Short Pauses.

[The Sergeant's Story of the Light Brigade.]
A survivor of the celebrated ride into the jaws of death
gives in the Boston Commercial Bulletin, the following
graphic picture of the charge:-
"Lord Cardigan's eye glanced us over; then spurring his
horse forward a few paces, he said:
666 My men, we have received orders to silence that bat-
tery?'
―――――

"God save us!' my brother ejaculated. Then grasping
my hand, he said:-
"Fred, my dear fellow, good-bye; we don't know what
may happen. God bless you; keep close to me -'
"What more he might have said was lost in Lord Cardigan's
ringing shout of—
""Charge!'
66 INTO THE JAWS OF DEATH.
"We went in at a trot; the trot changed to a canter, and
the canter into a gallop. Through the lines I could see Lord
Cardigan several horse-lengths ahead riding as steadily as if
he was on parade. Now, to tell the plain truth, when we had
ridden a short distance, say one hundred paces, I felt terri-
bly afraid.
The truth flashed upon me in a moment that we
were riding into a position that would expose us to a fire on
both flanks, as well as the fire from the battery in front of
us, which we had been instructed to silence. I said to my-
self, 'This is a ride to death!' but I said it loud enough for
my brother to hear, and he answered and said:
"There goes the first!'
"The first was Lord Lucan's aid-de-camp, Captain Nolan,
who, after making a slight detour, was crossing our left to
join us in the charge. A cannon-ball had just cut him in
two as my brother spoke.
"My heart leaped into my mouth and I almost shrieked
with fear, but I restrained myself, and setting my teeth hard
I rode on. A moment later the rifle bullets from the sharp-
shooters on the hillside began to whistle about our ears.
Saddles were emptied at every step. Then came the whist-
ling shot and the shrieking shell and tore through our
squadrons, mangling men and horses, plowing bloody fur-
rows through and through our ranks. Then my fear left

me. My whole soul became filled with a thirst for revenge,
and I believe the same spirit animated every man in the
ranks. Their eyes flashed, and they ground their teeth and
pressed closer together. The very horses caught the mad
spirit, and plunged forward as if impatient to lead us to our
revenge and theirs. At this time there was not much to be
seen. A heavy, dense smoke hung over the valley, but the
flaming mouths of the guns revealed themselves to our eyes
at every moment as they belched forth their murderous con-
tents of shot and shell.
"Now a shot tore through our ranks, cutting a red line
from flank to flank, then a shell plowed an oblique and bloody
furrow from our right front to our left rear; anon a ricochet-
ting shot rose over our front ranks, fell into our centre and
hewed its way to the rear making terrible havoc in its pas-
sage. Oh! that was a ride. Horses ran riderless, and men
bareheaded, and splashed with the blood of their comrades
pressed closer and closer and ground their teeth harder, and
mentally swore a deadlier revenge as their numbers grew
smaller.
66 INTO THE GATES OF HELL.
"Alone and in front rode Cardigan, still keeping the same
distance ahead. His charger was headed for the centre of
the battery. Silently we followed him. Up to this time
neither my brother nor myself had received the slightest
scratch, although we were now riding side by side with com-
rades who at the start were separated from us by several files.
We reached the battery at last. Up to this time we had rid-
den in silence, but what a yell burst from us as we plunged
in among the Russian gunners. Well would it have been for
them if they had killed us all before we reached them. They
had done too little and too much. They had set us on fire

And there was no lack of material to work upon. They

forest, and only stopped when we reached the bank of the
Tehernaya River.
"Wheeling here, we proceeded to cut our way back again.
On the return ride I was assailed by a gigantic Russian
trooper who made a strike at me with his sabre. I partially
guarded it, but not wholly, and the next moment felt a sting-
ing pain in my neck. It passed in a moment, however, and
I was about to make short work of the trooper, when I heard
my brother cry:
"Ah! you would, would you?' and the Russian fell cleft

"We cut our way through and once more entered the fatal
valley. When half way back to our starting point a cannon
shot struck my brother and beheaded him. 'Tom, ah, thank

[From James G. Blaine's Oration on Garfield.]
GARFIELD.
Surely, if happiness can ever come from the honors or
triumphs of this world, on that quiet July morning James A.
Garfield may well have been a happy man. No foreboding
of evil haunted him; no slightest premonition of danger
clouded his sky. His terrible fate was upon him in an
instant. One moment he stood erect, strong, confident in
the years stretching peacefully out before him. The next he
lay wounded, bleeding, helpless, doomed to weary weeks of
torture, to silence, and the grave.

cause, in the very frenzy of wantonness and wickedness, by
the red hand of murder, he was thrust from the full tide of

and dazed, he could give up life, hardly aware of its relin-

quishment, but through days of deadly languor, through
weeks of agony, that was not less agony because silently
borne, with clear sight and calm courage, he looked into his
open grave. What blight and ruin met his anguished eyes,
whose lips may tell—what brilliant, broken plans, what
baffled, high ambitions, what sundering of strong, warm,
manhood's friendships, what bitter rendering of sweet house-
hold ties! Behind him a proud, expectant nation, a great
host of sustaining friends, a cherished and happy mother,
wearing the full, rich honors of her early toil and tears; the
wife of his youth, whose whole life lay in his; the little boys
not yet emerged from childhood's day of frolic; the fair
young daughter; the sturdy sons just springing into closest
companionship, claiming every day and every day rewarding
a father's love and care; and in his heart the eager, rejoic-
ing power to meet all demand. Before him, desolation and
great darkness! And his soul was not shaken.
His coun-
trymen were thrilled with instant, profound, and universal
sympathy.
Masterful in his mortal weakness, he became the centre of
a nation's love, enshrined in the prayers of a world. But
all the love and all the sympathy could not share with him
his suffering. He trod the wine-press alone. With unfal-
tering front he faced death. With unfailing tenderness he
took leave of life. Above the demoniac hiss of the assas-
sin's bullet he heard the voice of God. With simple resigna-
tion he bowed to the Divine decree.
As the end drew near, his early craving for the sea re-
turned. The stately mansion of power had been to him the
wearisome hospital of pain, and he begged to be taken from
its prison walls, from its oppressive, stifling air, from its
homelessness and hopelessness. Gently, silently, the love
of a great nation bore the pale sufferer to the longed-for

within sight of its heaving billows, within sound of its mani-
fold voices. With wan, fevered face tenderly lifted to the
cooling breeze, he looked out wistfully upon the ocean's
changing wonders; on its fair sails, whitening in the morn-
ing light; on its restless waves, rolling shoreward to break
and die beneath the noonday sun; on the red clouds of
evening, arching low to the horizon; on the serene and shin-
ing pathway of the stars. Let us think that his dying eyes
read a mystic meaning which only the rapt and parting soul
may know. Let us believe that in the silence of the reced-
ing world he heard the great waves breaking on a further
shore, and felt already upon his wasted brow the breath of
the eternal morning.

lections: "Hamlet's Soliloquy,' "Break, Break,

185. CADENCE.
1. Cadence is a gradual elevation of pitch and in-
crease of force on the third or fourth syllable preced-
ing the last one of a sentence, followed by a lowering
of the voice in the discrete or concrete movement two
or more notes below the prevailing pitch of the senti-
ment; as,

wor-
4. The true American patriot is ever a ship-
er.
186. GENERAL LAW OF USE.
The intervals through which voice passes in chang-
ing the pitch from that which prevails in the upward
and downward slide, will depend upon the character
of the sentiment; tranquil thoughts have but slight
and gradual elevation and depression, while the Ca-
dence in violent or intense emotions is abrupt and
sweeps through a greater interval of pitch.
187. CLIMAX.
1. The term Climax as used in Elocution is the proper
management of all the elements of vocal expression,
so as to render correctly and effectively the thought
contained in the rhetorical figure known by that name.
2. A sentence containing a Climax is so arranged
that each idea rises in importance, force or dignity
above that which precedes it. The most forcible
periods that have come to us from ancient orators
and writers are constructed in this order. The writ-
ings of Quintilian, Demosthenes and Cicero abound
in this beautiful figure.


## p. 208 (#234) ############################################

208
COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
3. Sometimes the order of arrangement is reversed,
when the figure is called Anti-Climax.
4. The reading of each kind of sentence requires
the application of the appropriate element indicated
by the sentiment. The changes in the Climax will
usually be in the following order: From a Normal to an
Abnormal Quality, from Moderate to Full Force, from
Middle to High Pitch, and from a Slow or Moderate to
a Rapid Movement. The Stress will depend upon the
prevailing character of the sentiment. In the Anti-
Climax, the order of changes will be reversed.
189. Examples: CLIMAX.
1. "In my affection to my country, you find me ever firm
and invariable. Not the solemn demand of my person; not
the vengeance of the Amphictyonic Council, which they de-
nounced against me; not the terror of their threat'enings;
not the flattery of their pro`mises; no, nor the fury of those
accursed wretches, whom they roused like wild beasts aga'inst
me, could ever tear this affection from my breast`."
2. If I were an American, as I am an Englishman,
while a foreign troop remained in my country I never
would lay down my arms; no', never, NE`VER,

190. MODULATION.
1. Modulation is the ready and perfect adaptation
of the appropriate elements of speech to the sentiment
designed to be conveyed.
2. The skillful modulation of the voice requires an
instantaneous and imperceptible transition from one
Qu to another, an easy increase or decrease of
Force, a ready change of Stress, and a perfect com-
mand of every degree of Pitch and Movement.
3. The good reader or speaker varies the element of
expression so skillfully that the hearer gets a sugges-
tion of the meaning of words by the very nature of
the sound in which they are uttered.
4. In impersonation, description and narration much
of the reader's success depends upon the modula-
tion of his voice. So proficient have some readers
become in the control of the vocal elements and of
their features and limbs, that an audience can with
difficulty believe the impersonator, who represents a
dozen characters in as many minutes, is not really the
several individuals represented.
5. The acquisition of this valuable power is but the
summing up, classification, and adaptation of the va-
riousRequisites of a good Elocution; " and though
this appears simple, and seems to imply nothing but

["Mrs. McWilliams and the Lightning." - Mark Twain.]
-
Well, sir, - continued Mr. McWilliams, for this was not
the beginning of his talk, the fear of lightning is one
of the most distressing infirmities a human being can be
afflicted with. It is mostly confined to women; but now
and then you find it in a little dog, and sometimes in a man.
It is a particularly distressing infirmity, for the reason that
it takes the sand out of a person to an extent which no other
fear can, and it can't be reasoned with, and neither can it be
shamed out of a person.
Well, as I was telling you, I woke up with that smothered
and unlocatable cry of "Mortimer! Mortimer!" wailing in

"Nothing. Just turning on the water. This room is
smothering hot and close. I want to bathe my face and

"You have certainly parted with the remnant of your

it strikes water fifty times. Do turn it off. Oh dear, I am
sure that nothing in this world can save us.
It does seem

"It was a—it was a picture. Knocked it down."
"Then you are close to the wall! I never heard of such
imprudence! Don't you know that there's no better con-

And you came as near as anything to swearing, too. Oh,
how can you be so desperately wicked, and your family in
such peril! Mortimer, did you order a feather bed, as I
asked you to do?"
"No. Forgot it."
"Forgot it! It may cost you your life. If you had a
feather bed, now, and could spread it in the middle of the
room and lie on it, you would be perfectly safe. Come in
here, come quick, before you have a chance to commit
any more frantic indiscretions."
I tried, but the little closet would not hold us both with
the door shut, unless we could be content to smother. I
gasped awhile, then forced my way out. My wife called out:
"Mortimer, something must be done for your preserva-

things; and the madam shut herself up with her candle.

"Mortimer, what was that?'
"Nothing but the cat."
"The cat!
Oh, destruction!
Catch her and shut her up
in the wash-stand. Do be quick, love; cats are full of elec-
tricity. I just know my hair will turn white with this night's
awful perils."
I heard the muffled sobbings again. But for that, I should
not have moved hand or foot in such a wild enterprise in the
dark.
However, I went at my task, -over chairs, and against
all sorts of obstructions, all of them hard ones, too, and
most of them with sharp edges, and at last I got kitty
cooped up, at an expense of over four hundred dollars in
broken furniture and shins. Then these muffled words came
from the closet:
"It says the safest thing is to stand on a chair in the
middle of the room, Mortimer; and the legs of the chair
must be insulated with non-conductors. That is, you must
set the legs of the chair in glass tumblers. [Ftz! — boom ·
bang! smash!] Oh, hear that! Do hurry, Mortimer, before
you are struck."
-
I managed to find and secure the tumblers. I got the last
four-broke all the rest. I insulated the chair legs, and
called for further instructions.
"Mortimer, it says 'Während eines Gewitters entferne
man Metalle, wie z. B., Ringe, Uhren, Schlüssel, etc., von
sich und halte sich auch nicht an solchen Stellen auf, wo
viele Metalle bei einander liegen, oder mit andern Körpern
verbunden sind, wie an Herden, Oefen, Eisengittern u. dgl.'
What does that mean, Mortimer? Does it mean that you
must keep metals about you, or keep them away from you?"
Well, I hardly know. It appears to be a little mixed.
All German advice is more or less mixed. However, I

about you."
66 Yes, that must be it. It stands to reason that it is.
They are in the nature of lightning-rods, you know. Put on
your fireman's helmet, Mortimer; that is mostly metal."
I got it and put it on, a very heavy and clumsy and
uncomfortable thing on a hot night in a close room. Even
my night-dress seemed to be more clothing than I strictly
needed.
"Mortimer, I think your middle ought to be protected.

Mortimer, it says, 'Das Gewitter läuten ist sehr gefähr-

dangerous not to ring the church bells during a thunder-
storm?"
"Yes, it seems to mean that, if that is the past parti-
ciple of the nominative case singular, and I reckon it is.
Yes, I think that it means that on account of the height
of the church-tower and the absence of Luftzug it would be

Our little summer establishment stands on the top of a
high range of hills, overlooking a valley. Several farm
houses are in the neighborhood, the nearest some three or
four hundred yards away.
When I, mounted on the chair, had been clanging that
dreadful bell a matter of seven or eight minutes, our shut-
ters were suddenly torn open from without, and a brilliant
bull's eye lantern was thrust in at the window, followed by
a hoarse inquiry: -

["Scott and his Dogs."— Irving.]
After my return from Melrose Abbey, Scott proposed
a ramble, to show me something of the surrounding country.
As we sallied forth, every dog in the establishment turned
out to attend us. There was the old and well-known stag-
hound, Maida, a noble animal, and a great favorite of
Scott's, and Hamlet, the black greyhound, a wild, thought-
less youngster who had not yet arrived at the years of dis-
cretion; and Finette, a beautiful setter with soft silken hair,
long pendant ears and a mild eye, the parlor favorite.
When in front of the house, we were joined by a super-
annuated greyhound, who came from the kitchen wagging
his tail, and was cheered by Scott as an old friend and com-
rade. In our walks, Scott would frequently pause in con-
versation to notice his dogs and speak to them as if rational
companions, and, indeed, there appears to be a vast deal of
rationality in these faithful attendants on man, derived from
their close intimacy with him.
Maida deported himself with a gravity becoming his age
and size, and seemed to consider himself called upon to pre-
serve a great degree of dignity and decorum in our society.
As he jogged along a little distance ahead of us, the young
dogs would gambol about him, leap on his neck, worry at his
ears and endeavor to tease him into a frolic.
The old dog would keep on for a long time with impertur-
bable solemnity, now and then seeming to rebuke the wan-
tonness of his young companions. At length he would make
a sudden turn, seize one of them and tumble him in the

"You
dust; then giving a glance at us, as much as to say,
see, gentlemen, I can't help giving way to this nonsense,"
would resume his gravity and jog on as before. Scott
amused himself with these peculiarities.
66
"I make no doubt," said he, "when Maida is alone with
these young dogs, he throws gravity aside and plays the boy
as much as any of them; but he is ashamed to do so in our
company, and seems to say: 'Have done with your non-
sense, youngsters! what will the laird and that other gentle-
man think of me if I give way to such foolery?
999
While we were discussing the humors and peculiarities of
our canine companions, some object provoked their spleen
and produced a sharp and petulant barking from the smaller
fry, but it was some time before Maida was sufficiently
roused to ramp forward two or three bounds and join in the
chorus with a deep-mouthed bow-wow! It was but a tran-
sient outbreak, and he returned instantly, wagging his tail
and looking up dubiously in his master's face, uncertain
whether he would censure or applaud.
"Ay, ay, old boy," cried Scott, you have done won-

These simple anecdotes may serve to show the delightful
play of Scott's humors and feelings in private life. His do-
mestic animals were his friends; everything about hi

["My Uncle Peter." - George Macdonald.]
I will tell you the story of my Uncle Peter, who was born
on Christmas day. The first remembrance that I have of
him is his taking me one Christmas eve to the largest toy-
shop in London, and telling me to choose any toy whatever
that I pleased. He little knew the agony of embarrassment
into which this request of his threw his astonished nephew.
I wandered about, staring like a distracted ghost at the
"wealth of Ormus and of Ind" displayed about me. Uncle
Peter followed me with perfect patience; nay, I believe, with
a delight that equalled my perplexity, for every now and then,
when I looked round to him with a silent appeal for sympathy
in the distressing dilemma into which he had thrown me, I
found him rubbing his hands and spiritually chuckling over his
victim. How long I was in making up my mind I cannot tell,
but as I look back upon this splendor of my childhood, I
feel as if I must have wandered for weeks through intermina-
ble forest-alleys of toy-bearing trees.
Uncle Peter was a little round man, and to look at him you
could not have fancied a face or a figure with less of the
romantic about them, yet I believe that the whole region of
his brain was held in fee-simple — whatever that may mean
by a race of fairy architects who built aërial castles therein,
regardless of expense. His imagination was the most distin-
guishing feature of his character, aud to hear him defend
any of his extravagances, it would appear that he considered
himself especially privileged in that respect. "Ah, my
dear," he would say to my mother, when she expostulated
with him on making some present far beyond the small means
he at that time possessed -

born on Christmas day." I do not think he had more than
a hundred pounds a year, and he must have been five and
thirty, but Uncle Peter lived in constant hope and expecta-
tion of some unexampled good luck befalling him; "For,"
said he, "I was born on Christmas day."
He was never married. When people ventured to jest
with him about being an old bachelor, he used to smile, for
anything would make him smile, but he never said anything
on the subject, and not even my mother knew whether he had
any love-story or not. I have often wondered whether his
goodness might not have come in part from his having lost
some one very dear to him, and having his life on earth puri-
fied by the thoughts of her life in heaven. But I never found
The lucky fortune which Uncle Peter had anticipated
came at last. A cousin of whom he had heard little for a
great many years, although they had been warm friends while
at school together, died in India and left him a large estate.
But before the legacy was paid to Uncle Peter, he went
through a good many of the tortures which result from being
"a king and no king." At length, after much skirmishing
with the lawyers, he succeeded in getting a thousand pounds
on Christmas eve.
out.
"NOW!" said Uncle Peter, in enormous capitals. That
night a thundering knock was heard at our door. We were
all sitting in our little dining-room-father, mother and
seven children of us-talking about what we should prepare
for the next day. The door opened, and in came the most
grotesque figure you could imagine. It was seven feet high
at least, without any head, a mere walking tree-stump, as far
as shape went, only it looked soft. The little ones were
terrified, but not the big ones of us, for from top to toe (if
it had a toe) it was covered with toys of every conceivable
description, fastened on to it somehow or other.
It was a

perfect treasure-cave of Ali Baba turned inside out. We
shrieked with delight. The figure stood perfectly still, and
we gathered round it in a group to have a nearer view of the
wonder.
We then discovered that on all the articles there were
tickets, which we supposed at first to record the price of each.
But, upon still closer examination, we discovered that every
one of the tickets had one or other of our names upon it.
This caused a fresh explosion of joy. Nor was it the chil-
dren only that were remembered. A little box bore my
mother's name. When she opened it, we saw a real gold
watch and chain, and seals and dangles of every sort, of
useful and useless kind, and my mother's initials were on the
watch. My father had a silver flute, and to the music of it
we had such a dance, the strange figure, now considerably
lighter, joining in it without uttering a word.
""
During the dance one of my sisters, a very sharp-eyed
puss, espied about halfway up the monster two bright eyes
looking out of a shadowy depth of something like the skirts
of a great coat. She peeped and peeped, and at length, with
a perfect scream of exultation, cried out, "It's Uncle Peter!
It's Uncle Peter!' The music ceased, the dance was for-
gotten; we flew upon him like a pack of hungry wolves; we
tore him to the ground, despoiled him of coats and plaids
and elevating sticks, and discovered the kernel of the bene-
ficient monster in the person of real Uncle Peter; which,
after all, was the best present he could have brought us on
Christmas eve, for we had been very dull for want of him,
and had been wondering why he did not come.

opinion and emotion.

Action in adding beauty, precision and force to the

deavor to apply her teachings to our expression. Here,
in the happy warbling of the birds, the gentle waving
of the leafy branch, and the long undulating swell of
the peaceful ocean, we behold the unmistakable mani-
festations of tranquillity and peace. All her motions
now are gentle, graceful and joyously sublime. But
Nature does not always wear this peaceful aspect;
clouds gather in the heavens, the swift, dark tempest
sweeps the earth with maddened fury, uprooting trees
and deluging the land, while the crashing thunderbolts
strike terror and death in the abodes of man. The
direct blast of the raging storm and the zigzag and
forked streaks of lightning are all in keeping with
the wrathful shrieks that accompany them. Here,
then, we deduce our principles of vocal and bodily
expression.

197. POSITION.
The impression made by a reader or speaker as he
steps upon the platform and takes his position is of
great importance. If his walk be irregular, halting or
haughty, and the position assumed be ungraceful and
betray uneasiness or a want of proper respect for his
auditors, his performance must contain much merit to
overcome the prejudice he has already excited in his
audience. On the other hand, a firm, elastic step, fol-
lowed by a graceful attitude that occasions no unfavor-
able impressions, wins commendation at the start;
and his hearers become sympathetic and approving
from the beginning.
198. Positions of the Feet.
Stand erect with the shoulders well thrown back,
the chest full and slightly elevated. Support the body
mainly on one foot, the other lightly touching and
advanced from three to six inches. The angle formed
by the feet while in this position, should be a little less
than a right angle, say eighty degrees.

and balance the body, which is thrown a little forward,
with the toe of the right foot.
200. Changes of Position.
In the delivery of unemotional thought there should
be few changes, and all movements should be performed
within a limited space. In the expression of emo-
tional thought and heated passion, change of position,
and greater freedom of movement are permissible;
yet even here, the speaker must confine himself within
the bounds of propriety. The impetuous, headlong,
and boisterous plunges up and down the platform sug-
gest not strength and vigorous emotion under the
control of a powerful reserve force, but ungovernable
weakness and instability. Never move until the occa-
sion impels you to do so, and you will not go far
astray.
201. Position of the Head.
The head is presumed to guide the motions of the
body, and should be so held as to command the respect
of an audience. Its various positions foreshadow the
thought before it is expressed. An erect position of
the head suggests confidence, dignity and honor;
thrown back, humor, pride or vanity; inclined for-
ward, humility and grief; inclined aside, languor;
while a tossing motion implies contempt and anger.
202. Expression of the Eyes.
The eyes are particularly expressive of emotion.
It is here the mysterious workings and changes of
mind are imaged forth in unmistakable language. In

reading turn your eyes from the book to your hearers
as frequently as possible; this secures attention and
often supplies the place of appropriate gesture. In
speaking or recitation look into the eyes of your audi-
ence, not at the walls, nor assume that vacant stare
which masses the people into so many inanimate ob-
jects. In personation look in the direction of the
person to whom you are supposed to be speaking, and
not at the audience. At all times keep your eyes open,
have a purpose in them, and not an undecided expres-
sion of uncertainty.
203. The Arms.
When not employed in gesture the arms should
hang gracefully by the sides or one may be placed at
the waist, as represented in the figures 1 and 2.
204. Position of the Hands.
1. The various positions assumed by the hand are
highly significant, and should be thoughtfully studied.
2. In repose the hands should be a model of grace;
the forefinger should be gently extended, the thumb
extended and nearly parallel with the first finger;
the second finger slightly curved, the third curved
more than the second, and the fourth, or little finger,
forming a semi-circle. Study the attitudes of statuary
and adapt your positions to those models that are re-
garded as specimens of the highest art.
3. The hand is said to be supine when open, fingers
relaxed and palm upward, indicating entreaty, appeal,
light, joyous emotions, and general description,

4. It is prone when open, fingers extended and
palm downward; used in denial, degradation and con-
cealment.
5. It is vertical when open, fingers extended and
palm outward; used in repelling, disgust, abhorence
and warding off.
6. It is clenched when tightly closed; used in anger,
defiance, and threatening.
7. It is pointing when loosely closed, forefinger and
thumb uppermost and extended; used in pointing and
designating.
205. Direction of Movement.
Before attempting any of the following exercises in
gesture with the hands, the pupil should become
familiar with the various terms used in indicating
direction.
1. FRONT. Gestures made directly before the body
are termed "front."
2. EXTENDED. Gestures made direct from the
speaker's side are termed "extended."
3. OBLIQUE. Gestures made between the front and
extended are called " oblique."
4. BACKWARD. Gestures back of the extended are
called backward."
5. DESCENDING. Gestures made below the horizon-
tal line of the chest are called "descending."
6. HORIZONTAL. Gestures made by extending the
hand and arm in a line horizontal to the chest (whether

front, oblique, or the side or backward) are called
"horizontal."
7. ASCENDING. Gestures made above the horizon-
tal are termed "ascending."
8. CLIMAX OF GESTURE. Gestures reach their cli-
max on the accented syllable of the word with which
they are used.
206. Both Hands
Are often used, making the same motions, to give
greater breadth of thought, broader expanse, and more
intensity of emotion.
207. Arm Motions.
To secure facility and grace of gesture, a short pre-
liminary exercise, employing both arms simultane-
ously, is of great advantage. Every exercise in
gesture should be preceded by several whole-arm-
movement combinations, which will be suggested after
the following description of an exercise the author has
used most advantageously with young children.
208. Direction for Arm Movement.
Take the first position, slightly elevate the chest,
and force the shoulders well back. Let the arms and
hands hang naturally, the little fingers just touching
the sides. Raise both the arms, bringing the hands
towards each other in front, near the body and slightly
turning them so that the forefingers just touch by the
time the hands meet at the waist; continue raising the
hands, fingers relaxed and slightly curved, palms

MODE OF GESTURE.
241
gradually turning inward, until the chin is reached,
when the fingers gradually extend. From this point
the hands separate, the whole arms sweep through a
graceful curve downward and outward through the
horizontal, oblique, and extended directions, the palms
at first upward, gradually turn inward, then down-
ward, when the arms curve and the hands are brought
again together at the waist as when raised from the
sides in the initial motion. This movement is to be
repeated many times until familiar, after which others.
can be developed from it, which will all be of great
service in imparting ease and grace to gesture.
209. Mode of Gesture.
1. The grace of gesture is expressed in the com-
pound curve, sometimes called "
Hogarth's line of
beauty." The motion of the arm originates in the
shoulder, is then transmitted to the arm, whence the
hand and the fingers receive the impulse and both
gradually curving as the arm is raised until the chest
(on the side opposite the arm employed) is reached,
when the arm, hands, and fingers unbend, and reach
their full extension at the climax.
2. The curve of arm gesture, expressive of pleasing,
tranquil and serious thought, and employed in narra-
tion, description and argument, is beautifully illus-
trated in the varied motions that may be described
with a flexible willow-twig.
3. The direction of motion in the gesture of violent
passion and uncontrollable excitement, whether occa-

sioned by fright or joy, is best illustrated in the angu-
lar flash of the falling thunderbolt.
4. From these illustrations the learner will readily
infer the character of gesture required when he has
determined the sentiment contained in the composi-
tion.
5. The following examples, which have appeared in
Randall's Elocution, Potter's Manual of Reading, The
New York Speaker, and many other elocutionary
works, are now so generally used, and serve so well to
illustrate a great variety of gesture, that their introduc-
tion is preferred to others used by the author.

A. o. Let me not | NAME it to you ye chaste stars!
H. e. And if the night have gathered aught of evil
or concealed dis PERSE it.
A. e. Melt and dis PEL, ye specter doubts!
212. General Hints Upon Gesture.
1. "Suit the action to the word, and the word to
the action; with this special observance -
- that you
o'erstep not the modesty of Nature."
2. Be definite and decided in your action. Decision
of gesture is more important than grace; combine
the two.
――――――――
3. In shifting from one foot to the other avoid drop-
ping one shoulder.
4. Though appropriate gesture is pleasing to the eye
and greatly assists the hearer in comprehending the
thought, the pupil is reminded that too little gesture
is better than a continuous or even frequent sawing
of the air.
5. During the action of gesture the arm should be
kept moving all the time- rarely stationary for a
single instant.
6. When reading attempt no gesture unless you can
look from your book and follow the gesture with your
eyes.
7. The climax of the gesture should be on the em-
phatic word, and the hand performing the gesture

should return to the side or proceed with another
gesture.
8. Keep your face either full or three quarters full
toward your audience, unless personation should re-
quire it otherwise.
9. In personating two characters have one speak to
the right the other to the left. Explanations require
a full face to the audience.
10. Use curved lines in gesture in all cases except
those portraying sudden and impassioned Emotions.
11. As a general rule in single gestures, use the
right arm, with the right foot advanced, in preference
to the left. The left, however, is often conveniently
used in the mimicry of awkward characters.
12. Do not permit the love of dress display to mar the
effect of your delivery by making you ridiculous.
Taste in dress is little less important than appropriate
language and delivery.
13. Let your changes in gesture accord with the
language. The more rapid the thought and violent
the emotion, the more sudden the transitions. Calm,
dignified and reflective thought requires slow, meas-
ured, graceful changes.
14. Observe the attitudes and gestures of great ora-
tors and actors.
15. In sitting on a chair on the platform or else-
where in the presence of company, keep erect and
avoid crossing the limbs or tilting back your chair.
Persor.al comfort may justify such abandon in your
private room, but not in the presence of company.

FACIAL EXPRESSION.
249
213. FACIAL EXPRESSION.
1. Facial Expression is the adaptation or the coun-
tenance to the thought to be expressed.
2. Of the face Quintilian has said: "The face is the
dominant power of expression.
of expression. With this we suppli-
cate; with this we threaten; with this we soothe;
with this we mourn; with this we rejoice; with this
we triumph; with this we make our submissions;
upon this the audience hang; upon this they keep
their eyes fixed; this they examine and study even
before a word is spoken."
3. Facial Expression in its various phases, influenced
by the constantly changing impulses of that mysterious
agent we call mind, is a science of such wonderful pos-
sibilities, that an extended treatment of the subject in
an elementary text-book, is impracticable. It is suffi-
cient to say that every sentiment and emotion has its
peculiar facial expression, subject to time, place and
circumstance.
4. The effect of vocal delivery is so much height-
ened by a sympathetic expression of face, that the
student of Elocution, whether preparing for the ros-
trum, bar, or pulpit, should on no account neglect the
adaptation of his countenance to the sentiment.
66
5. It is said of Whitfield, the Prince of Pulpit
Orators, that his face was like a canvas, and upon it
he painted every passion that stirs the human breast.
It was at one moment terrific as if all the furies were
enthroned on that dark brow; and next, as by a dis-

solving view, there would come forth an angelic sweet-
ness that savored of heaven."
6. The eye is the most expressive of all the fea-
tures. From it the soul looks forth, and communes
with kindred spirits. Through it the workings of the
mind are made manifest before the tongue moves in
obedience to the will. The expectant child reads in
the mother's eye the answer to his wish. "Even the
animals are susceptible to its power. The dog watches
the eye of his master, and discovers from it, before a
word is spoken, whether he is to expect a caress or
apprehend chastisement. The lion cannot attack a
man so long as the man looks him steadily in the
eye."
214. General Principles of Facial Expression.
THE BROWS.
1. An unruffled brow denotes tranquil thought.

["NATIONS AND HUMANITY."
It was not his olive valleys and orange groves which made
the Greece of the Greek; it was not for his apple orchards
or potato fields that the farmer of New England and New
York left his plough in the furrow and marched to Bunker
Hill, to Bennington, to Saratoga. A man's country is not a
certain area of land, but it is a principle; and patriotism is
loyalty to that principle. The secret sanctification of the
soil and symbol of a country is the idea which they repre-
sent; and this idea the patriot worships through the name
and the symbol.
――――――
- George W. Curtis.]
So, with passionate heroism, of which tradition is never
weary of tenderly telling, Arnold von Winkelried gathers into
his bosom the sheaf of foreign spears. So, Nathan Hale,
disdaining no service that duty demands, perishes untimely,
with no other friend than God and the satisfied sense of
duty. So, through all history from the beginning, a noble
army of martyrs has fought fiercely and fallen bravely for
that unseen mistress, their country. So, through all history
to the end, that army must still march, and fight, and fall.
But countries and families are but nurseries and influences.
A man is a father, a brother, a German, a Roman, an Ameri-
can; but beneath all these relations he is a man. The end
of his human destiny is not to be the best German, or the
best Roman, or the best father; but the best man he can be.
History shows us that the association of men in various
nations is made subservient to the gradual advance of the
whole human race; and that all nations work together
towards one grand result. So, to the philosophic eye, the
race is but a vast caravan forever moving, but seeming often
to encamp for centuries at some green oasis of ease, where
luxury lures away heroism, as soft Capua enervated the hosts
of Hannibal.

But still the march proceeds, slowly, slowly, over moun-
tains, through valleys, along plains, marking its course with
monumental splendors, with wars, plagues, crime, — advanc-
ing still, decorated with all the pomp of nature, lit by the
constellations, cheered by the future, warned by the past.
In that vast march the van forgets the rear; the individual
is lost; and yet the multitude is but many individuals. He
faints, and falls, and dies; man is forgotten; but still man-
kind moves on, still worlds revolve, and the will of God is
done in earth and heaven.
We of America, with our soil sanctified and our symbol
glorified by the great ideas of liberty and religion, — love
of freedom and love of God, are in the foremost vanguard
of this great caravan of humanity. To us rulers look, and
learn justice, while they tremble; to us the nations look,
and learn to hope, while they rejoice. Our heritage is all
the love and heroism of liberty in the past; and all the great
of the "Old World" are our teachers.
-
Our faith is in God and the right; and God himself is, we
believe, our Guide and Leader. Though darkness sometimes
shadows our national sky, though confusion comes from
error, and success breeds corruption, yet will the storm pass
in God's good time, and in clearer sky and purer atmos-
phere our national life grow stronger and nobler, sanctified
more and more, consecrated to God and liberty by the mar-
tyrs who fall in the strife for the just and true.
And so with our individual hearts, strong in love for our
principles, strong in faith in our God, shall the nation leave
to coming generations a heritage of freedom, and law, and
religion, and truth, more glorious than the world has known
before; and our American banner be planted first and highest
on heights as yet unwon in the great march of humanity.

PART V.
217. GROUPING.
1. Grouping is the skilful arrangement of words,
phrases and sentences, with regard to the elements
employed in their delivery, into such groups as shall
render their meaning clear, pleasing and impressive.
2. Effective grouping implies in addition to a knowl-
edge and complete control of all the elements employed
in vocal expression, a cultivated taste, good judgment
and a clear perception of an author's meaning. Here
we have the application of the whole art embraced in
logic, rhetoric and elocution; for the process involves
the science of thought, the laws of composition, and
the art of vocal delivery.
3. It is grouping that distinguishes the forcible and
captivating oration from the noisy harangue, the
soul-stirring rendition of a dramatic composition from
the school-boy's drawling declamation. It is by judi-
cious grouping that the perfect orator brings the image
before our eyes, awakens the thrill in our hearts, and
fires our souls with the loftiest emotions that animate
-
our race.

literary knowledge, good judgment, keen perception,
delicate taste, and above all, such a perfect understand-
ing of the human mind, as the appropriate grouping of
speech. For this reason, definite instruction, compre-
hending the multitude of forms occurring in language
is most difficult.
5. To aid the learner in the analysis of thought and
grouping of words for delivery, an example will be
given of a method the author has employed with great
advantage. The pupil is reminded that other group-
ings of the sentence might be given which would be
equally effective.
6. The student's success in this department of elo-
cution depends so much upon the management of
pauses, that a few of the more important rules govern-
ing the suspension of the voice will be given, with the
suggestion that the length of the pause depends, en-
tirely upon the sentiment, the speaker and the circum-
stance.
218. GROUPING PAUSES.
I. PAUSE BEFORE.
1. The infinitive phrase; as, It is well to know
our duty.
2. Prepositional phrases; as, It is prudent | in
every man to provide against future want.
3. Adjectives following their nouns; as, Once upon
a midnight | dreary.

4. Relative Pronouns; as, He must have brains in
his heels, who has them not in his head.
5. Conjunctions; as, There is a mourner, | and her
heart is broken.
6. An Ellipsis; as, Character | once lost is regained
slowly.
II. PAUSE AFTER.
1. The Nominative phrase; as, Every good and
perfect gift cometh from God.
2. The objective phrase in an inverted sentence;
as, My happy, peaceful youth | restore to me.
3. Emphatic words; as, But most | by numbers
judge the poet's song.
4. Words in apposition; as, Peter, the hermit, | in-
cited the people of Europe to a holy warfare.
5. Each member of a sentence; as, You're in the
old way, and I'm in the new; | That is the false, |
and this is the true.
To these rules many others might be added, but they
are subject to so many exceptions and modifications
that it is thought best to include them under one

NO SECTS IN HEAVEN.
[Mrs. E. H. J. Cleveland.]
Talking of sects till late one eve,
Of the various doctrines the saints believe,
That night I stood, in a troubled dream,
By the side of a darkly flowing stream.
And a 66 Churchman" down to the river came;
When I heard a strange voice call his name,
"Good Father, stop; when you cross this tide,
You must leave your robes on the other side."

But the aged father did not mind;
And his long gown floated out behind,
As down to the stream his way he took,
His pale hands clasping a gilt-edged book.
"I'm bound for heaven; and when I'm there,
I Shall want my Book of Common Prayer;
And, though I put on a starry crown,
I should feel quite lost without my gown.
""
Then he fixed his eyes on the shining track,
But his gown was heavy and held him back,
And the poor old father tried in vain,
A single step in the flood to gain.
I saw him again on the other side,
But his silk gown floated on the tide;
And no one asked, in that blissful spot,
Whether he belonged to the " Church" or not.
Then down to the river a Quaker strayed;
His dress of a sober hue was made:
66
'My coat and hat must all be gray
I cannot go any other way."
-
Then he buttoned his coat straight up to his chin,
And staidly, solemnly, waded in,
And his broad-brimmed hat he pulled down tight,
Over his forehead so cold and white.
But a strong wind carried away his hat;
A moment he silently sighed over that;
And then, as he gazed to the farther shore,
The coat slipped off, and was seen no more.

As he entered heaven his suit of gray
Went quietly sailing away, away;
And none of the angels questioned him
About width of his beaver's brim.
Next came Dr. Watts, with a bundle of psalms
Tied nicely up in his aged arms,
And hymns as many, a very wise thing,
That the people in heaven, "all round," might sing.
But I thought that he heaved an anxious sigh,
As he saw that the river ran broad and high,
And looked rather surprised, as one by one
The psalms and hymns in the wave went down.
And after him, with his MSS.,
Came Wesley, the pattern of godliness;
But he cried, "Dear me! what shall I do?
The water has soaked them through and through."
And there on the river far and wide.
Away they went down the swollen tide;
And the saint, astonished, passed through alone,
Without his manuscripts up to the throne.

Then, gravely walking, two saints by name.
Down to the stream together came;
But, as they stopped at the river's brink,
I saw one saint from the other shrink.

How you attained to life's great end?

As I'm close communion,' to cross with you,
You're bound, I know, to the realms of bliss,
But you must go that way, and I'll go this."
Then straightway plunging with all his might,
Away to the left- his friend to the right,
Apart they went from this world of sin,
But at last together they entered in.
―――
And now, when the river was rolling on,
A Presbyterian Church went down;
Of women there seemed an innumerable throng,
But the men I could count as they passed along.
And concerning the road, they could never agree
The old or the new way, which it could be,
Nor ever a moment paused to think
That both would lead to the river's brink.
And a sound of murmuring, long and loud,
Came ever up from the moving crowd;
"You're in the old way, and I'm in the new;
That is the false, and this is the true '
Or, "I'm in the old way, and you're in the new;
That is the false, and this is the true."
""
But the brethren only seemed to speak:
Modest the sisters walked and meek,
And if ever one of them chanced to say
What troubles she met with on the way,
How she longed to pass to the other side,
Nor feared to cross over the swelling tide,
A voice arose from the brethren then,
"Let no one speak but the 'holy men;'

For have ye not heard the words of Paul,
'Oh, let the women keep silence all?'"
I watched them long in my curious dream,
Till they stood by the borders of the stream;
Then, just as I thought, the two ways met;
But all the brethren were talking yet,
And would talk on till the heaving tide
Carried them over side by side -
Side by side, for the way was one;
The toilsome journey of life was done;
And all who in Christ the Savior died,
Came out alike on the other side.
No forms or crosses or books had they;
No gowns of silk or suits of gray;
No creeds to guide them, or MSS. ;
For all had put on Christ's righteousness.
MISCELLANEOUS SELECTIONS.
INDUSTRY AND ELOQUENCE. Wm. Wirt.
In the ancient republics of Greece and Rome, oratory was
a necessary branch of a finished education. A much
smaller proportion of the citizens were educated than among
us; but of these a much larger number became orators.
No man could hope for distinction or influence, and yet
slight this art. The commanders of their armies were
orators as well as soldiers, and ruled as well by the rhetor-
ical as by their military skill. There was no trusting with
them, as with us, to a natural facility, or the acquisition of
an accidental fluency by occasional practice.

They served an apprenticeship to the art. They passed
through a regular course of instruction in schools. They
submitted to long and laborious discipline. They exercised
themselves frequently, both before equals and in the pres-
ence of teachers, who criticised, reproved, rebuked, excited
emulation, and left nothing undone which art and persever-
ance could accomplish.
The greatest orators of antiquity, so far from being
favored by natural tendencies, except, indeed, in their high
intellectual endowments, had to struggle against natural
obstacles; and, instead of growing up spontaneously to
their unrivaled eminence, they forced themselves forward
by the most discouraging, artificial process.
Demosthenes combatted an impediment in speech and an
ungainliness of gesture, which, at first drove him from the
forum in disgrace. Cicero failed, at first, through weakness
of lungs, and an excessive vehemence of manner, which
wearied the hearers and defeated his own purpose. These
defects were conquered by study ond discipline. He exiled
himself from home, and, during his absence, in various
lands, passed not a day without a rhetorical exercise, seek-
ing the masters who were most severe in criticism as the
surest means of leading him to the perfection at which he
aimed.
Such, too, was the education of their other great men.
They were all, according to their ability and station, ora-
tors; orators, not by nature or accident, but by education,
formed in a strict process of rhetorical training.
The inference to be drawn from these observations is
that, if so many of those who received an accomplished
education became accomplished orators, because to become
so was one purpose of their study, then it is in the power of
a much larger proportion among us to form ourselves into

creditable and accurate speakers. The inference should not
be denied until proved false by experiment.
Let this art be made an object of attention; let young
men train themselves to it faithfully and long; and if any
of competent talents and tolerable science be found, at last,
incapable of expressing themselves in continued and con-
nected discourse, so as to answer the ends of puplic speak-
ing, then, and not till then, let it be said that a peculiar
talent or natural aptitude is requisite, the want of which
must render effort vain; then, and not till then, let us
acquiesce in this indolent and timorous notion which con-
tradicts the whole testimony of antiquity and all the ex-
perience of the world.

OUR DUTIES TO THE REPUBLIC.-Judge Story.
The Old World has already revealed to us, in its unsealed
books, the beginning and end of all its own marvelous
struggles in the cause of liberty. Greece, lovely Greece,
――――――
"The land of scholars and the nurse of arms,"
where sister republics, in fair procession, chanted the praises
of liberty and the gods, - where and what is she? For two
thousand years the oppressor has ground her to the earth.
Her arts are no more. The last sad relics of her temples
are but the barracks of a ruthless soldiery. The fragments
of her columns and her palaces are in the dust, yet beautiful
in ruins. She fell not when the mighty were upon her. Her
sons were united at Thermopylæ and Marathon; and the
tide of her triumph rolled back upon the Hellespont. She
was conquered by her own factions. She fell by the hands
of her own people. The man of Macedonia did not the work
of destruction. It was already done by her own corruptions,
banishments, and dissentions.

ing and setting sun, where and what is she? The eternal

city yet remains, proud even in her desolation, noble in her
decline, venerable in the majesty of religion, and calm as in
the composure of death. The malaria has but traveled in
the paths worn by her destroyers. More than eighteen cen-
turies have mourned over the loss of her empire. A mortal
disease was upon her vitals before Cæsar had crossed the
Rubicon; and Brutus did not restore her health by the
deep probings of the senate chamber. The Goths and
Vandals and Huns, the swarms of the North, completed
only what was already begun at home. Romans betrayed
Rome. The legions were bought and sold; but the people
offered the tribute money.
We stand the latest, — and, if we fail, probably the last,-
experiment of the self-government by the people. We have
begun it under circumstances of the most auspicious nature.
We are in the vigor of youth. Our growth has never been
checked by the oppressions of tyranny. Our constitutions
have never been enfeebled by the vices of luxuries of the
old world. Such as we are, we have been from the begin-
ning, simple, hardy, intelligent, accustomed to self-govern-
ment and to self-respect. The Atlantic rolls between us
and any formidable foe. Within our own territory, stretch-
ing through many degrees of latitude and longitude, we
have the choice of many products and many means of inde-
pendence. The government is mild. The press is free.
Religion is free. Knowledge reaches or may reach every
home. What fairer prospect of success could be presented?
What means more adequate to accomplish the sublime end?
What more is necessary than for the people to preserve
what they have themselves created? Already has the age
caught the spirit of our institutions. It has already as-
cended the Andes, and snuffed the breezes of both oceans.
It has infused itself into the life-blood of Europe, and

Holland. It has touched the philosophy of Germany and
the North; and, moving onward to the South, has opened
to Greece the lessons of her better days. Can it be that
America, under such circumstances, can betray herself?
Can it be that she is to be added to the catalogue of repub-
lics, the inscription upon whose ruins is: "They were, but
they are not?" Forbid it, my countrymen! Forbid it,
heaven!
AN AMERICAN EXILE. - I. H. Brown.
In Norfolk Bay, long years ago, where waved
The nation's flag from mizzen gaff
Of frigate, sloop, and other war-like craft,
A group of naval officers, assembled
On the flag-ship's quarter-deck, discussed
With earnestness the act by which the State
Of South Carolina annulled
The tariff laws of Congress.
The nation's heart throbbed anxiously with fears
Of what must follow such a deed portentous,
The President's prompt act,
Despatching Scott to Charleston, ordering
The execution of the laws by force,
Had thrilled the nerves of those who bore
Their country's arms.
The naval service boasted many men
Who traced through veins as chivalrous as their sire's
The blood of Sumter, Pickens, Hayne,
And other revolutionary patriots;
And, conscious of a lineage illustrious
From those who gave the grand Republic birth,
Their minds were often filled with polities
Of state; and thus the acts of courts
And legislatures oft became their theme
In time of peace as much as warlike deeds
Of Neptune.

"
One of these, in this debate,
A handsome, dark-eyed officer of most
Commanding mien, became conspicuous
In warm approval of his State's rash act
And censure strong of President
And Congress. While his flashing eye betrayed
The fierce emotions of his soul, his voice
Rang fearful maledictions: "Curse the country
Whose flag from yonder mizzen floats; the men
Be cursed, who in the name of government
Ignore the rights my native State has held
Supreme." Then drawing forth his rapier
As if in frenzied rage: "My sword's my own,
My heart is loyal to my native State;
And here I swear, this blade shall ne'er be drawn
But in defense of rights this tyrant thing
Called government, usurps, and those its threats
Would terrify. Its flag be trailed in dust;
The fate of Carthage be its cursed doom;
The memory of its present acts, with those
Who give them shape, go down in blood and shame."
Such direful imprecations shocked the ears
Of those who heard; and ere the speechless group
Recovered from their blank amaze a young
Lieutenant felled the speaker senseless to
The deck; then, quick before the officer
Commanding, preferred the charge of treason
Court-martial trials are speedy in results;
The sentence novel in its terms, was heard
With unfeigned haughtiness and scorn by him
Whom it deprived of country.
"The prisoner, hence, for life, shall be consigned
To vessels cruising in a foreign sea:
No tongue to him shall speak his country's name,
Nor talk to him of aught save daily wants.
And ever to his sight that country's flag
Shall be a token that its power lives
To carry out this sentence."

In far off seas, away from kindred hearts
And native home, the years passed slowly on;
But pride and stubborn will did not desert
This strange misguided man; his fate he seemed
To cherish for the cause he still believed
Would triumph in the end.
Yet to and fro his narrow bounds he paced,
Alone amid a frigate's crew, of whom
Not one could speak to him a friendly word,
Nor tell him of that wondrous growth and fame
The land he cursed attained among
The nations of the earth. No cheering word
His yearning heart in time could e'er expect
From stricken mother, weeping wife, and babes
By him made worse than orphans, who might blush
To call him father. Still, above, around
In sportive play, the flag he madly cursed,
In gorgeous folds waved kindly o'er his head
As if forgiving his ingratitude.
Anon as other years rolled sadly by,
And he was passed from ship to ship, as each
In turn went home, the lines of grief and frosts
Of age bore silent evidence of slow decay.
In time his face was marked with pensive cast,
A harbinger of sad repentant thought.
A sailor, unperceived took note of him,
And oft observed him watch the waving flag
With strange emotion. And once his lips
Were seen to move: "Thou ever present - Curse,
Reminding me of what I am, of what
I've lost. Thou Nemesis of nature's wrongs;
For that I've sinned against my birth, my soul's
Remorse affirms. How long e'er nature's laws,
More kind than human heart, will free my eyes
From thee, thou vengeful witness of my shame?
I'd tear thee from thy staff, but when I think
Of all the tears thou'st witnessed in these eyes,
At first my curses, then my prayers to God,

Thou seem'st so much a friend, I would not harm
One star within thy field, and yet, and yet -- "
Full thirty years had passed since sound
Of friendly voice had filled his ear, and now
He paced another deck than one designed
For heavy armament, a merchant craft,
Commissioned while the nation's ships of war
Were called for duty home to try the cause
For which this poor, deluded exile gave
His manhood and his life.

Near set of sun
The cry of "sail" was heard, and then,
Against his will, they hurried him below.
The startling call to quarters thrilled his ear:
And e'er the roll of drum and boatswain's whistle died away
There came a distant "boom" that roused a hope
He yearned to realize. A moment more,
A deaf'ning sound, that shook the very keel
Awoke his heart with joy. He knew and hailed
The truth. The land, his land was now at war.
The foe his name, it mattered not to him
Had struck the challenge blow and filled his soul
With fire.

O love of Country! Thou art lasting as
The faith of childhood. Thou art stronger than
The love of life, the fear of death!
This exiled penitent, this prodigal
Without a home, would prove himself a man!
He cried for help to free him from his bonds;
He tried to burst the door; with frantic yells,
He shrieked for those above to lead him forth
To grapple with the foe. But all was vain.
A tearing shot
That ploughed through side and prison bulkhead walls,
Made clear a passage wide enough for him
To struggle through to seek his wild desire.

But e'er he reached the deck, the foe had lashed
His ship beside, and countless fierce wild men
Were leaping down among the feeble crew,
Who battled hard, but vain, against such odds.
He saw the flag the enemy displayed,
A flag unknown, unseen by him before,
Though strangely like the one he cursed,-
So much, I would die in its defense.
He wrenched a cutlass from a dying hand,
And hewed his way among the privateers.
Where'er he struck, the way was cleared of men
Like wheat before the blade. His strange demean
And antique garb amazed the foe, until
It seemed he'd drive the boarders to their ship.
At last, his wounds o'ercame his madd'ning strength,
And sinking to his knee, was soon disarmed,
But spared the murd'rous stroke by one who knew
His name and story from a child.
His glazing eye turned wistful toward that flag,
Now drooping low, as if to mourn for him:

KIND WORDS. Kidd's Elocution.
As the breath of the dew to the tender plant, they gently
fall upon the drooping heart, refreshing its withered tendrils,
and smoothing its burning woes. Bright oases they are, in
life's great desert. Who can estimate the pangs they have
alleviated, or the good works they have accomplished?
Long after they are uttered, they reverberate in the soul's
inner chamber, and low, sweet, liquid strains, that quell all
the raging storms that may have before existed. And, oh!
when the heart is sad, and like a broken harp, the sweetest
chords of pleasure cease to vibrate, who can tell the power
of one kind word? One little word of tenderness, gushing

in upon the soul, will sweep the long neglected chords, and
awaken the most pleasant strains.
When borne down with the trials and troubles of life, we
are ready to sink faintly by the way, how like the cheering
rays of sunshine do kind words come! They disperse the
clouds, dispel the gloom, and drive sorrow far away.
Kind words are like jewels in the heart, never to be for-
gotten, but, perhaps, to cheer by their memory, a long, sad
life; while words of cruelty are like darts in the bosom,
wounding, and leaving scars that will be borne to the grave
by their victim.
Why is it, then, that we do not always seek, by kind
words, to scatter sunbeams along the pathway of others?
THE VISION OF IMMORTALITY. Wm. C. Bryant.
I who essayed to sing in earlier days,
The Thanatopsis and The Hymn to Death,
Wake now the Hymn to Immortality!
Yet once again, oh! man, come forth and view
The haunts of nature; walk the waving fields,
Enter the silent groves, or pierce again
-
The depths of the untrodden wilderness,
And she shall teach thee. Thou hast learned before
One lesson- and her Hymn of Death hath fallen
With melancholy sweetness on thine ear.
The flowers that spring above their last year's grave
Are eloquent with the voice of life and hope —
And the green trees clap their rejoicing hands,
Waving in triumph o'er the earth's decay!
Yet not alone shall flower and forest raise
The voice of triumph and the hymn of life.
The insect brood is there: each painted wing
That flutters in the sunshine, broke but now
From the close cerements of a worm's own shroud,
Is telling, as it flies, how life may spring

In its glad beauty from the gloom of death
Where the crushed mould beneath the sunken foot
Seems but the sepulchre of old decay;
Turn thou a keener glance, and thou shalt find
The gathered myriads of a mimic world.
The breath of evening and the sultry morn
Bears on its wing a cloud of witnesses
That earth from her unnumbered caves of death
Sends forth a mightier tide of teeming life;
Raise then the Hymn to Immortality!
The broad green prairies and the wilderness,
And the old cities where the dead have slept,
Age upon age, a thousand graves in one,
Shall yet be crowded with the living forms
Of myraids, waking from the silent dust.
Kings that lay down in state, and earth's poor slaves
Resting together in one fond embrace,
The white-haired patriarch and the tender babe,
Grown old together in the flight of years;
They of immortal fame and they whose praise
Was never sounded in the ears of men,
Archon and priest, and the poor common crowd, -
All the vast concourse in the halls of death,
Shall waken from the dreams of silent years
To hail the dawn of the immortal day.
Aye, learn the lesson! Though the worm shall be
Thy brother in the mystery of death,
And all shall pass, humble and proud and gay
Together, to earth's mighty charnel-house,
Yet the immortal is thy heritage!
The grave shall gather thee: yet thou shalt come,
Beggar or prince, not as thou wentest forth,
In rags or purple, but arrayed as those
Whose mortal puts on immortality!

Of nature, and her solemn hymn of death
Steals with a note of sadness to thy heart.

Breaks from the mould with every bursting flower,

Burdened with sorrow at the woes which crowd
Thy narrow heritage, lift up thy head
In the strong hope of the undying life,
And shout the Hymn to Immortality.
The dear departed that have passed away
To the still house of death, leaving thine own,
The gray-haired sire that died in blessing thee,
Mother, or sweet-lipped babe, or she who gave
Thy home the light and bloom of Paradise,
They shall be thine again, when thou shalt pass
At God's appointment, through the shadowy vale,
To reach the sunlight of the Immortal Hills.
And thou that gloriest to lie down with kings,
Thine uncrowned head no lowlier than theirs,
Seek thou the loftier glory to be known
A king and priest to God! - when thou shalt pass
Forth from these silent halls to take thy place
With patriarchs and prophets and the blest
Gone up from every land to people heaven.
So live, that when the mighty caravan,
Which halts one night-time in the vale of Death,
Shall strike its white tents for the morning march,
Thou shalt mount onward to the Eternal Hills,
Thy foot unwearied, and thy strength renewed
Like the strong eagle's for the upward flight!

Here have I shrieked in my wild despair,
When the damnéd fiends, from their prison came,
Sported and gamboled, and mocked me here,
With their eyes of fire, and their tongues of flame,
Shouting forever and aye my name!
And I strove in vain to burst my chain,
And longed to be free as the winds again;
That I might spring in the wizard ring,
And scatter them back to their hellish den!
Woe to the daughters and sons of men-
Woe to them all when I roam again!
How long I have been in this dungeon here,
Little I know, and nothing I care;
What to me is the day, or night,
Summer's heat or autumn sere,
Spring-tide flowers, or winter's blight,
Pleasure's smile, or sorrow's tear;
Time! what care I for thy flight?
Joy! I spurn thee with disdain;
Nothing love I but this clanking chain;
Once I broke from its iron hold,
Nothing I said, but silent and bold
Like the shepherd that watches his gentle fold,
Like the tiger that crouches in mountain lair,
Hours upon hours so watched I there;
Till one of the flends that had come to bring
Herbs from the valley and drink from the spring,
Stalked through my dungeon entrance in!
Ha! how he shrieked to see me free-
Ho! how he trembled, and knelt to me,
He, who had mocked me many a day,
And barred me out from its cheerful ray -
Gods! how I shouted to see him pray!
I wreathed my hands in the demon's hair,
And choked his breath in its muttered prayer,
And danced I then in wild delight,
To see the trembling wretch's fright!

that has been rightly struck on the English lyre, with every

Give an echo to the now silent and solitary mountains; gush
out with the fountains that as yet sing their anthem all day

in its purity, the pledges of friendship in its faithfulness;
and as the morning sun drinks the dew-drops from the flow-

PART VI.
222. ORIGINAL DISCOURSE.
1. Thus far the student has been instructed in the
manner only of expressing the thoughts of others.
While the ability to comprehend instantly and render
effectively an author's thoughts as outlined upon the
printed page is an accomplishment of great value to
all, such an attainment is not sufficient for the broad
and general culture required by our times and institu-
tions.
2. The responsibilities thrust upon us by the repub-
lican form of government under which we live, per-
petuated in its purity and efficiency by the logic of a
Choate, the wisdom of a Webster, and the eloquence
of a Clay, demand attainments of a higher order than
mere skill in the pathetic, forcible, or eloquent repeti-
tion of some popular composition.
3. The citizen who would form at least a unit in the
Republic must be competent to wield the pen and
when called upon, be prepared to address his country-
men intelligently upon the questions of the day. His
duty to himself and country demand that whether he
write or speak, his performance should be creditable
and effective.

4. A ready, vigorous pen and speech, like reading
and declamation, come from instruction, practice and
criticism.
5. The purpose of PART VI is to present the compo-
nent elements of a finished discourse in a manner so
simple that with the aid of the models and exercises
following, the student can not fail to acquire com-
mendable skill in the written and vocal expression of
his own thoughts.
6. Assuming that the student is familiar with the
general laws of grammar and the usual rhetorical
forms, we present at once the parts of the formal dis-
course as it is ordinarily constructed.
7. A discourse is the formal, public delivery of
thought previously prepared, in most cases, for the oc-
casion. It may be read or committed to memory and
addressed to the auditors for whom it is intended.
223. Kinds.
I. Addresses, of which there are many varieties; as,
an address of welcome, address of congratulation, pro-
fessional addresses, etc.
II. Orations, commemorative of some important
event; as, the oration of Mr. Winthrop at the York-
town celebration, Mr. Blaine's eulogy upon James A.
Garfield.
III. Lectures, designed to give instruction upon
historical, literary, or scientific subjects; as, Richard
A. Proctor's lectures on astronomy.

-
IV. Sermons, discourses prepared by clergymen for
the moral and religious instruction of the people.
V. Speeches, a term applied to those forms of de-
livery which are spoken either extemporaneously or
from matter previously prepared and committed to
memory. The speech is not restricted to time, place,
or occasion. It is heard in Congress, courts, and con-
ventions upon all subjects, at all times.
224. Division and Arrangement.
The most elaborate discourses may be divided nat-
urally into six parts, logically arranged in the follow-
ing order :-
I. The Exordium,
II. The Narration,
III. The Proposition,
IV. The Confirmation,
V. The Refutation,
VI. The Peroration.
1. THE EXORDIUM, or Introduction, in which the
speaker seeks to gain the favorable attention of his
auditors to himself and an unprejudiced consideration
of whatever principles he may advocate. The success
of the speaker is often determined by his introduc-
tion.
-
REQUISITES. 1. That the manner of the speaker shall be easy,
graceful, and natural, free from every appearance of affectation or
arrogance. 2. That the language shall be simple, and expressed
with the utmost accuracy. 3. That neither the manner of the
speaker nor his language shall anticipate any of the principal
points of his arguments.


## p. 286 (#312) ############################################

COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
2. THE NARRATION, or Description, is a concise
statement of the facts upon which the discourse is
based.
REQUISITES. 1. That it should be so plain that no misunder-
standing may arise in the minds of an audience. 2. That it be
reasonable and probable. 3. That it be told so pleasantly that the
hearers will not weary of its recital.
―――
3. THE PROPOSITION, or Statement, presents the
views entertained by the speaker on the subject under
consideration. In this part, when the discussion as-
sumes an intricate form, the subject is treated under
several heads called the partition.
REQUISITES. - 1. That the speaker in his partition confine him-
self to the fewest heads possible, and reject all points not bearing
directly upon the question at issue. 2. That his statements be
full, clear, and decided.
4. THE CONFIRMATION, is the application of all the
proofs drawn from invention or analogous cases to
strengthen the cause as presented by the speaker.
REQUISITES. 1. That the proofs offered be applicable and con-
clusive. 2. That they be arranged in such a manner that the
strongest is placed last and the weakest in the middle.
5. THE REFUTATION, or Confutation, is the answer-
ing of the arguments and objections of an opponent,
either expressed or anticipated, by showing them to be
erroneous, irrelevant, inconsistent, or absurd.
REQUISITES. 1. That the answers be fair, and delivered in the
spirit of candor. 2. That the speaker attempt not to disprove ir-
refutable facts and arguments. A speaker often renders himself
ridiculous by such a course. A candid admission of facts bearing

287
upon the question strengthens the speaker's position and wins him
sympathy in the minds of judge and jury.
6. THE PERORATION, or Conclusion, is the summing
up of the principal arguments together with such addi-
tional points as bear directly upon the proposition.
REQUISITES. — 1. That the style of the peroration harmonize
with the general treatment of the subject. 2. That the speaker
employ all the graces of rhetoric and elocution at his command.
3. That the conclusion be not too long concluding. 4. That the
closing sentences be constructed and delivered so as to leave the
minds of hearers in accord with that of the speaker.

NOTE. While the above classification and arrangement is found
in the most finished orations left us by the great masters, it is not
uniformly observed, nor indeed is it necessary in all discourses.
Until the student acquires facility in original work, the order of
parts as outlined above should be followed in the exercises fol-
lowing the examples.

As a citizen of Lyndon who rejoices in its prosperity and

tice to believe my words actuated by honest convictions. It
is due to the importance of the interests involved that we con-

sider the propositions to be presented this evening from
every standpoint we severally and collectively occupy.
II. THE NARRATION.
Messrs. Jackson, Smith & Co., extensively engaged at
various points in the United States in the manufacture of
wrapping paper, realizing a number of advantages to be
found in the peculiar quality and abundant quantity of wheat
straw grown within a radius of a dozen miles of Lyndon, have
submitted to our citizens a proposition which we have met
to consider and answer. According to the terms of their
proposition, these gentlemen in consideration of the grant of
10 acres of land lying on both sides of Fountain Creek
within the corporate limits of Lyndon, which shall for ten
years succeeding such grant be exempt from all taxation,
and the sum of $20,000 to be paid when a like amount shall
have been expended by them in the erection of buildings,
will within one year after such grant of land erect, on the
land so granted, a factory for the manufacture of wrapping
paper, together with the necessary machinery, employing
from 200 to 400 operatives throughout the year.
III. THE PROPOSITION.
This proposition has been published in our papers for two
weeks, and discussed on our streets until even the children
are familiar with its terms. Notwithstanding all that has
been said for and against accepting the proposition, much
remains to be added in its favor, a part of which I shall at-
tempt to briefly present. The employment of 300 skilled
operatives in our midst, with their families, will add to our
population a thousand sober, industrious, economical people,
whose wants must be supplied by our merchants and artisans.
The running of the extensive machinery of so large a factory
as the gentlemen propose to erect will furnish a home market

for a large part of the coal taken from our mines. And,
finally, the manufacture of the thousands of tons of straw
which has been heretofore consumed in flames for the want
of other disposition, will inaugurate a system of providence
and economy among our farmers, which in view of past ex-
perience, can not come too soon.
IV. THE CONFIRMATION.
That the addition to our population would be beneficial,
morally and financially, is assured in the practice of this
firm of employing none but thrifty, sober, industrious and
skillful workmen, and the further practice of withholding a
portion of each week's pay until all creditors of employes
may have an opportunity of securing themselves against pos-
sible loss. The difficulties which our miners have experi-
enced in shipping their coal at a profitable advantage will, by
the establishment of such an enterprise as is contemplated,
be in a measure obviated by the daily demand of 2,000
bushels of coal within one mile of their pits. I am informed
by one of the gentlemen composing this firm, that the fiber
contained in our straw is the best for their purpose to be
found in America, that the paper made of this straw will be
of a quality which will command the highest price in the
market; and that their daily consumption for 9 months of
the year, will amount to 100 tons, or 200,000 lbs., for
which they will pay from $2 to $3 per ton. A simple calcu-
lation in multiplication, showing the daily distribution of
$300 among our farmers for their straw, $160 to the miners
for their coal, and $1,000 to the operatives of the factory,
who in turn expend the half of their earnings. among our
merchants, must satisfy any candid mind of the financial ad-
vantage accruing from such an enterprise as we are invited
to foster in our community.

V. THE REFUTATION.
The opposition to the proposed assistance we are asked
to render is fitly illustrated by the dog in the manger, which
will neither eat the straw that forms his lair nor suffer the
ox to eat of it. The coal which underlies our city and vicin-
ity in exhaustless abundance, may there remain for future
and more enlightened generations to bring to the surface and
send to distant marts for all that these fossiliferous relics of
an antediluvian civilization may feel disposed to do towards
its development. They style themselves the true friends of
the city, and attempt to prove their childish boast by apply-
ing what are otherwise most wholesome maxims; as,
A
bird in the hand is worth two in the bush,' "It is better to
let well enough alone,' "We hold what we have and leave
fools to speculate in what they expect to get," "Never go
in debt for what you do not need," "If Jackson, Smith &
Co. want a factory let 'em build it, and we'll sell 'em the
land to build it on." Now, as a matter of fact, the greater
portion of these objectors are ignorant, though compara-
tively wealthy men, who obtained their first money by in-
heritance, which was certainly no fault of theirs, and have
by that blandlike passivity peculiar to Shylock, simply suf-
fered it to accumulate cent. per cent.; and the suspicion of
suffering a trifling delay in securing an immediate return
for the few dollars they will pay in taxes for the proposed
assistance, disturbs their peaceful meditations upon the
superiority of notes, bonds, and mortgages over the uncer-
tainty of the convertibility of straw into gold. The almost
certain distribution among our people of $200,000 a year,
has no charms for them—there's no usury in that general
distribution. If these are the friends of our city let us pray
for deliverance from their friendship.

VI. THE PERORATION.
In conclusion, I urge the immediate and favorable action
of our people upon the proposition before us.
Such an op-
portunity may not again be offered. Other communities,
even in our own county, with all the peculiar advantages we
are credited with having, but with a keener perception of
advantages to be derived from manufacturing industries,
are impatiently waiting for our rejection of the proposition
in order that they may profit by our folly. Let us reach a
conclusion at once, and let that conclusion be so emphatic
that even old fogyism shall feel the impulse of a quickened
life, born of the enlightened age in which we live.
PAUL'S DEFENSE BEFORE KING AGRIPPA.
I. THE EXORDIUM.
"I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall
answer for myself this day before thee touching all the
things whereof I am accused of the Jews: especially because
I know thee to be expert in all customs and questions which
are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me
patiently."
II. THE NARRATION.
"My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first
among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews:
which knew me from the beginning, if they would testify,
that after the most straitest sect of our religion, I lived a
Pharisee. And now I stand and am judged for the hope of
the promise made of God unto our fathers: Unto which pro-
mise our twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night,
hope to come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am
accused of the Jews."

III. THE PROPOSITION.
"Why should it be thought a thing incredible with you
that God should raise the dead?"
IV. THE CONFIRMATION.
"I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many
things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which
things I also did in Jerusalem: and many of the saints did I
shut up in prison, having received authority from the chief
priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my voice
against them. And I punished them oft in every synagogue,
and compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad
against them, I persecuted them even unto strange cities.
Whereupon as I went to Damascus, with authority and com-
mission from the chief priests, at midday, O king, I saw in
the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the
sun, shining round about me, and them which journeyed with
me. And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a
voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue,
Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to
kick against the pricks. And I said, Who art thou, Lord?
And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest. But rise
and stand on thy feet: for I have appeared unto thee for
this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of
these things of which thou hast seen, and of those things in
the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee from the
people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee, to
open their eyes, and to turn them from darkness to light,
and from the power of Satan unto God, that they may re-
ceive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them which

are sanctified by faith that is in me. Whereupon, O king
Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:
but shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem,
and throughout all the coasts of Judæa, and then to the Gen-
tiles, that they should repent and turn to God, and do works
meet for repentance."
V. THE REFUTATION.
"For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and
went about to kill me. Having therefore obtained help of
God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and
great, saying none other things than those which the prophets
and Moses did say should come: that Christ should suffer,
and that he should be the first that should rise from the dead,
and should shew light unto the people, and to the Gentiles."
VI. THE PERORATION.
"And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a
loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning
doth make thee mad."
"But he said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but
speak forth the words of truth and soberness. For the king
knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely:
for I am persuaded that none of these things are hidden from
him for this thing was not done in a corner. King Agrippa,
believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest."
"Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou persuadest
me to be Christian."
"And Paul said, I would to God, that not only thou, but
also all that hear me this day, were both almost, and alto-
gethe rsuch as I am, except these bonds."

225. Subjects For Original Discourse.
The students will prepare discourses as above upon
the following subjects. But one part at first should
be required each day. These parts should be read
before the class, criticised, and afterward rewrit-
ten as a whole; and then formally delivered before the
school.
1. Is commerce or agriculture more beneficial to
the best interests of the nation?
2. Has the National Government a right to inter-
fere in education?
3. Is the unanimity required in juries conducive to
the attainment of justice?
4. Has the discovery of gunpowder been beneficial
to mankind?
5. Will America decay as the great nations of An-
tiquity have done?
6. Are great men made by circumstances? or do
great men make circumstances?
7. Does climate affect the character of a people?
8. Would the annexation of Mexico be for the best
interests of the United States?
9. Was the career of Napoleon Bonaparte of greater
benefit than evil to the world?
10. Would it not be expedient to elect U. S. Sena-
tors by a popular State vote instead of by Legislative
vote?
11. Ought education to be compulsory?
12. Is the "protective policy" best for American
interests?

EXTEMPORANEOUS SPEECH.

13. Is universal suffrage conducive to the greatest
prosperity of the United States?
14. Is frequency of elections a source of corruption?
15. Would a Congress of Nations be desirable?
16. Ought there to be a national law limiting the
amount of a man's wealth?
17. Is a lawyer justifiable in 'defending what he
knows to be a wrong?
18. Has the introduction of labor-saving machinery
been beneficial to the laboring classes?
226. Extemporaneous Speech.
1. The greatest excellence to which the student,
ambitious of oratorical fame, may aspire, is comprised
in the ability to speak fluently, logically, and effect-
ively, upon any subject, at any time, without previous
preparation.
2. This accomplishment may be termed "thinking
on one's feet." It is not the result of any sponta-
neous development. It comes from study, practice,
work.
3. The power to charm the heart, and steal away
the senses, to divert the mind from its own devisings,
and hold an audience in breathless spell, as the orator
paints the rosy tints of heavenly longings, or leads the
imagination down through the labyrinths of wonder-
land, or depicts with lightning tongue and thunder
tones, the horrors of the doomed, comes not by nature,
but by work, — work, work.

4. Whether this so-called gift be assisted by the
early efforts of a Demosthenes declaiming over the
sea-beat cliffs of Attica, or the harangues of a
youthful Clay before a group of oxen, perfection in de
livery is attained only by frequent and long continued
practice, based upon accurate observation and zealous
study.
227. The Two Forms of Extemporaneous Speech.
CONVERSATON.
1. CONVERSATION is the general and familiar inter-
change of sentiments.
2. No form of social intercourse furnishes so much
humanizing enjoyment, as pleasing and entertaining
conversation. Notwithstanding the pleasure it affords,
few people, even among the educated classes, are cap-
able of entertaining a company by continuous, intelli-
gent discourse.
3. The student is here reminded that unconnected
remarks, followed by ambiguous or meaningless
monosyllabic rejoinders, interspersed with nauseating
repetitions of such expletives as, Yes, indeed,'
"You don't say so,'
"You bet," etc., do not consti-
tute elevating discourse.
4. Conversation is an art, and as such, it is capable
of cultivation to approximate perfection. Success in
the higher forms of speech, depends upon the conver-
sational skill of the aspirant for oratorical honors.

GENERAL RULES FOR CONVERSATION.
297
228. General Rules for Conversation.
1. Breathe without gasping or attracting attention.
2. Articulate distinctly, but do not impress your
hearers with the idea that you are going through an
exercise in vocal gymnastics.
3. Be natural; remember it is yourself you are im-
personating, and you will be judged accordingly.
4. In general, use a full, pure tone, moderate force,
radical stress, middle pitch, and moderate movement.
In those parts of your conversation requiring peculiar
description and personation, use the appropriate ele-
ments.
5. Enter into the spirit of the subject with all your
mind. Cultivate the habit of listening to others.
This is at least polite. Attention to what others say
is the relay from which you are enabled to continue
your part of the conversation intelligibly and agreea-
bly to the other members of your company.
6. Avoid pedantry, affectation, and all mannerisms
calculated to detract from the general topic of conver-
sation.
7. Conceive, summon, and express your best
thoughts.
8. Employ the simplest, purest, and most expressive
language at your command.
9. Avoid unpleasant personalities, particularly with
reference to those who are absent.
10. Avoid topics of little general interest to your
listeners.
11. However familiar to the company the condition

of the weather and streets may be, their prolonged
discussion is not sufficiently important to justify more
than a passing remark.
12. Indulge sparingly in raillery and cutting repar-
tee. A merciless wit is never esteemed above a treach-
erous weapon.
229. Subjects for Conversation.
1. Changes in this city which I have seen.
2. An incident I witnessed on the street.
3. The value of system.
4. A description of a large mill I visited.
5. My first sight of a steamboat.
6. An impressive sermon I heard.
7. The influence of Longfellow's poetry.
8. Views from our post-office.
9. An incident on a railroad train.
10. Our last picnic.
11. My opinion of (some kind of amusement).
12. My impression of our last fair.
13. What I saw in a dream.
14. Gossipers as a class.
15. The dangers of bad company.
16. Advantages one may have by traveling.
17. The influence of habits of neatness.
18. Order and confusion.
19. The study of history.
20. The scandal monger.
21. The influence of money.
22. The evils of society gossip.
23. The history of a dime (dated 1830).

24. The influence of health on a man's career.
25. Habits of economy.
26. The value of a good reputation.
27. The possibilities to a man who might live and
retain his faculties 1000 years.
230. Public Speaking.
1. Public extemporaneous speaking is the delivery
of sentiment without previous written preparation.
2. The speaker employs the same elements as in
conversation, but upon an enlarged scale. To these
he may, as occasion requires, add depth and fullness
to his quality, producing the grand tones of the
Orotund; he may increase his force, raise his pitch,
and indulge in a greater variety of stress, movement,
and pauses than in ordinary conversation. In addition
to these departures he may energize and embellish his
delivery by gesture and facial expression; and, gener-
ally, he may play upon the accidental elements in
arousing the emotions of an audience more than would
be proper in the most animated conversation.
3. Of all professions recognized by civilized man,
probably none requires in its perfection so many and
varied accomplishments as that of oratory. The pub-
lic lecturer who leads the van in the march of science
for the improvement of society, the statesman, who
guards the nation's rights and shapes his country's
destiny, the man of God, who seeks to purify the
human heart and save a fallen race all must wield
the wondrous power of speech.
4. How far the orators of the past have possessed

this comprehensive art of arts is largely answered in
the social, governmental, and religious freedom of the
nineteenth century.

231. General Requisites.
1. The orator should have a liberal education.
2. He should be actuated by the noblest impulses.
3. He should be endowed with the highest attrib-
utes of humanity.
4. He should possess the most extended information
upon all subjects. To this end, he should have fre-
quent practice in reading, conversation, speaking and
writing.
5. Every physical organ should be subordinate to
the will.
6. The summation of all these qualifications, Cicero
tells us, marks the perfect man.
232. Specific Rules for Extemporaneous Speaking.
1. Have something to say worth hearing.
2. Know more of your subject than do any of your
auditors.
3. Be wide awake and thoroughly in earnest.
4. Believe and feel intensely all you say.
5. Merge yourself into the thoughts you are utter-
ing.
6. Look into the eyes of your hearers, not over
their heads.
7. Cultivate facility and elegance of expression by
using good language at all times.
8. Endeavor to hold your hearers that they may not
wander from the subject.


## p. 301 (#327) ############################################

SPECIFIC RULES FOR EXTEMPORANEOUS SPEAKING. 301
9. Be yourself: you can not personate another with
your ideas.
10. Never lose control of your thoughts, your
breath, or your speech.
11. Avoid all forms of slang: no speaker ever
exhausted the English language.
12. Have a complete mastery of all the elements of
elocution thus your body and limbs are made sub-
jective to the mental powers.
13. Think only of what you are going to say: your
grammar, rhetoric and elocution will suggest the
――――――
manner.
14. If you have five or ten minutes for preparation,
think of the proposition only.
15. Command a faultless articulation, an accurate
pronunciation, and an absolute control of the essential
elements of vocal expression.
16. Carefully study the speeches known to be ex-
temporaneous of eminent orators: consider the time,
place, and circumstance of their delivery.
17. Study the models furnished by Demosthenes,
Cicero, Fox, Sheridan, Burke, Webster and Clay.
18. Avoid great force in the beginning by studied
distinctness and deliberate movement. Your audience
must be led by measured tones of persuasion gradu-
ally up to the more intensified forms of expression.
-
19. In passing from one sentiment or emotion to an-
other, strive to feel the emotion before attempting its
utterance; words without feeling awake no responsive
chord among your hearers.


## p. 302 (#328) ############################################

302
COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION.
20. Commit and frequently recite aloud a few excel-
lent passages abounding in decided sentiment, absorb-
ing emotion and vehement passion. The possession of
the words gives the mind opportunity to dwell upon
the thoughts, and thus their frequent conception and
utterance trains the nerves, muscles and vocal organs
to command the required expression at will
21. Stop the moment you are done.
233. Speaking from Notes.
1. When the speaker has sufficient time to collect
and arrange his thoughts, he should endeavor to think
of all he wishes to say upon the subject, and write the
heads of his thoughts as they occur, and afterward
arrange them in the most appropriate order.
2. In general, the most pleasing and entertaining
matter should appear first. The auditors are never
so critical as when the speaker steps upon the plat-
form. An unfavorable impression once made is too
difficult to overcome to justify the speaker's giving
it an occasion.
3. The closing thoughts should possess merit and
originality, and should be spoken with such sincerity,
vigor and eloquence that an audience shall respect at
least the advocate, if not the sentiment he utters.
4. Do not be tedious. Do not labor to exhaust
your theme. When you can no longer talk without
stopping to think what next to say, you are done,
and should stop at once.

HOME INDORSEMENT.
The following resolution, adopted by the Board of Education of
Edwardsville, Ill., the author's home, shows the appreciation of the
work where it is best known: :-
Oct. 2, 1882.
Resolved, That "BROWN'S COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTIONARY SERIES" be
adopted for the use of the pupils of the VII and VIII grades of this school
district from this date.
From Robt. Allyn, LL.D., Pres. Southern Illinois Normal University:
I have examined your "Common School Elocution" with some care, and
am well pleased with its plan, and better pleased with its execution. It is a
good book, and not its smallest value, to my mind, is its small compass, com-
paratively. People can afford to buy it and can find time to go through it. I
approve it thoroughly.
From E. L. Mc Dowell, Professor of Elocution, Foster's School, St. Louis.
Your "Common School Elocution" is indeed a very ingenious adaption of
Elocutionary principles to the wants of schools, colleges and private students.
In the hands of good teachers it will prove of inestimable value in forming
an effective style of reading and delivery.
From F. A. Fitzpatrick, Supt. City Schools, Leavenworth, Kan.:
I am very much pleased with your "Common School Elocution," its careful
gradation, the purity of its selections and its treatment of a subject of which
we all know too little. I shall try to make a place for it in our course. You
are to be congratulated upon the conception as evinced in the completed
work.
From the American Journal of Education, St. Louis:
As we turn the pages of "Common School Elocution" we discover a new
departure. The old stereotyped plan is ignored, and a rigid investigation of
nature's laws substituted, in which the pupil is led to take an intelligent and
respo
part. There appears to be no progress in pages possible until
principles are analyzed and mastered. As a scientific work, developing the
laws of human expression in a clear and philosophic manner, it deserves a
place among the best books ever presented for school and college use.
From the Illinois School Journal:
The aim of the author has been that of most men who have written for the
"Common School Teacher," namely, to produce a book which can be used to
advantage by the untrained teacher without the aid of practical instruction.
It is this quality, mainly, that marks the financial success of any school book.
That Mr. Brown has been more than ordinarily successful in this, we believe.
He shows the skill of the real teacher by holding to one theme until it can
hardly be misunderstood. The whole book is devoted to the business in hand,
the teaching being continued to the close. An excellent feature is the fact
that the author has not selected scraps for examples. Selections as long as
those found in readers render the book fit to be used as a reading book.
From Geo. A. Boyle, Principal of Marion Schools, Kan.:
I have no hesitation in saying that "Common School Elocution" is the best
book of the kind I have ever seen. After an examination of several other works
on the subject we have adopted your book in our sixth and seventh grades.

From W. H. Hilyard, Co. Supt. Monroe Co., Ill.:
Teachers feel that something is needed to secure higher attainments to
their pupils in their efforts to master the principles underlying a natural de.
livery in reading; and such a demand is unquestionably met in part, if not
entirely, by a recent work entitled, "BROWN'S COMMON SCHOOL ELOCU-
TION." The treatise is designed and adapted for untrained teachers, pre-
senting to such the requisite means whereby the subject of elocution can be
acquired and successfully taught. The subject of GROUPING receives special
attention; and it is believed that few, if any, works are so well adapted as
this to enable the reader to grasp effectively an author's ideas, and to give
proper expression to the thought and sentiment.
From G. L. Bowman, Prin. High School, Prescott, Wis.:
"Common School Elocution" has the following good points: (a.) It pre-
sents to the eye the entire work, by an excellent tabulation. (b.) It gives
minute directions for breathing, and emphasizes that part of the work. (c.)
It gives an idea of each quality of tone by likening it to some sound in nature
familiar to the pupil, and gives minute directions for placing the organs to
produce it. (d.) The selections used for illustrations are fresh, practical,
and sufficiently comprehensive.
From Hon. Jas. P. Slade, State Supt. of Public Instruction, Ill.:
After having examined with some care your "Common School Elocution,"
I have to say that the definitions and directions are clear and concise and
the illustrations and selections excellent.
The book seems to me to be well adapted to the purpose for which it was
prepared, that of helping teachers to learn and to teach the science and the
art of vocal expression. Those desirous of excelling as teachers of reading
will find the work suggestive and very helpful.
From B. F. Sippy, Co. Supt. Madison Co., IU.:
I am pleased to say that, after having carefully reviewed your "Common
School Elocution," it is the best book of the kind that I have ever examined.
The suggestions which appear throughout the book will certainly prove in-
valuable to the teachers of our common school in their efforts to teach that
most neglected of all branches-READING.
From S. B. Hood, Supt. of Randolph Co., Ill.:
"BROWN'S COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION" is exactly adapted to our public
schools. It is a nice mean between the too much of some authors, and the too
little of others.
Its definitions, though concise, are clear, comprehensive and suggestive.
The arrangement of topics is natural and their analysis logical. The practical
bears close and vitalizing relations to the theoretical. The work as a whole is
a rational system of elocution, with copious and well selected exercises for
the elucidation and enforcement of its principles.
From James H. Brownlee, Prof. of Elocution and Literature, Southern Ill., Nor-
mal University:
I have carefully examined the "Common School Elocution," by Prof. I. H.
Brown, and find it to be a thoroughly practical and scholarly work, and well
calculated and adapted for use in the public schools. Just such a book has
been needed, and it deserves a warm welcome from teachers, and a wide cir-
culation. I am pleased to give my unqualified indorsement to so meritorious
a work. Its introduction as a text-book into our schools will not fail to
greatly assist the pupils in mastering the noble and useful art of speaking
and reading with ease, variety and impressive effect.
From J. H. McDonald, Co. Supt. Crawford Co., Wis.:
Allow me to acknowledge the receipt of your timely and meritorious work,
"Common School Elocution." It must prove the thing in assisting teachers,
students and public readers to step out of the present mechanical process of
reading. I hope to see the day when every school "in the land" will be skil-
fully and practically following the observations and suggestions afforded by
this laudable book.
From Miss Amelia W. Platter, Teacher of Elocution, Jeffersonville (Ind.) High
School:
It has given me great pleasure to examine your excellent book. I like it
very much. It is even better than I anticipated.

TESTIMONIALS.
From H. H. Keebler, Prin. of Collinsville (Ill.) Public School:
I have carefully examined your "Common School Elocution," and I am
very much pleased with it. It is well adapted to the wants of the school-
room and private students. The "Common School Elocutionary Selections"
is also a book of merit and compares favorably with the best of similar publi-
cations.
From W. H. La Rue, Prin. of Holt (Mo.) Public Schools:
Your "Common School Elocution," was duly received, and in reply would
say that it is a gem production, and embraces all that is really necessary for a
class of beginners or even those who have some knowledge of this art, and I am
confident that it will stand the test of the most critical.
From J. M. Moore, Prin. Steel City Public Schools, Neb.:
I like your Elocution very much, I have been using it in my school since it
came, I shall send you an order the last of this month.
From Theodore Adelmann, Prin. of Hermann (Mo.) Public Schools:
The nearer a text-book approaches nature the better adapted is it to the
intelligent student. If any text-book possesses the claim of adherence to
nature, "Brown's Elocution" is certainly the one; and I recommend it most
heartily to the student of the much neglected art of Elocution. "Brown's
Elocutionary Selections" is also worthy of much commendation, since it
affords selections in all the various phases and branches of Elocution, with
necessary annotations for the use of the student.
From W. H. Wasson, Prin. Schools, Mound City, Kan.:
I have given your book on Elocution, a thorough examination and like it
very much.
It is a perfect gem, adapted to the use both of common and high schools.
I hope you will meet with the success you so justly merit, for placing so
valuable a book at a price that all can afford.
From W. H. Cole, Author of Cole's Institute Reader:
I am very much pleased with the arrangement of your "Common School
Elocution." We need more work of this kind done in our common schools.
From Isaac W. Ogle, Prin. Steelville (Ill.) Schools:
The pupils are delighted with the work, and I am more than pleased with
it. It ought to be in every school.
From Prof. F. W. Harding, of the Perry (Mich.) Normal and Business Inst.:
I have made a thorough examination of "Common School Elocution" and
consider it among the best. Please send us fourteen copies of the Elocution
and one copy of the Selections.
From W. S. Wilson, Prin. Sheldon (Iowa) Schools:
I like the "Common School Elocution" better than anything of the kind I
have examined. It fills a long felt want. Send me 20 (twenty) copies for
introduction, and be prepared to receive a call for more within a short time.
From Bion S. Hutchins, Supt. and Prin. High School, Beloit, Kan.:
"6
The examination of your Elocution" convinces me that the book is ex-
ceedingly practical for school work, and the selections both in the book of
"Selections" and in the text-book appear to be the very latest and best. I
am highly pleased with it, and hope to be able to use it soon.
From L. E. Smedley, Co. Supt. Putnam Co., 'Ind.:
The entertainment given by Prof. I. H. Brown before the County Institute
at Greencastle, August 16, was one of the most pleasant features of the week.
It consisted of well chosen selections and original sketches, full of wit,
humor, and pathos, delivered in such a way as to bring out the full force of
the sentiment and to please, entertain and convulse his large and appreciative
audience. Prof. Brown has all those rare powers of delivery and facial ex-
pression so necessary to the successful Elocutionist. His entertainment was
highly praised by all who heard him.
From the Petersburg (Ill.) Observer, July 21, 1883:
* * * The selections were excellent and rendered in fine, effective style,
giving conclusive proof that the gentleman has made a careful and intelligent
study of the art of Elocution. His voice is clear, ringing, and under good

control; his utterance distinct, with forcible and pointed expression. The
numerous pieces rendered embraced the humorous, tragic, and pathetic, in
poetry and prose, in both broken and pure English. Mr. Brown's ability to
amuse and entertain his hearers was clearly demonstrated by the close atten-
tion paid him during the evening, as well as by the contagious laughter that
followed each humorous recitation.
From the Tipton (Ind.) Times, Sept. 6, 1883:
* * * Prof. Brown is a thorough master of his art, and completely de-
lighted the audience which assembled to hear him. He is not only a finished
scholar, but a pleasant and sociable gentlemen as well. If he should come
again to Tipton he may rest assured that he will be greeted with a crowded
house such as he deserves.
From Geo. N. Elliott, School Com., Linn Co., Mo.:
Prof. I. H. Brown, during my Normal Institute in August, 1883, lectured to
the teachers on the principles of Elocution and gave a public elocutionary
entertainment. I am convinced that he thoroughly understands the subject
and has many original and useful ideas on the methods of teaching the same.
The entertainment given was interesting and heartily enjoyed by the audi-
ence. His characterization was fine, and his Shakesperian renditions particu-
larly praiseworthy.
From the Harrisburg (Ill.) Chronicle-Sentinel, Aug. 17, 1883:
Prof. I. H. Brown, the Elocutionist, lectured at the M. E. Church Wednes-
day evening, and those who were fortunate enough to be present were well
repaid and immensely pleased and delighted with the entertainment. The
audience was a most an appreciative one. The lecture, while abounding in
amusement was no less instructive in the science of vocal and physical
expression. Prof. Brown is the author of several works on Elocution, and
stands high in his profession. Should he again visit our town we promise
him a much larger audience. The fact is, we want to hear Brown again, and
we want to hear him often. His elocution and his human nature are done up
"brown."
From the Kahoka (Mo.) Herald:
The elocutionary entertainment given by Prof. Brown at the court-house
last Thursday night was indeed a rare treat. Mr. Brown is the finest mimic
and most perfect elocutionist that has been in Kahoka. He was favored with
a large audience, and the general expression was that his entertainment was
the best that has favored this city for years.
From J. F. Arnold, Co. Supt. Jasper Co., Ill.:
Prof. I. H. Brown, gave one of his Elocutionary entertainments at the
Opera Hall, July 25, 1883. He was greeted by a large and appreciative audi-
ence, which he held for one and one-half hours. He recited many fine selec-
tions. And at times received great applause, Prof. Brown is a fine reader
and a natural actor. As a reader he has but few equals
From the Democratic Herald, Lawrenceville, Ill.:
* ** Mr. Brown is an excellent Elocutionist, and has evidently devoted
considerable time and attention to the study of elocution. In the delineation
of German characters he is especially fine. His style of gesticulation is
original with himself and differs materially from that adopted by many public
speakers.
From Frank B. Crockett, Co. Supt. Tipton Co., Ind.:
From observations made during Prof. Brown's work in our Institute ending
in his elocutionary and mimical entertainment under the Institute's auspices,
I take pleasure in commending him as a practical, masterly, unassuming
worker. His "COMMON SCHOOL ELOCUTION" is invaluable. His close rela-
tion with educational work, and especially with the language department, has
enabled him to prepare a book equalled by few and excelled by none. Those
having occasion to use his services will indorse this statement.
From the Highland (Ill.) Telephone:
Prof. Brown, assisted by his nine-year-old daughter, gave a very excellent
Elocutionary entertainment in Turner Hall last Friday evening, which was
well attended. * ** Mr. Brown's rendition of Over the Hill from the

TESTIMONIALS.
Foor House was superb, and his listeners sat in the profoundest silence
drinking in the words of the narrative as though the subject of it himself,
and not a personator, was relating the story. The closing lines were so
grandly given that one could almost in reality see it all, and the sympathetic
tear drop stole into the eye of tender-hearted listeners. This one performance
alone was worth the price of admission. ✶ ✶ * Miss Edith's performances
were very interesting; her grief over her "Dead Doll" could scarcely be
excelled; so apparently natural was her weeping that it was difficult to
realize she was but feigning.
From Chas. H. Martin, Supt. Schools, Lawrenceville, Ill.:
Prof. Brown's work in our Institute was practical and highly appreciated
by the teachers. The more so on account of the enthusiasm which he throws
into his work.
His Elocutionary entertainment given at the court house was well patron-
ized by our citizens and indeed was a success in every respect.
We hope the Professor may visit us again.
From the Mattoon (Ill.) Gazette:
Prof. I. H. Brown gave an Elocutionary entertainment at the rooms of the
Y. M. C. A. last evening. The Professor is a finished elocutionist and gave
his audience a highly enjoyable entertainment. We hope he will pay our city
another visit, and we bespeak for him such an audience as he deserves.
From R. D. Miller, Co. Supt. Menard Co., Ill.:
I take great pleasure in stating to you that your work in our Institute both
in the Public Reading, and in the course of instruction given the class, was
received most favorably; and the verdict of those most competent to judge
is that you are an artist of great ability both natural and acquired; and as a
teacher of Elocution you are unsurpassed by any of the many who have
taught in this place.
From Douglas Dobbins, Co. Supt. Shelby Co., Ind.:
We listened to Prof. Brown two hours. When I say listened I mean the full
perfect act the verb expresses. There was no yawning, no closing up of tired
eyelids, no hungry longing looks toward the door. All went away from his
lecture pleased, and this is what might be heard on our streets next day.
"That Prof. Brown is immense." "His voice is perfect." "His characteriza-
tion is true to life." "His dialectric readings very superior." "His render-
ing of Over the Hill from the Poor House the best we ever heard."
We will try to have him come again.
From the Brookfield (Mo.) Gazette:
Prof. I. H. Brown's Elocutionary entertainment at Strawbridge Hall
on Monday evening, was well attended and gave excellent satisfaction.
*** His Shylock, after Edwin Booth, was the best we ever heard as an
Elocutionary effort; and his parody or modernization of the extortioner's
reply to Antonio, was inimitable, and "brought down the house," as the
phrase goes. Prof. Brown is a master of the noble art.
