 ACCENT. 
 
 AS accent relates to the pronunciation 
 of words taken fmgly, it can have 
 little to do in an effay on the pronunciation 
 of words mfucceffion,as elocution, perhaps, 
 may not improperly be called ; for as 
 words juftly pronounced are merely the 
 materials for delivery, thefe muft all he 
 fuppofed to be in our own poffeflion before 
 we can poffibly begin to arrange and dif- 
 play them to advantage. A perfon who 
 pronounces every word fmgly with the 
 greateft purity, may not be able to read 
 well ; and another may convey the fenfe of 
 an author with great force and beauty,

 who does not always either pronounce the 
 words juftly, or place the accent on the 
 proper fyllable. The only point, there- 
 fore, in which it will be neceffary to take 
 notice of accent in reading, is that where 
 the emphafis requires a tranfpofition of it : 
 this happens when two words which have 
 a famenefs in part of their formation, are 
 oppofed to each other in fenfe. Thus, if 
 I pronounce the words jujlice and injuJHcc 
 as fmgle words, I naturally place the ac- 
 cent on the penultimate fyllable of both ; 
 but if I contrail them, and fay Neither 
 jujlice nor injujlice have any thing to do 
 with the prefent quejlion ; in this fentence 
 I naturally place the accent on the firfl 
 fyllable of injujlice^ in order the more 
 forcibly and clearly to diftinguifh it from 
 jnflice. This- tranfpofition of the accent, 
 which is fo evidently dictated by the fenfe, 
 extends itfelf to all words which have a 
 famenefs of termination, though they may

 I wanted more particularly to {how that 
 I meant one requifite of dramatic ftory ra- 
 ther than another, I fhould fay In this 
 fpectes of compofttion^ flaujibility is much 
 more ejjential than probability ; and in the 
 pronunciation of thefe words, I mould 
 infallibly tranfpofe the accent of both, 
 from the third to the firft fyllables ; in or- 
 der to contrail thofe parts of the words 
 which are diftinguimed from each other 
 by the import of the fentence. As an in- 
 ftance of the neceflity of attending to this 
 emphatical accent, as it may be called, 
 we need only give a paffage from the 
 Spectator, N 189. 
 
 In this cafe I may uCe the faying of an emi- 
 nent wit, who upon fome great men's preffing 
 him to forgive his daughter who had married 
 againft his confent, told them he could refufe 
 nothing to their inftances, but that he would 
 have them remember there was a difference be- 
 tween giving and/wgiving.

 In this example, we find the whole fenfe 
 of the paflage depends on placing the ac- 
 cent on the firft fyllable of forgiving, in 
 order to contraft it more ftrongly with 
 giving*, to which it is oppofed ; as with- 
 out this tranfpofition of accent, the oppo- 
 fition, on which the fentiment turns, would 
 be loft. 
 
 Another inftance will more fully illuf- 
 trate the neceffity of attending to this em- 
 phatical accent. 
 
 The prince for the public good has a fovc- 
 rei^n property in every private performs eflatc; 
 and, confequently, his riches muft /crealc or 
 ^creafe, in proportion to the number and riches 
 
 of his fubjefts. Spi'u. N 200. 
 
 The words mcreafe and decreafe have, in 
 this example, the accent on the firfl fyl- 
 lable of each, as k is there the contraft in 
 in the fcnfe lies. 
 
 What has already been fuid of accent, 
 as it relates to the art of reading, is, per-

 haps, more than fufficient ; but fo much 
 has been faid about the nature of this ac- 
 cent, both in the ancient and modern lan- 
 guages,- that it may not be improper to 
 offer a few thoughts on the fubjecl: here. 
 Some authors confidently aflert, that the 
 accented fyllable is pronounced in a higher 
 tone than the reft, and others infift that it 
 is not pronounced higher but louder only. 
 Whatever may have been the nature of 
 accent in the learned languages, certain it 
 is, that the accented fyllable in our own, 
 is always louder than the reft, and if we 
 attend ever fo little to the two kinds of 
 inflexion with which every accented word 
 in a fentence is pronounced, we fhall foon 
 fee that the accented fyllable is either 
 higher or lower than the reft, according to 
 the inflexion which it adopts. 
 
 Thus in this fentence, Plate III. N 8. 
 
 Sooner or later virtue muft meet with a re- 
 war d\ .

 6 ELEMENTS OF 
 
 Here I fay the laft fyllable -leyzn/ has the 
 falling inflexion, and if we pronounce 
 the word without emphafis, and merely as 
 if we were concluding the fubjecl:, this 
 fyllable will be pronounced louder and 
 lower than the fyllable immediately pre- 
 eeeding ; but if we give emphafis to this 
 fyllable, by oppofmg it to fomething elfe, 
 we fhall find it pronounced both higher 
 and louder than the preceding fyllables. 
 Thus in the following fente'nce, Plate III, 
 N J I. 
 
 Virtue will meet with a reward^, and not pu- 
 ni{hment // . 
 
 Here the word reward has the fame in- 
 flexion as in the former initance, and the 
 word punifhmeiit ends with the rifing in- 
 flexion ; but the fyllable ward is percepti- 
 bly higher as well as louder than the fyl-r 
 lablc that precedes it. Again : if we give 
 this word the rifing inflexion, we mall 
 find in this cafe, that without emphafis 
 
 the

 accented fyllable ward is pronounced 
 both louder and higher than the preced-* 
 ing fyllables. Thus N II. 
 
 If virtue muft have a reward 7 , it is our in- 
 tereft to be virtuous. 
 
 Thefe obfervations compare the accented 
 fyljable with the preceding fyllables only, 
 it will in the next place be neceflary to 
 compare it with thofe that follow : for 
 which purpofe let us obferve the pronun- 
 ciation of this fentence, N III. 
 So that no man living can be faid to be perfect^. 
 If in this example we pronounce the 
 word perfect without any emphafis, and 
 merely as if we were concluding a dif- 
 courfe, we fliall find the accented fyllable 
 adopting the falling inflexion, and pro- 
 nounced fomewhat higher and louder than 
 the laft. The fame inflexion of voice 
 .upon the accented fyllable, and the higher 
 tone of this fyllable than the laft, will ap- 
 pear much more perceptibly by pronounc-

 ing this word in the following fentence, 
 NIV. 
 
 We ought to avoid blame, though we can- 
 not bt perfetfi* 
 
 Here, I fay, if we give the word per-* 
 feft the falling inflexion, and pronounce 
 it with emphafis, we fhall find the firft 
 fyllable very perceptibly higher and louder 
 than the laft ; on the contrary, if we give 
 the word perfeft the rifmg inflexion, we 
 fhall find the accented fyllable louder than 
 the laft, though not fo high, for the laft 
 fyllable perceptibly flides into a higher 
 tone. Thus N V. 
 
 If we wifli to be perfect', we muft imitate 
 
 God. 
 
 Thefe obfervations will, perhaps, be ftilJ 
 better conceived, by watching our pronun- 
 ciation of a word where the accent is 
 nearly in the middle. Thus in this paf- 
 ige of Shakefpeare, N VI, 
 
 What

 In this pafiage, I fay, the fyllable rog 
 has the rifmg inflexion, and is pronounced 
 perceptibly louder and higher than the 
 
 two firft, and louder and lower than the

 three laft : but if we give this fyllable the 
 falling inflexion, as in this fentence,N VIL 
 He is neither moved by intreaties nor inter- 
 rog\atories, 
 
 Here, I fay, the fyllable rog if pro- 
 nounced with the leaft degree of emphafis, 
 is both louder and higher than either the 
 preceding or fubfequent fyllables. 
 
 From thefe obfervations this general 
 conclufion may be drawn ; WHATEVER 
 
 INFLECTION IS ADOPTED, THE ACCENT- 
 ED SYLLABLE IS ALWAYS LOUDER 
 
 THAN THE REST ; BUT IF THE ACCENT 
 IS PRONOUNCED WITH THE RISING IN- 
 INFLEXION, THE ACCENTED SYLLABLE

 THAN AN-Y OT;HE& SYLLABLE, EITHER 
 
 PRECEDING OR S'UCCf EDiNG. The only 
 exception to this is, the fentence, N VIII. 
 where the accent is on the laft fy liable of 
 a word which has no emphails, and is pro- 
 nounced as at the concluiion of a difcourfe. 
 Sooner or later virtue muft meet with its re- 
 
 Here the laft fyllahle, though pronouns 
 ed louder than the firft is evidently pro- 
 jQounced a degree lower. 
 
 It may not, perhaps, be improper t9 
 Jake notice of a ufage of the word accent, 
 which, though feemirigly inaccurate, will 
 be found upon examination, to be a juft 
 application of the word. It is the cuftom,<

 of the worjd 9 which are feats pf empire, 
 ^o call thofe modes of pronunciation ufe<J 
 in parts diilant from the capital, by the 
 name of accents. Thus we fay, a native 
 pf Ireland fpeaks Englifh with the Irim, 
 and a native of Scotland with the Scotch 
 accent ; though both thefe fpeakers pro- 
 nounce every word with the accent on the 
 very fame fyflable as the Englim. Why 
 then do we fay, they fpeak with a differ- 
 ent accent ? The reafon is, that fpeaking 
 founds have never been fufficiently ana- 
 lyzed, to enable us to difcover their com- 
 ponent parts, which makes us take up 
 with indefinite and unfpecific terms, in- 
 ftead of fuch as are precife and appropriated 
 to their. ohjeft. This has greatly obfcured 
 the notion of accent, and led feme * to fup~ 
 pofe, that accent in our language is no 
 more than a force upon a certain fyllable 
 of a word which diftinguifhes it from the

 to inflexions of voice, and for that reafon 
 the word is ufed by us in the fingular 
 number, f Others have imagined; that 
 we have two accents, the grave and acute ; 
 but in the definition of thefe, they feem 
 only to mean that the latter has a -greater 
 degree of force than the former. Thus 
 for want of the fimple diftindion of the 
 riiing and falling flide of the voice, with 
 which every accented fyllable muft necef- 
 farily be pronounced, the nature of our 
 own accent feems as obfcure, and as little 
 \inderftoo4, as thofe of the Greeks and 
 Romans ; and it is to this obfcurity we owe 
 the fuppofed impropriety of calling a dia- 
 led: by the name of accent : for though 
 there are other differences in the Scotch 
 and Jriih pronunciation of Englifh befides 
 this, it is to the difference of accent that 
 the chief diveriity is owing : if we under-

 is, indeed, the flighteft difference imagin- 
 able ; fmce in both thefe kingdoms the 
 ftrefs is (to the exception of very few 
 words indeed,) laid on the fame fyllable as 
 in England : and, for this reafon, the laws 
 of poetry are exactly the fame in all : but 
 if we divide accent into grave and acute, 
 and call the acute the ftrefs with the rifmg 
 inflexion, and the grave the ftrefs with the 
 falling inflexion, we (hall then fee the pro- 
 priety of faying, fuch a one fpeaks with 
 the Irifh or Scotch accent ; for though the 
 Irifh place the ftrefs precifely on the fame 
 fyllable as the Engliih, it is often with a 
 different inflexion ; and the fame may be 
 faid of the Scotch. Thus the Scotch pro- 
 nounce the far greater part of their words 
 with the acute accent, or rifmg inflection, 
 and the Irifh as conftantly make ufe of the 
 grave accent, or falling inflexion, while 
 the Englifh obferve pretty nearly a

 as it were, from the level of fpeaking, and

 into a comparative obfcurity. 
 
 From this general idea of emphafis, it 
 will readily appear of how much confe- 
 quence it is to readers and fpeakers not to 
 be miftaken in it ; the neceffity of diflin- 
 guiihing the emphatical words from the 
 reft, has made writers on this fubject ex- 
 tremely felicitous to give fuch rules for 
 placing the emphafis, as may, in fome 
 meaiurc, facilitate this difficult part of elo- 
 cution : but few have gone farther than 
 to tell us, that we muft place the emphafis 
 on that word in reading, which we ihould 
 make emphatical in fpeaking ; and though 
 the importance of emphafis is infilled on 
 with the utmoit force and elegance of lan- 
 guage, no alliftance is given us to deter- 
 mine which is the emphatic word where

 fenfe of the author is the fole direction 
 we are referred to, and all is left to the- 
 tafte and imcferftanding of the reader. 
 
 One ^'writer, indeed, the author of the 
 Philpfopfyical _ Enquiry into the , Delivery 
 of written language, .has. given us a dif- 
 tintion of emphafis into two . kinds, 
 which has thrown great light upon this 
 abftrufe fubjec~h This gentleman diftin^ 
 guifhes the ftrefs into emphafis of force, 
 and emphafis of fenfe. " Emphafis of 
 " force," he tells us, " is that ftrefs we 
 " lay on almofl every fignificant word ; 
 " emphafis of fenfe, is that ftrefs we lay 
 44 on one or two particular words, which 
 " diftinguifhes them from all the reft in

 " the latter," he fays, " is determined by

 it muft be owned, is, in general, a very 
 juft one ; and a want of attending to it, 
 has occafioned great confufion in this fub- 
 ject, even in our beft writers ; they per- 
 ceived, that befides thofe words which 
 were ftrongly emphatical, there were many 
 others that had a ftrefs greatly fuperior to 
 the particles and lefs fignificant words, and 
 thefe they jumbled together under the ge- 
 neral term emphafis. Thus when the em- 
 phatical words were to be marked by be- 
 ing printed in a different character, we 
 find in feveral of the modern productions 
 on reading, that fometimes more than half 
 of the words are printed in Italics, and 
 confidered as equally emphatical. The 
 wrong tendency of iuch a practice is fuf- 
 ficiently obvious, but its origin was never

 which this author has given, that I {hall 
 endeavour to pufh my enquiries into em- 
 phafis ftill farther than he has done : I 
 {hall not only eftablifh the diftindtion he 
 has laid down, but attempt to draw the 
 line between thefe two kinds of emphafis, 
 fo as to mark more precifely the bounda- 
 ries of each. To this diftineiion of em- 
 phafis, I mall add another : I mail make 
 a diftin&ion of each into two kinds, ac- 
 cording to the inflexion of voice they 
 adopt ; which, though of the utmoft im- 
 portance in conveying a juft idea of em- 
 phafis, has never been noticed by any of 
 our writers on the fubjecl;. This diftinc- 
 tion of emphafis arifes naturally from the 
 obfervations already laid down, on therifmg

 importance of attending to thefe two in- 
 flexions in the feveral parts, and at the 
 end of a fentence ; and it is prefumed, the 
 utility of attending to the fame inflexions, 
 when applied to emphaffs, will appear ho 
 lefs evident and unquestionable. 
 
 But before we enter into this diftinbion 
 of emphatic inflexion, it may not be im- 
 proper to {how more precifely the diftinc-^ 
 tion of emphaiis, into that which arifes 
 from the peculiar fenfe of one or two 
 words in a fentence, and that which arifeS 
 from the greater importance of the nouft^i 
 verbs, and other fignificant words, tharr 
 of connectives and particles. And firft, 
 let us examine feme paflages where only 
 the latter ki'ncl of emphafis is found ; thi&

 lefs forcible pronunciation ; and this lefs 
 forcible pronunciation on the fmaller 
 words, raifes the others to fome degree of 
 emphafis. If we pronounce the next fen-

 underftood, it fitiks into 'the fame degree 
 'of obfcurity with the particles, and cannot 
 be raifed from this dbfcurity without di- 
 miniming the force of the emphatic word 
 Itfelf. 
 
 This brings us to a threefold diftinction 
 of words with regard to the force with 
 which they are pronounced ; namely, the 
 'conjunctions, particles, and words under- 
 ftood, which are obfcurely and feebly pro- 
 nounced; the'fubftantives, verbs, and more 
 fignificant words, which are firmly and 
 diftinftly pronounced ; and the emphatical 
 word, which is forcibly pronounced: it is 
 the laft of thefe only which can be pro-t 
 perly ftyled emphafis, and it is to a difco^ 
 very of the nature and caufe of this em- 
 phafis, that all our attention ought to be 
 directed. 
 
 And 'firft we may obferve, that if thefe 
 diftin&ions are juft, the common defini- 
 tion of emphafis is very faulty. Empha-*

 fis is faid to be a ftrefs laid on one or more 
 words to diftinguifh them from others : 
 but this definition, as we have juft feen, 
 makes almoft every word in a fentence 
 emphatical, and, at the fame time, con- 
 founds the diftindion between words which 
 have force from a peculiarity of meaning, 
 and thofe which have force from having 
 only more meaning than the particles. 
 Here then we mufl endeavour to invefti- 
 gate a jufter definition ; fuch a one as will 
 enable us to diftmguim words which are 
 really emphatical, from thofe which are 
 only pronounced with common force : for, 
 as the ingenious author above mentioned 
 has observed, thefe latter words may fome- 
 times be forcibly and fometimes feebly 
 pronounced, without any importance to 
 the fenfe ; but the former, that is, fuck 
 xvords as are truly emphatical, muft al-

 jured : this emphafis, therefore, ought to 
 be the firft object of enquiry. 
 
 The principal circumftance that diftin- 
 guifties emphatical words from others, 
 feems to be a meaning which points out, 
 or diftinguimes, fomething as diftinct or 
 oppofite to fome other thing. When this 
 oppofition is exprefled in words, it forms 
 an antithefis, the oppofite parts of which 
 are always emphatical. Thus in the fol- 
 lowing couplet from Pope : 
 
 'Tis hard to fay, if greater want of ikill 
 Appear in writing or in judging ill. 
 
 The words writing and judging are op- 
 pofed to each other, and are therefore the 
 emphatical words : where we may like- 
 wife obferve, that the disjunctive or, by 
 which the antithelis is connected, means 
 one of the things exclufi vely of the other ; 
 the fame may be obferved in another coup- 
 Jet from the fame author; where one

 Here it appears evidently, , that .the words 
 any means, which are the moil :emphatical, 
 are -diredly oppofe}! to the .means under- 
 ilood by the word^r^^, and the laft line 
 is perfectly equivalent to this. "-If not 
 tc by thefe means, by any other means, 
 " get wealth and place." 
 
 In thefe inftances, the oppofition fug- 
 geiled by the emphatical word is evident 
 at firft fight ; in other cafes, perhaps, the 
 antithefis is not quite fo obvious, but if 
 an emphafis can be laid on any word, we 
 may be affured that word is in antithefis 
 with fome meaning agreeable to the ge- 
 neral fenfe of the paffage. 
 
 To illuftrate this, let us pronounce a 
 line of -Marcus in Cato, where exprefling

 his indignation at the behaviour of Csefar, 
 he fays : 
 
 I'm tortuf'd eVn to madnefs, when I think 
 Of the proud vldtor 
 
 And we ihall find the greateft ftrefs fall 
 naturally on that word, which feerns op- 
 pofed to fome common or general mean- 
 ing ; for the young hero does not fay in 
 the common and unemphatic fenfe of the 
 word think) that he is tortured even to 
 madnefs when thinks on Csefar ; but in 
 the ftrong and emphatic fenfe of this word ; 
 which implies, not only " when I hear or 
 '*. difcourfe of him, but even when I think 
 " of him I am tortured even to ma,dnefs." 
 As the word think therefore, fifes above 
 the common level of fignification, it. is 
 pronounced above the common level of 
 found ; and as this fignification is oppofed 
 to a fignification lefs forcible, the word 
 may be properly faid to be emphatical.

 This more than ordinary meaning, of 
 a meaning oppofed to fome other mean^ 
 ing, feems to be the principal fource of 
 emphafis ; for if, as in the laft inftance, 
 we find the words will bear this oppo- 
 fition to their common fignification, we 
 may be fure they are emphatical ; this 
 will be flill more evident from another 
 example ; 
 
 By the faculty of a lively and picturefque 
 imagination, a man in a dungeon is capable 
 of entertaining himfelf with fcencs and land- 
 ikips, more beautiful than any that can be 
 found in the whole compafs of nature. 
 
 Spectator, N4ir. 
 
 If we read this paflage without that em- 
 phafis which the word dungeon requires, 
 we enervate the meaning, and fcarcely 
 give the fenfe of the author ; for the im- 
 port plainly is, that a lively imagination, 
 not merely abfent from beautiful fcenes, 
 but even in a dungeon, can form fcenes 
 
 more beautiful than any in nature.

 This plenitude of meaning in a parti- 
 cular word, is not always fo prominent as 
 to be difcernible by a common reader, 
 but wherever it really exifts, the general 
 meaning of the author is greatly enforced 
 by emphatically pointing it out. Let us* 
 take an example : 
 
 Steele begins one of his letters in the 
 Spectator by the following fentence ; 
 
 I have very often lamented, and hinted my 
 forrow in feveral fpeculations, that the art of

 provement of our manners. Speft, N 226. 
 
 As in this fentence, which is the firfl 
 in the eflay, it is taken from, we find a 
 new and important object introduced, fo 
 if we do not pronounce it with emphafis, 
 it will not be fufficiently noticed. The

 Wherever the contrariety or oppofition

 reading, lies in a difcovery of thofe words 
 which are in oppofition to fomething not 
 exprefled, but underftood ; and the beft 
 method to find the emphafis in thefe fen- 
 tences, is to take the word we fuppofe to 
 be emphatical, and try whether it will 
 admit of thofe words being fupplied, 
 which an emphafis on it would fuggeft : 
 if when thefe words are fupplied, we find 
 them not only agreeable to the meaning 
 of the writer, but an improvement of his 
 meaning, we may pronounce the word 
 emphatical ; but if thefe words we fupply, 
 are not agreeable to the meaning of the 
 words exprefled, or elfe give them an af- 
 fected and fanciful meaning, we ought by 
 no means to lay the emphafis upon them :

 We fhall find but few readers lay any 
 confiderable ftrefs upon the word piSiure,

 the former rule, we lhall find a ftrefs upon

 a polite imagination does not only find 
 pleafiire in converfmg with thofe objects 
 which give pleafure to all, but with thofe 
 which give pleaiure to fuch only as can 
 converle with them ; here r then the em-

 ftill more evidently by reading the paflage 
 both ways, as in the laft example. 
 
 But if emphafis does not improve, it al- 
 ways vitiates the fenfe ; and, therefore, 
 fhould be always avoided where the ufe of 
 it is not evident : this will appear by plac- 
 ing an emphafis on a word in a fentence 
 which does not require it.

 verty of tafte the town is fallen into with rela-

 Now if we lay a confiderable degree of 
 emphafis upon the words good fenfe it will 
 ftrongly fugged that the people here men- 
 tioned are not common or ordinary people,

 therefore, without any emphafis on them,

 From thefe obfervations, the following

 CONTRADISTINCTION, 
 
 Emphafis thus inveftigated and defined, 
 we may obferve, that all words are pro- 
 nounced either with emphatic force, ac- 
 cented force, or unaccented force ; this laft 
 kind of force we may call by the name of 
 feeblenefs ; or, in other words, where the 
 words are in contradiftinclion to other 
 words, or to fome fenfe implied, we may 
 call them emphatic ; where they do not 
 denote contradiftinclion and yet are more 
 important than the particles, we may call 
 them accented, and the particles and lefTer 
 words we may call unaccented or feeble 5

 word, are pronounced with as much lefs 
 force than the accented fyllable, as the un-

 are lefs forcible than the accented fyllable of

 and the two laft fyllables of the emphatic 
 word indifferent, are as much below the 
 fecond fyllable in force, as the particles 
 and unaccented fyllables [_are below thofe 
 which have an accent. 
 
 By this threefold diftincYion we are en- 
 abled to make very confiderable advances 
 in the methods of conveying mftructiort 
 in reading ; we cannot only mark the 
 emphatic words as ufual, but diftinguifh 
 them from the accented : thefe again may 
 be diftinguimed from the unaccented, and 
 by thefe means we make a nearer approach 
 to the fenie of compofition, and to a me- 
 thod of conveying our delivery of it to 
 others. But a {till greater advance re- 
 mains to be made by another diftinction : 
 a diftincYion, which, to the former advan- 
 tages of marking the different degrees of 
 force on words, adds the ftill more ftrik-

 diftinction, though obvious and palpable, 
 is perfectly new ; and cannot fail to add 
 greatly to inftrudion in fpeaking, as thefe 
 two different inflexions of voice are the 
 moft marking and fignificant diftindions 
 of fpeech. 
 
 As a fpecimen "of the utility of thefe 
 diftindtions of emphafis and inflexion, we 
 may obferve, that a difference of charac- 
 ter may exprefs the different degrees of 
 force with which every word is pronounc- 
 ed, and a different accent may fhow what 
 inflexion each of thefe forces muft adopt. 
 Thus in the following example : 
 
 exsrcife and temperance ftrengthen even an IN" 
 DIFFERENT conftitution. 
 
 Here we fee a threefold diftindion of 
 force : the word indifferent is emphatical, 
 and has the greateft flrefs ; the words ex- 
 ercife, temperance^ wb&Jlrengthen^ have a 
 lefler degree of force ; and the words and y

 fmaller degree of ftrefs, and may be faid 
 to be abfolutely feeble : and thefe different 
 forces are diverfified by the difference of 
 inflexion, as marked in the example. But 
 although in certain critical cafes, where 
 the fenfe of an author is difficult to point 
 out, all thefe three diftinctions may greatly 
 afllft us in conveying the exat pronuncia^ 
 tion ; yet in general, it will be quite fuf- 
 ficient to mark the emphatic word with 
 fmall Italics^ and the reft with Roman 
 letters, without entering into the diftinc- 
 tintion of the feeble words from thofe 
 that have a fecondary force, which feeble 
 words, if neceffary to be pointed out, may 
 be denoted by the fmall Roman letter, and 
 their different inflexions by a different ac- 
 cent. 
 
 03 Note. If an acute or grave accent 3s over the accent- 
 ed fyllable of a word, it indicates that the word muft 
 be pronounced with the riling or falling inflexion, as 
 much as if thefe accents had been placed at the end 
 gif the word.

 THEORY OF EMPHATIC INFLEXION. 
 
 T TAving thus endeavoured to give a clear 
 ^ and diftinft idea of the two different 
 kinds of emphafis, and attempted to prove, 
 
 that ernphafis, properly fo called, always 
 i 
 
 fuppofes contradiflinction or antithefis, ei- 
 ther expreffed or underftood ; it will now 
 be neceiTary to fhow that every emphatic 
 word, properly fo called, is as much dif- 
 tinguifhed by the inflexion it adopts, as 
 by the force with which it is pronounced. 
 We have feen already that where there 
 is no emphafis, the moft figmficant words 
 in a fentence adopt a different inflexion of 
 voice for the fake of variety and harmony : 
 for provided the fentence reads well it is 
 of no confcquence on which words the 
 different inflexions are placed. Thus in 
 the following fentence : 
 
 Excrcifc^ and temperance' ftrengthen / the 
 conftitutionN.

 In this fentence, I fay, the words temper- 
 ance and Jlrengthen have the rifing, and 
 exercife and conftitution the falling infle- 
 xion ; but if this fentence were lengthened 
 by the addition of another member, we 
 fliould find the inflexions fhift their places. 
 Thus in the following fentence : 
 
 Exercife ' and temperance^ ftreamherA the 
 conftitution/ and fweeten/ the enjoyments' of 
 life\. 
 
 Here, I fay, the words exercife and conftl. 
 tutlon have the rifmg, and temperance and 
 Strengthen the falling inflexion, as moft 
 agreeable to the harmony of the whole 
 fentence : but if a word really emphatical 
 had been in the firft fentence, no addi- 
 tional member would have obliged it to 
 alter its inflexion. Thus in the following 
 fentence : 
 
 ExercifeN and temperance/ firengthen/ even 
 
 an indifferent^ conftitution. 
 Here the word indifferent, which is really 
 l, has the falling inflexion ; and 
 
 this

 44 ELEMENTS OF 
 
 this inflexion it will ftill preferve though 
 we lengthen the fentence in imitation of 
 the former by an additional member. For 
 example : 
 
 Exercife/ and temperance^ ftrengthen/ even 
 an indifferent conftitution/, and fupply\ in 
 feme/ meafure the imperfections/ of nature^. 
 
 Here we find that, however the infle- 
 xion may change place on the reft of the 
 words, the word indifferent muft always 
 have the falling inflexion, or the fenfe of 
 the fentence will not be brought perfectly 
 out. In the fame manner we may ob- 
 ferve, that the fame word in another fen- 
 tence, when it requires ,the rifing infle- 
 xion, cannot alter that inflexion to the 
 falling, without injuring the fenfe. Thus 
 in the following fentence. 
 
 He that has but an indifferent conftitution 
 ought to ilrcngthen it by exercife and temper- 
 ance. 
 
 Kere the word indifferent muft necefla- 
 
 sily have the emphaiis with the rifing in-

 flexion, whatever may be the inflexion on 
 the other words. 
 
 As a farther proof that emphatic words 
 cannot alter their inflexion, we need only 
 attend to the pronunciation of a line in 
 Milton, where two emphatic words are 
 oppofed to each other ; fpeaking of Nim- 
 rod, he fays, 
 
 Hunting (and meri^ not beajls' lhall be his 
 game.) B. xii. v. 30. 
 
 In pronouncing this paflage, we fhall 
 find every reader lay the falling inflexion 
 on men, and the rifmg on beafts, as giv- 
 ing them a contrary pofition, that is, pro- 
 nouncing men with the rifmg, and beafts 
 with the falling inflexion, would foon 
 convince us that the former arrangement 
 is precifely what the fenfe demands. 
 
 From thefe obfervations this maxim 
 arifes, that as the emphafis of a word de- 
 pends on the fenfe of a fentence, fo the 
 inflexion of voice which this emphatic 
 
 word

 there are two emphatic words in the fame 
 fentence, the fenfe alone can decide which 
 is to have the riling, and which the fail- 
 ing inflexion of voice. 
 
 It has heen already proved, that em-, 
 phails always implies antithesis ; and that 
 where this antithefis is agreeable to the 
 fenfe of the author, the emphafis is pro- 
 per ; but that where there is no antithefis 
 in the thought, there ought to be none on 
 the words ; becaufe, whenever an empha- 
 fis is placed upon an improper word, it 
 will fuggelt an antithefis, which either 
 does not exlft, or is not agreeable to the 
 fenfe and intention of the writer. Here

 why one emphatic word fhould adopt the 
 rifing inflexion, and another the falling : 
 from the foregoing examples, it appears, 
 that every emphatic word requires either 
 the one or the other of thefe inflexions, 
 and that the meaning of an author entirely 
 depends on giving each emphatic word its 
 peculiar inflexion. It does not feem there- 
 fore entirely ufelefs, fo far to enquire into 
 the nature, or fpecific quality, if I may be 
 allowed to call it fo, of thefe two empha-

 It has been obferved, that emphafis is

 that where it is only implied ; or in other

 THE RISING INFLECTION IS TO BE 
 PLACED ON THOSE WORDS, WHICH, 
 THOUGH IN CONTRADISTINCTION TO 
 SOMETHING, ELSE DO NOT ABSOLUTELY 
 
 EXCLUDE ITS EXISTENCE. Let us try 
 this by an example. Lothario, in the Fair

 phafis with the rifing inflexion ; which 
 intimates, that however Lothario might 
 be reftrained by the force of others, Ho- 
 ratio's force, at leaft, was too infignificant 
 to control him : and as a farther proof 
 
 that

 that this is the fenfe fuggefted by the rif- 
 ing inflexion on the word thy^ if we do 
 but alter the inflexion upon this word, by 
 giving it the emphafis with the falling in- 
 flexion, we fhall find, that inftead of con- 
 tempt and fneer, a compliment will be 
 paid to Horatio ; for it would imply as 
 much as if Lothario had faid, 1 would not 
 turn afide from my leaft pleafure, not only 
 though common force, but even though thy

 the paflage is evident. 
 
 Here then we feem arrived at the true 
 principle of diftinclion in emphafis. ALL 
 
 EMPHASIS HAS AN ANTITHESIS EITHER 
 EXPRESSED OR UNDERSTOOD; IF THE 
 EMPHASIS EXCLUDES THE ANTITHESIS, 
 THE EMPHATIC WORD HAS THE FALL-

 THE EMPHATIC WORD HAS THE RISING

 INFLEXION. The grand diftindion, 
 therefore, between the two emphatic in- 
 flexions is this ; THE FALLING INFLE- 
 XION AFFIRMS SOMETHING IN THE 
 EMPHASIS, AND DENIES WHAT IS OP- 
 POSED TO IT IN THE ANTITHESIS; 
 
 WHILE THE EMPHASIS WITH THE 
 RISING INFLEXION, AFFIRMS SOME-* 
 THING IN THE EMPHASIS, WITHOUT 
 DENYING WHAT IS OPPOSED TO IT IN 
 
 THE ANTITHESIS : the former therefore 
 from its affirming and denying abfolutely, 
 may be called the flrong emphafis, and 
 the latter from its affirming only, and not 
 denying, may be called the weak empha- 
 fis. As a farther trial of the truth of 
 thefe definitions, let us examine them by 
 a few additional examples. 
 
 When Richard the Third rejects the 
 propofal of the duke of Norfolk to par- 
 don the rebels, he fays :

 In this example, we find feveral words 
 ernphatical ; but the words defpite and fear 
 particularly fo : thefe are always pro- 
 nounced with the ftrong emphafis, which 
 always adopts the falling inflexion. In 
 the foregoing definition of this emphafis, 
 it is faid, that the falling inflexion affirms 
 fomething in the emphafis, and denies 
 what is oppofed to it in the antithefis ; 
 and we accordingly find, that fomething 
 is affirmed of the -words defpite and fear^ 
 and fomething is denied of the antithetic 
 objects fuggefied by thefe words, which 
 are favour andjear/ej/hefs for the para-

 but in their defpite a monarch and let not 
 we who amfearlefs, but kings that fear, for- 
 give : by which we perceive, the juftnefs 
 of the definition ; for what is affirmed of 
 the emphatic object is denied of the anti- 
 thetic objedt ; agreeably to the definition 
 of the ftrong emphafis, or the emphafis 
 with the falling inflexion : another exam- 
 ple will ferve farther to illuftrate the na- 
 ture of this fpecies of emphafis. 
 
 When Cato is encouraging his little fe- 
 nate to hold out againft Caefar to the laft, 
 he fays : 
 
 Why fhould Rome fall a moment^ ere her 
 time ? 
 
 The emphafis, with the falling inflexion 
 on the word moment, which is the infle- 
 xion it is always pronounced with, fug- 
 gefts an antithefis oppofed to a moment, 
 which antithefis is, a r oery fhort time, and 
 the import of this emphafis at length, 
 would be equivalent to this : Why Jhould

 Rome fall not only a tittle, but even a mo- 
 ment before her time ? By which para- 
 phrafe, we fee the definition of this em- 
 phafis again exemplified ; for fomething- 
 is affirmed of the emphatic object, and 
 fomething is denied of the antithetic object. 
 Another example will make the juftnefs 
 of the definition ftill more evident. King 
 Henry, in Richard the Third, fpeaking of 
 the foftnefs of his difpofition, fays : 
 
 In my eytsjuftice has feem'd bloody. 
 
 Rich. III. Aft i. 
 
 In this line the emphafis, with the fall- 
 ing inflexion on the wordyw/fe-, intimates 
 that not only barbarity and cruelty , but 
 even juftice feemed bloody : and here, as in 
 the former examples, the emphatic phrafe 
 is a pofitive propofition, and the antithe- 
 tic phrafe a negative one. 
 
 The import of the emphafis with the 
 rifing inflexion, may be exemplified by 
 the following paiTage. Horatio, in the 
 
 Fair

 gery, fays :

 To forge a fcroll fo villainous and loofe 
 And mark it with a noble lady's name. 
 
 Fair Penit. Act ii. 
 
 The word man, in the firft line of this ex- 
 ample, is the emphatic object, which mufl 
 neceffarily have the rifmg inflexion ; be- 
 caufe this inflexion intimates, that fome- 
 thing is affirmed of the emphatic, which 
 is not denied of the antithetic object : the 
 antithetic object to the word man, we may 
 , fuppofe, to be fome being of a lower or-" 
 der ; and if this ernphafis were paraphrafed 
 it would run thus : 'Fives baj'e and poor , 
 unworthy of a man, though not univorthy 
 of a brute. And thus we find, that in 
 this emphafis, what is affirmed of the em- 
 phatic object is not denied of the antithe- 
 tic object, agreeably to the definition laid 
 
 down.

 In the examples which have been hi- 
 therto produced, the emphafis has always 
 clearly fuggefted the andthefis ; and a pa- 
 raphrafe, formed by producing both the 
 emphatic and antithetic object, has readily 
 prefented itfelf : but there are many in- 
 ftances, where, though the antithetic ob- 
 ject is equally real, it is not fo eafily made 
 out. In order to facilitate this operation, 
 it will be neceflary to obferve, that the 
 human feelings have recourfe to the moft 
 minute diftinctions imaginable for the fake 
 of exprelfmg thofe feelings with precifion 
 find force. 
 
 Thus when Lothario, in the Fair Peni- 
 tent, fays to Lucilla :

 Fair Penlt. Act i.

 In the fame manner, when Jane Shore 
 is protefting her fidelity to Edward's iffue, 
 Glofter anfwers : 
 
 *Tis well we'll try^ the temper of your 
 heart. Jane Shore, A<ffc iv. 
 
 The emphafis with the falling inflexion 
 on the word try fuggefts an antithelis, 
 which makes it necefiary to have recourfe 
 to the former fpeech : in this we find Jane 
 Shore give proof of her fidelity by pro- 
 teftations ; but Glofter replies, Jf Tts we//, 
 we'll try the temper of your heart ; which is 
 perfectly equivalent to faying, We will not 
 only prove your fidelity by talking* but by

 the fenfe of the paflage, we may be fure 
 the emphafis is properly placed.

 An inftance of an antithefis, perhaps, 
 ftill lefs obvious, we have in the following 
 line of Richard the Third, where Prince 
 Edward apologizes for his brother's far- 
 caftic ridicule on the duke of Glocefter : 
 
 I hope your grace knows how to bear' with 
 him. Richard Act Hi. 
 
 The word bear, in this fentence, is the 
 emphatical word, and always pronounced 
 with the rifmg inflexion ; but though we 
 perceive at firft hearing, the propriety of 
 adopting this inflexion, we cannot fo rea- 
 dily difcover the antithetic object intimat- 
 ed by it ; it is not till we confider the 
 definition of the neuter verb to bear, that 
 we find out what is oppofed to it ; the 
 word bear, in the paflage alluded to, indi- 
 cates fupporting a degree of difpleafure, fo 
 as to feem pleafed when we are not really 
 fo ; the antithetic object, therefore, muft 
 be, being really pleafed, and the paraphrafe, 
 intimated by this emphafis will be this :

 Sometimes the fenfe of a pafTage makes 
 it difficult to determine whether we muft 
 ufe the ernphafis with the rifing, or falling 
 inflexion, and in this cafe, (though it fel- 
 dom happens) we may adopt either the 
 one or the other indifferently. Thus when 
 Horatio, in the Fair Penitent, tells Ca- 
 lifta that he came to her as a friend, fhe 
 anfwers : 
 
 You are my hujbantfs/ friend, the friend of 
 Aitamont ! / 
 
 The words hu/band and Altamont, in this 
 line, are emphatical ; if they are both pro- 
 nounced with the falling inflexion, it im- 
 ports an abfolute denial of the antithetic 
 objed:, which is the friendflrip of Horatio 
 to her ; if we pronounce them with th6 
 rifing inflexion, it only infmuates that he 
 is not her friend : and this latter emphafis,

 feems the mod fuitable to the fituation of 
 Califta, as at that time fhe has not fo far 
 broke terms with Horatio as abiblutely to 
 deny that he is her friend. 
 
 Thus have I been led infenfibly by my 
 fubjed; into intricacies and diftincTiions, 
 whither, perhaps, but few of my readers 
 will be able to follow me : I might, in- 
 deed, have contented myfelf with lefs mi-

 appeared too curious and ufeful ' to be

 we may take occafion to contemplate how

 pronunciation of every different fpecies 
 of emphafis. Hitherto we have treated 
 chiefly of that emphafis, which may be

 other are expreffed ; or where but one of 
 them is exprelfed, and the antithefis to it

 thefe, there are inftances where two em-

 and fometimes, where three emphatic

 each of thefe different kinds of emphafis 
 in its order :

 In the fecond example, the word fight 
 and rail are in antithefis with each othef, 
 and do not fuggeft any other antithetic 
 objeds ; and this may be called the fmgle 
 emphafis expreffed : but in the next exam- 
 ple, the emphatic words grofs and re* 
 fined) are oppofed to each^ other, and thefe 
 are contrafted with the other two empha- 
 tic words, fenfe and under/landing ; and 
 this mutual correfpondence and oppofition 
 of four parts to each other, may not im- 
 perly be termed the double emphafis ; and 
 where three antithetic objects are oppofed 
 to three, as in N 4. we may call the 
 aflemblage a treble emphafis. 
 
 Single emphafis* 
 
 In the fmgle emphafis we find the in- 
 flexions are fo ftriclily appropriated to the 
 nature of the emphafis, that a different 
 arrangement of emphatic inflexion would 
 inevitably alter the fenfe : this appropria-

 tion of inflexion to fenfe does not feern 
 to hold fo ftrictly where the emphafis is 
 double,, or treble ; for here, as the anti- 
 thetic obje&s are almoft always exprefled, 
 and there is feldom any danger of a mif- 
 take in the fenfe, we mall not wonder to 
 find harmony claim her indifputable rights 
 in making this fenfe moft agreeable to the 
 ear ; for in an art, whofe intention is to 
 pleafe, as well as inftru&, we muft never 
 give up what is agreeable but for fake of 
 inftrudion, which is itfelf the greateft 
 pleafure. But though the inflexions of the 
 double and treble emphafis frequently 
 yield to the harmony of arrangement, 
 the fingle emphafis exprefled requires its 
 fpecific inflexion on each part ; for in. the 
 fecond example :

 the harmony of cadence would intimate, 
 we fhould foon find, that in the iingle em- 
 phafis expreffed, there is as ftrict an ap- 
 propriation of inflexion to the fenfe of 
 the emphafis, as when but one part of the 
 antithefis is exprefled in the fmgle em- 
 phafis impiied. As the inflexions in this 
 fpecies of emphafis therefore, are of much 
 more importance, and much more difficult 
 to fettle than thofe of the double and tre- 
 ble emphafis, it may not be improper, be- 
 fore we enter on the latter, to extend our 
 Speculations a little on the former. 
 
 Whatever may be the reafon why the 
 pofitive member of a fentence mould adopt 
 the emphafis with the falling inflexion, 
 and the negative member the rifing ; cer- 
 tain it is, that this appropriation of em- 
 phatic inflexion to a pofitive or negative 
 iignifkation runs through the whole fyf- 
 tem of pronunciation. Agreeably to this 
 arrangement, we constantly find good

 readers fmifh negative fentences with the

 fure to ufe the falling inflexion, and to 
 drop the voice ; and, perhaps this differ-

 eft differences between good and bad 
 readers : thus in the following fentence 
 from the Oration of Demofthenes on the 
 Crown, tranflated by Dr. Leland.

 thought, and may be reduced to the defi- 
 nition of the emphafis with the falling

 Wherever, therefore, a negative fen-

 The two laft members of the firft fen- 
 tence we find naturally adopt their fpecific 
 inflexions ; that is, the pofitive member, 
 the falling on wrong^ and the negative the 
 riling on fortune. The fucceeding fen- 
 tence has a negation in it that fuits the 
 riling inflexion much better than the fall- 
 ing, and therefore Greece has very pro- 
 perly the rifmg inflexion ; and the latter 
 members, not thofe only who prevailed, not 
 t/wje only 'who were victorious, will not ad- 
 mit of the falling inflexion without an 
 evident prejudice to the fenfe. 
 
 Plaufible, however, as this dodrine may 
 appear, it is not pretended that it is univer- 
 fally true. It is certain, that a negative 
 member of a fentence may often have the 
 falling, and a pofitive member the rifmg 
 inflexion : but it is as certain, that where 
 the fentence is fo conftructed as to require 
 the rifmg inflexion on the negative, and 
 the falling on the pofitive part of the fen- 
 tence,

 tence, there is always both greater force 
 and harmony. 
 
 From thefe obfervations, therefore, we 
 may conclude, that in the fmgle emphafis 
 where harmony is not grofly violated, 
 fenfe ought always to predominate : and 
 hence will arife this general rule : WHEN- 
 EVER A SENTENCE IS COMPOSED OF A 
 POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE PART, IF THIS 
 POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE IMPORTS 
 THAT SOMETHING IS AFFIRMED OF 
 ONE OF THE THINGS WHICH IS DENIED 
 OF THE OTHER ; THE POSITIVE MUST 
 HAVE THE FALLING AND THE NEGA- 
 TIVE THE RISING INFLEXION. 
 
 Small as the extent of this rule is, it 
 appears to throw fome light on the doc- 
 trine of emphafis ; and particularly where 
 the fenfe of a paflage is not very obvious, 
 and where harmony admits of a diverfity 
 of inflexion. Let us endeavour to reduce

 of this difpofition does not readily occur, 
 A little farther reflexion will induce us to 
 refolve this arrangement of inflexion into 
 the foregoing rule. For the word ere 9 iig- 
 nifying before^ relates to the word now, 
 in the former line, and the paraphrafe of 
 this emphafis is, The tempter now, at this

 whereas a tranfpofition of emphatic infle- 
 xion, that is, the rifmg inflexion on 
 tempter^ and the falling on accufer, would 
 infallibly fugged this fenfe. The tempter^ 
 not only before he was fomething more in~ 
 imical than accufer , but before he was even 
 the accufer of mankind. This paraphrafe 
 agrees fo ill with the fenfe of the pafTage,

 The reafon for placing the emphafiS

 arife from the fame principle as that of 
 placing the emphafis with the falling in- 
 flexion on the pofitive, and that with the 
 rifmg inflexion on the negative part of a 
 fentence ; for the priority of one thing to 
 another is reducible to its being that thing 
 at that time, and not another thing ; and 
 the preferablenefs of one thing to another 
 is equal to the choice being fixed on one 
 thing and not another. Thus the follow- 
 ing phrafe ; " I would rather * teach the

 may be reduced to this : if I muft teach 
 one of thefe arts, I will teach poifoning

 that one of thefe things, in the ftricteft

 the fame inflexion is preferved on the fame

 But if both parts of the comparifon are 
 underftood, and therefore to be taken (im- 
 ply and without emphafis, and it is the 
 intention of the fpeaker to declare with

 has the ftrong emphafis and falling infle- 
 xion, and the words compared has the 
 the weak emphafis and riling inflexion. 
 Thus Gay, in his fable of the Elephant

 fis is confined to the comparative word 
 Jharper ; as if he had faid, Envy is not 
 only a f pur equally foarp* but Jharper than 
 pay. 
 
 On thefe principles we may account for 
 the emphafis which a good actor always 
 places on the firfl part of the antithefis in 
 the following examples : 
 
 Ham. What ! look'd he frowningly ? 
 //or. A countenance more in forrow\ than

 dicious actor would lay the great ftrefs, 
 that is, the emphafis with the falling in>- 
 flexion on the word more, and give the 
 words lion and hare the weak emphafis 
 and rifmg inflexion. For Hotfpur, in this 
 paflage, is talking of dangers, and is not 
 fo much comparing them as the advan- 
 tages that arife from them ; and the para- 
 phrafe of this emphafis would be, f/ie re- 
 Jijlance we make to great and fmall danger 
 is not equal ; a great danger ft irs the blood 
 much more than a fmall one. 
 
 This drawing out the fignification of 
 emphatic words, feems the heft guide in. 
 cafes where the fenie is not quite obvious, 
 and will lead us to decide in many doubt- 
 ful cafes, where nothing but the tafte of 
 the reader is commonly appealed to. To 
 illuftrate this ftill farther, let us examine 
 a line in Otway's Venice Preferved, where 
 Pierre, expatiating on the wretched fhte 
 of Venice, fays :

 The phrafe, as well as, ngnines nothing;

 fenfe to the conjunction and-, if therefore 
 we lay the falling inflexion on blind, it 
 would be equivalent to faying, Juftice is 
 not only lame, but blind \ and this is a piece 
 of information we did not want : for juf- 
 tice is. always fuppofed to be blind. But 
 the falling inflexion on lame, and the rif- 
 i-ng on blind, is equivalent to faying, JuJ- 
 tice is not only blind, as foe is every where

 And that this is the true meaning of the 
 paffage cannot be doubted. If the poet 
 had written the line in this manner : 
 
 Juftice is as lame as fhe is blind among us. 
 
 The falling inflexion placed on blind, it 
 would imply, that Jujiice is not only 'very

 But it may be aiked fmce the fenfe muil 
 be fully conceived before we can adapt 
 the emphafis to the words, of what ufe it 
 Is to ring all thefe changes upon the dif- 
 ferent emphafes, when, though we con- 
 ceive them ever fo diftinctly, they will 
 only fuggeft one particular fenfe, but will 
 never tell us which we mail adopt as moil 
 fuitable to the meaning of the author. To 
 this it may be anfwered, that whatever 
 tends to mow the different import of each 
 kind of emphafis, enables us the better 
 to judge of the fuitablenefs or unfuitable- 
 nefs of each emphafis to the fenfe. This 
 unfolding and difplaying of what is fug- 
 gefted by each emphafis is that afliftance 
 to the underftanding, which fpetacles are

 diftindlly and with lefs labour than with- 
 out this affiftance. Where the fenfe is 
 clear, we need no fuch affiftance ; but where 
 the fenfe is obfcure and dubious, it can 
 fcarcely be doubted that difplaying and 
 unfolding it by fuch paraphrafes as are 
 fuggefted by the application of different 
 kinds of emphafis, will tend greatly to 
 take away the ambiguity, and mow which 
 kind of emphafis is incil fuitable to the 
 fenfe. 
 
 As. antithefis, therefore, either expreff- 
 ed, or underftood, is the fole caufe of 
 emphafis, it will be deferving of all the 
 reader's application to difcover this anti- 
 thefis where it is concealed, andtodifplay 
 it to advantage where it is expreffed : in

 quired the falling, the other neceflarily re- 
 quired the rifing ; and if the firft branch 
 required the rifmg, the other almoft as 
 neceflarily required the falling inflexion : 
 for it is, perhaps, worthy of obfervation, 
 that though the falling inflexion, if it be 
 firft in the fentence, neceflarily requires its 
 correfpondent emphatic word to have the 
 rifing, yet if the firft emphafis adopts the 
 rifmg inflexion, it does not fo invariably 
 require its correfpondent emphafis to be 
 of the falling ; but thefe inftances occur 
 fo feldom that they fcarcely form an ex- 
 ception to the contrary, which may there- 
 fore be very juftly called a general rule. 
 
 This, perhaps, will be fome guide to 
 us in determining the inflexions we are to

 Double EmphaJtSi 
 
 The double emphafis feems moft fre- 
 quently to be regulated by the harmony 
 of the fentence ; for as it is a general rule, 
 that the rifmg inflexion muft take place in 
 the middle of fuch a fentence, the fecond 
 branch of the firft member muft necefla- 
 rily have the rifmg inflexion, and the reft 
 of the branches muft have fuch an empha- 
 fis and inflexion, as contributes moft to 
 the harmony of the period : with this ge-i 
 neral rule, that the two parts of the anti- 
 thefis have each of them the two different 
 inflexions, arranged in an oppofite order;

 branch of the fecond member forms the

 inflexion, the firft branch of this mem-* 
 ber muft neceflTarily have the rifmg infle- 
 xion ; this is the arrangement of Inflexion, 
 which feems univerfally adopted by the

 of reading this fentence feems too turgid 
 and emphatic for the hiftoric ftyle, what 
 are we to think of that general rule that 
 feems univerfally to be acknowledged by 
 all readers ; namely, that the fenfe of an

 To pronounce this paflage with the great-

 this would fuggeft a paraphrafe perfectly 
 illuftrative of the fenfe, which is, that 
 a day^ or an hour of virtuous liberty is not 
 only worth more than the longejl finite du- 
 ration in bondage, but even a whole eter- 
 nity. This pronunciation, however, would 
 necefTarily give the rifmg inflexion to bon-

 I do not contend that this alteration is not

 be obfervecl of the tranfpofition of the

 By this arrangement we fee the ftrongly

 lay the fame emphafis on angel ; for though 
 this would intimate that St. Cecilia did not

 angel, yet this intimation w^ould make no 
 amends for the quaintnefs and difcord this

 feveral words in fucceffion : this fucceffive 
 emphatic force does not, like the former, 
 fuggeft any particular meaning excluded 
 by it, and therefore may not improperly 
 be called a general emphafis. This em- 
 phafis is not fo much regulated by the 
 fenfe of the author, as by the tafte and

 not admit of any certain rule ; but as it is

 It muft not be diflembled, however, 
 that if this intermediate member contains

 drop the voice before the end, the fenfe of 
 the fentence is not at all concerned in any 
 of the inflexions, except that on grow in 
 the middle, which muft necefTarily be the 
 rifmg, and that on diftance at the end, 
 which muft be the falling inflexion : if 
 thefe inflexions are preferved on thefe 
 words, the reft may take their chance, and 
 the fenfe will be fcarcely affected ; but 
 the dulleft ear muft perceive an infinite 
 advantage to the harmony in placing the 
 falling inflexion on grown in the firft part 
 of the fentence, and on knowledge in the 
 laft : and fo natural is this pronunciation, 
 that there are few readers fo bad as not 
 to place thefe inflexions on thefe words

 This part of pronunciation, therefore, 
 though of little importance to the fenfe, 
 is of the utmoft importance to the har- 
 mony of a fentence. Every writer on the 
 fubjecl has left it entirely to the ear ; and, 
 indeed, fo nice are the principles on which 
 harmony and variety in pronunciation de- 
 pend, that it is no wonder any analyfis of 
 it has been fhifted off, and clafTed among 
 thofe things for which it is utterly impoC- 
 fible to give rules. But, as we have of- 
 ten obferved, though the varieties of voice, 
 in other refpectB are almoft infinite, all 
 thefe varieties are ftill reducible to two ra<- 
 dical and effential differences, the upward 
 and downward Hide or inflexion ; and 
 therefore, though the high and low, the 
 the loud and foft, the quick and flow, the 
 forcible and feeble, admit of almoft infi- 
 nite degrees, every one of thefe differ- 
 ences and degrees muft either adopt the 
 riling or falling inflexion of voice ; and

 thefe inflexions being more eflential to the

 mony and variety fo much admired, and, 
 it may be added, a very effential part. If 
 therefore no rules could be given for the 
 application of thefe inflexions to the pur- 
 pofes of harmony and variety, the prac-

 ufmg the rifmg and falling inflexion of 
 the voice upon fucceflive words, princi- 
 pally, to pleafe the ear, and break a conti- 
 nued chain of fimilar paufes. For the 
 rifmg inflexion of the voice has nothing 
 emphatical in it, nor the falling any thing 
 concluding. As this latter inflexion, and 
 the fmall paufe that accompanies it, often 
 takes place on words that are immediately 
 connected in fenfe with what follows, it 
 feems barely a refting place for the voice 
 and ear, and fuch an enforcing of the 
 fenfe as naturally arifes from a more deli- 
 berate pronunciation of the words. That 
 the voice may be in the falling inflexion 
 without marking a. eonclufion in the fenfe, 
 and even while it excites expectation of 
 fomething to follow, is evident irom the

 this will fhow the difficulty of avoiding 
 a monotony without adopting this infle-

 fing and away ; dozen and together ; fhuf- 
 fling and dividing ; other and converfation ; 
 thefe words, I fay, will be very apt to 
 drag, and produce a famenefs of found if

 the rifmg inflexion is ufed on the firft, 
 and the falling on the laft of every pair, 
 the monotony will be prevented, and a 
 fucceflion of founds introduced, very de-

 In this laft example, the words progrefs^ 
 both, and improvements, come under the 
 above mentioned rule, and may very pro- 
 perly have the harmonic inflexion ; and 
 as the word works and Creator in the next 
 member but one are under the fame pre- 
 dicament, it will add greatly to the variety 
 of this concluding fentence to pronounce 
 theie alfo with the fame inflexion. 
 
 But the great objecl: of the harmonic 
 inflexion is forming the cadence : here it 
 is, that harmony and variety are more pe- 
 culiarly neceffary, as the ear is more par- 
 ticularly affeded by the clofe of a fubjecl:, 
 or any branch of a fubjecl, than by any 
 other part of the compofition. We have

 voice which marks a conclusion : to which

 Rule II. When a feries of fimilar fen- 
 tences, or members of fentences, form a 
 branch of a fubjecl: or paragraph ; the 
 laft fentence or member muft fall gradu-

 Somewhat fimilar to that of Verification, 
 The return of the accented fyllable at cer-

 In verfe we find thefe intervals nearly

 the meafure. Thus in the following

 far from having a bad effect on the ear, 
 that it frequently relieves it from the too 
 great famenefs to which rhyming verfe is 
 always liable. 
 
 But if this inequality of interval is fome-

 Loofe and negligent, however, as proie 
 may appear, it is not entirely deftitute of 
 meafure : for it may be with confidence 
 afferted, that, wherever a ftyle is remark- 
 ably fmooth and flowing, it is owing in 
 fome meafure to a regular return of ac- 
 cented fyllables. And though a ilrength

 We are always complaining our days are few,

 The reafon of this harfhnefs feems to be,

 This difference, therefore, can arife from 
 nothing but an unequal and immetrical 
 arrangement of accent in the former fefl-

 metrical arrangement of accent in the lat- 
 ter. 
 
 As a farther corroboration of the truth 
 of this opinion, let us take a fentence re-

 unaccented. 
 
 Now if we change a few of the words 
 of this fentence to others 'of different

 regular return of accent, the harmony of 
 profe muft arife from the fame ;fource : 
 that is, as verfe owes its harmony entirely 
 to a regular return of accent, profe can 
 never be harmonious by a total want of 
 it. The fole difference between them 
 feems to lie in the conftant, regular, and 
 artificial arrangement of accent in the one, 
 and the unftudied, various, and even op- 
 pofite arrangement in the other. Verfe, 
 with fome few exceptions, proceeds in a 
 regular alternation of accent, from one 
 end of the poem to the other ; harmoni- 
 ous profe, on the contrary, in fome mem- 
 bers, adopts one fpecies of arrangement, 
 and in fome another ; but always fo as to 
 avoid fuch clutters of accents in one place, 
 and fuch a total abfence of them in another, 
 as neceffarily occafions a ruggednefs and 
 difficulty of pronunciation.

 At firft fight, perhaps, we fhould be 
 led to fuppofe, that the intervals between 
 the accents ought rather to diminilh than 
 increafe as they approach the end of a fen- 
 tence ; and yet, if we confult the ear, we 
 fhall find that intervals of two unaccented 
 fyllables found better even in the clofmg 
 member of a fentence, than intervals of 
 one unaccented Syllable only. Let us 
 take the following fentence as an example 
 of this. 
 
 Demetrius compares profperity to the indul- 
 gence of a fond mother to a child, which of- 
 ten proves his ruin ; but the affection of the di- 
 vine Being to that of a wife father, who would

 others fhould agree with mine in this par- 
 ticular, it may be laid down as a rule, 
 that other circumflances being equal, the 
 laft members of fentences, ought rather to 
 end in the dactylic than in the iambic 
 rccafure. In this appellation of the mea- 
 fure of prole, I adopt the terms generally 
 made ufe of, and particularly by Mafon, 
 in his EiTuy on Profaic Numbers. This 
 gentleman deferves much praife for his 
 attempt to inveftigate the caufcs of profaic 
 harmony, but appears to me to have an 
 idea of Englifh metre fo blended with that 
 of the Latin and Greek, as to throw con- 
 fufion and error over his whole perform- 
 ance. For what can we make of his 
 placing two long quantities over the two 
 fyllables of the words sentence and fpondee ? 
 Thefe words can have but one accent each, 
 and it is accent, or emphafis, and thefc 
 only, and not any length or opennefs of 
 the vowels that forms Englifh metre, or 
 
 that

 that rhythmus which is analogous to it in 
 profe. 
 
 Hitherto I have considered poetic and 
 profaic harmony as arifmg from an har- 
 monious and rhythmical arrangement of 
 accent ; and it is with fome diffidence I 
 venture upon a farther explication of this 
 fubjecl; upon principles which have never 
 yet been thought of : but I prefume it will 
 be found, upon enquiry, that the various 
 and harmonious arrangement of the rifmg 
 and falling inflexions of the voice is no 
 lefs the caufe of harmony, both in verfe 
 and profe, than the metrical arrangement 
 i>f accent and emphalis.

 upon every fyllable marked with the long

 on every fyllable marked with long quantity. 
 Though deep' yet clear/, though gentle yet

 Strong/ without rage/; without/ o'erflow/ing

 In this mode of reading the couplet, we 
 form a ftrefs on nearly alternate fyllables, 
 which conftitutes the, effence of poetry, but 
 by a perfect famenefs'of inflexion on the 
 accented fyllables we reduce it to a mono- 
 tony worfe than the moft inharmonious

 The firft line of this couplet ends with the 
 rifmg inflexion, to prevent the want of 
 harmony there would be in ending two 
 fucceffi ve lines with the fame inflexion ; 
 a famenefs for which nothing but empha- 
 fis will ever apologize. As this line ends 
 with the rifmg inflexion, the laft word 
 may not improperly be called the rudder, 
 which directs the inflexions on the pre- 
 ceding words : for in order to prevent 
 an exat return of the fame order of in- 
 flexion, it is not fufficient that the differ- 
 ent inflexions fucceed each other alter- 
 nately, this would be like the fucceffive

 milar inflexions between two fimilar in- 
 flexions, and this produces a variety fimir- 
 lar to the feries

 The firft line, therefore, of this verfe,

 der of placing the inflexions is not inva-

 every other rule, and makes harmony 
 fubfervient to fenfe : but it may be aflert- 
 ed, that this order of arranging the infle-

 that when emphafis does not forbid, this 
 is the arrangement into which the verfe 
 naturally glides. It may likewife be ob- 
 ferved, that where emphalis coincides with 
 this arrangement, the verfe is always the 
 moil harmonious, and the fenfe in its moft 
 poetical drefs. Nay, we fhall find harmo- 
 nious profe where emphafis does not in- 
 terrupt the natural current of inflexion,

 the introduction of a greater variety of 
 inflexion : for in the former fentence, we 1 
 find the inflexions were rifing upon exer- 
 cife, falling upon temperance zsAJinngthen^ 
 rifing upon conjlltution and f<weeten, and 
 falling upon life. As this fentence natu- 
 rally falls into three portions, each por- 
 tion confifting of two accented words, the 
 order is equivalent to the feries of letters 
 
 A, B ; B, A ; A, B. 
 
 but the additional accented words in the 
 laft fentence makes the feries equivalent 
 to thefe letters 
 
 A, B ; B, A ; B, A ; A, B.

 cies of arrangement directly oppofite to 
 the other ; and fo as to form an harmo-

 Whatever, therefore, may be the order of 
 arrangement in the commencement and 
 middle of a fentence, it is certain, that 
 if we mean to form an harmonious ca- 
 dence, one of thefe two arrangements of 
 inflexion ought to take place at the end of 
 a fentence : that is, if the laft member 
 confifts of four accented words, the fame 
 inflexions ought to take place at the end 
 of a fentence, as we find generally obtain 
 in the laft line of a couplet in poetry ; or 
 if the laft member confift of three ac- 
 cented words, fuch inflexions ought to be 
 adopted as will make a feries of three in- 
 flexions moft various, which is, by giv- 
 ing the laft word the falling, the penulti- 
 mate the rifmg, and the antipenultimate 
 either the riling or falling inflexion. 
 
 An inftance of the firft arrangement is 
 the following fentence :

 where produces and ftrife have the rifmg 
 inflexion, and fraud and cruelty the fall-

 we find in this ientence :

 In order to pronounce this fentence with 
 an harmonious cadence, the word this muft 
 have the rifmg inflexion, as at the end 
 of the firft line of a couplet, and the three 
 laft words, much greater applaufe, which 
 form the laft member, muft be pronounced 
 very diftinftly with the falling inflexion, 
 on the laft, the riling inflexion on greater^ 
 and the falling on much. 
 
 The rule, therefore, that arifes from 
 thefe obfervations is, that when the laft 
 paufe neceflarily leaves the laft member 
 of a fentence with four accented words, 
 as in the firft example, they are pronounced 
 with the inflexions in the order falling, 
 rijing, rifing falling ; and when the paufe

 for thefe words, having neceflarily the

 It feldom happens, however, that the 
 fentence is fo conftmcted as to prevent the 
 ear from falling into one or other of the 
 two before mentioned arrangements of

 an harmonious cadence, that for the fake 
 of forming one, allowances will be made 
 for giving an emphatic accent even to 
 words not entitled to it from their fenfe. 
 Let us fuppofe the following fentence

 Thefe obfervations necefTarily fuggeft 
 the importance of fuch a choice and ar-

 on each other ; they are counterparts of 
 one great operation of the human mind,

 feelings of one man to another with force, 
 precifion, and harmony. It will not be

 is rectified either by adding two accented

 *1 TTHatever difficulties we' may find in 
 reading profe, they are greatly in- 
 ereafed when the compofition is in verfe ; 
 and more particularly if the verfe be 
 rhyme. .The regularity of the feet, and 
 the famenefs of found in rhyming verfe, 
 ftrongly folicits the voice to a famenefs of 
 tone ; and tone, unlefs directed by a judi- 
 cious ear, is apt to degenerate into a fong, 
 and a fong, of all others, the moft dif- 
 gufting to a perfon of juft tafte. If there- 
 fore, there are few who read profe with 
 propriety, there are ftill fewer who fuc- 
 ceed in verfe ; they either want that equa- 
 ble and harmonious flow of found which 
 diftinguifhes it from loofe, unmeafured 
 compofition, or they have not a fufficient 
 delicacy of ear to keep the harmonious 
 fmoothnefs of verfe from Hiding into a 
 whining cant : nay, fo agreeable is this

 cant to many readers, that a fimple and 
 natural delivery of verfe feems tame and 
 infipid, and much too familiar for the 
 dignity of the language. So pernicious 
 are bad habits in every exercife of the fa- 
 culties, that they not only lead us to falfe 
 objects of beauty and propriety, but at 
 laft deprive us of the very power of per- 
 ceiving the miftake. For thofe, therefore, 
 whofe ears are not juft, and who are to- 
 tally deficient in a true tafte for the mufic 
 of poetry, the beft method of avoiding 
 this impropriety, is to read verfe exactly 
 as if it were profe : for though this may 
 be faid to be an error, it is certainly an 
 error on the fafer fide. 
 
 To fay, however, as fome do, that the 
 pronunciation of verfe is entirely deftitute 
 of fong, and that it is no more than a juft 
 pronunciation of profe, is as diftant from 
 truth as the whining cant we have been 
 fpeaking of, is from true poetic harmony.

 Poetry without fong is a body without a

 difficult to hit, but when once it is hit, it 
 is fure to give the moft exquifite pleafure. 
 It excites in the hearer the moft eager de-

 It muft, however, be confeifed, that

 who attempt to imitate them, Hide into 
 that blemim which borders fo nearly on a

 and that the movement of the verfe may be 
 fuited to all their different characters ; yet 
 as verfe is a fpecies of mufic, none of the 
 paffions appear to fuch advantage in poetry 
 as the benevolent ones ; for as melody is 
 a thing pleafing in itfelf, it muft naturally 
 unite with thofe paffions which are pro- 
 ductive of pleafmg fenfations ; in like

 a generous fentiment, or as a beautiful 
 countenance gives advantage to an ami-

 the pathetic feems the favourite and moft 
 endearing theme. Thofe readers, there-

 jnuch as confufion or obfcurity. 
 
 But thoiigh an elegant and harmonious 
 pronunciation of verfe will fometimes ob- 
 lige us to adopt different inflexions from 
 thofe we fhould life in profaic pronuncia- 
 tion, it may flill be laid down as a good 
 general rule, that verfe requires the fame 
 inflexions as profe, though lefs flrongly 
 marked, and more approaching to mono- 
 tones-. If therefore we are at a lofs for 
 the true inflexion of voice on any word in 
 poetry, let us reduce it to earneft conver- 
 fation, and pronounce it in the molt fami- 
 liar and prolaic manner ; and we [hall for 
 the moil part fall into ilioie very infle- 
 xions we ought to adopt in repeating

 Terfe : nay, it is the prefervation of thefe 
 profaic inflexions that makes the poetic 
 pronunciation natural : and the whining 
 cant which is adopted by many affected 
 readers of poetry, owes, in a great mea- 
 foe, its origin to a neglect of this rule. 
 Thus in the following couplet ; 
 Short is the date in which ill adts prevail, 
 But honefty'-s a rock will never fail. Steele. 
 If we pronounce the laft word fall with 
 the rifmg inflexion, fliding upwards a lit- 
 tle higher than ufual, we mall infallibly 
 draw the couplet into the whining tone 
 we are here fpeaking of ; but if we pro- 
 nounce every part of the fame fentence 
 exactly in the fame manner, except the 
 laft word, and give this the falling infle- 
 xion, we mail find a natural tone pre- 
 ferved, and the whining cant entirely va- 
 nifhed. 
 
 This obfervation naturally leads us to a

 Sentence, or member of a fentence, would

 profe, it ought always to have the fame 
 inflexion in poetry ; for though, if we

 often place the falling inflexion where the

 Though we were to read this paflage quite 
 profaically, it would not admit of the fall- 
 ing inflexion on any of its paufes till the

 the falling inflexion, and be in a lower

 In reading this paflage profaically, we 
 might place the falling inflexion on Inde ; 
 but the poetical pronunciation of this paf- 
 fage would neceflarily require a fufpenfion 
 of voice with the riling inflexion on that 
 word. It may be obferved, indeed, that

 grand, beautiful, and plaintive fubjecls 
 flide naturally into the rifing inflexion, as 
 this is expreflive of awe, admiration, and 
 melancholy ; where the mind may be faid 
 to be pafiive : and it is this general ten- 
 dency of the plaintive tone to affume the 
 rifing inflexion, which inclines injudicious 
 readers to adopt it at thofe paufes where 
 the falling inflexion is abfolutely necef- 
 fary ; and for want of which the pronun-

 . and fo juftly diiliked ; for it is very re- 
 markable, that if, where the fenfe con- 
 cludes, we are careful to preferve the fall-

 any other part of the verfe, with very lit- 
 tle danger of falling into the chant of 
 bad readers. Thus in the following pa- 
 fage which opens the tragedy of Cato : 
 
 The dawn is overcaft, the morning low'rs, 
 And heavily in clouds brings on the day ; 
 The great, the important day, 
 Big with the fate of Cato and of Rome. 
 
 The grandeur of the objects and fwell of 
 language in this defcription, naturally 
 throw the voice into thofe tones that ex- 
 prefs the awe and dignity which thefe ob- 
 jects excite in the mind j and thefe tones 
 being inclined to the plaintive, naturally 
 Hide into the rifmg inflexion on the paufes ; 
 and this is apt to draw the voice into a 
 chant ; but let the word Rome have the 
 falling inflexion and fink into a lower key, 
 in the natural talking tone, and the im- 
 perfections in pronouncing the former 
 part will be in a great meafure covered ;

 word Rome has the rifing inflexion, the 
 whole will appear to have a difagreeable 
 whining tone. 
 
 This may fuffice, to mew the neceflity 
 of attending to the pronunciation of pe- 
 riods in verfe, and of giving them the 
 fame inflexion of voice they would require 
 in profe ; for it mufl be carefully noted^ 
 that though we often end with the rifmg 
 inflexion in verfe, where we fhould uie 
 the falling in . profe, yet if in profe we 
 fhould end with the rifmg inflexion, we 
 ought always to end with the fame infle- 
 xion in verfe ; in this cafe, the riling in- 
 flexion at the end of a fentence will not 
 appear to have the whining tone. Thus, 
 where a queftion would require the rifmg 
 inflexion in profe, verfe will neceflarily 
 require it to end with the fame inflexion .: 
 and in this cafe, the rifmg inflexion will 
 have no bad effect on the ear.

 Here, though every paufe requires the rif-

 yet as this period is an interrogation re- 
 quiring the riling inflexion, no whining 
 chant is the confequence, but the whole 
 is natural. 
 
 From thefe obfervations, this general 
 rule will naturally arife ; that though in 
 verfe we frequently fufpend the voice by 
 the riGng inflexion, where, if the com- 
 pofition were profe, we fhould adopt the 
 falling : yet, wherever in profe, the mem- 
 ber or fentence would neceffarily require 
 the rifmg inflexion ; this inflexion muft 
 neceflarily be adopted in verfe. An in-

 injudicioufly printing the laft couplet fa

 would be effectually prevented by unit- 
 ing the laft couplet to the reft, fo as to

 Having premifed thefe obfervations, 
 we fhall endeavour to throw together a

 for the making of verfes than the reading 
 of them. 
 
 Rule I. As the exak tone of the paf- 
 fion, emotion, or fentiment which verfe 
 excites, is not at firft eafy to hit, it will 
 be proper always to begin a poem in a 
 fimple and almoft profaic ftyle, and fo pro- 
 ceed till we are warmed with the fubject, 
 and feel the emotion we wifti to exprefs. 
 Thus in Gray's Elegy in a Country Church- 
 yard, if we cannot immediately fir ike into 
 the folemn ftyle with which that poem 
 begins, it will be better to commence with 
 ,an eafier and lefs marking tone ; and fome- 
 what like the ftyle of reading profe, till 
 the fubjecl: becomes a little familiar. There 
 are few poems which will not allow of 
 this profaic commencement, and where 
 they^oo not, it is a much lefs fault in 
 reading to begin with too little empha- 
 iis, than either to ftrike into a wrong one, 
 or to execute the right emphafis auk- 
 
 wardly.

 of the Bards, is alraoft the only one that 
 does not admit of commencing moderately. 
 
 Ruin feize tbee ruthkfs king ! 
 Confufion on thy banners wait ! &c. 
 
 Rule II. In verfe r every fyllable- is tor 
 have the fame accent, and every word the 
 fame emphafis as in profe : for though the 
 rhythmical arrangement of the accent and 
 emphafis is the very definition of poetry, 
 yet, if this arrangement tends to- give an 
 emphafis to words which would have none 
 in profe, or an accent to fueh fyllables as 
 have properly no accent, the rhythmus, 
 or mufic of the verfe, muft be entirely 
 neglcded. Thus the article the ought ne- 
 .ver to have a ftrefs, though placed in that 
 part of the verfe where the ear expects an 
 accent.

 But a ftrefs upon the laft fyllable of this

 which is that of altering the accent of a

 would be more difgufted with the harfh- 
 nefs of the verfe, if the right accent were 
 preferved, than with a wrong accent, 
 which preferves the harmony of the verfe : 
 for it is not merely reducing a line to profe 
 if the fenfe requires it, which is a capital 
 fault in reading poetry, but reducing it to 
 very harfh and difagreeable profe. Thus 
 the angel, in Milton, reafoning with Adam 
 about the planets, fays :

 the following couplet from Pope : 
 
 Thus in the foul, while mem'ry prevails,

 In the laft line of this couplet, there can- 
 not be any paufe but at the word under-

 making a paufe at the end of every line; 
 ia poetry, whether the fenfe requires it or 
 not ; and this, he obferves, is fo necef-

 have heard it approved by perfons of great 
 judgment and tafte. I muft own, how- 
 ever, that the neceffity of this paufe, where 
 the fenfe does not require it, is not fo evi-

 fible paufe of fufpenfion does not feem to 
 anfwer the end propofed by it ; which is, 
 that of making the ear fenfible of the ver- 
 fification, or of the equality of accentual 
 impreffions in every line. For this final 
 paufe is fo fmall, when compared with 
 that which precedes or follows it in the 
 body of the line, and this latter and larger 
 paufe is fo often accompanied with an in- 
 flexion of voice which marks the forma- 
 tion of perfect fenfe, that the boundaries 
 of the verfe become almoft, if not utterly 
 imperceptible, and the compofition, for a 
 few lines, fall into an harmonious kindj of 
 profe. For it is evident, that it is not a 
 fmall paufe at the end of a line in verfe, 
 which makes it appear poetry to the ear, 
 fo much as that adjustment of the accent- 
 ed fyllables which forms a regular re-

 the line in this manner :

 The affectation which moft writers of 
 blank verfe have, of extending the fenfe be- 
 yond the line, whether neceffary or not, 
 is followed by a fimilar affectation in the, 
 printer, who will often omit placing a 
 paufe at the end of a line of verfe, where 
 he would have inferted one in profe ; and 
 this affectation is ftill carried farther by the 
 reader, who will generally run the fenfe of 
 one line into another, where there is the

 {how that he is too fagacious to fuppofe

 aufe the line concludes. This affectation, 
 I fay, has poffibly given rife to the oppo- 
 fite one adopted by the learned, namely, 
 that of paufing where the fenfe abfolutely 
 forbids a paufe, and fo by fhunning Scylla 
 to fall into Charybdis : this error is ex- 
 cellently defcribed by Pope : 
 
 The vulgar thus through imitation err, 
 As oft the learn'd by being, (ingular ; 
 So much they hate the crowd, that if the throng 
 By chance go right, they purpofely go wrong. 
 
 The Latin and Greek verfe, indeed, re- 
 quired a paufe at the end of the line, and a 
 paufe much greater than is allotted by Mr. 
 Sheridan to Englifh verfe ; but verfe in 
 thefe languages was fo widely different 
 from the verfe of the moderns, that no-

 and as there was a good reafon from the na- 
 ture of thefe languages for excluding the 
 ufe of rhyme, it is no wonder that they 
 adopted a long paufe at the end of every 
 verfe,juft as an injudicious reader of Englifh 
 verfe would do, to form a chime of equal 
 fyllables : and although this chime is fo 
 difagreeable to a modern Englifh ear, it is 
 very poilible it was not fo to our fore- 
 fathers, nor to the ancient Greeks and 
 Romans, who confidered verfe rather as 
 fmging than fpeaking : but to us, who 
 make the mufic of verfe entirely fubfer- 
 vient to the fcnfe, it feems fcarcely allow- 
 able to give a paufe to the end of a line 
 in verfe, where there is none in the fenfe, 
 and by that means deftroy that balance in

 in the mean time, as the ufe of this paufe 
 is confefledly very delicate, I would advife 
 every one who cannot adopt it with eafe, 
 and without danger to the fenfe, to neg- 
 lect it entirely : the truth is, the end of a 
 line in verfe naturally inclines us to a 
 paufe, and the words that refufe a paufe 
 fo feldom occur at the end of a verfe, that 
 we often paufe between words in verfe, 
 where we mould not in profe, but where 
 a paufe would by no means interfere with 
 the fenfe ; this, it is prefumed, has been 
 fully mown in the former part of this 
 work, and this, perhaps, may be the rea- 
 fon why a paufe at the end of a line in

 this be, certain it is, that if we pronounce 
 many lines in Milton, fo as to make the 
 equality of impreffions on the ear diftinctly 
 perceptible, if by making this paufe, we 
 make the paufes that mark the fenfe lefs 
 perceptible, we exchange a folid advantage

 This rule will furprife many, who have

 MODULATION OF VOICE. 
 
 A FTER a perfect idea is attained of the 
 paufe, emphafis, and inflexion, with 
 which we ought to pronounce every word, 
 fentencc, interrogation, climax, and dif- 
 ferent figure of fpeech, it will be abfo- 
 lutely neceflary to be acquainted with the 
 power, variety, and extent of the inftru- 
 ment, through which we convey them to 
 others ; for unlefs this inftrument be in a 
 proper pitch, whatever we pronounce will 
 be feeble and unnatural ; as it is only in 
 a certain pitch that the voice can command 
 the greateft variety of tones, fo as to utter 
 them with energy and eafe. 
 
 Every one has a certain pitch of voice, 
 in which he is moft eafy to himfelf and 
 moft agreeable to others ; this maybe called 
 the natural pitch: this is the pitch in 
 which we converfe ; and this muft be the 
 bafis of every improvement we acquire 
 
 from

 from art and exercife : for fuch is the 
 force of exercife upon the organs of fpeech, 
 as well as every other in the human body, 
 that conilant practice will ftrengthen the 
 voice in any key we ufe it to, even though 
 this happen not to be the moft natural and 
 eafy at firft. This is abundantly proved 
 by the ftrong vociferation which the iti- 
 nerant retailers in the ftreets acquire after 
 a few years practice. Whatever key 
 they happen to pitch upon at firft is gene- 
 rally preferved ; and the voice in that note 
 becomes wonderfully ftrong and fonorous : 
 but, as the Spectator humoroufly obferves, 
 their articulation is generally fo indiftincl:, 
 that we underftand what they fell, not fo 
 much by the words as the tune. 
 
 As conftant exercife is of fuch import- 
 ance to ftrengthen the voice, care fhould 
 be taken, that we exercife it on that part 
 where it has naturally the greateft power 
 and variety : this is the middle tone j the

 tone we habitually make ufe of when we 
 converfe with, or fpeak to perfons at a 
 moderate diftance ; for if we call out to 
 one who is fo far off, as to be almoft out 
 of hearing, we naturally raife our voice 
 to a higher key, as well as fwell it upon 
 that key to a much greater degree of loud* 
 nefs : as, on the contrary, if we wifh to 
 be heard only by a fmgle perfon in com- 
 pany, we naturally let fall our voice into 
 a low key, and abate the force of it, fo as 
 to keep it from being -heard by any, but 
 the perfon we are fpeaking to. 
 
 In this fituation nature dictates ; but 
 the fituation of a public fpeaker is a fitua- 
 tion of art : he not only wimes to be 
 heard, but to be heard with energy and 
 eafe ; for this purpofe, his voice muft be 
 powerful in that key which is eafieft to 
 him, in that which he will moft naturally 
 fall into, and which he will certainly have 
 the moil frequent occafion to ufe j and this 
 is the middle tone.

 But before we enter farther on this fub- 
 jet, it feems abfolutely neceflary to ob- 
 viate a very common miftake with refpect 
 to the voice, which may lead to an incur- 
 able error ; and that is, the confounding 
 of high and low with loud and foft. 
 Thefe plain differences are as often jumb- 
 led together as accent and quantity, though 
 to much worfe purpofe. Our miftaking 
 of accent for quantity when we converfe 
 about it, makes not the leaft alteration in 
 our fpeaking ; but if, when we ought only 
 to be louder, we raife our voice to a higher 
 key, our tones become mrill and feeble, 
 and fruftrate the very intention of fpeak- 
 ing. 
 
 Thofe who underftand ever fo little of 
 mufic know that high and loud, and foft 
 and low, are by no means necefiarily con- 
 nected, and that we may be very foft in 
 a high note, and very loud in a low one ;

 exa&ly the fame note as a flight one, 
 though it is confiderably louder. But to ex- 
 plain this difference to thofe who are un- 
 acquainted with mufic, we may fay, that 
 a high tone is that we naturally affume 
 when we wim to be heard at a diftance, 
 as the fame degree of force is more audi- 
 ble in a high, than in a low tone, from 
 the acutenefs of the former, and the gra- 
 vity of the latter ; and that a low tone is 
 that we naturally affume when we are 
 fpeaking to a perfon at a fmall diftance, 
 and wifh not to be heard by others ; as a 
 low tone with the fame force is lefs audi- 
 ble than a high one ; if, therefore, we raife 
 our voice to the pitch we fhould naturally 
 life if we were calling to a perfon at a 
 great diftance, and at the fame time exert 
 fo fmall a degree of force as to be heard 
 only by a perfon who is near us, we fhall 
 have an example of a high note in a foft 
 tone j and, on the contrary, if we fup-

 pofe ourfelves fpeaking to a perfon at a 
 fmall diftance, and wim not to be heard 
 by thofe who are at a little greater, in this 
 fituation we fhall naturally fink the voice 
 into a low note, and throw juft as much 
 force or loudnefs into it as is neceiTary to 
 make it audible to the perfon we are fpeak- 
 ing to. By this experiment we perceive, 
 that high and loud, and foft and low, 
 though moft frequently aflbciated, are ef- 
 fentially diilincl from each other. 
 
 Such, however, is the nature of the 
 human voice, that to begin in the extremes 
 of .high and low are not equally danger- 
 ous. The voice naturally flides into a 
 higher tone, when we want to fpeak 
 louder, but not fo eafily into a lower tone, 
 when we would fpeak more foftly. Expe- 
 rience mows us, that we can raife our 
 voice at pleafure to any pitch it is capable 
 of; but the fame experience tells us, that 
 it requires infinite art and practice to

 bring the voice to a lower key when it is 
 once raifed too high. It ought therefore 
 to be a firft principle with all public readers 
 and fpeakers, rather to begin under 
 the common level of their voice than 
 above it. The attention of an auditory 
 at the commencement of a lecture or ora- 
 tion, makes the fofteft accents of the 
 fpeaker audible, at the fame time that it 
 affords a happy occafion for introducing a 
 variety of voice, without which every ad- 
 drefs muft foon tire. A repetition of the 
 fame fubjeft a thoufand times over, is not 
 more tirefome to the under ftanding, than 
 a monotonous delivery of the moft varied 
 fubjet to the ear. Poets, to produce va- 
 riety, alter the ftrudture of their verfe, 
 and rather hazard uncouthnefs and dif- 
 cord than famenefs. Profe writers change 
 the ftyle, turn, and ftructure of their pe- 
 riods, and fometimes throw in exclama- 
 tions, and fometimes interrogations, to

 all this art is entirely thrown away, if 
 the reader does not enter into the fpirit of 
 his author, and by a fimilar kind of ge- 
 nius, render even variety itfelf more va- 
 rious ; if he does not by an alteration in 
 his voice, manner, tone, gefture, loud- 
 nefs, foftnefs, quicknefs, flownefs, adopt 
 every change of which the fubjet is fuf- 
 ceptible. 
 
 Every one, therefore, who would ac- 
 quire a variety of tone in public reading 
 or fpeaking, muft avoid as the greateft evil 
 a loud and vociferous beginning ; and for 
 that purpofe it would be prudent in a 
 reader or fpeaker, to adapt his voice as if 
 only to be heard by the perfon who is 
 neareft to him ; if his voice has natural 
 ftrength, and the fubjet any thing impa- 
 fioned in it, a higher and louder tone will 
 infenfibly fteal on him ; and his greateft

 his voice, as it were, from the extremities

 are neareft to him. This it will be proper 
 to do almoft at the beginning of every pa- 
 ragraph in reading, and at the introdyc- 
 tion of every part of the fubjecT: indifcourfe. 
 Nothing will fo powerfully work on the 
 voice, as fuppofing ourfelves converfmg 
 at different intervals with different parts 
 of the auditory. 
 
 For though high and loud, and foft and 
 low, are effentially diftincT:, our exprefling 
 them fo frequently together makes it diffi- 
 cult for us to avoid being too high when 
 we are loud, and too foft when we are 
 low ; but as loudnefs is apt to lead us into 
 a vicious extreme, from which it is the 
 moft difficult to recover ourfelves ; foftnefs 
 has a tendency to reduce the voice to its 
 natural pitch, and give it a frefh vigour,

 from bringing it again within the fphere

 A very judicious writer on this fubjecT: 
 directs a reader or fpeaker, upon his firft 
 addreffing his auditory, to fix his eyes 
 upon that part of them from which he is 
 the fartheft, and to pitch his voice fo as to 
 reach them. This, I fear, would be at- 
 tended with very ill confequences if the 
 aflembly were very large ; as a fpeaker 
 would be ftrongly tempted to raife his 
 voice, as well as intreafe its force ; and 
 by this means begin in a key much too 
 high for the generality of his auditory, or 
 for his own powers to continue it. The 
 fafeft rule, therefore, is certainly to begin, 
 as it were, with thofe of the aflembly that 
 are neareft to us ; and if the voice be but 
 articulate, however low the key may be, 
 it will ftill be audible ; and thofe who have

 they will not wonder I employ my chief 
 care to guard againft an error by far the 
 moft common, as well as the moft dan- 
 gerous. 
 
 Few fpeakers have a voice too weak for 
 the public, if properly managed ; as audi- 
 bility depends much more on a proper 
 pitch of voice, accompanied with diftinc- 
 nefs of articulation, than on a boifterous 
 and fonorous loudnefs ; this is evident from 
 the diftinctnefs with which we hear a good 
 actrefs in the eafy chit chat of genteel co- 
 medy ; nay, even a fpeech afide, which is 
 little more than a whifper, though uttered 
 in a lower tone of voice, is fo articulated 
 by a judicious ador, as to be equally audi- 
 ble with the loudeft burfts of paflion. A 
 voice, therefore, is feldom inaudible from 
 its want of force, fo much as from its want 
 of modulation ; and this modulation de- 
 pends fo much on not fuffering the voice 
 
 to

 to begin above its natural pitch, that too 
 much care cannot be taken to guard againft 
 it. 
 
 Much, undoubtedly, will depend on 
 the fize and ftructure of the place we 
 fpeak in : fome are fo immenfely large, 
 as many of our churches and cathedrals, 
 that the voice is nearly as much diffipated 
 as in the open air ; and often with the ad- 
 ditional inconvenience of a thoufand con- 
 fufed echos and re-echos. Here a loud 
 and vociferous fpeaker will render himfelf 
 unintelligible in proportion to his exer- 
 tion of voice : as departing and com- 
 mencing founds will encounter each other, 
 and defeat every intention of diftinctnefs 
 and harmony. 
 
 Nothing but good articulation will 
 make a fpeaker audible in this fituation ; 
 and a judicious attention to that tone of 
 voice which is moll fuitable to the fize and 
 imperfections of the place. If the place we

 fpeak in be but fmall, it will be fcarcely 
 neceflary to obferve that the loudnefs of 
 the voice mould be in proportion. Thofe 
 who have not ears fufficiently delicate to 
 difcern the true quantity of found necef- 
 fary to fill the place they fpeak in, ought 
 to take every poffible method to acquire 
 fo effential a qualification. A knowlege 
 of mufic, many trials of different degrees 
 of loudnefs, and the friendly criticifm of 
 good judges, may do much towards ac- 
 quiring this accomplifhment ; and it muft 
 ever be remembered, that high and low 
 are eflentially diftintt from loud and foft ; 
 as we may with the utmoft propriety be 
 at the higheft note of our voice in the 
 fmalleft room, provided we are not too 
 loud, and ufe the loweft part of our voice 
 in the largeft, provided we are not too 
 foft and indiftinct to be heard.

 fentence ; and to commence the next fen-

 tired or fatiated with its proper enjoyments. 
 The fenfe of feeling can indeed give us a no- 
 tion of extenfion, fhape, and all other ideas 
 that enter at the eye, except colours ; but at 
 the fame time it is very much ftraitened and 
 confined in its operations to the number, bulk,

 while we lower the pitch, to add to the 
 force of the voice : this, however, is no 
 eafy operation, and none but good readers, 
 and confummate actors, can do it per- 
 fectly. It is no very difficult matter to be 
 loud in a high tone of voice, but to fye 
 loud and forcible in a low tone, requires 
 great practice and management ; this, 
 however, may be facilitated by pronounc- 
 ing forcibly at firft in a low monotone ; 
 a monotone, though in a low key, and 
 without force, is much more fonorous and 
 audible than when the voice Hides up and 
 down at almoft every word, as it muft do 
 to be various. This tone is adopted by 
 actors when they repeat paflages afide. 
 They are to give the idea of fpeaking to 
 thcmfelves, in fuch a manner as not to be

 comes audible to the whole houfe. The 
 monotone therefore, becomes an excellent

 /^ ESTURE, confidered as a juft and ele-

 body to the nature and import of the fub- 
 ject we are pronouncing, has always been 
 Confidered as one of the moft effentiaf 
 parts of oratory. Its power, as Cicero 
 obferves, h much greater than that of 
 words. It is the language of nature in 
 the ftri&eft fenfe, and makes its way to the 
 heart, without the utterance of a fingle 
 found. Ancient and modern orators are 
 full of the power of action ; and action, 
 as with the illuftrious Grecian orator, feems 
 to form the beginning, the middle, and* 
 end of oratory. 
 
 Such, however, is the force of cuftom r

 ers in the Britifti fenate, are very faulty 
 in their ufe of action, and it is remark- 
 able that thofe who are excellent in every 
 other part of oratory are very deficient in 
 this. The truth is, though the reafon of 
 action in fpeaking is in the nature of 
 things, the difficulty of acquiring the other 
 requifites of an orator, and the flill greater 
 difficulty of attaining excellence in action, 
 (which after all our pains is lefs efteemed 
 than excellencies of another kind) thefe, 
 I fay, feem to be the reafons why action 
 is fo little cultivated among us ; to this we 
 may add, that fo .different are national 
 taftes in this particular, that hardly any 
 two people agree in the juft proportion 1 of 
 this fo celebrated quality of an orator. 
 Perhaps the finifhed action of a Cicero, or 
 a Demoflhenes, would fcarcely be borne

 and fome of their fineft ftrokes of a&ion 
 
 would, perhaps, excite our laughter. The 
 
 oratory, therefore, of the Greeks and Rot 
 
 mans in this point, is as ill fuited to a Bri- 
 
 tifh auditor, as the accent and quantity of 
 
 the ancients is to the Englifh language. 
 
 The common feelings of nature, with the 
 
 figns that exprefs them, undergo a kind 
 
 of modification, which is fuitable to the 
 
 tafle and genius of every nation ; and it 
 
 is this national tafte which muft neceflarily 
 
 be the vehicle of every thing we convey 
 
 agreeably to the public we belong to. 
 
 Whether the a&ion of the ancients was

 tions of gefture, which was almoft indif- 
 penfabie in the ancient, yet a certain de- 
 gree of it rnuft neceflarily enter into the 
 compofition of every good fpeaker and 
 reader. To be perfectly motionlefs while 
 we are pronouncing words, which require 
 force and energy, is not only depriving 
 them of their neceflary fupport, but ren- 
 dering them unnatural and ridiculous. A 
 very vehement addrefs pronounced with- 
 out any motion, but that of the lips and 
 tongue, would be a burlefque upon the 
 meaning, and produce laughter ; nay, fo 
 unnatural is this total abfence of gesticu- 
 lation, that it is not very eafy to fpeak in 
 this manner.

 difcord muft inevitably be the confequence. 
 An awkward action, and fuch as is un->

 TT now remains to fay fomething of thofd 
 tones which mark the paffions and 
 emotions of the fpeaker. Thefe are in- 
 tirely independent on the modulation of 
 the voice, though often confounded with 
 it : for modulation relates only to fpeak- 
 ing either loudly or foftly, in a high or a 
 low key ; while the tones of the paffions 
 or emotions mean only that quality of 
 ibund that indicates the feelings of the 
 fpeaker, without any reference to the 
 pitch or loudnefs of his voice ; and it is 
 in being eafily fufceptible of every paflion 
 and emotion that prefents itfelf, and be- 
 ing able to exprefs them with that pecu- 
 liar quality of found which belongs to 
 them, that the great art of reading and 
 fpeaking confifts. When we fpeak our 
 own words, and are really impaffioned by 
 the occafion of fpeaking, the paflion or 
 
 emotion

 emotion precedes the words, and adopts 
 fuch tones as are {likable to the paflion we 
 feel ; but when we read, or repeat from 
 memory, the paflion is to be taken up as 
 the words occur ; and in doing this well, 
 the whole difficulty of reading or repeat- 
 ing from memory lies. 
 
 But it will be demanded, how are we 
 to acquire that peculiar quality of found 
 that indicates the paflion we wifh to ex- 
 prefs ? The anfwer is eafy : by feeling the 
 paflion which exprefles itfelf by that pe- 
 culiar quality of found. But the queftion 
 will return, how are we to acquire a feel- 
 ing of the paflion ? The anfwer to this 
 'queftion is rather difcouraging, as it will 
 advife thofe who have not a power of im- 
 ^aflioning themfelves upon reading or

 there no method of affifting us in acquir-

 on this occafion, is, to reprefent to our ima- 
 gination, in the moil lively manner pof- 
 fible, all the moft ftriking circumftances 
 of the tranfaction we defcribe, or of the

 This muft be allowed to be a very na* 
 tural method of exciting an emotion in 
 the mind ; but fti-11 the woes of others, 
 whether real or fictitious, will often make 
 but a weak imprefiion on our own mind, 
 and will fail of affecting us with a fuffi- 
 cient force to excite the fame emotions in 
 the minds of our hearers. In this exi- 
 gence, it may not, perhaps, be unprofit- 
 able, to call to our afliflance the device 
 of the ancient Grecian actor Polus ; who, 
 when he had the part of Ele&ra to per- 
 form, and was to reprefent that princefs 
 weeping over the afhes of her brother 
 Oreftes, ordered the urn, which contained 
 the afhes of his dear and only fon to be

 that fervor and warmth of expreffion, 
 which, by a certain fympathy, is lure to af- 
 fect thofe who hear us. 
 
 But our natural feelings are not always 
 to be commanded ; and when they are, 
 Hand in need of the regulation and em*

 therefore, of every reader and fpeaker in 
 public to acquire fuch tones and geflures 
 as nature gives to the paffions ; that he 
 may be may be able to produce the fem- 
 blance of them when he is not actually 
 impamoned. The feelings of men when

 fpot, without feeling in ourielves the work- 
 ings of the paffipns thus inftantaneouily 
 produced. Here the reality of the fitua- 
 tion contributes greatly to our own feel- 
 ings, as well as to the feelings of the 
 fpeaker. The fpeech of a malefactor fel-r 
 dom fails to move us powerfully, however 
 wretchedly delivered ; and a perfon really 
 in the agonies of paffion moves us irreilhS- 
 ibly. But thefe are fituations very dif- 
 ferent from the reader and fpeaker in pub- 
 lic. The reader has always a fictitious or 
 abfent paffion to exhibit ; and the public 
 fpeaker muft always produce his paffion 
 at a certain time and place, and in a cer- 
 tain order ; and in this iituation it is ge- 
 rally fuppofed by our beft critics, that an 
 excefs of feeling, fuch as we have when 
 unpremeditately actuated by ftrong paf- 
 iions, would render us incapable of ex-

 ances of the paffions, that we may be 
 able to exhibit them when we are not 
 really impaffioned ; and when we are, to 
 give paffion its moll agreeable expreflion. 
 Mr. Burke has a very ingenious thought 
 on this fubjecl: in his Origin of our Ideas 
 of the Sublime and Beautiful. He ob- 
 ferves, that there is fuch a conneclion be- 
 tween the internal feeling of a paffion, 
 and the external expreffion of it, that we 
 cannot put ourfelves in the pofture, or 
 attitude, of any paffion, without commu- 
 nicating

 nicating a certain degree of the paffion 
 itfelf to the mind. The fame may be ob- 
 ferved of the tone of voice which is pecu- 
 liar to each paffion : each paffion produces 
 an agitation of the body, which is accom- 
 panied by a correfpondent agitation of the 
 mind : certain founds naturally produce 
 certain bodily agitations, fimilar to thofe 
 produced by the paffions, and hence mufic 
 has power over the mind, and can difpofe 
 it alternately to joy, or forrow ; to pity, 
 or revenge. When the voice, therefore, 
 affumes that tone which a mufician would 
 produce in order to exprefs certain paf- 
 fions or fentiments in a fong, the fpeaker, 
 like the performer on a mufical inflru- 
 ment, is wrought upon by the found he 
 creates ; and though active at the begin- 
 ning, at length becomes paffive, by the 
 found of his own voice on himfelf. Hence 
 it is, that though we frequently begin to

 ihow the neceffity of fludying and imi-

 that accompany the paffions, that we may 
 4ifpofe ourfelves to feel them mechani- 
 cally, and improve our expreffion of them 
 \yhen we feel them fpontaneoufly ; for by 
 the imitation of the paffion we meet it, as 
 i.t were, half way. 
 
 A paffion well defcribed, difpofes us to 
 the feeling of it, and greatly affifts us in 
 exprcffing it with force and propriety ; 
 this mows the neceffity of a good defcrip- 
 tion of the paffions, and how much the 
 art of fpeaking depends upon it. Thofe 
 who feel the paffions the moft powerfully, 
 z>.nd unite with this feeling a power of 
 defcribing their feelings, are thofe from 
 whom we may expect the beft pictures 
 of what paries in the foul. For this rea~

 fon too, we find the greaceffc orators have 
 been moft converfant with the beft poets ; 
 for though it is not the buimefs of the 
 poet, like that of the philosopher, to en- 
 ter into a logical definition of the origin, 
 extent, and various relations of the pa- 
 fion he produces, he muft, however, feel 
 it ftrongly, and exprefs it exactly as we 
 fee it in nature, or it will fail in its effect 
 on the foul, which, in this cafe, judges 
 by a fort of inftincl:. This, it is prefum-. 
 ed, will be a fufficient reaibn for drawing 
 the examples that are given of the pa. 
 fions chiefly from the poets ; and of thefe 
 chiefly thofe in the dramatic line, as it is 
 in thefe that the paffions are generally the 
 moft delicately and forcibly touched.

 a braced or relaxed ftate of the finews, 
 and a peculiar call of the eye. This fyf-

 lived to give his original idea the finifh- 
 ing he intended ; and to have feen it com- 
 bated by oppofite opinions, that he might 
 have removed feveral objections that lie 
 againft it, and render the truth of it a lit- 
 tle doubtful. It muft be owned, however, 
 that this writer deferves great praife for 
 the mere attempt he has made to form a 
 new fyftem, which, under fome reftritions, 
 may not be without its ufe. It is certain, 
 that all the paflions, when violent, brace 
 the finews ; grief, which, when moderate, 
 may be faid to melt or relax the frame, 
 when accompanied by anguifh and bitter 
 complainings,becomes active and bracing*.

 Pity feems never to rife to a fufficient de-

 anger, even in the flighteft degree, feems 
 to give a kind of tenfion to the voice and 
 limbs. Thus Shakfpeare, as quoted by 
 this writer, has given us an admirable pic-

 way than in any other of our poets ; and 
 perhaps, the beft defcription that could be 
 given us of the paffions in any language, 
 may be extracted from the epithets he has 
 made ufe of. But to return to the fyftem: 
 Hill defines fcorn to be negligent anger, 
 and adds, " it is exprefled by languid 
 *' mufcles, with a fmile upon the eye in 
 " the light fpecies, or a frown to hit the 
 66 ferious." The reafon he gives for this 
 expreffion, is, " becaufe fcorn infinuates 
 "by a voluntary flacknefs, or difarming 
 " of the nerves, a known, or a concluded 
 " abfence of all power in the infulted ob- 
 " jecl:, even to make defence feem necef- 
 " fary." This feems a very accurate pic- 
 ture of the paffion, and the flacknefs of 
 the nerves appears necefTarily to enter into 
 the proper method of expreffing it. But 
 what are we to think of his definition of 
 Joy ? " Joy," fays he, " is pride pofleiTed

 yet met with, has fuppofed pride to be a 
 neceflary part of the compofition of joy ; 
 though a degree of joy may form part of 
 the compofition of pride. Pity, he de- 
 fines to be active grief for another's af- 
 flictions ; but this definition feems not to 
 include the moft leading trait of pity, 
 which is, benevolence and love ; and 
 though pity is always accompanied with 
 a degree of forrow, which often excites 
 us to aflift thofe we pity, yet pity is often 
 beftowed on objects we neither can nor 
 endeavour to aflift. The poets have al- 
 ways ftrongly marked this alliance be- 
 tween pity and love, and with great pro- 
 priety. When Blandford tells Oroonoko 
 he pities him : Oroonoko anfwers, 
 
 Do pity me ; 
 
 Pity's a-kin to love, and ev'ry thought 
 Of that foft kind is welcome to my foul.

 to be reverfed, but when the mind is too

 When I was dry with rage, and extreme foil,

 Show'd like a ftubble-land at harveft-home : 
 He was perfumed like a milliner ; 
 And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held 
 A pouncet-box, which ever and anon, 
 He gave his nofe, and took't away again ;-

 344 ELEMENTS Of 
 
 DESPAIR. 
 
 Defpair, as in 3 condemned criminal, 
 or one who. has loft all hope of falvation, 
 bends the eye-brows downwards, clouds 
 the forehead, rolls the eyes frightfully, 
 opens the mouth horizontally, bites the 
 lips, widens tne'noftrils, and gnaflies the 
 teeth.. The arms are fometimes bent at 
 the elbows, the Ms clinched hard, the 
 veins and mufcles fwelled ; the {kin livid, 
 the whole body {trained and violently agi- 
 tated ; while groans of inward torture 
 are more frequently uttered than words. 
 If any words,. they are few, and exprefled 
 with a fallen eager bitterncfs, the tone of 
 the voice often loud and furious, and fome- 
 times in the fame note for a confiderable 
 time. This ftate of human nature is too 
 frightful to dwell upon, and almofl im- 
 proper for imitation ; for if death cannot 
 be counterfeited without too much mock-

 bits a ftate ten thoufand times more terri- 
 rible than death, ought to be viewed with 
 a kind of reverence to the great Author of 
 nature, who feems fometimes to exhibit 
 to us this agony of mind as a warning to 
 avoid that wickednefs Which produces it. 
 
 Shakfpeare has moft exquifitely touched 
 this fearful fituation of human nature, 
 where he draws cardinal Beaufort, after a 
 wicked life, dying in defpair, and terrified 
 with the murder of duke Humphrey, to 
 which he was acc'effary.

 For wonder is involuntary praife. 
 
 Wonder or amazement, opens the eyes, 
 and makes them appear very prominent. 
 It fometimes raifes them to the fkies, but 
 more frequently fixes them on the object: ; 
 the mouth is open, and the hands are 
 held up nearly in the attitude of fear ; the 
 voice is at firft low, but fo emphatical, that 
 every word is pronounced flowly and with 
 energy : when, by the difcovery of fome- 
 thing excellent in the object of wonder, 
 the emotion may be called admiration, the 
 eyes are raifed, the hands lifted up, or 
 clapped together, and the voice elated with 
 expreinons of rapture.

 even after his death. The curate, upon far- 
 ther examination, finding the penitent (terror) 
 in the utmofl agonies of defpair (narrative) and 
 being himfelf a man of learning, told him (ex- 
 hortation and encouraging) that he hoped his cafe 
 was not fo terrible as he apprehended, fince he 
 found that he was fo very fenfible of his fault, 
 and fo fincerely repented of it. The penitent 
 Hill urged the evil tendency of his book to 
 fubvert all religion, (fear) and the little ground ' 
 of hope there could be for one, whofe writings 
 would continue to do mifchief when his body 
 was laid in afhes. The curate, finding no 
 other way to comfort him, told him (encour- 
 aging) that he did well in being afflicted for 
 the evil defign with which he publifhed his 
 book, but that he ought to be very thankful 
 that there was no danger of its doing any hurt.

 whilft he was living. To which he added, 
 for his farther fatisfadtion, (indifference) that he 
 did not believe any,befideshis particular friends 
 and acquaintance, had ever been at the pains of 
 reading it, or that any body after his death 
 would ever enquire after it. The dying man 
 had ftill fo much the frailty of an author in 
 him, as to be cut to the heart with thefe con- 
 folations ; and, without anfwering the good 
 man, afked his friends about him (with a pee- 
 vifhnefs that is natural to a fick perfon) (peevifh- 
 nefs and refentment) where they had picked up 
 fuch a blockhead, and whether they thought 
 him a proper perfon to attend one in his con- 
 dition ? The curate finding that the author did 
 not expect to be dealt with as a real and fincere 
 penitent, but as a penitent of importance, af- 
 ter a fhort admonition, withdrew ; not quefiion- 
 ing, but he mould be again fent for if the iick- 
 nefs grew defperate. The author, however, 
 recovered, and has fince written two or three 
 other tracts with the fame fpirit, and very 
 luckily for his poor foul with the fame fuccefs.

 CONCLUSION. 
 
 As an effay towards reducing to prac- 
 tice the fyftem of inflexions laid down in 
 the prefent work, I have attempted to 
 mark them as they occurred in Mrs. 
 Yates's pronunciation of the Monody in 
 Memory of Mr. Garrick. Not that by 
 thefe marks I w T ould pretend to have con- 
 veyed that jufthefs of paufe, that melody 
 of voice, and that dignity of manner, 
 which fo remarkably diltinguim the pro- 
 nunciation of this great aclrefs Thefe 
 are among thofc perifhable beauties fo 
 finely defcribed in the Monody ; but there 
 are beauties of an inferior kind which are 
 not quite fo incommunicable, and it is pre- 
 fumed that thofe who have attentively pe- 
 ril fed

 the prefent work, will not think that no- 
 tation which conveys to us the inflexions 
 of a good fpeaker, though unaccompanied 
 by every other excellence, either an incu- 
 rious or a ufelefs difcovery. 
 
 N. B. In the notation, or marks an- 
 nexed to the Monody, I have made ufe of 
 the horizontal line, not as a mark of em- 
 phafis or long quantity, but to exprefs 
 that monotone, or famenefs of voice, 
 which good pronouncers of verfe fo often 
 introduce to the greater! advantage. This 
 monotone generally falls into a lower key, 
 and as it is naturally expreffive of awe, 
 amazement, and admiration, is exceedingly 
 fuitable to folemn, grand, and magnificent 
 fubjecls. For a more particular account 
 of this Monotone, fee Vol. I. p. 1 1 5,
