PRE
P R E F A CE,
IT would enlarge this Preface beyond its due
bounds, to attempt to prove the advantage of
e Rhetorical Syſtem in general, in order to a right
underſtanding of the claſsics. I ſhall therefore only
briefly acquaint the reader, what laws I preferib-
ed to myſelf, and have Arictly obſerved in this com
position, fofar as it is my own, (the Latin definitions
being moſtly Parnaby's); and then the particular
manner in which I uſe it.
Firſt, I determined for method's fake in the Engr
lifh Syſtem, to allow a diſtich for every figure, which
in the Latin is generally explained in one line, and
fometimes leſs : becauſe our language being not to
conciſe as the Latin, could not in fo few words give,
in an intelligible and eaſy turn of expreſsion, a full
and exact definition of the figure, its nature and
uſe; with ſuch obſervations, as is fometimes equally
neceſſary with the very definition.
Next I reſolved, that the name of the figure ſhould
begin the diſtich, or have only a monoſyllable before
it: becauſe, had it been placed in the
middle or end
of the firſt, or any part of the ſecond line, it is cer-
tain the memory, might not be able immediately to ree
collect the beginning of the definition : whereas now,

The PREFACE.
no ſooner is there mention made of the name, than
that eaſily follows in a natural order ; which, I be-
I .
lieve, adds conſiderably to the work.
Thirdly, I have taken care to ſeparate the exam-
ple from the rule ; becauſe boys are often apt to lay
an equat ſtreſs on every word contained in the rule;
and generally want judgment to diſtinguiſh betwixt
that and the example that illuftrates it. Beſides,
it does not
ſeem to me fo proper to give the Engliſh in
verſe ; becauſe the meaſure muſt require ſome words
to which the rule adds no weight in that particu-
lar circumstance : whereas in this ſcheme, I have
choſen füch examples, as I thought most proper, eaſy
and familiar, and beſt adapted to the deſign of the
Figure ; without adding one word more than was
abſolutely neceſſary to complete the ſenſe.
Fourthly, becauſe the names of the Figures, ex
cepting very few, are Greek words, and conſequent-
by cannot excite in their minds the proper ideas affix:
ed to them, without a tolerable acquaintance with
the original; I thought it would be very neceſſary
to tranſlate them into Engliſh, and alſo to give their
derivations from the Greek ; that the young
student
may not only understand the Figure itſelf, but alſo
the particular meaning of its name.

Preface to Mr. Holmes's Rhetoric.
WHAT now remains, is to mention the im-
provements made in this piece, and to whom we
are obliged for them. Having looked over fome
performances for this purpoſe, none came ſo near
the original deſign, as Mr. Holmes's, to whom the
public is much indebted for his other labours, in
improving the education of youth. On attentively
conſidering his Art of Rhetoric, we were immedi-
ately led to make afe of it ; he having introduced
his Syſtem with an explanation of its nature and
uſe, pointing out the parts of a theme and an ora-
а
tion, with which the knowledge of Rhetoric is ſo
connected, that the ability of performing with ex-
cellency one or other, depends on the proper diſ-
,
poſing of words and ſentences, and ſo connecting
them as to have all the advantage of language,
which is centered in Rhetoric.
This knowledge has been hitherto confined to
the learned languages; and it has been thought,
that inſtances of its uſe were no where to be found
but in the Claſsics ; which has erected ſuch a ve-
neration for them, as to deprive every other per-
formance of any merit in that way.
.
Upon how unfair a foundation this fuperſtruc-.
ture has been raiſed, muſt appear from this per-
formance ; in which the Trope, Figure, Allego-
ry, &c. being the flowers collected from the bed
of Rhetoric, are illuſtrated from the ſacred writings.

PRE FACE.
This may in time give them that dignity they me-
rit in this particular, and add to the reverence and
reſpect every intelligent being ſhould pay to the
Word of GOD.
This performance is peculiarly adapted to the
Engliſh Reader; and as our language of late is rif-
ing to a dignity its natives would gladly ſee eſta-
bliſhed, nothing can engage a fondneſs for it more
than a piece (however diminutive) that points out
her beauties, and ſhows that ſhe is not leſs deſti-
tute of them than any other tongue.
That the ſcholar therefore may have ſome pieces
ready for his praxis, we have ſelected ſome of
the moſt capital pieces from Engliſh authors, as
inſtances of the ſeveral paſsions of the mind, and
the different modes of ſpeech ; which by a proper
ufe, under the inſpection of his teacher, may en-
able him in time to ſpeak with fluency and ele-
gance; and remove a criminal modeſty, ſo fre-
quently a bar to genius.

A Metaphor, in place of proper words,
Reſemblance puts ; and dreſs to ſpeech affords.
A Metonymy does new names impofe,
And things by things by near relation ſhows.
Synecdoche the whole for part doth take;
Or, of a part for whole, exchange doth make.
An Irony, difſembling with an air,
Thinks otherwiſe than what the words declare.

Q. How many kinds of Topics are there?
A. Three : demonſtrative, deliberative, and ju,
ridical.
Q. What is a demonſtrative Topic ?
A. That we uſe, when we ſpeak in praiſe, or
diſpraiſe of any perſon, deed, or thing.
Q. How do you uſe it in ſpeaking of a Perſon?
a
A. When from his education, eloquence, learn-
ing, wiſdom, virtue, riches, dignity, authority, &c.
we praiſe a good man, ſuch as Cicero; or from the
contrary, diſpraiſe a bad man, ſuch as Cataline.
Q. How do you uſe it in ſpeaking of a Deed?
A. When from its juſtice, honor, courage,
time, place, manner, &c. we extol any fact, ſuck
as the return of Regulus to his enemies; or from

THE ART OF RHETORIC.
Q. What is a deliberative Topic ?
Ã. That we uſe, when from the advantage or
diſadvantage of a thing, we either perſuade or
diffuade.
Q. How do you inſtance it?
Ā. As when, from the ſafety, profit, and plea-
ſure of it, we perfuade to peace; or, from the
contrary, diffuade from war.
Q. What is a Juridical Topic?
A. That we uſe, when we either accuſe or de-
fend. Thus Milo, having killed Clodius, is accu-
ſed by Clodius's friends, but defended by Cicero.
Q. How do its arguments differ?
A. According to the ſtating of it.
Q. What is the ſtating of a Cafe?
A. The iffue it is brought to, from the accu-
fer's Complaint and the accuſed's Defence.
Q. How do you inſtance it?
A. Thus : Milo was accuſed, for killing Clo
dius ; Milo confeſsed he killed him, but faid he
did it juſtly. Now the ſtating the caſe here is,-
Whether Milo killed Clodius juſtly or unjuſtly?
Q. How many ways may a caſe be ſtated ?
Ã. Four ways; viz. Conjectural, finitive, in
quality, in quantity.
Q. When is a Cafe Conjectural?
A. When it is enquired, whether the thing
was done or no; as, whether Milo killed Clodius.
Q. When is a cafe finitive ?
A. When we enquire into the name, nature,
and definition of the crime ; as, I own I took it,
but I did not commit theft : Where theft muſt be
defined, &c.

Q. What is a caſe in quality?
A. When we enquire, in what manner a fact
was done; as, Milo kiiled Clodius, but he did it juſte
ly. Here we muſt enquire into the circumſtances,
and prove from Law, what in this caſe inay be
deemed Juft or Unjuf.
Q. What is a caſe in Quantity ?
A. 1 hat we uſe, when we enquire into the
greatneſs or ſmallneſs of a crime : as, tho' it be
plain it is a crime, yet it is denied to be a great one.
Q. How do we here Amplify or Diminiſh?
A. By confidering how the fact was circum-
ſtanced in time, place, words and actions, enquiring
who, what, where, when, why, how, by whoſe
aſiſtance, &c. and comparing things with things we
determine, what may be deemed great or little.
Q. What are inartificial arguments from reaſon ?
A. Such as ariſe from without, and not from the
thing itſelf; ſuch as teſtimonies, evidence, &c.*
Q. What is the buſineſs of arguments froin
Morality ?
A. To procure favour, or to perſuade.
Q. What is meant by arguments from morality?
A. That the Orator or Speaker ſhould well con-
fider-Of what, before whom, and for whom he
fpeaks. 1. In regard to his own morals ; that he
himſelf may appear honeſt, prudent, impartial, be-
nevolent, &c. 2. In reſpect to the morals of the

we bring in nothing, nor let any thing drop from us, which
may prejudice the topic we are upon; for, as Cicero well ob-
ferves, “ Turpius elt oratori, nocuiffe videri caufæ, quàm
non profuifle," Cic. de Orat. 2. 73.

Judges, audience, or perſons he would perſuade :
that the thing perſuaded may alſo appear honor- .
able, juſt, and ſerviceable, &c.
Q. What is the buſineſs of arguments from the
Affections ?
A. To move the paſſions, or to pleaſe.
ļ What is meant by arguments from the affec-
tions or paffiens?
A. That he, who would gain his point in per-
fuaſion, muſt endeavour thoroughly to underſtand
the frame of human nature, and
thereby work up-
on the affections, which God has placed in human
minds as ſecret ſprings to all our actions. For as
Tully obſerves, plura enim multo homines judicant
odio, aut amore, aut cupiditate, aut iracundiâ, aut
ſpe, aut timore, aut errore, aut aliquá permotione
mentis, quàm veritate. .Cic. de Orat 2. 42.
Q. How do you define the affections or paſſions ?
A. They are certain emotions of the ſoul,accompa-
nied either with pleaſure or pain. The four chief
paffrons are, joy, refulting from ſome preſent good;
kope, ariſing from ſome future good, grief, occafi-
oned by ſome preſent evil; and fear, cauſed by ſome
future evil. To theſe may be added, anger, lenity,
pladeſty, impudence, love, batred, malice, envy,
compaffion, emulation, &c.
Q. What is difpofition?
A. Diſpoſition is the proper ranging of the argu-
ments or parts of an oration.
Q: How many parts are there in an oration,
and in what order ſhould they ſtand ?


## p. 27 (#41) ##############################################

THE ART OF RHETORIC.
27
A. The parts of an oration or declamation are
ufually reckoned fix, and generally ſtand in this
order : exordium, narration, propoſition, confir-
mation, refutation, and peroratian.
Q. What do you underſtand by the exordium
of an oration ?
A. The exordium, or beginning of an oration,
is that part, in which we are to give our audience
ſome intimation of our ſubject, and from the nature
of it to prepare their minds to benevolence and at-
tention. In which part the ſpeaker ought to be
clear, modeſt, and conciſe,
Q. What is the narration ?
A. The narration is a brief recital of the whole
caſe from beginning to end : which ought to be
plain, that it may be underſtood ; likely, that it may
;
be credited; pleaſing, that it may be liſtened to ;
and ſhort, that it may not tire.
Q. What do you underſtand by the propoſition ?
A. The propoſition is an explanation of the pur-
port, or ſum of the whole diſcourſe, or thing in
diſpute. If it divides the oration into parts, (which
ought never to exceed three or four at molt) it is
called partition.
Q. What is the confirmation in the oration?
A. The confirmation is that part which con-
tains the proofs or arguments we uſe to ſtrengthen
and enforce our ſubject. In this part of a diſcourſe
rhetoricians adviſe, that our ſtrongeſt arguments
be ſet in the front, the weakeſt in the middle, and
that ſome few of the beſt be kept as a reſerve.
Vid. Cic. de Orat. 2, 27.

THE ART OF RHETORIC.
Q. What is the refutation ?
A. The refutation, or confutation, is an anſwer
to all our adverſary's arguments; and takes off all
his objections, by ſhowing them to be abſurd, falſe,
or inconſiſtent.
Q What is the peroration ?
A. The peroration, or conclufion, is a recapitu-
lation of the ſtrongeſt arguments, brought into one
view, as the rays of the ſun are drawn into a focus;
eſpecially ſuch as are moſt likely to move the paf-
fions, and affect the heart, convince the judgment,
or enlighten the underſtanding.

Q. What is an Hyperbole ?
A. Hyperbole in Speech the Truth outflies. 6
There is a general Analogy and Relation between all
Tropes, and in them all we uſe a foreign or ftrange Word
inſtead of a proper ; and therefore we lay one Thing
and mean ſomething different. When we ſay one Thing,
and mean another almoſt the fame ; it is a Synecdoche :
When we ſay one thing, and mean another mutually de-
pending; it is a Metonymy. When we ſay one thing, and
mean another oppoſite or contrary; it is an liony. :
When we ſay one thing and mean another like it; it is a
Metaphor : A Metaphor, continued and often repeated,
becomes an Allegory :. A Metaphor, carried to a great de..
gree of boldneſs, is an Hyperbole ; and, when at firft found
it ſeems a little harſh and ſhocking, and may be imagin-
ed to carry ſome impropriety in it; it is a Catacresis.

In order to lay before our pupil the power, contexto.
and propriety of the ſpeech of Catiline, which we
have introduced, as an example of oratory; and
that he may be fully informed of the artifice,
plaufibility, and high colouring that appear in it,
we have ſelected the particulars of the tranſac-
tions that occafioned the ſpeech, as given by Dr.
Goldſmith, in his Roman hiſtory.
SERGIUS CATILINE was a patrician by
birth, who reſolved to build his own power on
the downfal of his country. He was ſingularly
formed, both by art and nature, to conduct a
conſpiracy; being poffeffed of courage equal to
the moſt deſperate attempts, and eloquence to
give a colour to his ambition ; ruined in his for-
tune, profligate in his manners, vigilant in pur-
ſuing his aims; and infatiable after wealth, only
to laviſh it on guilty pleaſures : in ſhort, as Ci-
cero deſcribes him, he was a compound of oppo-
ſite paſſions ; intemperate to exceſs; yet patient
of labour to a wonder ; ſevere with the virtuous,
debauched with the gay; ſo that he had all the
vicious for his friends by inclination, and he ata

tached even ſome of the good, by the fpecious
fhow of pretended virtue. However, his real
character was at length very well known at Rome:-
He had been accuſed of debauching a veſtal vir.
gin; he was ſuſpected of murdering his ſon; to
gratify a criminal paſſion; and it was notorious,
that in the proſcription of Syllaz he had killed
his own brother, to make his court to the tyrant.
Having contracted many debts by the looſeneſs
of ſuch an ill-ſpent life, he was reſolved to extri-
cate himſelf from them by any means, however
unlawful : his firſt aim therefore was at the con-
ſulſhip, in which he hoped to repair his ſhattered
fortune by the plunder of the provinces ; but in
this he was fruſtrated. This diſgrace ſo operated
fo
upon a mind naturally warm, that he inſtantly
entered into an aſſociation with Piſo, and ſome
others of deſperate fortunes like himſelf; in
which it was reſolved, to kill the conſuls that had
been juſt choſen, with ſeveral other fenators;
and to fhare the government among themſelves.
Theſe deſigns however were diſcovered, before
they were ripe for action, and the ſenate took
;
care to obviate their effects. Some time after, he
again ſued for the conſulſhip, and was again dif-
appointed; the great Cicero being preferred be-
fore him. Enraged at theſe repeated mortifica-
tions, he now breathed nothing but revenge :
his deſign was (had he then obtained the conful-
ſhip, and with it the command of the armies of
the empire) to have ſeized upon the liberties of
his country, and goyers alone. At length, im.

patience under his diſappointments would not per-
mit him to wait for the ripening of his ſchemes ;
wherefore he formed the mad reſolution of uſurp-
ing the empire, though yet without means ade-
quate to the execution.
Many of thoſe who were in the former con
ſpiracy of Pifo, ſtill remained attached to Catiline's
intereſt : theſe he * aſſembled, to about the
number of thirty; informed them of his aims and
his hopes, ſettled a plan of operation, and fixed
a day for the execution. It was reſolved among
them, that a general inſurrection ſhould be raiſed
throughout Italy, the different parts of which
were afligned to the different leaders. Rome
was to be fired in different places at once; and
Catiline, at the head of an army raiſed in Etruria,
was in the general confufion to poſſeſs himſelf of
the city, and maſſacre all the ſenators.. Lentulus,
one of his profligate affiftants, who had been
prætor or judge in the city, was to preside in
their general councils : Cethegus, a man who
facrificed the poffefsion of great preſent power,
to the hopes of gratifying his revenge againſt
Cicero, was to direct the maſſacre through the
city; and Caſsius was to conduct thoſe who fired:

it. But the vigilance of Cicero being a chief
obſtacle to their deſigns, Catiline was very de-
firous to ſee him taken off before he left Rome;
upon which, two knights of the company under.
* In the firſt general meeting of the conſpirators, Catiline
made the following ſpeech, which is a remarkable inſtance
of the power of oratory,

took to kill him the next morning in an early viſit
on pretence of buſineſs, while in bed. The
meeting, however, was no ſooner over, than Ci-
cero had information of all that paffed in it; for,
by the intrigues of a woman named Fulvia, he
had gained over Curius, her lover and one of the
conſpirators, to ſend him a punctual account of
all their deliberations. Having taken proper pre-
cautions to guard himſelf againſt the deſigns of
his morning viſitors, who were punctual to the
appointment; he next took care, to provide for
the defence of the city; and afſembling the ſe-
nate, conſulted what was beſt to be done in this
time of danger. The firſt ſtep taken was, to
offer conſiderable rewards for further diſcoveries,
and then to prepare for the defence of the ſtate.
The principal conſpirators were feized, and ex-
ecuted ; and Catiline fell in the rebel army, fight-
ing with deſperate fury. The particulars of this
conſpiracy are elegantly defcribed by Salluft,
from whence the following ſpeech is taken.

With blackeſt inſurrection, to confound

Grateful to appetite more pleas'd my ſenſe

The all-graſping power of Rome has not yet been

there is ſomewhat worth the labour of conquering,

pled a region, ſo that there are none left alive able

to you, my countrymen, that the conquered youth
are daily draughted off to ſupply the deficiencies in

plundered, to make up the tributes: impoſed on us
by oppreſsive avarice. Britons fow their fields

and the greedy Romans reap them. Our very bo
dies are worn out in carrying on their military works;
and our toils are rewarded by them with abuſe and
Aripes. Thoſe who are born to Navery, are bought

who enſlave it. And our portion.of:diſgrace is the
bittereft, as the inhabitants of this iſland are the

native bent againſt tyranny, is the offence, which
moſt ſenſibly irritates thoſe lørdly uſurpers. : Our

tural defence by the furrounding ocean, render us
obnoxious to their ſuſpicions : for they know, that

Choſe freely what it now ſo juſtly rues,
Me miſerable ! which way ſhall I fly
Infinite wrath, and infinite deſpair ?
Which way I fly is hell ; myſelf am hell ;
And, in the loweſt deep, a lower deep
Still threat'ning to devour me, opens wide,
To which the hell I ſuffer feems a heaven.
O then at laſt, relent. Is there no place

Left for repentance, none for pardon left ?
Nonc left but by ſubmiſsion ; and that word
Diſdain forbids me, and my dread of ſhame
Among the ſpirits beneath, whom I ſeduc'a
With other promiſes and other vaunts
Than to ſubmit, boaſting I could ſubdue
Th’ Omnipotent. Ah, me! they little know
How dearly I abide that boaſt fo vain,
Under what torments inwardly I groan,
I
While they adore me on the throne of hell,
With diadem and ſceptre high advanc'dy
The lower ſtill I fall, only ſupreme
In miſery : ſuch joy ambition finds !
But ſay I could repent, and could obtain;.
By act of grace, my former ſtate, how ſoon
Would height recall high thoughts ? how ſoon un-
ſay
What feign'd ſubmiſsion ſwore ? eaſe would recant
Vows made in pain, as violent and void,
(For never can true reconcilement grow
Where wounús of deadly heat have pierc'd fo
deep :)
Which would but lead me to a worſe relapfe,
And heavier fall : ſo ſhould I purchaſe dear
Short intermiſsion bought with double ſmart.
This knows my puniſher: therefore as far
From granting he, as I from begging peace.
All hope excluded thus, behold in ſtead
Of us outcaſt, 'exild, his new delight,
Mankind created, and for him this world.
So farewel hope, and with hope farewel fear,
Farewel remorſe ; all good to me is loft ;

Divided empire with Heav'n's King I hold,

FROM
FROM heav'n my ſtrains begin. From heav'n
deſcends
The flame of Genius to the choſen breaſt,
And beauty with 'poetic wonder join'd,
And inſpiration. Ere the rifing ſun
Shone o'er the deep, or ’mid the vault of night
The moon her ſilver lamp ſuſpended : ere
The vales with ſprings were water'd, or with groves
Of oak or pine the ancient hills were crown'd;
Then the great Spirit, whom his works adore,
Within his own deep eſſence view'd the forms,
The forms eternal of created things :
The radient fun; the moon's nocturnal lamp ;
The mountains and the ſtreams; the ample ſtores
Of earth, of heav'n, of nature. From the firſt,
On that full ſcene his love divine he fix’d,
His admiration. Till, in time complete,
What he admir'd and lov'd his vital pow'r
Unfolded into being Hence the breath
Of life informing each organic frame :
Hence the green earth, and wild reſounding waves:
Hence light and ſhade, alternate; warmth and cold;
And bricht autumnal ſkies, and vernal ſhow'rs,
And all the fair variety of things.

But not alike to every mortal eye
Is this great ſcene unveil'd. For while the claims
Of ſocial life to diff'rent labours urge
The active pow'rs of man, with wifeſt care
Hath nature on the multitude of minds
Impreſs'd a various bias : and to each
Decreed its province in the common toil.
To ſome ſhie taught the fabric of the ſphere;
The changefül moon, the circuit of the ſtars,
The golden zones of heav'n. To ſome ſhe
gave
To ſearch the ſtory of eternal thought ;
Of ſpace and time; of fate's unbroken chain,
:
And will's quick movement.. Others by the hand.
She led o'er vales and mountains, to explore
What hailing virtue dwells in every vain
Of herbs or trees. But ſome to nobler hopes.
Were deſtin'd:- ſome within a finer mouldi
She wrought and temper'd with a purer flame;
To theſe the Sire omnipotent unfolds,
In fuller aſpects and with fairer lights,
This picture of the world. Through every par
They trace the lofty ſketches of his hand :
In earth, or air, the meadow's flow'ry ſtore,
The moon's mild radiance, or the virgin's mien
Dreſs'd in attractive ſmiles, they ſee portray'd
(As far as mortal eyes the portrait fcan)
Thoſe lineaments of beauty which delight
The mind fupreme. They alſo feel their force,
Enamour'd : they partake th' eternal joy.

NOVELTY.
CALL now to mind what high capacious pow'rs
Lie folded up in man; how far beyond
The praiſe of mortals, may the eternal growth
Of nature to perfection half divine,
Expand the blooming ſoul? What pity, then,
Should Sloth's unkindly fogs depreſs to earth
Her tender bloſſom ; clioak the ſtreams of life,
And blaſt her ſpring! Far otherwiſe deſign’d
Almighty wiſdom ; nature's happy cares
The obedient heart far otherwiſe incline.
Witneſs the ſprightly joy, when aught unknown
Strikes the quick ſenſe, and wakes each active pow'r
To brisker meaſures. Witneſs the neglect,
Of all familiar proſpects, though beheld
With tranſport once, the fond attentive gaze
Of young aſtoniſhment; the fober zeal
Of age commenting on prodigious things.
For ſuch the bounteous providence of heav'n,
In every breaſt implanting this deſire
Of objects new and ſtrange, to urge us on
With unremitted labour to purſue
Thoſe ſacred ſtores that wait the rip’ning foul,
In truth's exhauſtleſs bofom. What need words
To paint its pow'r ? For this, the daring youth
Breaks from his weeping mother's anxious arms.
In foreign climes to rove; the penſive fage
Heedleſs of ſleep, or midnight's harmful damp,
Hangs o'er the ſickly taper; and untir'd
The virgin follows, with inchanted ſtep,
The mazes of fome wild and wonderous tale,

From morn to eve; unmindful of her form;
- Unmindful of the happy dreſs that ſtole
The wiſhes of the youth, when every maid
With envy pin’d. Hence, finally, by night
The village matron, round the blazing hearth,
Suſpends the infant audience with her tales,
Breathing aſtoniſhment! of witching rhymes,
And evil ſpirits ; of the death-bed call
Of him who robb’d the widow, and devour'd
The orphan's portion ; of unquiet foals
;
Ris'n from the grave to eafe the heavy guilt
Of deeds in life concealed; of ſhapes that walk
1
At dead of night, and clank their chains, and wave
The torch of hell around the murderer's bed.
At ev'ry ſolemn pauſe the croud recoil
Gazing each other ſpeechleſs, and congeald
With ſhiv'ring fighs; till eager for th' event,
'
Aroạnd the beldame all arrect they hang,
Each trembling heart with grateful terrors quell’d.

ROLLA's, animating ſpeech to his ſoldiers.
Y brave aſſociates--partners of my toil, my
feelings and my fame !—can Rolla's words
add vigour to the virtuous energies which inſpire
your hearts ? -No-you have judged as I have,
—
the foulneſs of the crafty plea by which theſe bold
invaders would delude you. Your generous fpirit
has compared as mine has, the motives, which, in
a war like this, can animate their minds, and ours.

power, for plunder, and extended rule.-We, for
our country, our altars, and our homes.—They,
follow an Adventurer whom they fear-and obey
a power which they hate,- We ſerve a Monarch
a
whom we love-a God whom we'adore. When-
e'er they move in anger, 'deſolation tracks their
progreſs !- Where'er they pauſe in amity, afflic-
tion mourns their friendſhip - They boaſt, they
come but to improve our ſtate,-enlarge our
thoughts, and free us from the yoke of error!
Yes—They will give enlightened freedom to our
minds, who are themſelves the flaves of paſsion,
avarice, and pride. They offer us their protecti-
on.--Yes, ſuch protection as vultures give to lambs
-covering and devouring them! They call on us
to barter all our goods we have inherited and
proved, for the deſperate chance of ſomething bet-
ter which they promiſe. Be our plain anſwer this :
The throne we honour is the PEOPLE'S CHOICE-
the laws we reyerence are our brave Father's le-
gacy-the faith we follow teaches us to live in
bonds of charity with all mankind, and die with
hope of blifs beyond the grave. Tell your inva- .
ders this, and tell them too, we ſeek no change ;
and, leaſt of all, ſuch change as they would bring
US.

CONCLUSION.
Directions for Speaking.
SPEAK the Speech (I pray you) as I pronouncd
it to you, trippingly on the tongue :. But, if
you mouth it, as many of our Speakers do, I had
as lieve the town-crier had ſpoken my lines. And
do not ſaw the air too much with your hand, thus; ;
but uſe all gently : for in the very torrent, tem-
pest, and (as I may ſay) whirl-wind of your paſsi-
on, you muſt acquire and beget a temperance, that'
may give it ſmoothneſs. Oh, it offends me to the
ſoul, to hear a robouſtous periwig-pated fellow
tear a paſsion to tatters, to very rags; to ſplit the
ears of the groundlings; who (for the moſt part)
are capable of nothing, but 'inexplicable dumb-
ſhows and noiſe: I would have ſuch a fellow whipt,
for o'er-doing termagant ; it out-herods Herod. -
Pray you, avoid ic!
Be not too tame neither : but let your own dif-
cretion be your tutor.
Suit the Action to the
Word, the Word to the Action ; with this ſpeci-
al obſervance, thạt you o'er-ſtep not the modeſty
of nature : for any thing fo over-done, is from the
purpoſe of ſpeaking. Now this, over-done or
come tardy off, tho it make the unskilful laugh,
cannot but make the judicious grieve; the cenſure
of which one, muft (in your allowance) o'er-ſway
a whole crowd of others.
