PREFACE
This bibliographical index is planned to provide ready references to
the growing volume of literature on Speech Education. It is a compila-
tion intended primarily as a guide for teachers and students, rather than
for technical research workers. Each of the divisions of the volume
includes what we believe to be a working bibliography adequate to pro-
vide the teacher and student with enough leads and guides to systematize
and expedite investigative study.
The bibliography makes no pretense of being exhaustive. The listed
items are limited to (1) materials written in the English language, and
(2) materials dealing more or less directly with the field of Speech.
Duplication of items already indexed in other bibliographies is held to
a minimum. Hence, a considerable body of material which might have
found a place in this work is excluded because of ready accessibility
through Blanch Baker's Dramatic Bibliography and Arthur G. Kennedy's
A Bibliography of Writings on the English Language from the Beginning
of Printing to the End of 1922.
Needless to say, several journals devoted wholly to speech problems
have been rather completely indexed. Among these publications are the
Emerson Quarterly, Journal of Expression, Journal of Speech Disorders,
Public Speaking Review, Quarterly Journal of Speech, and Speech
(London).
The classifications of materials are designed to serve the needs of
practical convenience, rather than to suggest mutually exclusive logical
divisions. It should also be noted that certain items are indexed under
two or more sections in order to give added usefulness to the volume.
The length of an annotation does not necessarily reflect the quality of
the book or article under consideration. Our only object in presenting
the expository detail 19 to throw some light upon the general nature of
the work. Consequently, many of the listed materials are not annotated
because the titles are sufficiently revealing to suggest the contents or point
of view.
Finally, we trust that any significant omissions will be regarded with
kindly indignation.

A careful analysis of Plato's dislike for
rhetoric. The author traces this attitude
to Plato's distrust of certain rhetoricians

conclusion is that Aristotle's theory of rhet.
oric is more like that of Protagoras and
Gorgias than of Plato.

This monograph sets forth and analyzes
the functions and values of the discussion
method. More specifically, the "purpose of
the investigation with regard to influence
in discussion,' where the problem dealt
with the consideration of presented alterna-
tives, was to
"1. Test the ability of an individual:
"a. In getting the group to adopt
his point of view and record it or some-
thing similar to it, as the decision of the
group. This is termed influence of an
immediate group nature, immediate
group influence.
*b. In basically changing the view-
point of other members of the group. This
may be called influence of a persisting
sort, or persisting individual influence.
"2. Correlate each type of influence with
individual characteristics."

Exposition of Delsarte system is incor-
porated in the sections. Based upon pre-
mise that man has three aspects which
form
indestructible unity-physical,
moral, and intellectual. Analysis of or-
ganism reveals some instrument which
makes each of these aspects manifest-the
vocal, dynamic, and buccal. Scheme there-
fore derives from the union of the aspects
of man and the agents for their expression.
Hence the treatment of voice, gesture and
articulation.
