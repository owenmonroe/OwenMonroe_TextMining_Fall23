TESTIMONIALS.
THE FIRST AND SECOND EDITIONS OF
VANDENHOFF'S SYSTEM OF ELOCUTION
having been exhausted, a Third Edition is now published, considera-
bly enlarged, under the title of "THE ART OF ELOCUTION." The Pub-
lisher is happy in presenting, from among many others, the following
high testimonials to the merits of the work:
From the REV. R. T. HUDDART, (Classical Academy, Houston streel.)
It affords me much pleasure to add my testimony to the value, im-
portance, and advantage of Mr. George Vandenhoff's Work on Elocu-
tion. He has aptly styled it "a pluin System :" such it truly is to those
who will pursue the instruction given, step by step; and cannot fail of
producing a beneficial and much wished for result in one of the depart-
ments of education so sadly neglected-correct reading-devoid of vul-
garities, and errors in articulation and pronunciation. I hope the book
will have a wide circulation, in order that the good which it is capable
of effecting may be thus more extensively diffused, and a better system
of instruction be afforded to the rising generation, in that which con-
stitutes a most agreeable accomplishment in every gentleman's educa-
tion, namely, "Logical and Musical Declamation."

From MRS. LAWRENCE, (Academy, Stuyvesant Place.)
I have great pleasure in stating, that Mr. G. Vandenhoff's Work on
Elocution has been used with so much success in my school, that I can
safely recommend it to all, who may desire improvement in that elegant
branch of education; as the most simple, clear, and concise treatise on the
subject; and well adapted to the comprehension of any mind.

TESTIMONIALS.
To the Author, from JOHN VANDENHOFF, Esq., Professor of Elocution
in the Royal Academy of Music, London.
In reference to your System of Elocution, published in New-York,
I am proud to recognise it as the best practical work I know on the
subject.
I have made satisfactory experiments of it in my own practice; and
shall make it a Text-Book, both with my private pupils, and my Classes
at the Royal Academy of Music; for which purpose send me two hun-
dred copies.
I shall recommend it also to the Elocutionary Professors of our seve-
ral Colleges.

From C. S. HENRY, D. D., Professor of Philosophy and History in
the University of New-York.
I have the highest opinion of Mr. Vandenhoff's System of Elocution.
I know of no book so well fitted for the use of learner or teacher. It
possesses in an eminent degree the combination of good qualities most
of all to be desired in a work of instruction--correctness of theory, sim-
plicity and clearness of exposition, and ease of practice.

From A. RICHARDSON, Esq., Principal of the Freehold Young Ladies'
Seminary.
I have introduced Vandenhoff's Elocution into our Seminary, and
am highly pleased with the trial which we have thus far made of its
merits, viz: the great interest which a large class of young ladies
manifest in the subject of Elocution since we have introduced this work.
This branch of education, hitherto one of the most uninteresting to my
pupils, is now regarded as entirely the reverse.

A. RICHARDSON.
From the Annual Report of the BOARD OF DIRECTION of the NEW-
YORK MERCANTILE LIBRARY ASSOCIATION-(1844.)
Elocution.-Attempts have been made, in former years, to form classes
in this department of education, which have proved unsuccessful. The
Board, during the past year, have been enabled to interest a sufficient
number of the members in the subject, to form a class which is now in
operation.
The class in Reading and Oratory is under the instruction of Mr.
George Vandenhoff, whose eminent qualifications are too well known
to need a word of recommendation from us.

Notices of the Press.
"It is admirably calculated for the purpose which it is designed.”—
Boston Evening Gazette.
"This is a capital work, thoroughly practical, and in every sense a
good book. The exercises are very judiciously selected, and exhibit
great tact and judgment. It will be found of great service to the student,
in the acquisition of an art which is daily gaining ground as an essen-
tial part of the education of a gentleman. We think it will even add
to the already distinguished reputation of the author."-News-Letter.
"This is an excellent work, and written by one who is fully compe-
tent to the task he has undertaken. To those who are studying Elocu-
tion, it is invaluable. To all who would acquire a good knowledge of
language, and correct manner of reading and speaking, we would
warmly recommend this work."-Crystal Fount.
"The directions in Mr. Vandenhoff's book are so simple, so easy of
comprehension, and may be so readily practised, that there should be
no mercy shown hereafter to any slovenly or negligent reader who has
the means to possess himself of a copy of this excellent system."—
Broadway Journal.
"This book went to a second edition within six months of the first
appearance. The author is a Professor of Elocution in the city of New-
York, and any one will be convinced by reading a few pages of his
work, that experience has shown him the defects which usually impair
Elocution. Elocution properly embraces the subjects of articulation,

punctuation, pauses, and modulation of voice in pitch and emphasis,
all of which are treated in this book, intelligibly, and we should judge
from a slight examination, to good purpose. Half the volume is de-
voted to the developement of the system and exercises, and the other
part to selections of prose and poetry for reading, recitation, and de-
clamation."-Utica Daily Gazette.
"The author of this work is well known as one of the most ac-
complished elocutionists in America. The volume before us is pro-
nounced by the best of judges to be simple and clear in its teach-
ings, and admirably adapted for the use of Schools. The reading is
of the first order, and the book appears to have been got up with
great care."-Onondaga Standard.
"Very many books have been written for the purpose of teaching
the principles of good reading and speaking; some of much merit.
We have examined a work by G. Vandenhoff, teacher of Elocution in
the city of New-York, entitled 'A Plain System of Elocution,' with
which we are much pleased. It explains the principles of the art in a
clear and forcible manner, and illustrates them by ingenious characters,
well calculated to assist the learner. Its selections of examples in
prose and verse are excellent, and the arrangement very good."-
Rochester Daily American.
"A second edition of Mr. Vandenhoff's admirable work on this im-
portant branch of education. The present edition is greatly improved
and enlarged, and takes in the various branches of the subject;—logical
and musical reading and declamation; oratorical, poetical and dramatic
reading and recitation. As now published, the work forms a complete
'speaker,' and is well adapted for private or school use.
The rapid
sale of the first edition shows that Mr. Vandenhoff's labors in this de-
partment are not unappreciated."-Commercial Advertiser.
"This second edition of Mr. Vandenhoff's Elocution proves that it
is appreciated by those for whom it is chiefly intended. Teachers and
parents are indebted to the author for this aid to their labors. The re-
marks on articulation and pronunciation are very judicious, and the se-
lections of exercises, both in prose and poetry, show good taste. In-
deed, the book may be studied with profit by many who imagine them-
selves out of the ranks of learners, for its views on many subjects con-
nected with this science are quite original.”—Evening Gazette.
"The second edition of a work which we noticed when it first ap-
peared. Mr. Vandenhoff is one of the most accomplished practical
elocutionist the country. He is also a scholar, thoroughly ac-
quainted with the rules of the science which he has made it his pro-
fession to teach."-Freeman's Journal.

PREFACE.
THE work now offered to the Public is an enlargement
and improvement, by the addition of much original matter,
of the Author's previous publication, entitled "A Plain
System of Elocution," which ran through two editions, but
which is now so much improved upon as to induce the
Author to change its name. The alterations and additions
made to that System are the result of reflection, study, and
of the experience gathered from an extensive practice as
an instructor. The Author has great pleasure in acknow.
ledging the valuable suggestions which he has received
and adopted, from his father, JOHN VANDENHOFF, Esq., Pro-
fessor of Elocution at the Royal Academy of Music in
London. To Dr. RUSH's Treatise on the Voice, the Author
has had recourse for light on many of the niceties of the
elementary sounds of our language; and gladly takes this
opportunity of offering his humble tribute to the masterly
analysis of the voice, its functions and capabilities, contain-
ed in that philosophical and eloquent work.
He takes this occasion also to renew his acknowledg-

ments to those families and heads of academies who have
encouraged his attempt to awaken greater attention to this
essential branch of education, and who do him the honor to
approve of his system of instruction.*
The numerous classes of elegant and accomplished
ladies who have read with him, in the houses of families of
the highest standing and respectability, prove that a just
appreciation is entertained of this art as an indispensable
female acquirement: and the attention and improvement of
his pupils have made his task one of pleasure and self-
gratulation. The correct and elegant enunciation of her
native tongue, and a graceful style of reading the language
of its prose writers and poets, cannot be too assiduously
cultivated by a lady: the accomplishment is peculiarly
feminine, and its possession is a distinctive mark of high
breeding and good education. If the Author's exertions
shall be deemed to have facilitated its acquirement, he will
be proud indeed.

ART OF ELOCUTION.
INTRODUCTION.
The value of ELOCUTION; particularly to the Orator-Elocution
a necessary part of Oratory-Sketch of an Orator—“ Can
Elocution be taught?"-Answer to the Right Reverend Dr.
Whately's (Archbishop of Dublin) objections to a System of
Elocution-the arguments in his Elements of Rhetoric com-
batted by his arguments in his Elements of Logic-Advice
to the Student.
ELOCUTION, as its derivation (cloquor) indicates, is the
art of speaking, or delivering language; and it embraces
every principle and constituent of utterance, from the arti-
culation of the simplest elementary sounds of language, up
to the highest expression of which the human voice is capa
ble in speech.
Of the importance, if not the necessity, of such an art to
a perfect system of education, one would think there could
not be two opinions. We must all speak; it must therefore
be desirable to speak with propriety and force; as much so
as regards the utterance of our language as its grammatical
accuracy. And though any language, however meagre and

ART OF ELOCUTION.
however mean, and any utterance, however imperfect and
inelegant, (so that it be barely intelligible,) are sufficient
for any of the commonest purposes of speech, yet something
higher is surely necessary even to the ordinary conversa.
tion of the gentleman and the man of education.
But most of us are called upon occasionally in public,
even though we may not belong to any of the learned pro-
fessions, to express our opinions, to state our views, to offer
our advice, or to justify some course we may have pursued
in relation to affairs in which others beside ourselves are
interested; and on such occasions, the advantage of a
natural, elegant, and easy delivery cannot but be felt in se-
curing the ready attention and favor of the audience.
To him who desires to make a figure in the Pulpit, in
the Senate, or at the Bar, a good delivery, a nervous and
elegant style of Elocution, are as essential, almost, as force
of argument and grace of language. How many a good
story is marred in the telling: how many a good sermon is
lost in the preaching: how many a good speech, excellent
in matter, argument, arrangement, language, falls listless
on the ear, from the apathetic, inelegant, and powerless
manner of the speaker! Elocution is indeed a part of ora-
tory, essential to its perfection. He who would touch the
heart, "and wield at will the fierce democracie," must have
"wit, and words, and worth,
Action and utterance, and the power of speech,
To stir men's blood!"

Thus, "doubly armed," the orator rises calm in the confi-
dence of his strength. In vain the angry shout, in vain the
discordant tumult of a hostile and prejudiced assembly:
"illum
Non civium ardor prava jubentium
Mente quatit solidâ.”
He stands unmoved amid the storm. He speaks, and “his
big manly voice" goes forth, like the trumpet's sound, above
all the tumult. He is by turns patient or indignant, bold
or yielding, as it suits his purpose: he exhorts, he threat-
ens, he supplicates, he persuades. The storm is hushed-
the waves subside; he has stretched his wand over the
troubled waters, and the tempest is at rest. And now all
hang breathless on his lips ;-he warms, he glows, he is on
fire: his hearers are carried away with him; they follow
him in all his windings, through every change of feeling
and passion. He bears down every obstacle; his friends
he animates with his enthusiasm, he lashes his opponents
with his satire,—he withers them with his scorn, he crush-
es, he annihilates them with his terrible, his resistless pow-
er. And now "Io! Io! Triumphe!" Acclamations of
delight rend the air; he is crowned with garlands, he is
borne in triumph to his home, the hero of the day; achiev-
ing a bloodless victory, a stainless triumph-nobler than
was ever won by conquest and the sword-the victory of
mind over mind, the triumph of the intellect of one man
over the understandings and the hearts of thousands.

ART OF ELOCUTION.
Such is the triumph of the perfect ORATOR ;-a triumph
due as much to the power and grace of delivery, as to the
force of argument or the eloquence of diction.
And how is this power and grace of delivery to be ac-
quired ?—for acquired it must be-it is born with no man:
it is indeed to this part of oratory that the maxim "orator
fit" is peculiarly applicable. It is an art; and is to be at-
tained by rule, by training and discipline, by constant and
well regulated exercise, by using the mental faculties to
a quick power of analysis of thought, and the cultivation of
the ear and vocal organs for a ready appreciation and exe-
cution of tone. And that system that furnishes the best
and readiest means of attaining these objects, is the best
system of Elocution: the one that fails of this is worth
nothing.
And here I will take the opportunity of answering the
objections of those who are in the habit of promulgating the
opinion that Elocution cannot be taught—that is, that it is
not an art; for to deny that it admits of rules, and princi-
ples, is to deny it the place of an art. The name of the Rt.
Revd. Dr. WHATELY, Archbishop of Dublin, is the greatest
that I find among the list of these objectors; and in an-
swering his objections to all or any System of Elocution, I
shall be able, I think, to dispose of the whole question-
"Can Elocution be taught?"
Dr. Whately, in his ELEMENTS OF RHETORIC, (Part IV.
c. 2,) while he admits, and indeed insists on, the importance
of a good Elocution, emphatically protests against any sys-

15
tem for its attainment: his own directions being that every
person should read and speak in a natural manner; and he
says (§ 3, p. 356,*) "that in reading the Bible, for example,
or anything which is not intended to appear as his own
composition, it is desirable that he should deliver it as if he
were reporting another's sentiments, which were both fully
understood and felt in all their force by the reporter."
Admitted; this is the very object of Elocution: and how is
it to be attained? He tells us-"the only way to do this
effectually, with such modulations of voice, &c. as are suitable
to each word and passage, is to fix the mind earnestly on the
meaning, and leave nature and habit to suggest the utterance :
and for this plan "he lays claim to some originality of his
own" (Part IV. c. i, §1); though he says, (c. ii., § 2,) that
"it is not enough that the reader should himself actually
understand a composition; it is possible, notwithstanding, to
read it as if he did not: and in the same manner, it is not
sufficient that he should himself feel and be impressed
with the force of what he utters; he may, notwithstanding, de-
liver it as if he were unimpressed." Now can anything be so
vague and so contradictory as such directions as these:
“Don't use any system of Elocution: it will give you a false
style; but read and speak naturally, as if you understood
and felt what you are reading and speaking; nature and habit
will show you how; though, at the same time, however clearly
you may understand, and however deeply you may feel what

you are delivering, it is quite possible that that you may, not-
withstanding, deliver it with an utter absence of understand-
ing and feeling."
And why? Clearly for the want of a system, which by
rules and principles of art shall render such a contradiction
next to impossible.
The right reverend and learned Doctor (c. ii., § 2,) lays
it down that, "To the adoption of any such artificial scheme
of Elocution (that is, by a peculiar set of marks for deno-
ting the pauses, emphases, &c.)—there are three weighty
objections" and the reverend and learned logician states
the objections to be,
"1st. That the proposed system must necessarily be im-
perfect;
"2dly. That if it were perfect, it would be a circuitous path
to the object in view; and,
"3dly. That even if both these objections were removed, the
object would not be effectually obtained."
That is, even if the system were perfect, and not only per-
fect, but direct, still it would not be effectual! To the
learned Doctor, who is a master of the syllogism, and of
every form of argument, this may be clear; but, I confess,
it puzzles my duller apprehension to understand how ineffi
ciency can follow from the perfection of means working di
rectly to their end. However, let us examine how the
learned and reverend Doctor proceeds to prove the validity
of his objections to this artificial system of Elocution. He
says in the same section, "First, such a system must ne-

cessarily be imperfect, because, though the emphatic word
in each sentence may easily be pointed out in writing, no
variety of marks would suffice to indicate the different tones
in which the different emphatic words should be pro-
nounced: though on this depends frequently the whole
force, and even sense of the expression.”
As an instance, he gives the following passage, (Mark,
iv., 21): "Is a candle brought to be put under a bushel or
under a bed?" And he adds, "I have heard this so pro-
nounced as to imply that there was no other alternative, and
yet the emphasis was laid on the right words?"
What emphasis? The Doctor (with respect I speak it)
clearly is not versed in the distinction between inflection
and emphasis, or in the difference between one species of
emphasis and another. I reply to him, that a pupil who
had had three lessons only in Elocution, on a good analyti.
cal system, could not have been guilty of the gross perver-
sion of sense, by false reading, instanced above; for he
would have learnt very early in his course, the inflection
due to a simple interrogative sense, that apposition of
meaning requires apposition of inflection,-and that, to
make antithetical inflections and emphasis on words having
apposition of meaning, is such a total subversion of every
rule of Elocution and common sense, as to excite wonder at
the possibility of any rational being falling into so absurd an
error. And the same pupil, if called upon to mark to the
eye the correct reading of the above sentence, could imme-
diately do it, (certainly, any pupil of mine could,) so as to

ART OF ELOCUTION.
preclude the commission of so gross an error-equal, in its
absurdity, to that of the aspiring youth, who, reckless of
pause, inflection, or emphasis, stated that
"His name was Norval on the Grampian hills,”—
leaving the hearer to imagine that in the lowlands he went
under another cognomen.
But, really, the whole course of the right reverend
prelate against a system of Elocution, is so weak and illogi-
cal that it is painful to follow him step by step.
He proceeds to say, that such a system, if perfect, must
be circuitous, because it professes to teach the tones, empha-
ses, &c. which nature, or custom, which is a second nature,
suggests that is, because its principles must be founded on
nature. And he asks triumphantly-" Then, if this be the
case, why not leave nature to do her own work?"
The answer is obvious: because were we to leave na-
ture to do her own work, we should never emerge from a
rude state of nature; her work would be "ferox, dura,
aspera."
It is natural to man to walk erect; but the infant is as-
sisted in its earliest efforts: and though every person can
walk, it is not every person, by any means, who carries
himself firmly, easily, and gracefully. We see a stooping
carriage, rounded shoulders, a shuffling gait, an uneven
uncertain step; yet all walk, and walk as their nature, or
custom, (which, as Dr. Whately says, is second nature,)
leads them; and every time they indulge this their nature,

they confirm themselves in the practice of a vicious habit.
Hence, it is not thought preposterous, or unworthy of a gen-
tleman, to learn to walk, or at least to improve his personal
carriage, under the directions of a drill-serjeant and a fen-
cing master; and to acquire by art and exercise the bearing
and manly step which distinguish the gentleman from the
uncultivated hind. Thus, it is clear, that it is not always
enough to leave nature to herself: when so left, she fre-
quently degenerates and becomes vitiated; and we are
obliged to go back to certain principles, drawn even from
herself, to restore her to her perfect form, complexion, and
condition.
"Lastly," says the right reverend Doctor, "if a person
could learn thus to read and speak, as it were by note,
with the same fluency and accuracy as are attainable in the
case of singing, still the desired object of a perfectly natural
as well as correct elocution, would never be in this way at-
tained. The reader's attention being fixed on his own voice,
the inevitable consequence would be, that he would betray
more or less his studied and artificial delivery; and would,
in the same degree, manifest an offensive affectation."
Now, the very object of a system of Elocution, such as
the right reverend Doctor so strenuously condemns, is to
give, by practice on just principles, an habitual power of
vocal intonation, inflection, and expression, suited to every
condition of sense, every style of composition, every variety
of feeling, every vicissitude of passion: and the Elocution-
ist who is thoroughly master of his art, no more fixes his at-

tention, while speaking, on his own voice, or on the rules by
which he is producing his effects, than the Rhetorician, in
the course of a composition or an oration, is thinking mi-
nutely of every rule of grammar, logic or rhetoric, by which
to construct his sentences, to round his periods, to divide his
discourse, or to conduct his argument. The skilful fencer,
whom practice has made master of his weapon, uses it ra-
pidly and with effect, without thinking of the names of the
guards or parades that he is executing.
"When one is learning a language, he attends to the
sounds; but when he is master of it, he attends only to the
sense of what he would express."—(Reid on the Mind.)
So, in pursuing a system of Elocution, the pupil acquires
an easy habit, or style of delivery, by exercising himself, on
rule, in giving voice and expression to the language of oth-
ers, or to his own premeditated and pre-written effusions,—
till, from practice, what he has done continually, by rule
and art, in set and studied speech, he comes at last to exe-
cute easily and naturally, and without thought of the means,
in spontaneous and original effusions.
I shall conclude my answer to Dr. Whately's objections
by an extract from his preface to his own Elements of
LOGIC: the remarks in which, in defence of a System of
Logic, are, mutatis mutandis, exactly applicable to his own
objections to a System of Elocution; so that I am happy to
have it in my power to be able to bring against him a much
higher authority than myself-his own; and to let the just
reasoning contained in his "Elements of Logic," refute the

false positions put forth in his " Elements of Rhetoric." He
thus ably and happily maintains the utility of Logic, and
shows the importance and necessity of a system for its
attainment:
"One preliminary observation it may be worth while to
offer in this place. If it were inquired, what is to be re-
garded as the most appropriate intellectual occupation of
man, as man, what would be the answer? The statesman
is engaged with political affairs; the soldier, with military;
the mathematician, with the properties of numbers and mag-
nitudes; the merchant, with commercial concerns, &c.;
but in what are all and each of these employed ?—em-
ployed, I mean, as men. Evidently, in reasoning. They
are all occupied in deducing, well or ill, conclusions from
premises; each concerning the subject of his own particu-
lar business. If, therefore, it be found that the process
going on daily, in each of so many different minds, is, in
any respect, the same, and if the principles on which it is
conducted can be reduced to a regular system, and if rules
can be deduced from that system, for the better conducting
of the process, then, it can hardly be denied, that such a
system and such rules must be especially worthy the atten-
tion, not of the members of this or that profession
merely, but-of every one who is desirous of possessing
a cultivated mind. To understand the theory of that
which is the appropriate intellectual occupation of Man
in general, and to learn to do that well, which every
one will and must do, whether well or ill, may surely

be considered as an essential part of a liberal educa-
tion."
This is most true, apt, clear, and conclusive; and it is
as applicable to Elocution as to Logic. Speech, as much as
reason, distinguishes man from the brute; all men must use
it, whether well or ill, in the daily concerns of their lives,
or in more public affairs, and in a more extensive arena :
and the advantages of a system for doing it well are equally
apparent.
The following passage from the same preface is a di-
rect answer to the right reverend Doctor's own objections
to an artificial system of Elocution:
"It has usually been assumed, however, in the case of
the present subject, that a theory which does not tend to the
improvement of practice is utterly unworthy of regard;
and then, it is contended that Logic (Elocution) has no such
tendency, on the plea that men may and do reason (speak)
correctly without it: an objection which would equally ap-
ply in the case of Grammar, Music, Chemistry, Mechanics,
&c., in all of which systems the practice must have existed
previously to the theory."
How alive the right reverend Doctor is to the weakness
of the argument against a system for his favorite science,
and yet with what triumph he uses the same defeated argu-
ment against my art,-exclaiming, "Then why not leave
nature, or custom, which is second nature, to do her own
work ?"

He proceeds, and I go with him heartily:
"But many who allow the use of systematic principles
in other things, are accustomed to cry up common sense
as the sufficient and only safe guide in reasoning." (This
is exactly what the reverend Doctor himself does in the case of
Elocution,—and therefore let him give the coup de grace to
his own position.)
"Now, by common sense is meant, I apprehend, (when
the term is used with any distinct meaning,) an exercise of
the judgment unaided by any art or system of rules; such
an exercise as we must necessarily employ in numberless
cases of daily occurrence; in which, having no established
principles to guide us,-no line of procedure, as it were,
distinctly chalked out,—we must needs act on the best ex-
temporaneous conjectures we can form. But that common
sense is only our second best guide,—that the rules of art,
if judiciously framed, are always desirable when they can
be had, is an assertion for the truth of which I may appeal
to the testimony of mankind in general; which is so much
the more valuable, inasmuch as it may be accounted the
testimony of adversaries. For the generality have a strong
predilection in favor of common sense, except in those points
in which they, respectively, possess the knowledge of a sys-
tem of rules; but, in these points, they deride any one who
trusts to unaided common sense. A sailor, e. g., will
perhaps despise the pretensions of medical men, and
prefer treating a disease by common sense; but he would

ART OF ELOCUTION.
ridicule the proposal of navigating a ship by common sense,
without regard to the maxims of nautical art. A physician,
again, will perhaps contemn systems of political economy,
of logic, or metaphysics, and insist on the superior wisdom
of trusting to common sense in such matters; but he would
never approve
of trusting to common sense in the treatment
of diseases. Neither, again, would the architect recom-
mend a reliance on common sense alone in building, nor
the musician in music, to the neglect of those systems of
rules, which, in their respective arts, have been deduced
from scientific reasoning, aided by experience. And the
induction might be extended to every department of prac-
tice. Since, therefore, each gives the preference to unassisted
common sense only in those cases where he himself has nothing
else to trust to, and invariably resorts to the rules of art wher-
ever he possesses the knowledge of them, it is plain that man-
kind universally bear their testimony, though unconsciously,
and often unwillingly, to the preferableness of systematic
knowledge to conjectural judgments."
Now, could any one have furnished a clearer, more lo-
gical, or more satisfying answer than the above, to the
learned and right reverend Doctor's own objections to a
system of Elocution; and to his doctrine, in his Elements of
Rhetoric, in favor of " unaided common sense," against "the
rules of art" in delivery, viz.: "The practical rule to be
adopted, is not only to pay no studied attention to the voice,
but studiously to withdraw the thoughts from it, and to
dwell as intently as possible on the sense; trusting to na-

ture, (i. e., common sense,) to suggest spontaneously the
proper emphases and tones"!
I am contented that the learned prelate's doctrine should
be adjudged on his own arguments, and that his objections
to a system of Elocution (which he does not possess) should
be answered by his able defence of a system of Logic, of
the rules of which he is master.
I have dwelt thus long on the right reverend prelate's
opposition to Elocution as an art, because I have fre-
quently felt that his testimony was of great weight with
many, in deterring them from a study pronounced useless
or impracticable by so high an authority, and one deserv-
ing great consideration and respect, from the station, erudi-
tion, general clearness of reasoning, and the attainments of
its author and it is therefore a source of great satisfaction
to me, to find that he has himself (in his Elements of Logic)
furnished arguments against himself, (in his Elements of
Rhetoric,) of a clearness and force that no effort of mine
could have attained to.
I will once more take advantage of the same admirable
preface, to adopt for my own purpose the language of the
right reverend Doctor :
"I am not so weak as to imagine that any system can
ensure great proficiency in any pursuit whatever, either in
all students, or in a very large proportion of them: 'We
sow many seeds to obtain a few flowers.'"
But I am happy to be able to add, that I have been gra-
tified by finding my efforts rewarded by the marked im-

provement in voice, delivery, expression and gesture, of
many pupils who have attended my course of instruction
for but a short period; and in the still greater advance of
those who have patiently, and steadily, and laboriously car.
ried out the system that I have laid down.
That system
has no pretension to profundity, but it is simple and intelli-
gible, and, I think I may venture to add, (as far as it goes,)
correct in theory, and easy of practice. It will, therefore,
I trust, be found of service to the student in the acquisition
of an art which is daily gaining ground, as an essential
part of the education of a gentleman.
I have added to the system a full practice in reading and
declamation, extracted from the works of the best authors
in prose and verse, and in every variety of style. The mere
reading aloud of these extracts, as practice in reading and
declamation, (after an understanding of the rules and prin-
ciples laid down in the system,) even without an instructor,
will be of great advantage to the student. He will reap at
least the benefit of accustoming his ear to the flow of the
language, and so, insensibly, catching something of the
strength and spirit of their diction.
If he go a step further, and read them under the direc-
tion of a guide who can point out to him the peculiar merits
of each, and show him, analytically, how every beauty
may be heightened and brought out into strong relief,-if
he will practise himself with such an instructor, on such
models, disciplining his ear, his action, and his voice, he

With these acquirements united, he may go forth with
confidence to address any assembly in the world: his basis
will be sure; practice will give ease and confidence to his
efforts; and exercise and perseverance amid the "
"forensis

as the scene of his exertions, will make him a valuable ally,

Articulation.-Pronunciation.
"THE end of oratory is to persuade. We cannot
persuade without being first clearly understood; we
cannot be clearly understood without distinct utter-
ance, that is, a clear
ARTICULATION.
This is the first requisite in the reading both of
prose and poetry. Without it, the metre and rhythm
of verse are destroyed; many words are not distin-
guishable in sound from others of somewhat similar
form, though of widely different signification; and the
whole delivery is confused and inelegant. With a
distinct articulation, a speaker of only moderate power
of voice is heard in any place or assembly, much more
easily, and with less effort to himself, than one of
much greater power of organ, whose articulation is
imperfect for it has been observed, that loud, con-
fused noise, even though much greater in degree,
does not travel as far as pure and musical sound.


## p. 30 (#36) ##############################################

ART OF ELOCUTION.
Hence the necessity, before all other things, of a clear,
pure articulation.
To acquire this perfectly, it is necessary to recur
to the first principia,—that is, the ELEMENTARY
SOUNDS of our language.
Speech is articulate vocal sound. That sound is
represented to the eye by signs: these signs are let-
ters, combined into syllables, which syllables are
combined into words-the perfect signs of things; and
the vocal utterance of these signs is speech.
Brutes have vocal sounds, but not speech: for the
sounds they utter are not articulate. It is given to
Man alone to shape his voice into intelligible articu-
late sound, which can communicate thought, desire,
passion, to his fellow-men.
Perfect articulation, then, depends on the clear
enunciation of certain elementary sounds, whose com-
bination forms words.
The signs or letters representing these sounds, and
forming the alphabet of our language, have been clas-
sified by grammarians, principally as vowels and con-
sonants; and they define a vowel as a simple sound,
perfect in itself,-and a consonant, as a sound that
cannot be uttered without the addition or help of a
vowel.
But this nomenclature and definition is imperfect as
a guide and mark of the articulate sounds, whatever
may be its value as a classification of the alphabetical
signs of our language. It is true, indeed, that a con-
sonant (so called from its supposed dependence for its
sound on an attendant vowel,) cannot be individually

SIGNS AND SOUNDS.
31
named without the help of a vowel: that is to say,
the sign or letter B is named be, C se, D de, and so
on; but these consonants, in their combination with
other signs, do not require for their perfect utterance
the aid of a vowel at all; so that their names as signs
are as distinct from their power as sounds, as the
names alpha, beta, theta, of the Greek alphabet, are
distinct from the value or power of the sounds of
a, B, 8, when combined into syllables and words.
For, if a consonant required, of necessity, an atten-
dant vowel before it could be uttered, we never could
enunciate at all such words as black, brandy, claim,
draw, flow, grow, throw, strike, and other words com-
mencing with two or three successive consonants
without the interposition of any vowel: for it will be
clear to any one who will commence the utterance of
any such word, and break off before arriving at the
vowel, that he can and must complete the sounds of
the consonants without its assistance.
Thus, let any one begin to utter the word brandy,
(br-andy,) and suddenly arrest his voice upon br, and
he will perceive that he has uttered a sound and tone
without the aid of a vowel; and so of cl-ose, th-row,
fl-ow, cr-owd, sh-ame, p-ray, &c.; and it is really the
same with words commencing with a single consonant
only, as b-ad, c-old, r-ide, m-ake, &c. Each sign,
whether a vowel or a consonant, has its proper ele-
mentary sound or sounds, however different in quality
or degree of tone those sounds may be.
Again, the SEVEN VOWEL SIGNS in our language,
A, E, I, O, U, W, Y,


## p. 32 (#38) ##############################################

32
ART OF ELOCUTION.
represent many more sounds, monothongal and diph-
thongal, as will be found in the utterance of the fol-
lowing common words:
A-ll, a-rm, a-t, a-le, e-ve, e-nd, i-n, i-sle,
o-ld, o-n, d-o, u-s, u-nion,
in which the sign A, alone, represents four distinct
sounds.
And there are many consonant sounds which are
not represented by any single sign or letter, but re-
quire the combination of several letters to represent
their power as the sounds ch in church, th (soft) in
truth, thin, and th (hard) in that, &c.
Yet these are elementary sounds; and this shows.
the necessity of clearly distinguishing between the
mere alphabetical sign and the elementary sound, or
sounds, which it represents.
Now, as the perfect appreciation and utterance of
the elementary sounds are necessary to the attainment
of a clear and distinct articulation of the language,
which their combination forms, it is essential to adopt
a classification and nomenclature which shall convey
a clear and distinct idea of their value in speech.
For that end, none can be found more definite and
exact than that propounded by Dr. Rush, in his elo-
quent and philosophical work on the human voice.
He divides the elementary sounds of our language
into
1. TONICS-2. SUB-TONICS-3. ATONICS;
which may be thus briefly defined:


## p. 33 (#39) ##############################################

ELEMENTARY SOUNDS.
33
1. TONICS (having tone)-those elementary sounds
which have a distinct and perfect tone or vocality,
proper to themselves, and capable of being held or
prolonged by the voice indefinitely.
Such is the sound of a in a-rm, a-ll, &c., of e in e-ve, of o in
o-ld, &c.
By vocality is meant that full, or (as Dr. Rush defines it)
"that raucus quality of voice which is contradistinguished from
a whisper or aspiration." This distinction may be illustrated
by uttering the exclamations "um !" as an expression of doubt,
inquiry, &c., and “sh !” (for hush !) as enforcing silence: in the
first of which (um!) there is vocality, and in the second (sh!)
merely a whispered aspiration, without tone or vocal sound.
2. SUB-TONICS-whose sound has also tone or vo-
cality, but inferior to that of the tonics in fullness
and power of sustainment.
Such is the sound of b as heard in b-ad, d in d-ear, I in l-one,
m in m-ode, n in n-ose, &c.
3. ATONICS-whose sound is without tone; that is,
an impulsion of breath without vocality.*
Such is the sound of p heard in p-ad, t in t-ime, s in s-igh,
fin f-ade; the utterance of which is in the nature of an explo-
sive whisper.
* Mr. Knowles, in his Grammar, talks of "voice without
breath," as the distinctive mark of the pure semi-vowels.
Voice without breath! This is an organic impossibility. Voice
cannot be produced without breath, though breath alone does
not, without the assistance of the vocal organs, produce voice:
as, in uttering the letter S, a mere sibilation of the breath takes
place without vocality: for the hissing of a serpent is not a vo-
cal sound; though the word hiss cannot be uttered without the
B*

the same; with this difference in quantity, that in a-ll it is long,

in o-n it is short; they are accordingly here marked under the
same numeral, with the distinctive mark -, long, or ~, short.
6. So the tonic of e in e-ve, and of i in i-ll, is organically the
same, differing only in quantity; numbered and marked ac-
cordingly.
We have in the above scheme nine distinct pure tonic ele-
ments, whose sound is monothongal; that is, capable of being
produced by one simple process of articulation, and of being
prolonged to an indefinite time, without any change of tone, or
serpent-like sibilation. Voice without breath is flame without
fire!

alteration of the vocal organs, from the commencement to the
close of its sound.
The term monothongal is used in contradistinction to
MIXED OR DIPHTHONGAL TONICS,

I-sle,
Ou-r,
Oi-1,
U-nion.
The above two lists of pure and mixed tonics contain all the
tonic sounds, monothongal and diphthongal, that are found in
our language.t
Of course, in speaking here of diphthongal tonics, I discard
the grammatical definition of a diphthong: for, according to
that, the sound of oo, as in ooze, is called diphthongal, whereas
it is really a pure tonic element; it is the sound of o in d-o. In
articulation, a diphthong is the union of two tonics, in which
the actual utterance of each takes place: the radical, or com-
* Â-le, Äi-L.—The authority of Dr. Rush is in favor of con·
sidering these sounds identical; that is, he classes the a in
a-le as diphthongal; but afte a very nice examination by a
good ear, I think a distinct sound may be traced in äi-d, from
that which is found in fa-de-in päi-n, from pa-ne. For
this reason I have classed them as separate tonic sounds; the
one pure, the other mixed.
It is necessary to observe, that in adopting the nomen
clature of the elementary sounds, propounded by Dr. Rush, I
have thought it advisable to depart in some instances from his
arrangement and definition of those sounds, and also to make
additions thereto. I mention this, that that learned and philo-
sophical writer may not, by any chance, have to bear the impu-
tation of any errors which may appear in my arrangement or
definition of those elementary sounds, or of their power and
value in speech.

mencing sound, being different from that which is heard at its
close or vanish; thus, the sound of the name of the letter u, (as
heard in the word u-nion,) is compounded of the e in e-ve and
the o in d-o: that is, its radical (or root) is e, its vanish is o,

I.—The diphthongal sound of i has been by some writers re-
solved into the tonic sounds of a and e; a being given as the
radical or opening, and e as the vanish or close of the sound.
But this combination (a e) would produce the diphthongal
sound oi, as in voice; which is, in fact, a provincial pronuncia-
tion of the diphthongal sound of ï (in such words as find, mind,
&c.) prevalent among the vulgar in some of the northern coun-
16
1 6
9
6
ties in England, where we may hear foind for find, koind for
kind, &c. The true radical of ï is u, as in us, and its vanish e,
as in eve. This will be manifest by articulating these two
sounds, separately and slowly at first, and gradually blending
them by a closer and more rapid utterance, till the two tonics
run together, and are lost in each other, thus:

W. The character of the sound of this sign, as in the above
examples, is clearly diphthongal, though its elements are difficult
to trace with exactitude; perhaps its radical is a, its vanish o.
This sign is also frequently mute in its diphthongal figure, as in
awe: here are three vowel signs with one elementary sound, viz.

also in bow (arcus), though heard in the verb to bow.
We shall see hereafter the sub-tonic character of W and Y.
AI.—This diphthong is composed of a and i, as in pain, ail,
which are distinguishable to a fine ear from the pure tonic in
ale, pane, &c.; but the distinction is really very slight-still it
exists.

practice, will tend to strengthen and bring out his voice (see
"VOCAL GYMNASTICS"); and next, let him go carefully through
the Exercise on the Tonics, until he shall read them with per-

outset, will save the pupil much after-trouble in the matter of
articulation.

It will be observed that the A-tonics have each their appro-
priate Sub-tonics, to which they belong, and of which they are
the vanish, or last fading sound: thus B, when sounded, after
its tone or vocality ceases, fades into P; D into T; G (hard)
into K, &c.; as may be perceived by sounding the syllables
Bab, Did, Gig, &c.

VALUE OF THE ELEMENTARY SOUNDS.
All deficiencies of articulation (not proceeding from
organic defect) are merely an imperfect or difficult ut-
terance of the elementary sounds-tonics, sub-tmics,


## p. 44 (#50) ##############################################

44
ART OF ELOCUTION.
and atonics-of which our language is composed;
for it is manifest, that if the parts be perfect, the whole
must be perfect also: and therefore, if our articulation
of the elemental sounds be just, our articulation of all
the syllables and words which their combination forms
must also be just.
What is lisping, or stammering? An imperfect or
faulty utterance of certain elemental sounds. Show
the person who lisps or stammers, (always excepting
the case of organic defect,) the organic process of ar-
ticulation of the particular sound in which his utter-
ance is imperfect, and make him practise that process
of articulation, and there is no doubt of the result; his
defect, if not organic, will be removed, and he will
speak clearly and distinctly.
Slovenly articulation is mis-spelling to the ear; and
is as great a blemish to speech as false spelling is to a
written letter one fault should be as carefully guard-
ed against as the other, in early education. This can
only be done by justly distinguishing between the
sign and the sound, and practising the pupil on all
the elementary sounds of which his language is com-
posed, until he is perfectly master of them in all their
combinations.
The necessity of a distinct articulation will be made
apparent at once by reading the following
EXAMPLES.
1. A serious man was never before guilty of such a series of
follies; in which every species of absurdity was accompanied
by a specious gravity, which rendered it infinitely amusing.

CARELESS ARTICULATION.

In this passage, unless the syllables ies and ious be
correctly distinguished by the reader, in the words
serious and series, species and specious, it must be
quite evident that confusion and uncertainty will re-
sult to the hearer.
2. The duke paid the money due to the Jew before the dew
was off the ground; and the Jew, having duly acknowledged it,
said adieu to the duke for ever.
This example may help to correct a carelessness
very common-that of confounding the consonants d
and j when followed by the sound of u, a process
which changes adieu into a jew, duke into juke, &c.
"That's villainous ;"" reform it altogether."
A ludicrous instance of this kind of carelessness oc-
curred to me in a town in one of the northern counties
of England. I was looking at some apartments which
were shown to me by the landlady of the house.
They did not exactly suit me, and I said so. She,
with all the hauteur of a disappointed and irritated
proprietress, replied, "Well, sir, then you can shoot
yourself elsewhere." I took my leave, assuring her
that I had no such suicidal intention. However, I
followed the advice she meant to give, and did suit
myself elsewhere.
How commonly do we hear, in ordinary conversa-
tion,
A p'tik'lur man, instead of a par-tic-u-lar man.
A fatle error, for fa-tal error.
A purson of emenunce, for per-son of em-i-nence.
Voilet, or vielut, for vi-o-let, &c

ART OF ELOCUTION.
To correct these, and similar errors of articulation,
arising from a careless utterance of the elementary
sounds, the tables of articulation in the "PRACTICE,"
at the end of the System, are prepared for the reader.
Their object is, by frequent practice, to give a habit
of clear articulation of certain sounds, syllables, and
combinations that are generally slurred over.
In practice, I find the greatest carelessness prevail-
ing in the utterance of the following sounds, which I
therefore single out for exercise-the numerals indica-
ting the required sound have reference to the Table
of Tonic Elements.

This sound is between the e in met and the u in curl. It is a

The correct sound of e is attained by striking the accent
lightly, and without dwelling on the er; whereas, in ūr, as in
curd, the sound is more open, and heavier.

io, as in violate (ri-o-late,) vi-o-lence, &c.
Having gone through the Tables of Practice in the above
sounds, let the reader practise the CONTRAST TABLES, to make
the distinction between them clearer to the ear.
The above terminations and syllables are those on
which the greatest carelessness exists in the articula-
tion of the tonic sounds, and therefore I have selected
them for practice; but it is equally necessary to ob-
serve the due sounds of the tonics, whether they occur
in commencing, middle, or terminating syllables.
In reading the tables, be particular first to get the
correct tonic sound of the vowel, as given in the key-
word, and bear in mind that articulation of a sound

does not imply accentuation of the syllable; that is
part of
PRONUNCIATION.
Pronunciation distinguishes the educated gentleman
from the vulgar and unpolished man.
Pronunciation is made up of articulation and ac-
centuation; when both are perfect, the individual has
a correct and elegant pronunciation.
Custom, as Horace has truly said, "arbitrium est
et jus et norma loquendi"-custom is the arbiter and
criterion of what is correct in speech; but then it
is the custom of the polite and elegant part of the
world, (not of the mere vulgar,) that must guide us;
and of which the Roman poet, writing, as he did, to
the cultivated intellects of the Augustan age, must be
understood to speak.
The custom of vulgar thousands cannot sanctify
their errors; nor can the daily practice of thousands
change folly into wisdom, any more than it can cor-

standard authorities to which we might appeal with
certainty, (for our language is continually undergo-
ing change, addition, and improvement;) but, unfor-
tunately, the gentlemen of the learned professions are
frequently so careless in their own pronunciation as
rather to require admonition, (medice, sana te ipsum,)
than to be looked to as authorities; so that they may,
(from their own inaccuracies) be considered a Court
of Errors, but not of Appeal. We must, therefore,
rely upon such lights as we have, and the assistance
of those who, well educated in other respects, make
their own language their particular study.
The following are a few very common examples,
(which it is absolutely necessary to correct,) of
ERRONEOUS PRONUNCIATION,
by mal-articulation or false accentuation.

The syllables car, gar, and guar, are, in polite and refined
pronunciation, softened thus:
car is made kya'r, as kyart (cart,) kyar-pet (carpet.)
gar and guar, gya'r, as gya'rd (guard,) gya'rden (garden,)&c.
Also, before a long and accented i or y, the letter k makes
key, as keyi'nd (kind,) skey-i' (sky,) &c.
Such are a few points which I particularly notice,
because it is in them that errors most prevail. The
nature of this book does not pretend to go into the
whole theory of pronunciation: my object is, practi-
cally to correct certain prevalent faults of articulation
and pronunciation.

ART OF ELOCUTION.
-
SECOND DIVISION.
PART I.
ELOCUTION, as an art, is imitative; it copies, it
mimics as it were-the inflections, tones and varia-
tions of the voice in ordinary unrestrained speech.
As a science, its rules-which are drawn from obser-
vation of these natural tones, inflections and varia-
tions-teach us to invest the language of others, or
our own pre-meditated and pre-written effusions, with
the same variations of voice, inflection and tone, as
we should use, were they the spontaneous and ex-
tempore outpourings of our immediate thoughts and
feelings. And, as in rhetoric we acquire a good habit
or style of composition, by a study and analysis of
the styles and compositions of others;-so, in Elocu-
tion, we acquire an easy habit or style of delivery,
by exercising ourselves in giving voice and expres-
sion to the language and sentiments of others;-till,
from practice, what we have done continually by
rule and art, in set and studied speech, we execute at
last easily and naturally, in spontaneous and original
effusions. After mere distinctness of articulation, and
correctness of pronunciation, this is the first object of
Elocution, to read and speak easily and naturally.


## p. 63 (#69) ##############################################

RHETORICAL PAUSE.
63
And this we acquire by the following
PRINCIPLES:
1. PAUSE.-2. INFLECTION.-3. EMPHASIS.
1. PAUSE.
RHETORICAL PAUSES.
The grammatical pauses which are addressed to
the eye of the reader are insufficient for the speaker;
who addresses himself to the understanding "through
the porches of the ear." He requires more frequent
stopping-places, at more equal intervals, and of better
regulated proportionate duration; both for his own
ease and relief, to enable him to acquire fresh impetus
on his journey; and for the convenience of those who
follow his steps, that they may be able with facility
to keep in his track.
We have, therefore, rhetorical pauses, which are
independent of, (though consistent with, and assist-
ant to,) the grammatical pauses. It is essential that
the doctrine of rhetorical pause should be distinctly
understood; as it not only marks the proper division ·
of thought, and the condition and relation of one part
of the sense to another, but its practice is indispensable
to the perfect effect of the orator: without it, he must
totter and stumble through every long and intricate
sentence with pain to himself and his auditory: with
its aid, his movements become regular, certain, and
easy.
I

ART OF ELOCUTION.
To prove this, let the student read aloud the two
following sentences according to the grammatical
pauses marked in the punctuation.
READ:
1. Nothing is more prejudicial to the great interests of a na-
tion than unsettled and varying policy.
Observe that in this sentence there is no grammat-
ical pause.
2. The people of the United States have justly supposed
that the policy of protecting their industry against foreign leg-
islation and foreign industry was fully settled, not by a single
act, but by repeated and deliberate acts of government, per-
formed at distant and frequent intervals.
If in the reading of this sentence, we adopt the
grammatical pauses only, our delivery (especially of
the opening part of the sentence up to the first com-
ma) will be embarrassed, uncertain, and indistinct.
We shall presently see how easy it will become by
the introduction of the rhetorical pauses, in addition
to, and in aid of the common ones.
I adopt four rhetorical pauses, viz.
1. The short Pause, thus marked, equal, in duration of time,
to the Quaver-Rest in music.
2. The middle Pause,, double the time of the short pause.
3. The Rest, -, or full pause, double the middle pause, and
equal to the Minim Rest in music.
4. The long Pause, I, double that of the rest, and equal
the Bar Rest in music.
Of all these, the first, or short pause, is of the

greatest importance, on account of its continual use,
and its great assistance and relief to the orator,-
being rather in the nature of a suspension of the
breath, than an absolute pause.

NOTE.-Never pause between the verb and its objective case,

the sake of emphasis.

2. MIDDLE PAUSE, (crotchet-rest.)
Frequently occurs in the middle of the sentence,—
which it serves to divide, by separating the opening,
or what may be called the incomplete or hypothetical
part, from the closing or winding up of the sentence,
-where the sense is perfected.
EXAMPLES.
If the world is not the work of chance
it must have had an intelligent Maker.
Although you see not many possessed of a good taste
yet the generality of mankind are capable of it.
Nations, like men, fail in nothing which they boldly under-
take,
when sustained by virtuous purpose and firm resolution.
RULE 1.
The middle pause (therefore) precedes and marks the com-
mencement of the climax of the sense of a sentence.
And now, applying all the preceding rules for pause,

RHETORICAL PAUSE.
67
let the student read aloud the two extracts, which he
has already read without the rhetorical pauses; and
he cannot fail to perceive the advantage he will gain
in ease and effect.
They would be marked, as to rhetorical pauses, as
follows:
1. Nothing is more prejudicial to the great interests of a
nation-
than unsettled and varying policy.
2. The people of the United States have justly supposed
that the policy of protecting their industry against foreign
legislation and foreign industry was fully settled,
not by a single act, 4
but by repeated and deliberate acts of government per-
formed at distant and frequent intervals.
RULE 2.
The middle pause is also used to mark a parenthesis, or any
parenthetical interruption of the sense; unless it be very slight ;
in which latter case the short pause is sufficient.
EXAMPLES.
1. Men of superior genius
while they see the rest of mankind painfully
struggling to comprehend obvious truths
glance themselves like lightning
through the most remote consequences.
2. Genius the pride of man
as man is of the creation
has been possessed but by few.
The judicious use of the short pause and the mid-
dle
pause, serves also to class and divide members of
sentences in logical and clear division, according as


## p. 68 (#74) ##############################################

68
ART OF ELOCUTION.
they are more or less immediately connected with
each other in thought and construction; hence follows
as a
GENERAL RULE.
Branches of sentences having immediate reference to each
other, can be divided only by the short pause; while they must
be separated from other branches with which they are less con-
nected, by the middle pause.
EXAMPLE.
These are the men, to whom,
arrayed in all the terrors of government, I would say,
you shall not degrade us into brutes.
If, in this sentence, we make a short pause only after to whom,
the next branch of the sentence, arrayed in all the terrors of
government, would appear to refer to the men to whom; where-
as, being separated, as it is, from those words, by the middle
pause, it is assigned to the pronoun I, to which it really belongs.
The middle pause is also frequently used in place of the gram-
matical period or full stop, between two sentences, which are
closely allied to each other in relation to the sense which they
bear out, as will be presently shown.
3. THE REST, or FULL PAUSE
Marks the perfection of the sense, that is, the cli-
max of its force; as, the close of a proposition.
"
The full-stop, which is used in grammatical punc-
tuation to mark the close of a sentence or period, is
not a sufficiently distinct guide; for it frequently
closes a sentence which is intimately allied, by the


## p. 69 (#75) ##############################################

RHETORICAL PAUSE.
69
connection of the sense, with the next, and perhaps
with several succeeding periods. In such cases, the
punctum or full-stop which marks the grammatical
close of a sentence, should be rejected in reading; the
middle pause should be used in its stead; and the
rest or full pause should not be introduced till the
actual winding up of all the sentences which have a
close relation to each other in continuing or carry-
ing out the sense to its climax or perfect close.
Take the following sentences, with their gram-
matical punctuation as an
EXAMPLE.
Logicians may reason about abstractions, but the great
mass of mankind can never feel an interest in them. They
must have images.
Now here the second short sentence is intimately connected
with, and in its relation to the sense, forms part of the first; in
fact, it completes and closes the proposition which the first
sentence opened and began. Yet it is divided from that first
sentence, (with which, in its relation to the sense, it is so inti-
mately connected) by the grammatical full-stop or period; and
yet, the close of the whole proposition contained in these two
sentences admits, in grammatical punctuation, of no greater
division from what may follow, in support and illustration of that
proposition, than the same period or full-stop, which has been
already used to separate the two parts of the whole proposition.
This is illogical. The two sentences should thus be relatively
marked and read with rhetorical pause:

Logicians may reason about abstractions, but the
great mass of mankind can never feel an interest in
them They must have images. -
For further illustration, I give the following sentences, mark-

ART OF ELOCUTION.
ed both grammatically and rhetorically, by which it will be
seen that the period or full-stop is frequently used when the
middle pause is sufficient, and indeed absolutely necessary, to
keep up the connection of the sense; and that, at the full close
of the relation between the sentences so divided by the middle
pause, and not till then,-the full pause should have place.
EXAMPLES.
Soon after Christianity achieved its triumph, the principles that
had assisted it began to corrupt. It became a new pagan-
ism. Patron saints assumed the offices of household gods.
St. George took the place of Mars. St. Elmo consoled the
mariner for the loss of Castor and Pollux. The Virgin
Mother and Cecilia succeeded to Venus and the Muses.
The fascination of sex and loveliness was again joined to
that of celestial dignity; and the homage of chivalry was
blended with that of religion. -
Now all these sentences are intimately allied to each other;
they form parts of the same proposition, and serve only to com-
plete and carry it out. They cannot therefore logically admit
of a greater separation by pause than that which I have
marked above: their final close alone can be marked with the
full pause.
4. LONG PAUSE I (bar-rest)
Marks the close of a subject, or of an important di-
vision of it.
It precedes-
The change from one division of a discourse to another;
A new train of ideas or course of argument;
A return from a digression, or from excited declamation
to calm statement and logical discussion.
This pause affords an opportunity to correct the tone or pitch

of voice, which may have reached a high range in the excite-
ment of earnest argument or intense feeling. In this latter
regard the long pause is of great use and assistance to the
reader and the orator. Its application must be illustrated and
acquired by practical exercise.
The system of Rhetorical Pause deserves the stu-
dent's best attention; for its proper application will
contribute greatly to the clearness, flow, and effect of
his discourse, as well as to his own ease and delivery.
Let him now read aloud the following marked
EXERCISE ON PAUSE.
SENSE TASTE AND GENIUS. —
USHER.
The human genius with the best assistance
breaks forth but slowly and the greatest men have
but gradually acquired a just taste and chaste
simple conceptions of beauty- At an immature age
the sense of beauty is weak and confused and re-
quires an excess of coloring to catch the attention
It then prefers extravagance and rant to justness
a gross false wit to the engaging light of nature
and the shewy rich and glaring to the fine and
amiable- This is the childhood of taste but as
the human genius strengthens and grows to matu-
rity if it be assisted by a happy education the sense
of universal beauty awakes it begins to be dis-
gusted with the false and mis-shapen deceptions™

gant simplicity" on pictures of easy beauty and un-
affected grandeur |
The progress of the fine arts in the human mind
may be fixed at three remarkable degrees"- from
their foundation to the loftiest height- The basis is
a sense of beauty and of the sublime the second
step we may call taste and the last genius |
-
A sense of the beautiful" and of the great is uni-
versal which appears from the uniformity there-
of in the most distant ages and nations- What
was engaging and sublime" in ancient Greece and
Rome is so at this day and as I observed be-
fore there is not the least necessity of improve-
ment or science to discover the charms of a graceful
or noble deportment There is a fine but an inef-
fectual light in the breast of man- After night-
fall we have admired the planet Venus the beau-
ty and vivacity of her lustre the immense distance
from which we judged her beams issued and the
silence of the night- all concurred to strike us with
an agreeable amazement But she shone in distin-
guished beauty" without giving sufficient light to di-
rect our steps or show us the objects around- Thus
in unimproved nature the light of the mind is
bright and useless- In utter barbarity our pros-
pect of it is still less fixed it appears and then
again seems wholly to vanish in the savage breast-
like the same planet Venus-when she has but just
raised her orient beams to mariners above the
waves and is now descried now lost through the
swelling billows |

The next step is taste the subject of our in-
quiry which consists in a distinct unconfused
knowledge of the great and beautiful- Although
you see not many possessed of good taste- yet the
generality of mankind are capable of it- The very
populace of Athens had acquired a good taste" by
habit and fine examples so that a delicacy of judg-
ment seemed natural to all who breathed the air
of that elegant city We find a manly and elevated
sense distinguish the common people of Rome and
of all the cities of Greece while the level of man-
kind was preserved in those cities while the ple-
beians had a share in the government" and an utter
separation was not made between them and the no-
bles by wealth and luxury But when once the
common people are rent asunder" wholly from the
great and opulent and made subservient to the lux-
ury of the latter then the taste of nature infalli-
bly takes her flight from both parties The poor by
a sordid habit and an attention wholly confined to
mean views and the rich by an attention to the
changeable modes of fancy and a vitiated prefer-
ence for the rich and costly- lose the view of sim-
ple beauty and grandeur-
It may seem a paradox" and yet I am firmly per-
suaded that it would be easier at this day to give
a good taste to the young savages of America
to the noble youth of Europe |

INFLECTION.
75
2. INFLECTION.
The human voice is to be considered as a musical
instrument—an organ; constructed by the hand of the
Great Master of all Harmony. It has its bellows, its
pipe, its mouth-piece; and when we know the "stops"
it will discourse most eloquent music." It has its ga-
mut, or scale of ascent and descent; it has its keys, or
pitch,-its tones,-its semi-tones, its bass, its tenor, its
alt-its melody, its cadence. It can speak as gently
as the lute, "like the sweet south upon a bed of vio-
lets," or as shrilly as the trumpet; it can tune the
"silver-sweet" note of love, and "the iron throat of
war;" in fine, it may be modulated by art to any
sound of softness or of strength, of gentleness or harsh-
ness, of harmony or discord. And the art that wins
this music from the strings is ELOCUTION. The nice-
ties and refinements of this art are to be acquired, step
by step, by well-directed practice.
At present, let us learn a simple ascent, (or rise,)
and descent, (or fall,) of the voice; of the range of—
say one tone in music, upwards or downwards. This
ascent or descent of the voice is called by Elocution-
ists, INFLECTION,* and they have two
SIMPLE INFLECTIONS.
The rising inflection, marked with the acute accent thus
on the inflected word.

The student may always, at will, strike these in-
flections with certainty by asking himself the follow-
ing question, (which can hardly be spoken without
making the inflections distinctly, as they are marked :)
EXAMPLE.
Did I rise or fall?
In which the rising inflection occurs on the word rise, and the
falling inflection on the word fall. It can therefore never be
forgotten, and may serve as a mnemonic or key to these two
simple inflections.
This and similar questions run on an ascending and descend-
ing scale of the voice, which may be thus marked:
Do I
rise
or fall?
In which the voice descends on " Do I,”—ascends on
"rise,"
the pitch being at the highest on "or," when the voice imme-
diately descends on "fall."
pitch from low to high, is doubtless accent. We derive the
grave and acute accents from the Greeks, who, it is supposed,
used them to denote the slides of the voice from grave to sharp,
or low to high; so that, it is believed that the speeches of their
orators were marked, almost as minutely as a musical score, for
the direction of the voice. But the term accent has, by cus-
tom, now grown to be so constantly applied to stress upon a
syllable, that I prefer to adopt the less technically correct, but
equally intelligible term, inflection, to denote the slides of the
voice; and to use the term accent in its present popularly re-
ceived sense.


## p. 77 (#83) ##############################################

INFLECTION.
77
This ascent of the voice, or rising inflection, varies
in its range from one tone to three. The pitch in-
creases as the force of the speaker increases. In or-
dinary speech, where no particular force is given,—in
a perfectly indifferent question, for example,-the rise
would not be more than of one tone: as,
"Will my brother come?
asked quite indifferently, would receive an ascent of
one tone asked with interest, would receive an as-
cent of three tones; asked eagerly, would rise five
tones; and asked with a passionate expression, or of
surprise, would rise even an octave; but, in reading
or speaking with any degree of force, the simple ris-
ing inflection is usually over an interval of three tones,
(a third); and the descent of the falling inflection
is over the same interval. And the change of pitch is
discrete; that is, the voice leaps directly and abruptly
from tone to tone; whereas, in the greater ascent of a
fifth, and an octave, it is concrete; that is, it slides
over the interval, slurring the intermediate tones:
this distinction will be more fully explained under the
head of compound inflections.
To facilitate and familiarise to the pupil's ear and voice the
distinction between the rising and falling inflection, let him
practise the tonic sounds, upon the following plan, of rising and
falling on each.

This practice will be of great service in improving the pitch
of the voice, and giving it facility and pliability. The student
should therefore practise it till he can strike the third, rising and
falling, clearly, forcibly, and with certainty.

INFLECTION.

INFLECTIONS TO MARK THE SENSE.
The popular or common direction-drop your voice
at the end of a sentence-is illogical and false; and is
the cause of a very general bad habit with young
readers, and one which they seldom shake off in after-
life except under good instruction,-that of letting the
voice sink in pitch and tone and fulness on the con-
cluding word or words of every sentence; the effect
of which is, that the last words of a sentence which
are essential to complete the whole sense,-and with-
out which the auditor can only guess at the speaker's
meaning, are not heard at all; or, if even heard, are
deprived of all force, by the listless manner in which
they fall from the mouth. This is, of all things, to be
avoided. The last words of a sentence are as impor-
tant as the first,—indeed, they are generally more so:
therefore let them have always full enunciation and
weight in delivery; or your meaning will be imper-
fect and uncertain.
The inflection proper to the close of a sentence de-
pends upon the form or nature of that sentence: whe-
ther it be affirmative,-negative, or interrogative; or
whether the full sense be complete or suspended; for,
as a principle, the rising inflection is the mark of in-
complete sense, as the falling inflection denotes the
close or completion of the sense of a sentence; and
the inflection required is regulated by the condition of
the sense.

Sentences containing a simple unqualified affirmative are
marked with the falling inflection: as,
I wrote because it amused me. I corrected, because it
was as pleasant to correct as to write.
2. NEGATIVE sense
is marked with the rising inflection: as,
The quality of mercy is not strained.
It is not a book I want.
Note that in this form of sentence the rising inflection is to
be placed on the word or thing negatived; the negative parti-
cle not has usually a falling inflection, for force.
From the above rules it follows, that
In a sentence containing an affirmative in one
branch of it, and a negative or denial in the other,

Departures from the above general rules of inflec-
tion for simple, direct sentences, are occasionally made
for force and effect under the power of emphasis,-
which will be presently explained.
BODY OF A SENTENCE-SUSPENSION OF VOICE-
INFLECTION.
There is a distinction to be observed between sus-
pension of voice ;—by which I mean, holding the voice

which, as we have seen, is an actual ascent of the voice.

course of formation; and the full close of the sense
of a sentence, leaving nothing to be added or sup
posed, is denoted by the falling inflection. This is
clear from the preceding rules: and holds good as to
simple sentences; i. e. sentences not having several
members intervening (and requiring variety of inflec-
tion) between the commencement and the close of
the period.
GENERAL RULES.
1. The voice must be suspended till it take an inflection
under some rule; and the last word of the suspended sense
-immediately preceding that on which the formation of com-
plete sense begins-must be marked with a distinct rising
inflection.
This inflection, at this point of the sentence, accompanied by
the middle pause, serves to divide a simple sentence into two
parts; the opening, or incomplete part, and the closing, or per-
fect part.-(See Rule 1, of Middle Pause, p. 66.)
2. If the sense be completed before the close of the period,
the falling inflection must mark it; and this, even if many
other words and members follow-provided their addition do
not vary or qualify (though they may explain and strengthen)
the previous meaning.
EXAMPLES.
1. Grace of manners is so essential to princes-
that, whenever it is neglected, their virtues lose a great
degree of lustre.
2. The rule itself is an example in point; at the words, ' mark
it' and 'follow'; and the following sentence-

ART OF ELOCUTION.
This proposition was, however, rejected,
and not merely rejected" but rejected with insult.
The perfect understanding of the preceding rules of
simple inflection-which are the basis of all that will
follow is essential before advancing a step further.
Their application tends much to correct that un-
meaning sameness or monotony so common to readers
in general, and so tiresome to the ear: and when, to
the practice of these rules, is added that of the doctrine
of rhetorical pause, the style is at once indued with
meaning, life, and a pleasing variety. This is the
first step towards the MUSIC OF ELOCUTION.
COMPOUND INFLECTIONS.
There are also compound or double inflections,-
consisting of a concrete slide ascending or descending,
and embracing five and even eight tones,-that is, a
full octave-under the influence of strong feeling, ex-
pression, or energy. These inflections are fully
treated of hereafter in Part III. of 2d Division.
Before we enter upon the intricacies and variations
of inflection necessary to long, or particularly-con-
structed periods, let us for the present proceed to the
third principle under our second division, viz.


## p. 85 (#91) ##############################################

EMPHASIS.
85
3. EMPHASIS
is a word of Greek origin and form, adopted in its
original spelling (suparis) into our language; its deri-
vation is sv (on) and în (to speak), or qarış (speech):
according to which, therefore, emphasis strictly signi-
fies a speaking (strongly) upon; or, as it is popularly
called, a stress of the voice upon a certain word (or
words) to which a particular meaning or force is at-
tached, and particular attention desired: and this is
called the emphatic word; (I denote it by this line
written under the word,) thus:
He spoke for religion, not against it.
This book is mine, that yours.
In the utterance of the above sentences, the words
marked as emphatic receive an impulsive or explo-
sive force of sound, which distinguishes their power
and importance above the other words. Just in the
same manner as what we call the accented syllable
in any word is marked by stress, or stroke of sound,
from the other syllables with which it is combined: as
in the words
vir-tue, mer-ciful, pól-icy, resolu-tion, con-stancy,
in which the stress, or impulse of sound, is thrown on
to one particular syllable, which is popularly called

ART OF ELOCUTION.
the accented,* but more properly, the heavy syllable,
in contradistinction to the light or (as they are called)
unaccented syllables, which have no weight of sound,
or stress upon them: so, in a sentence, the stress or
emphasis being thrown by an impulse of sound on
any particular word, that word is called the emphatic
word. And, in fact, this emphasis, when applied to a
word, falls always on the accented or heavy syllable
of the word, doubling the stress upon it. We shall
presently see that emphasis requires, to be complete,
not only stress, but inflection; and that that inflection
is governed by the character of the emphasis.
But, first, it is proper to observe here the distinc-
tion between our language and that of the Greeks
and Romans, who measured the march of their lan-
guage by quantity, of long or short J syllables:
and all the words of their language had a certain
and fixed prosodial quantity; according to which
their verses are supposed to have been constructed
and scanned or measured. Our language, on the
contrary, acknowledges no fixed and certain quan-
tity to its syllables; the distinction between which is
of light and heavy, not of long and short: for the
length or time of utterance to be given to a word or
syllable in our language, is regulated not by any fixed
prosodial rule (to which it is not amenable,) but by
other circumstances of a varying nature, as, its force
and value to the sense,-or the amount of feeling that
is to be conveyed by or upon it; so that in our versi-
* See "Inflection," and Note to page 75.

87
fication, it constantly happens that, in its relative pro-
portion in a line, the same word is sometimes long,
sometimes short; and indeed, it will be manifest to
any ear, that monosyllables, such as care, there, loud,
bold, &c. may be prolonged at will to any indefinite
time, so as to give to them the quantity of a quaver, a
crotchet, a minim, or even a semibreve. This clearly
does away with the idea of a settled rule of quantity
in our language; the rhythmus (or order) of which is
governed by another principle, that of the regular ar-
rangement of heavy and light sounds, or syllables ;
and this it is, not quantity, which makes the rhythm
of English versification. This will be more fully
treated of under the head of " Time," in the chapter de-
voted to the Reading of Verse.
Here it is necessary to remark, that there is a certain
rhythmical, or measured, movement even in prose;
not so regularly preserved as in verse, but still re-
quiring to be noted and marked in reading.
In some elaborate compositions, indeed, where the
cadences are very regular, the rhythm and time are
preserved with great exactness; and it is a great
beauty in elocution to mark them by the pulsation
and remission of the voice, on the heavy and light
syllables respectively, and by a due observance of
time or measure.
Take, as an example, the following, by Dr. John-
son, in common time: The notation is only to show
the time, and the barring marks the rhythmical ac-
centuation:

In this example I have marked the accented or heavy sylla-
bles which require pulsation of voice; and it will be observed
that the first note of the bar is always accented, or its place is
supplied by a rest, or pause, which, with the other notes, fills
up the cadence, and completes the bar; for rests, or pauses, are
as essential a part of the rhythm as the notes themselves, and,
in verse especially, it is on their due and proportionate observ-
ance, as well as of the heavy and light syllables, that rhythm
depends. All this is more fully explained hereafter: but I
thought thus much, on the subject of quantity and stress, (or
accent,) necessary to be remarked before proceeding with Em-
phasis, of which stress is an essential constituent.
The power of emphasis to strengthen or change the
meaning of any sentence is very great; and its proper
use in delivery adds greatly to the point and power of
a discourse; hence some orators are called emphatic
speakers, when it is intended that their style is pointed
and forcible. But Emphasis is not merely stress or
weight of voice: it is made up of stress and inflection;
accordingly,
EMPHASIS is stress and inflection of voice.
There are two principal kinds of Emphasis-
1. Emphasis of sense.
2. Emphasis of force.
1. Emphasis of sense is that emphasis which marks
and indicates the meaning or sense of the sentence;
and which being transferred from word to word, has

power to change and vary the particular meaning of
such sentence. In other words, it is the placing on
the particular word which carries the main point of the
sentence, or member of the sentence, the inflection.
due to such sentence or member, and giving weight or
emphasis to such inflection :-the word so marked and
distinguished is called the emphatic word.
To make the emphasis of sense, throw the inflection proper
to the sentence, or member of it, on the emphatic word; and
give weight or stress on that inflection.
or
Thus-
The following interrogative sentence requires the rising in-
flection. Now, by placing that inflection on any one word, and
at the same time giving weight or stress to that inflection-the
sense will be emphasized on that particular word; and as the
emphasis of sense is changed from word to word, the point of
the sense will be varied accordingly.

tion and meaning of a sentence, or member of it, on
some particular word: and the inflection is rising or
falling according to the rule applicable to the particu-
lar sentence, or member of it, in which that word
occurs.
There are branches of the emphasis of sense, inci-
dental to particular rules of inflection, as
Antithetical Emphasis-
Emphasis with pronominal phrase, &c.
of which I shall speak under the proper heads.
2. Emphasis of force (or it might be called Empha-
sis of feeling,) is that emphasis or stress which a
speaker uses arbitrarily to add force to some particu-
lar idea or expression; not because the sense or mean-
ing intended to be conveyed requires it,-but because
the force of his own feeling dictates it.
RULE.
The emphasis of force is always made with the falling in-
flection; whatever may be the inflection proper to the sentence,
without such emphasis.
EXAMPLES.
Could you be so cruel?
Could you be so cruel?
I did not say so.
These sentences-interrogative and negative-by ordinary
Rule, would have the rising inflection; ; but the emphasis of
force being placed on the word could, or cruel, and not, gives

them the falling inflection: without at all affecting the sense.
-though it gives force to the idea conveyed by the words.
Bear in mind, therefore, that this emphasis of force,
when it is made, is independent of and paramount to
all general rule of inflection; which it controls and
over-rules.
Emphasis of force is sometimes doubled, as—
Could you be so cruel?
In which, the force is thrown on two words, and expresses as
much as if the speaker said,
Can it be possible that you are what I consider so shock-
ingly cruel!
There is also CUMULATIVE or accumulated empha-
sis of force; that is, when the emphasis is heaped or
accumulated on several words in succession, as
I tell you, I will not do it; nothing on earth shall persuade
me.
This is the strongest expression of force. I shall
have occasion to illustrate it more fully hereafter.—

"PRESS ON."
THIS is a speech, brief, but full of inspiration and
opening the way to all victory. The mystery of Na-
poleon's career was this,-under all difficulties and
discouragements, "PRESS ON !" It solves the problem
of all heroes, it is the rule by which to weigh, rightly,
all wonderful successes and triumphal marches to for-
tune and genius. It should be the motto of all, old
and young, high and low, fortunate and unfortunate,
so called.
"PRESS ON!" Never despair; never be discour-
aged, however stormy the heavens, however dark the
way; however great the difficulties, and repeated the
failures, "PRESS ON !"
If fortune has played false with thee to-day, do
thou play true for thyself to-morrow. If thy riches
have taken wings and left thee, do not weep thy life
away; but be up and doing, and retrieve the loss by
new energies and action. If an unfortunate bargain
has deranged thy business, do not fold thy arms, and

give up all as lost; but stir thyself and work the more
vigorously.
If those whom thou hast trusted have betrayed
thee, do not be discouraged, do not idly weep, but
"PRESS ON!" find others; or, what is better, learn to
live within thyself. Let the foolishness of yesterday
make thee wise to-day. If thy affections have been
poured out like water in the desert, do not sit down
and perish of thirst, but press on; a beautiful oasis is
before thee, and thou mayst reach it if thou wilt. If
another has been false to thee, do not thou increase
the evil by being false to thyself. Do not say the
world hath lost its poetry and beauty; 'tis not so;
and even if it be so, make thine own poetry and
beauty by a brave, a true, and, above all, a religious
life.
STORM AT SEA.
THE storm increased with the night. The sea was
lashed into tremendous confusion. There was a fear-
ful, sullen sound of rushing waves and broken surges.
Deep called unto deep. At times, the black volume
of clouds over-head seemed rent asunder by flashes
of lightning that quivered along the foaming billows,
and made the succeeding darkness doubly terrible.
The thunders bellowed over the wide waste of waters,
and were echoed and prolonged by the mountain
waves. As I saw the ship staggering and plunging
among these roaring caverns, it seemed miraculous
that she regained her balance, or preserved her buoy-

ancy. Her yards would dip in the water; her bow
was almost buried beneath the waves. Sometimes,
an impending surge appeared ready to overwhelm
her, and nothing but a dexterous movement of the
helm preserved her from the shock.
When I retired to my cabin, the awful scene still
followed me. The whistling of the wind through the
rigging sounded like funeral wailings. The creaking
of the masts, the straining and groaning of bulk-heads,
as the ship labored in the weltering sea, were frightful.
As I heard the waves rushing along the side of the
ship, and roaring in my very ear, it seemed as if Death
were raging round this floating prison, seeking for his
prey; the mere starting of a nail, the yawning of a
seam, might give him entrance.

DANTE-MILTON.
THE character of Milton was peculiarly distin-
guished by loftiness of thought; that of Dante by in-
tensity of feeling. In every line of the Divine Comedy
we discern the asperity which is produced by pride
struggling with misery. There is perhaps no work
in the world so deeply and uniformly sorrowful. The
melancholy of Dante was no fantastic caprice. It
was not, as far as at this distance of time can be
judged, the effect of external circumstances. It was
from within. Neither love nor glory, neither the con-
flicts of the earth, nor the hope of heaven, could dispel
it. It twined every consolation and every pleasure

into its own nature.
It resembled that noxious Sardi-
nian soil of which the intense bitterness is said to have
been perceptible even in its honey. His mind was,
in the noble language of the Hebrew poet, "a land of
darkness, as darkness itself, and where the light was
as darkness!" The gloom of his character discolors
all the passions of men, and all the face of nature, and
tinges with its own livid hue the flowers of paradise
and the Glories of the Eternal Throne. All the por-
traits of him are singularly characteristic. No person
can look on the features, noble even to ruggedness,
the dark furrows of the cheek, the haggard and woeful
stare of the eye, the sullen and contemptuous curve of
the lip, and doubt that they belonged to a man too
proud and too sensitive to be happy.
Milton was, like Dante, a statesman and a lover;
and, like Dante, he had been unfortunate in ambition
and in love. He had survived his health and his
sight, the comforts of his home and the prosperity of
his party. Of the great men by whom he had been
distinguished on his entrance into life, some had been
taken away from the evil to come; some had carried
into foreign climates their unconquerable hatred of op-
pression; some were pining in dungeons; and some
had poured forth their blood on scaffolds. That hate-
ful proscription-facetiously termed the act of indem-
nity and oblivion--had set a mark on the poor, blind,
deserted poet, and held him up by name to the hatred
of a profligate Court and an inconstant people. Ve-

reign and the public. It was a loathsome herd-
which could be compared to nothing, so fitly, as to the
rabble of Comus-grotesque monsters, half bestial,
half human,-dropping with wine, bloated with glut-
tony, and reeling in obscene dances. Amidst these his
Muse was placed, like the chaste lady of the Masque,
lofty, spotless and serene-to be chatted at, and point-
ed at, and grinned at, by the whole tribe of Satyrs and
Goblins.
If ever despondency could be excused in any man,
it might have been excused in Milton. But the strength
of his mind overcame every calamity. Neither blind-
ness, nor gout, nor penury, nor age, nor domestic af-
flictions, nor political disappointments, nor abuse, nor
proscription, nor neglect, had power to disturb his se-
date and majestic patience. His spirits do not seem
to have been high, but they were singularly equable.
His temper was serious, perhaps stern; but it was a
temper which no sufferings could render sullen or fret-
ful. Such as it was, when on the eve of great events
he returned from his travels, in the prime of health
and manly beauty, loaded with literary distinctions
and glowing with patriotic hopes, such it continued to
be—when, after having experienced every calamity
which is incident to our nature, old, poor, sightless,
and disgraced, he retired to his hovel to die!

PART II.
INFLECTION (continued).
We have hitherto considered the inflections proper
to simple sentences only. We now proceed to some
SPECIAL RULES OF INFLECTION,
proper to periods of peculiar form and more elaborate
construction; and to the different members or branches
of which they may be composed.
1. APPOSITION.-2. ANTITHESIS.
1. APPOSITION in meaning and construction requires
the apposition to be marked by inflection; that is-
RULE.
Words, or phrases, in apposition with each other, take the
same respective inflections;-unless any of them be made em-
phatic for force.
EXAMPLES.
I reside in New York-a magnificent city.
And now abideth faith, hope, charity-these three.


## p. 100 (#106) ############################################

100
ART OF ELOCUTION.
2. ANTITHESIS, or opposition of meaning, requires
antithesis of inflection; that is,
RULE.
Words or phrases in antithesis to each other take opposite
inflections.
EXAMPLES.
He spoke for, not against peace.
As fire is opposed to water, so is vice to virtue.
We seek not peace, but war; and we shall fight, not pray;
for we had rather die than live.
The above are examples of single antithesis.
DOUBLE ANTITHESIS.
In the following, the antithesis is double; that is,
of several opposite ideas, and consequently opposite
inflections.
EXAMPLE.
Rational liberty is directly opposed to the wildness of anarchy.
(Here rational is in antithesis to wildness, and
liberty to anarchy: the inflections on each respectively
are therefore also opposed.)
FURTHER EXAMPLES.
If you seek to make one rich, study not to increase his stores,
but to diminish his desires.-Seneca.


## p. 101 (#107) ############################################

ANTITHESIS.
101
The peasant complains aloud; the courtier in secret repines.
In want, what distress! in affluence, what satiety ! The
ignorant, through ill-grounded hope, are disappointed; the
knowing, through knowledge, despond.-Young.
All flesh is not the same flesh; but there is one kind of flesh
of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another
of birds.
There are also celestial bodies, and bodies terrestrial: but
the glory of the celestial is one, and the glory of the terrestrial
is another.-1 Cor. c. 15.
Note also the melody that is produced to the ear by this anti-
thetical alternation of inflection; which thus has the effect, not
only of logically increasing the force and power of the contrast
of ideas, by contrast of pitch, but, at the same time, of pleasing
the ear by an agreeable variety of tone.
IMPLIED ANTITHESIS.
Antithesis may be implied, when not expressed; in which •
case the sense is left unfinished, (as it were,) and, consequently,
is marked with the rising inflection.
EXAMPLES.
He is a good boy, James.
(Implying that some other boy is a bad one.)
You ask too much money; I'll give you a dollar.
(Implying, "but not any more.")
I'd give a hundred dollars for such a horse as that.
(Implying, "but not for an inferior one.")

ART OF ELOCUTION.
Presumptuous man! the Gods take care of Cato!
(Implying, “more immediately than of other men.")
THE APPOSITION OF ANTITHESIS.
Words in antithesis to each other, may form an an-
tithetical member in apposition with a succeeding an-
tithesis; in which case both the preceding rules of in-
flection apply that is,
:
RULE.
The words in antithesis have opposite inflections; the anti-
thetical members in apposition have respectively the same in-
flections.
EXAMPLE.
Fire and water are not more opposed than vice and virtue
(Here, fire and water are in antithesis,—so are vice
and virtue; but the antithetical phrase fire and water
is clearly in apposition with the phrase vice and vir-
tue; the above rule applies.)
EMPHASIS OF ANTITHESIS.
(See ante, EMPHASIS OF SENSE.)
Words and members in antithesis are (as a general rule)
marked by the emphasis of sense; that is, the inflections are
marked with additional weight;-this emphasis may be desig-
nated as Antithetical Emphasis.
But the emphasis of force is sometimes used in one member
of the antithesis to give additional strength to it.
The antithesis is so frequent, and at the same time

so powerful a form of Rhetoric, that it deserves the
best attention of the Elocutionist; and he should
therefore make himself thoroughly master of this
branch of our subject.
(See SERIES-Antithetical Series.)
INVERTED SENTENCES.
RULE.
In an inverted sentence, the inverted members take the inflec-
tions respectively proper, in the direct sentence, to the mem-
bers in whose place they stand.
EXAMPLE.
Direct. He strictly enforces both by precept and example-
the laws of religion and morality inculcated in the
Gospel.
Inverted. The laws of religion and morality inculcated in
the Gospel he strictly enforces both by precept
and example.
EXCEPTION.
The only exception to this rule is made by the Emphasis of
force, the inflection of which is paramount, and never changes,
however much the position of the word on which it falls, may
be changed by inversion.
EXAMPLE.
Direct. Our sight is the most perfect of all our senses.


## p. 104 (#110) ############################################

104
ART OF ELOCUTION.
Inverted. Of all our senses our sight is the most perfect.
Or,
The most perfect of all our senses is our sight.
Here, by throwing the Emphasis of force upon the word
sight, we mark it strongly on the hearer's mind; and supposing
that to be the speaker's object, no transposition of the word will
relieve it from that Emphasis. But if it be merely an indiffer-
ent and abstract remark, it would be subject to the above rule as
to inversion, and be thus marked:
Our sight is the most perfect of all our senses.
Of all our senses, our sight is the most perfect.
The most perfect of all our senses is our sight.
CONDITIONAL SENTENCES.
The addition of a condition to an affirmative, re-
quires the rising inflection; which marks the uncer-
tainty raised by the condition attached, as-
He said he would call if you would consent to see him.
He shall live, if I have power to save him.
Doctrines must be embodied, before they can excite strong
public feeling.
Observe that the simple affirmative in this form of sentence
retains the falling inflection; it is the condition that receives
the rise.

or suspension of the sense of the main sentence, (as
is manifest from the derivation-raga-sv-Tiên); and
therefore members which are added to the sentence
after the sense is completed, are not parenthetical
(although they may be marked in parenthesis), but
rather cata-thetical-if such a word may be used-
The very sentence I have just written furnishes an
illustration of the distinction I wish to make; in
which, the first passage marked in parenthesis is not
(strictly) a parenthesis, for it does not suspend or in-
terrupt-though it confirms and explains the preceding
part of the main sentence; but the second passage
marked in parenthesis is correctly so marked, for it
interrupts and suspends the sense of the main sen-
tence. Again, the last phrase in the same sentence—
marked between two dashes-occurring at the close
of the main sense, is not parenthetical (though it
might be marked ordinarily in parenthesis), but
rather cata-thetical that is, tacked to the main
sentence.
But in common use and acceptation, all the above
phrases would be called parenthetical,-without re-
ference to their being an interruption of, or merely an
addition to, the sense; and therefore I shall arrange
the Elocutionary rules for reading parenthesis accord-
ing to the common and popular definition of the term.
Hence the following
RULES.
1. A parenthesis must have its commencement and continu-
auce indicated by a change to a somewhat lower tone of voice


## p. 107 (#113) ############################################

PARENTHESIS.
107
and a quicker movement; and the close of the parenthesis is
marked by a return to the same time, pitch and inflection of
voice as the sense had at the point immediately preceding the
parenthesis: so that,
2. If the sense of the main sentence be suspended and inter-
rupted by parenthesis, its close shall be marked with the rising
inflection: if the sense of the main sentence be complete, the
parenthesis shall be closed with the falling inflection.
NOTE. The more logical form of these rules would be thus-
If the parenthetical members suspend the sense, they shall be
read with suspension: if they do not, they shall be read as in-
dependent members.
EXAMPLES.
1. Parenthesis suspending the sense.
Gentlemen, if I make out this case by evidence, (and if I
do not, forget every thing you have heard, and reproach me for
having abused your honest feelings,) I have established a claim
for damages that has no parallel.-Erskine.
If there's a Power above, (and that there is
All nature cries aloud in all her works,)
He must delight in virtue.
2. Parenthesis-in addition without a suspension.
Now the works of the flesh are manifest,-which are these,
&c.
I hope to be pardoned for yielding to this high authority, in
preference to submitting my judgment to the opinion of those
who now deny the power (however respectable that opinion
may be.)

ART OF ELOCUTION.
EXCEPTION.
This rule is (like all others) subject to be varied by the in-
flection of the Emphasis of force-which, occurring in the pa-
renthesis, over-rules the inflection proper to suspension; as in
the following passage from Mr. Burke's speech on the impeach-
ment of Warren Hastings:
EXAMPLE.
Growing from crime to crime, ripened by cruelty for cruelty,
these fiends, at length, outraging sex, decency, nature, applied
lighted torches and slow fire-(I cannot proceed for shame and
horror!)-these infernal furies planted death in the source of
life, &c.
Here, though the sense is suddenly broken and suspended by
the introduction of the parenthesis, yet, as the closing phrase of
that parenthesis is marked with the emphasis of force, it is an
exception to the general rule, which would otherwise require a
rising inflection to mark the suspension of the sense.
PRONOUNS-PRONOMINAL PHRASE.
We are taught in Grammar that a pronoun is used
to avoid the repetition of a noun.
In Elocution, when the noun is repeated, and the use
of the pronoun rejected, we call the word so repeated
pronominal; that is, of the nature, or in place of a
pronoun; as,
He advanced the doctrine; he maintained the doctrine; he
propagated the doctrine.
In this example, "the doctrine," in every instance


## p. 109 (#115) ############################################

PRONOMINAL PHRASE.
109
of its repetition, is clearly pronominal; standing in
place of the pronoun "it." For, according to the
usual construction of such a sentence, it would have
stood-
He advanced the doctrine; he maintained it; he propagated it.
Hence, being so nearly of the same nature, they fol-
low the same rule of Elocution: viz.
RULE.
Pronouns and pronominal phrases have no proper inflection;
but merge in that of the inflected word with which they stand.
EXAMPLES.
(The pronouns and pronominal phrases are in brackets.)
Henry told [me] the truth [about it].
I asked [him] if he had finished [it].
[It] struck [me] that I had seen [him] before.
In these sentences, the pronouns have no inflection;
but are subjected to, and over-ridden by the inflection
of the word which governs them, or to which they are
immediately allied. So of a pronominal phrase.
EXAMPLES.
As you have shown mercy, you shall receive [mercy].
Your cruelty merits [cruelty].
Your goodness deserves [goodness].
He repaid your kindness with [kindness].
We observe that the pronominal phrase in each in-

stance follows the rule on the pronoun; and is sub-
jected to the inflection of the verb or preposition by
which it is governed.
Except
Demonstrative and interrogative pronouns ;* and pronouns or
pronominal phrases when emphatic: as,
This is my book, not that.
Who said so? What did he say ?
Henry told me the truth.
I warned him: he saved me.
He is a good boy James.
COMMON PHRASE (quasi pronominal.)
The same rule applies to the repetition of any phrase which
is common to two or more verbs, adverbs, &c. Such repeated
common phrase is read as pronominal.
EXAMPLES.
He speaks truly, and [he speaks] wisely.
It was truly said, and wisely [said].
If we live in the spirit, let us also walk [in the spirit].
PRONOMINAL PHRASE in reply.
The rule holds, also, on repetition of a common phrase in re-
ply, in dialogue, or in reference to previously spoken words by
another party.
* Pronouns of these two classes are generally emphatic, and
therefore the exception.


## p. 111 (#117) ############################################

PRONOMINAL PHRASE-EMPHASIS.
111
EXAMPLE.
Question. Is that your firm opinion?
Reply. It is [my firm opinion.]
Nor need the repetition be literal; if the idea or sense be re-
peated, the phrase is read as pronominal.
EXAMPLE.
The gentleman boasts that he is actuated by motives the
most pure and honorable. Sir, the boast is needless; Who
questioned" [his integrity and honor]?
EMPHASIS with pronominal phrase.
It will be observed that the verb or other word
governing, or in conjunction with, the pronominal
phrase, becomes emphatic: this is made still more
clear in the case of a negative with such phrase.
EXAMPLES.
To be, or not to be?

Question. Why do you express yourself so angrily?
Reply. I did not [express myself angrily].
The gentleman insinuates that I have acted a double part,
and therefore forfeited the confidence of the house. Sir, if I
had [done so] 1 should deserve [to lose your confidence], but I
shall prove that I have not [acted as he says]; and therefore I
expect to retain [your good opinion], (or) to retain your good
opinion.

[See SERIES-Pronominal Series.]
SERIAL SENTENCES.
THE SERIES, in rhetoric, (a succession of words or
phrases linked together in construction,) constantly
occurs; its delivery puzzles the reader who has no
certain rule to guide him, and his, consequently,
confused and unconnected manner, in turn, puzzles
his hearers.
There are, therefore, Rules in Elocution for the de-
livery of serial sentences,-certain and easy.
FORM OF SERIES.
The Series is-(first),
1. SIMPLE.-2. COMPOUND.
1. Simple, when it consists of single words (or sin-
gle ideas) in succession.
2. Compound, when it is composed of members in
succession, each composed of several words-convey-
ing several ideas.
These, again, are—(second,)
1. COMMENCING.-2. CONcluding.
1. Commencing, when they commence a sentence,
or where the sense is unfinished at their close.

Contentment, happiness, and honor, are the reward of
an amiable disposition, virtuous principles, a liberal ed-
ucation, and industrious habits.
We have also the
Negative Series,
Interrogative Series,
Antithetical Series,
and other variations on the regular series, which we
shall take in their proper order.

DIVISION OF A LONG SIMPLE SERIES.
RULE.
When a simple series exceeds five members, avviae the whole
into two or more shorter series; and read the divisions accord-
ing to rule, marking each division with the middle pause.
སྐ
EXAMPLE.
The works of the flesh are manifest; which are these:
Adultery," fornication, uncleanness,lasciviousness,~-
idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance,
emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,
envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and
such like.-Gal.
ཡ
▾
In a series of so many members as this, the division
(as above) prevents that unpleasing and catalogue-
like monotony, which is produced by reading the
whole as one series, with an unbroken succession of
rising inflections. The division is of course arbitrary,
as to the number of members which may be allotted
to each division; but the object to be aimed at in the
separation of the members is a distinct classification;
so that things, objects or ideas, resembling or allied to
each other in quality or degree, shall be kept together,
and not be thrown in confusedly with others of a dif
ferent nature.
Now, in the above example, such a distinct classi-
fication is rendered difficult, if not impossible, to the
reader, by the absence of order and classification in
the passage itself. It may indeed be remarked, with

INFLECTION ON SERIES.
117
the greatest respect, that great confusion is caused to
the mind by the indiscriminately throwing together a
series of offences very widely differing from each
other in quality and degree; and the climax of the
whole is enfeebled, if not destroyed, by the addition of
"drunkenness and revellings," after the high crime of
murder. As that crime is the climax of the works of
the flesh, what follows weakens the effect, and is, in
fact, an anti-climax. I am now analyzing it merely as
a piece of composition; and for the purpose of making
my meaning more clear, suppose the passage to have
stood as follows:
The works of the flesh are manifest; which are these:
Fornication, adultery," uncleanness, lasciviousness,~_
witchcraft heresy idolatry
emulations™ envy™ variance™ hatred™
wrath strife seditions
revellings drunkenness murders
and such like.
By this arrangement, the classification of crime would
have been clear and perfect, gradually growing and
increasing in power up to the climax-murder,-the
last dread work of the flesh. And it is to aid this lo-
gical arrangement, classification and progression, that
the rules for reading the series are given. In the fol-
lowing series the classification is distinct and perfect
as it is written, and it will be felt that the elocution-
ary arrangement and inflections very much aid it:

EXERCISES ON SERIES.
119
Besides the inflections proper to a series, increasing
force should be given to the delivery of each addition-
al member; so that the sound and volume of voice
shall swell and increase in the same proportion as the
sense grows and is amplified,-until both reach the
climax together. This will be more fully explained
and illustrated in the Third Division, under the head
of INTONATION. The reader may now practise the
following
EXERCISE ON SERIES.
1. If you look about you, and consider the lives of others as
well as your own; if you think how few are born with honor,
and how many die without name or children; how little beauty
we see, and how few friends we hear of; how many diseases
and how much poverty there is in the world;
you will fall down upon your knees;
and, instead of repining at one infliction, will admire
so many blessings you have received at the hand of God!
2. It was a loathsome herd,-which could be compared to
nothing so fitly as to the rabble of Comus,-
Grotesque monsters,-
half human, half bestial,-
dropping with wine,
bloated with gluttony,
and reeling in obscene dances.
3. This decency, this grace, this propriety of manners to
character, is so essential to princes in particular, that, whenever
it is neglected, their virtues lose a great degree of lustre, and
their defects acquire much aggravation. Nay, more; by neg-

lecting this decency, and this grace, and for want of a suffici
ent regard to appearances, even their virtues may betray them
into failings, their failings into vices, and their vices into habits
unworthy of princes and of men.
NEGATIVE series: (as a simple concluding series.)
RULE.
A series of negative members is read with a rising inflection
on every member but the last: (note, that the inflection falls
on the word or thing negatived.)
EXAMPLE.
Charity envieth not charity vaunteth not itself is not puffed
up ;-
Doth not behave itself unseemly seeketh not her own is not
easily provoked thinketh no evil.-1 Cor. c. xiii.
INTERROGATIVE SERIES.
A series of interrogations may be read either
1. Under the rule for single Questions, see p. 81; or,
2. With the same inflections as simple concluding series; or,
3. As the compound concluding series.
It is well, in delivery, to vary them, when they occur fre-
quently, or when several series follow closely on each other.
For example, the following, from Romans, c. viii., admits of
being read under either of the three rules:
1. As single interrogations:
Who shall separate us from the cross of Christ? Shall


## p. 121 (#127) ############################################

ANTITHETICAL SERIES.
121
tribulation or distress or persecution or famine- or
nakedness or the sword?
Thus read, great and equal force is given to each interroga-
tion; but there is no climax.
2. With the same inflections as the simple concluding Series:
Shall tribulation
famine- or nakedness
or distress or persecution - or
or the sword?
Thus read, the climax is made, by the falling inflection, on
the sword; as if he said, or even the sword itself; that is, the
fiercest and bloodiest violence and persecution.
3. As the compound concluding Series:
Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or
famine or nakedness or the sword?
So read, it amounts to a declaration,-put interrogatively,—
that none of the evils enumerated are of power to separate the
Christian from the Cross;-and there is much force in this
reading.
I should, myself, prefer the second reading given, as convey-
ing the most forcible contempt for persecution. But the choice
is a matter of taste.
ANTITHETICAL SERIES.
[See ante," ANTITHESIS."]
An Antithetical Series-that is, a series of members in An-
tithesis-commencing or concluding—is read under the same
rules of inflection as the Compound Series; each perfect anti-
thesis-and not each branch of it-forming a member of the
series.


## p. 122 (#128) ############################################

EXAMPLES.
Antithetical Series-(single Antithesis)

Commencing. Fire and water oil and vinegar heat and cold
light and darkness
are not more opposed to each other, than is

Double Antithetical Series-(double Antithesis.)

Note. In this last species of Series, the middle pause has
place after each member; that is, after each perfect antithesis.

EXTRACT FROM A SPEECH OF THE HON. HENRY
CLAY, ON THE EMANCIPATION OF SOUTH
AMERICA.
THUS, upon the ground of strict right, upon the
footing of a mere legal question governed by forensic
rules, the Colonies, being absolved by the acts of the
parent country from the duty of subjection to it, had
an indisputable right to set up for themselves.
But, sir, I take a broader and a bolder position. I
maintain that an oppressed people are authorized,
whenever they can, to rise and break their fetters.
This was the great principle of the English revolu-
tion; it was the great principle of our own. We must
pass sentence of condemnation upon the founders of
our liberty-say that they were rebels, traitors-and
that we are, this moment, legislating without compe-
tent powers, before we can condemn the cause of
Spanish America. Our revolution was mainly direct-
ed against the mere theory of tyranny. Our intrepid
and intelligent fathers saw, in the usurpation of the

power to levy an inconsiderable tax, the long train of
oppressive acts that were to follow. They rose-they
breasted the storm-they achieved our freedom!
Spanish America, for centuries, has been doomed to
the practical effects of an odious tyranny. If we were
justified, she is more than justified.
I am no propagandist. I would not seek to force
upon other nations our principles and our liberty, if
they do not want them. I would not disturb the re-
pose even of a detestable despotism. But if an abused
and oppressed people will their freedom; if they seek
to establish it; if, in truth, they have established it,
we have a right, as a sovereign power, to notice the
fact, and to act as circumstances and our interest re-
quire. I will say, in the language of the venerated
father of my country, "Born in a land of liberty, my
anxious recollections, my sympathetic feelings, and
my best wishes, are irresistibly excited, whensoever, in
any country, I see an oppressed nation unfurl the ban-
ners of freedom." Whenever I think of Spanish
America, the image irresistibly forces itself upon my
mind of an elder brother whose education has been
neglected, whose person has been abused and mal-
treated, and who has been disinherited by the unkind-
ness of an unnatural parent. And when I contemplate
the glorious struggle which that country is now
making, I think I behold that brother rising by the
power and energy of his fine native genius to the
manly rank which nature and nature's God intended
for him.

ART OF ELOCUTION.
THE MATERIAL AND SPIRITUAL IN POETRY.
Of all the poets who have introduced into their
works the agency of supernatural beings, Milton has
succeeded best. Here Dante decidedly yields to him.
And, as this is a point on which many rash and ill-
considered judgments have been pronounced, we feel
inclined to dwell on it a little longer. The most fatal
error which a poet can possibly commit in the man-
agement of his machinery, is that of attempting to
philosophize too much. Milton has been often cen-
sured for ascribing to spirits many functions of which
spirits must be incapable. But these objections, though
sanctioned by eminent names, originate (we venture
to say) in profound ignorance of the art of poetry.
What is spirit? What are our own minds-the portion
of spirit with which we are best acquainted? We ob-
serve certain phenomena. We cannot explain them
into material causes: we, therefore, infer that there
exists something which is not material. But of this
something we have no idea. We can define it only
by negatives. We can reason about it only by sym-
bols. We use the word, but we have no image of the
thing and the business of poetry is with images, and
not with words. The poet uses words, indeed; but
they are merely instruments of his art, not its objects.
They are the materials which he is to dispose in such
a manner as to present a picture to the mental eye.
And if they are not so disposed, they are no more en-

titled to be called poetry, than a bale of canvas and a
box of colors are to be called a painting.
Logicians may reason about abstractions, but the
great mass of mankind can never feel an interest in
them. They must have images. The strong tendency
of the multitude, in all ages and nations, to idolatry,
can be explained on no other principle. The first in-
habitants of Greece, there is every reason to believe,
worshipped an invisible Deity. But the necessity of
having something more definite to adore, produced, in
a few centuries, the innumerable crowd of gods and
goddesses. The history of the Jews is the record of
a continual struggle between pure Theism, supported
by the most terrible sanctions, and the strangely fas-
cinating desire of having some visible and tangible
object of adoration. Perhaps none of the secondary
causes which Gibbon has assigned for the rapidity
with which Christianity spread over the world—
while Judaism scarcely ever acquired a proselyte-
operated more powerfully than this feeling. God, the
uncreated, the incomprehensible, the invisible, attract-
ed few worshippers. A philosopher might admire so
noble a conception; but the crowd turned away in
disgust from words which presented no image to their
minds. It was before Deity, embodied in a human
form, walking among men, partaking of their infirmi-
ties, leaning on their bosoms, weeping over their
graves, slumbering in the manger, bleeding on the
Cross, that the prejudices of the synagogue, and the
doubts of the academy, and the pride of the portico,

legions, were humbled in the dust!" Soon after
Christianity had achieved its triumph, the principles
which had assisted it began to corrupt. It became a
new Paganism. Patron saints assumed the offices of
household gods. St. George took the place of Mars.
St. Elmo consoled the mariner for the loss of Castor
and Pollux. The Virgin Mother and Cecilia succeed-
ed to Venus and the Muses. The fascination of sex
and loveliness was again joined to that of celestial dig-
nity; and the homage of chivalry was blended with
that of religion. Reformers have often made a stand
against these feelings; but never with more than ap-
parent and partial success. The men who demolished
the images in cathedrals have not always been able
to demolish those which were enshrined in their
minds. It would not be difficult to show that in poli-
tics the same rule holds good. Doctrines, we are
afraid, must be embodied before they can excite strong
public feeling. The multitude is more easily interest-

From these considerations, we infer, that no poet
who should affect that metaphysical accuracy for the
want of which Milton has been blamed, would escape
a disgraceful failure.— Macauley.
EVIDENCE AND PRECEDENTS IN LAW.
BEFORE you can adjudge a fact, you must believe
it ;-not suspect it, or imagine it, or fancy it,--but be-
lieve it and it is impossible to impress the human
mind with such a reasonable and certain belief, as is
necessary to be impressed, before a Christian man can
adjudge his neighbor to the smallest penalty, much
less to the pains of death, without having such evi-
dence as a reasonable mind will accept of as the in-
fallible test of truth. And what is that evidence ?-
Neither more nor less than that which the Constitu-
tion has established in the courts for the general
administration of justice: namely, that the evidence
convince the jury, beyond all reasonable doubt, that
the criminal intention, constituting the crime, existed
in the mind of the man upon trial, and was the main-
spring of his conduct. The rules of evidence, as they
are settled by law, and adopted in its general adminis-
tration, are not to be overruled or tampered with.
They are founded in the charities of religion-in the
philosophy of nature-in the truths of history-and in
the experience of common life; and whoever ventures

both God and man will judge him accordingly.
These are arguments addressed to your reasons and
your consciences; not to be shaken in upright minds
by any precedent,-for no precedents can sanctify in-
justice if they could, every human right would long
ago have been extinct upon the earth. If the State
Trials, in bad times, are to be searched for precedents,
what murders may you not commit-what law of hu-
manity may you not trample upon-what rule of jus-
tice may you not violate-and what maxim of wise
policy may you not abrogate and confound? If pre-
cedents in bad times are to be implicitly followed,
why should we have heard any evidence at all?
You might have convicted without any evidence; for
many have been so convicted-and, in this manner,
murdered-even by acts of Parliament. If precedents
in bad times are to be followed, why should the Lords
and Commons have investigated these charges, and the
Crown have put them into this course of judicial
trial?-since, without such a trial, and even after an
acquittal upon one, they might have attainted all the
prisoners by act of Parliament:-they did so in the
case of Lord Strafford.
There are precedents, therefore, for all such things;
but such precedents as could not for a moment sur-
vive the times of madness and distraction which gave
them birth; but which, as soon as the spurs of the oc-
casions were blunted, were repealed and execrated
even by Parliaments which (little as I may think of

ments-sitting in the darkness of former times—in
the night of freedom-before the principles of govern-
ment were developed, and before the constitution be-
came fixed. The last of these precedents, and all the
proceedings upon it, were ordered to be taken off the
file and burnt, to the intent that the same might no
longer be visible to after-ages; an order dictated, no
doubt, by a pious tenderness for national honor, and
meant as a charitable covering for the crimes of our
fathers. But it was a sin against posterity-it was a
treason against society; for, instead of commanding
them to be burnt, they should rather have directed
them to be blazoned in large letters upon the walls of
our Courts of Justice, that, like the characters deci-
phered by the prophet of God to the Eastern tyrant,
they might enlarge and blacken in your sights, to ter-
rify you from acts of injustice.-Erskine.

rank, his superior eloquence, his splendid qualities, his
eminent services, the vast space he fills in the world's
eye, and—more than all the rest-his fall from power
(which, like death, canonizes and sanctifies a great
character,) will not suffer me to censure any part of
his conduct. I am afraid to flatter him; I am sure I
am not disposed to blame him. Let those who have
betrayed him by their adulation, insult him with their
malevolence. But, what I do not presume to censure,
I may have leave to lament.
For a wise man, he seemed to me, at that time, to
be governed too much by general maxims. I speak
with the freedom of history, and I hope without of-
fence. One or two of these maxims, flowing from an
opinion not the most indulgent to our unhappy spe-
cies, (and surely a little too general,) led him into
measures that were greatly mischievous to himself,-
and, for that reason (among others) perhaps, fatal to
his country,-measures, the effects of which, I am
afraid, are for ever incurable. He made an adminis-
tration so checkered and speckled; he put together a
piece of joinery so crossly indented and whimsically
dove-tailed-a cabinet so variously inlaid-such a
piece of diversified mosaic-such a tesselated pave-

there a bit of white; patriots and courtiers, king's
friends and republicans; whigs and tories; treache-

1. COMPOUND INFLECTIONS.
2. PAUSE OF Force, or ExpRESSION.
3. CUMULATIVE EMPHASIS.
COMPOUND INFLECTIONS.
I have previously mentioned compound inflections,
and it is now time to explain their force and use.
They are distinguished from the simple rise and fall,
by a greater range of ascent and descent, compre-
hending tones, double tones, and half tones, (carrying
the voice over an interval of five tones, and sometimes
even of an octave.)
The compound inflections are-
1. The compound rising-thus marked ~
2. The compound falling-thus
The curved line is chosen to indicate them, because in mak-
ing them, the voice does not rise or fall directly, but in a sort
of curve, taking in (or slurring over) intermediate half-tones in
its ascent or descent to the extreme point of inflection.
The use of these inflections does not set aside the
rules for inflection, so far as to the point whether the

135
inflection shall be rising or falling; but it increases
the pitch, and power of the inflection.
Thus, if I ask you—
Did you say yes?
with the simple rising inflection, the question is an indifferent
one, in fact, a simple interrogation: it might be thus marked
on a diagram, indicating the descent and ascent of the voice,
and the extreme point of inflection.
Did you say
Or, in music, it might be thus scored-
or in musical score:
yes?
Did you say
yes?
Here the ascent or rise is of three tones,-or, as it is called,
in thirds.
But, if I am anriously desirous to know what your answer was
--and in my question wish to express that I shall be very much
surprised if you have said "Yes," my question would be in-
flected with the compound (or curved) inflection, thus:
Did you say ye-
e s'

No
or,
Did you say
ye-s?
in which there is on the word yes both a descent and an ascent
-(that is, a double or compound inflection), the ascent being
two tones higher than that of the simple inflection in the sim-
ple question; and the curved line denotes the slur of the voice
in passing from the low tone to the high one.
In the same manner, the simple falling is changed, for ex-
pression and force, to the compound falling inflection. Thus,
in reply to the above question, if you give a simple answer, you
will say--No-with the simple falling inflection; but if (in
answer to my compound inflection) you desire to imply "by no
means; nothing could be further from my thoughts; and I am
surprised you should ask such a question,”—then you will re-
ply with the compound falling inflection,

commencing on a high pitch of voice, and making a sweep or
curve of descent equal and corresponding to the curve of as-
cent in the compound rising inflection of my question.
That ascent and descent are usually in fifths, as above; but
when the speaker is under strong passion, his voice will ascend a
full octave. Such, for example, should be the range of the inflec-
tion on the questions by Hamlet to Laertes at Ophelia's grave:
"Dost thou come here to whine ?
To outface me with leaping in her grave?"
Hamlet, act iv., sc. 1.


## p. 137 (#143) ############################################

COMPOUND INFLECTIONS.
137
Dost thou come here
to whine.
And, unless the voice reach the octave in these lines, the pas-
sionate contempt intended to be conveyed will be lost; and the
scornful question will be changed into a common interrogation,
expecting a serious answer.

​Such is the distinction between the compound and simple
inflections.
Now let us see when and for what they are used.

says-
RULE.
The compound inflections are used in strong and vehement
Interrogation, and for wonder, contempt, scornful indignation,
ridicule, and (especially) in IRONY.
EXAMPLES.
When, in "The Merchant of Venice," (Act iv., sc. 1,) Portia,
understanding that the merchant's bond to Shylock is forfeited,
Then must the Jew be merciful;
and Shylock asks-
On what compulsion must I? tell me that;
her reply-
The quality of mercy is not strain'd-
must be marked with the compound rising inflection; which
will give the expression of wonder that such a question could
be asked, and contempt for the sordid feeling that dictated it.
So, in the following examples, for ridicule and
irony:


## p. 138 (#144) ############################################

138
ART OF ELOCUTION.
You must take me for a fool, to think I could do that.
For mine own part,
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
For Brutus is an honorable man.
You meant no harm; oh no! your thoughts are innocent;
you have nothing to hide; your breast is pure, stainless, all
truth.
And in that reply of Brutus to Cassius, (Julius Cæsar.
Act iv.,) the scorn implied in his indignant interrogations,
must be marked with the compound inflection, reaching a full
octave.
Cas.-Ye gods! ye gods! must I endure all this?
Br.-All this? Aye, more!-Fret till your proud heart break:
Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humour ?—
-
It is, in fact, this pitch, (the octave,) that lends the scornful
expression to the words; and it is the degree of expression re-
quired that is to regulate the pitch.
IN ANTITHESIS.
These inflections are also used to give increased force to an-
tithesis; and follow each other, sometimes, in double antithesis
so closely, that the voice is kept in a continual wave of ascent
and descent, by alternate rising and falling compound inflec-
tions.

PAUSE OF FORCE.
139
EXAMPLES.
If you said so, then I said so.
Let the gall'd jade wince, our withers are unwrung!
In all the above examples, there is a certain degree of jeer-
ing or irony conveyed; and it is in the ironical expression that
these compound inflections, (with high pitch,) have the great-
est power. An exceedingly good practice on these inflections
is Marc Antony's speech to the populace, over the dead body
of Cæsar; in which it will be perceived what effect may be
added to the oft-repeated epithet, “honorable men,” (which the
orator ironically applies to Brutus and the rest,) by the adop-
tion of these compound inflections. But, in the practice of this
speech, remark that the irony is not immediately displayed by
Marc Antony. He dares not, in the first instance, cast a doubt,
by ironical expression, upon the motives of Brutus and the rest:
and it is only when he feels that he is making a favorable im-
pression upon the multitude, and "stealing away their hearts,"
that he ventures to unveil his thoughts, and to speak with irony,
and finally in utter contempt, of the "honorable men who have
stabb'd Cæsar." Bearing this hint in mind, the student may,
at this point of his progress, exercise himself with advantage
on that celebrated piece of oratory.*
2. PAUSE OF FORCE, OR EXPRESSION.
Great expression and force may be imparted to an
idea by the introduction of the short pause, with a
suspension of the voice immediately before the word
conveying the idea, or embodying emotion.
This pause, so introduced and suspending the
sense, is called the Pause of Force.
*See Appendix.


## p. 140 (#146) ############################################

140
ART OF ELOCUTION.
Like the Emphasis of Force (with which it is fre-
quently allied), it is arbitrary in its use, and depends
on the will and judgment of the speaker for its em-
ployment.
RULE.
The pause of force or expression is made by arresting and
suspending the voice, immediately before the word or member
on which the speaker wishes to concentrate his power.
EXAMPLE.
In Marc Antony's apostrophe to Cæsar's body,-when Bru-
tus and the rest, after the murder of Cæsar, having shaken
hands with Antony in pledge of amity, have left him alone in
the Senate house,-he exclaims,
Oh! pardon me,—thou bleeding piece of earth,—
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
The force and expression of this passage, in de-
livery, is wonderfully increased, if, besides the usual
pauses, we introduce the pause of feeling before-
with the emphasis of force on-the word "butchers:"
the passage will then be marked thus—
Oh! pardon me thou piece of bleeding earth-*
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
The effect of this is at once felt: it is as if the
speaker paused to find a word strong enough for his
feeling of abhorrence; and, at length, hitting on the
*The reading of the text of this line is received either
"bleeding piece of earth," or "piece of bleeding earth:" the
former appears to me the better reading.

PAUSE OF FORCE.
141
word butcher, he pours it out with the force and ex-
pression of execration.
This pause arrests the attention of the hearer in an
extraordinary manner; and therefore it may be used
for that effect, before the word of particular force and
importance in the most solemn and least-excited
passages; as in Saint Paul,
And now abideth faith, hope, charity; these three: but
the greatest of these is charity.
And in Portia's speech on mercy,
And earthly power doth then shew likest God's,
When mercy seasons justice.
In excited passages of highly-wrought feeling, it
also gives the orator an opportunity of gathering full
power of voice to concentrate it on the one word or
phrase-as, in the well-known burst of Othello's pas-
sion :
If thou dost slander her, and torture me,
Never pray more!
Great power and expression may be added to the
phrase "torture me," by the introduction of this
pause, with the emphasis of force, on the words "tor-
ture me."
The strength of the passage is further increased by
the addition of the same pause before the words
66 never pray more;" in which case, the pause will
be doubled in time; (as there is already a pause of
sense required after torture me.)


## p. 142 (#148) ############################################

142
ART OF ELOCUTION.
The passage will then stand marked-with pause, inflection
(of antithesis,) and emphasis of force.
If thou dost slander her, and torture me
Never pray more!
We shall presently see that the power of this pas-
sage may be still further augmented-under the
force of
CUMULATIVE EMPHASIS.
The emphasis of sense goes to meaning only; the
emphasis of force is expressive of intensity and
energy. That expression is augmented by doubling
the emphasis,—and is brought to its climax of power,
by applying it to several words in succession; which
is called accumulated or Cumulative Emphasis.
This emphasis, when judiciously used, adds great
power to passages of strength: but it must not be fre-
quently employed, or it will lose its effect by the repeti-
tion, and give a disagreeable jerking to the delivery.
It is introduced properly, to add increased force to
climax,-either of powerful argument, or of highly-
wrought passion. In both these cases it crowns the
excitement and energy of the speaker; it is the "top-
most round" of the ladder, beyond which he cannot
step. It should therefore be reserved for great occa-
sions. Thus,-
EXAMPLES.
1. In an important reply, in which the orator feels that he
has triumphantly refuted the arguments of his opponent, he
may, with effect, close the climax of his triumph with the cu-
mulative emphasis of force:
1

CUMULATIVE EMPHASIS.
143
I have thus shown, from the gentleman's own arguments,
that the doctrine advanced by him is not at present received:
-that it never was received: that it never can by any
possibility be received: and that, admitted, it must be
by the total subversion of liberty itself!
2. Again, on the climax of intense passion, as in the former
example of Othello's speech, read with cumulative emphasis,
the articulation of the passage becomes almost syllabic, and it
acquires tremendous power.
If thou dost slander her and torture me
Never pray more: abandon all remorse
On horror's head horrors accumulate;
Do deeds to make heav'n weep, all earth amazed-
For nothing canst thou to damnation add
Greater than this!
Such is the power of Cumulative Emphasis.
EXPRESSION of feeling and passion is achieved,
not by inflection or emphasis, but by pitch of voice;
which will be treated of in the next division.

THIRD DIVISION.
THE principles developed in the preceding Division
have taught us to read and speak with meaning, force,
and ease.
But Elocution has a higher aim. She fol-
lows the human voice in its natural and unrestrained
expression of intense feeling,-she accompanies it
"in the very torrent, tempest, and whirlwind of its
passion;" she knows it in its joy and in its sorrow;
she catches, and treasures up its intonations of love
and hate, persuasion and command, scorn, pity, ten-
derness and rage; and by the power of her "so potent
art," she holds them like familiar spirits, to be let
loose at will.
Under her teaching, he who will, may learn their
mastery; subdue them to his power; and call them
to his aid, when he would cast a spell over the minds
and hearts of his fellow-men.
This is the highest triumph of Elocution;-the truth-
ful utterance of intense and passionate feeling.
This is to be attained by the power of

INTONATION.
145
INTONATION.
Intonation is the art of imparting true and perfect
tone to the organ of the voice: its practice forms the
Education of the Voice, and gives it fulness and
volume.
The human voice (as I have before observed) must
be regarded as a musical instrument-an Organ.
To produce its tones, its bellows-the lungs-must
be kept duly inflated, or supplied with breath; the
pipe-the throat-must have full play,-the orifice
of the mouth must be well opened, and the sound
must be poured through it in a copious, swelling
stream; interrupted, momentarily, by pause or rests,
-on which it gathers fresh impetus for its onward
course.
Many a voice is called weak, not because it is
really deficient in natural power, but because its pos-
sessor is ignorant of, or unpractised in, the mechanical
means of eliciting, improving, and displaying its
strength. For the means are mechanical, and consist
of the following
PROCESS OF INTONATION.
1. INFLATION OF THE LUNGS, (to begin,) and regularly sup-
plying what they expend in respiration-by an imperceptible
inspiration, or catch of the breath, at each pause:-(and here
the rhetorical pause is of great service.)
2. OPENING THE MOUTH well-not speaking through the
teeth-or, as it is called, "eating your words,"-(which nine
speakers out of ten do.)
3. POURING OUT THE VOICE regularly, with an even and
continuous flow and swell; not in irregular jerks and starts.


## p. 146 (#152) ############################################

146
ART OF ELOCUTION.
This process is perfectly simple, and merely requires
exercise to make it easy. It is, in fact, the same art
as that which every one has observed in public
singers; who, however, display the mechanical
means too manifestly, (and in some instances painful-
ly,) by distortion of visage and heaving of chest.
This exhibition of the physical effort must be avoided
by the Elocutionist: Ars est celare artem. The
machinery must be worked, but the springs and
wheels must be kept out of sight.
SWELL OF VOICE.
The swell of voice is called in music crescendo, or increas
ing, and is denoted by this mark, <; and the diminishing of
the sound is called diminuendo, thus denoted, .
The whole swell and decrease is therefore thus denoted
I shall adopt the same respective marks ;-to denote the in-
creasing of the volume of voice-and its diminution.
INSPIRATION.
Observe that the pauses afford the opportunity for regular
inspiration, to supply expended breath; a resort absolutely ne-
cessary in order to powerful enunciation and perfect intonation;
for there can be no command of voice without a perfect com-
mand of breath.
I have previously laid it down, that in the delivery
of serial sentences-where the sense goes on increas-
ing by amplification-the volume of voice or sound
should also increase (crescendo) up to the climax;
but remember, that shouting is not Intonation.*
*There is a marked distinction between noise and musical
sound. Noise is a confused mixture of sounds produced by the

fly farther, and are heard at a greater distance, than those

walk before we run.
But Intonation is so connected
with, and necessary to the reading and delivery of
verse and poetic language, that it is now a proper
time and place to introduce some observations on
POETICAL ELOCUTION.
It is first to be observed, that the general style of
reading or reciting verse and poetic language, should
be higher and more exalted than that of prose for
poetry is a more exalted style of composition than
prose; and the elocution must keep pace with the
subject or matter. The voice must flow more softly;
must undulate gently, and not jump or jerk on the in-
flections; so that the verse may run smoothly and
without jar upon the ear. Intonation must be particu-
larly attended to in poetical delivery; so that the mu-
sic of the voice being fully brought out, it may aid
and give echo to the music of the language.
This style I call the imaginative style of Elocution:
because it is the style to be adopted in the delivery of
all imaginative composition, whether in prose or
verse. For, I need not remark that there is poetical
prose, which must be delivered in the imaginative or
poetical style; and we all painfully know that there
is poetry-or rather verse-so irredeemably prosaic,
that no reading or Elocution could possibly invest it
with the attributes of poetry: the best way is not to
read it at all.
As an example of poetic prose, take the following
EXTRACT FROM OSSIAN.

ward each other approached the heroes. As two dark streams
from high rocks meet and mix, and roar on the plain; loud,
rough and dark, in battle met Lochlin and Innisfail; chief mixed
his strokes with chief, and man with man. Steel clanging
sounded on steel. Helmets are cleft on high; blood bursts and
smokes around. As the troubled noise of the ocean when roll
the waves on high; as the last peal of the thunder of heaven;
such is the noise of battle. The groan of the people spreads
over the hills. It was like the thunder of night when the cloud
bursts on Cona, and a thousand ghosts shriek at once on the
hollow wind.
Such language as this must not be delivered as
common prose; but the speaker's Elocution must be
swelling, exalted, dignified; in fine, elevated to the
level of the composition. In the same manner, in the
delivery of any figurative passage in an ordinary dis-
course or oration,-where the orator, borne aloft on
the wings of his imagination, quits the common track
of language and soars in the regions of fancy,-the
Elocution must also rise, and sustain a flight equal in
loftiness and ambition to the elevation of the orator's
diction and style. As in the following

with it; that is, the imaginative style must be
adopted.
One of the main characteristics of this lofty style is
what is called the orotund voice; that is, that full
and swelling tone which is produced by the same or-
ganic form and action of the mouth as are necessary
perfectly to enunciate the tonic o, as in o-ld, c-o-l-d,
&c. To utter this tonic perfectly, the mouth is kept
in a rotund form, and the tone produced is called oro-
tund (ore rotundo.) By carefully reading the follow-
ing lines, with particular attention to the enunciation
of the tonic o, and swelling the voice upon it, the pu-
pil will attain a clear perception of the orotund voice.

To Scriptural reading, and prayer, the orotund is
most appropriate; for its full swelling tone lends
depth and solemnity to the delivery, and is strongly
expressive of reverential feeling. The acquisition and
command of the orotund, therefore, is essential to the

clergyman, whose voice is required to fill a large
building, not only so as to be audible, but with a
deep and solemn effect that shall secure the attention,
respect and sympathy of his auditors. The figurative
and sublime language of the Old Testament must not
be uttered, (as it too frequently is,) in the familiar and
undignified tone in which we would deliver an ordi-
nary lecture, or make a statement of finance; and
even the beautiful simplicity of the New Testament
must not be vulgarised and degraded to the familiar
tone of common-place conversation or narration. The
dignity of his subject, his office, its high aim, the
place, the occasion, all demand from the clergyman,
dignity of style and manner; and the orotund voice,
with its full swelling stream of sound, is the one adapt-
ed to that end. It should, therefore, be a great and
constant object of the clergyman to educate his voice
and utterance upon this point. More than these few
hints on Scriptural reading I cannot give here; it is a
style of itself, which requires considerable practice,
and cultivation of voice, so as to avoid, on the one
hand, meanness, and familiarity in aiming at sim-
plicity; and on the other, to escape bombast and tur-
gidity, while aspiring to dignity and power.
READING OF VERSE.
The previous observations apply to the general style
of poetical Elocution, whether in prose or verse. In
the reading of verse, we must, moreover, be careful to
preserve RHYTHM and MELODY.

ART OF ELOCUTION.
1. RHYTHм is musical order of arrangement: it is
as pleasing, and indeed necessary to the satisfaction of
the ear, as symmetry and regularity of form are to the
eye. In music, rhythm governs the leaping or gush-
ing of the sound; in dance, it regulates the beating of
the feet; in language, it directs or arranges the pulsa-
tions or strokes of the voice upon words or syllables;
or, as it is called, in music, the accentuation. I have
before observed, that there is a rhythm even in prose;
but it is uncertain, irregular and fickle. Verse is the
music of language; rhythm is its essential quality ;
the regularity and perfection of which distinguish it
from prose.
Verse is addressed to the ear; its music
is not received through the eye, (although a regular
marginal blank may seem to mark the versification
on paper,) and therefore, it is as requisite, in reading
verse, to mark the rhythmical accentuation of the line,
as that, in playing or singing, we should observe due
time. That is, we must regulate the pulsation and
movement of sound by the voice, to the regulated
metrical accentuation (or rhythm) of the verse.
English verse consists of the arrangement, at regu-
lar intervals, of accented and unaccented,-or, more
properly speaking, of heavy and light syllables.
This regular arrangement, or order, constitutes the
rhythm of the verse,-whether that verse be blank
or in rhyme ;-rhyme is the coincidence of sound in
the closing cadence of one line with that of another;
it has no reference to or influence upon the rhythm,
from which it is perfectly distinct, nor is it an essen-
tial constituent of English poetry.


## p. 155 (#161) ############################################

MEASURE of verse.
155
Latin and Greek Verse is measured, by prosodians,
by certain adjustments of syllables, long and short,
called feet of these feet there is a great variety, of
which the principal are the
Spondee-two long syllables, as undone,
Trochee—one long and one short syllable, as mērčy,
Iambus—one short and one long, as elate,
Dactyl-one long and two short, as mērciful,
Anapest-two short and one long, as lemonade.
But, of that style of scanning our English verse is
quite independent, and indeed incapable. The syllables
in our language cannot be classed as long or short, for
the same syllables vary in quantity, as they occur in
different verses, according to the amount of feeling or
force that may be given to them, and other circum-
stances governing their quantity. English verse is
regulated by the arrangement of heavy and light syl-
lables, and depends for its musical effect upon time
and accentuation; or, pulsation and remission of
sound, on the heavy and light syllables, respectively.
English verse may be divided into common time
and triple time: the first being the pace of a man's
walk; the second of a horse's canter. The accentua-
tion is, as in music, always on the bar; that is, the
accented note, or heavy syllable, must commence the
bar, or its place must be supplied by a rest, which
counts for it; for rests are as essential to rhythm as
the notes themselves.


## p. 156 (#162) ############################################

Thus we can divide or bar for accentuation, all English verse.
Take the following three examples, as timed, barred, and ac-
cented: the two first are in common time, the third is in triple
time:

The pulsation of voice, and the classification or division of
the syllables as accented and arranged in the preceding coup-
lets, distinctly mark their different rhythm.-To illustrate this
further, read the second line of the third couplet, as if it were
thus divided and accented:
And the king | seized a flambeau | with zeal | to destroy.
Thus read, the verse becomes prose; for, by false accentua-
tion, its musical movement is lost, and the rhythm is destroyed.
This must be clear to every ear.
At the same time be careful not to fall into that
sing-song style of reading verse, which is produced
by the accentuation of little and insignificant words.
This sing-song style. so common among readers,

is the result of the absurd attempt of prosodians to
measure English versification by feet, instead of by
time and accentuation. The music of a verse is not
to be ascertained by counting on the fingers, or scan-
ning, (as it is called); but by the ear.*
English verse consists of a certain number of bars,
in the same time; of which the rests or pauses are
constituent parts: and it is therefore as much on the
due observance of these rests, as on the accentuation
of the notes or syllables, that the rhythm depends.
Take the following examples of verses scanned first accord-
ing to the feet of the prosodians, counted on their fingers, and
then according to the rational prosody which really governs
the rhythm of English verse, that is, time and accentuation.
According to the former plan, it will be observed, that the sense
is utterly sacrificed to the scanning, for want of rest or pause,
however necessary it may be to the meaning or feeling of the
verse; while, by the latter plan, the rhythm, sense and feeling
go hand in hand, and are aided by rests.

By which, we find, that these are verses of six bars, in com-

requires a pause. And so in the following examples: in which
it will be seen that verses which would be said by the proso-
dians to consist of four feet, are, in general, verses of six bars;
and that what would, in scanning, be called by prosodians pen-
tameters, or five-feet verses, are really lines of six, and some-
times even of eight bars.-The time, either triple or common,

ART OF ELOCUTION.
It will be found by reading verse according to this system,
-of marking the rhythm by time and accentuation,—that it
will flow much more easily than when read by prosodial scan-
ning: nor shall we be obliged to make elisions of vowels for
the purpose of preserving the apparent regularity of the line,-
that is, according to the plan of counting the syllables on the
fingers. No poet has suffered more from this pedantic method
of measuring English verse, than Shakspeare, whose commen-
tators have not scrupled to add syllables to, or deduct syllables
from his lines, in order to give them "the right butter-woman's
pace to market ;" and this because these learned gentlemen, in-
stead of receiving the music of his verse through their ears,
measured his lines, like tape, upon their fingers: and if they
did not happen exactly to fit the prescribed length, they laid
him upon the Procrustes' bed of their prosodial pedantry, and
stretched him out, if too short, or cut him down, if too long!
Thus they have succeeded, in some instances, in "curtailing"
his verse of its beauty and "fair proportions," by the elision
or blending of vowels, whose utterance really forms the music
of the lines. For example, of the line
|O| Romeo! | Romeo! | wherefore | art thou | Romeo? |
they would make a verse of what they would call five feet, with
a redundant syllable; and, to do this, they are obliged to reduce
the melodious name of Ro-me-o to two syllables; and scan it
thus:-
Oh Ro | myo Ro | myo where | fore art | thou Ro | myo?-
thus clipping and defacing the language, for the sake of level-
ling it to the standard of a false prosody.
Again, if we follow this prosodial finger-measuring of verse,
what becomes of the force and depth of the heart-wrung ex-
clamation of Samson, (Agonistes,) when he exclaims:-
Oh! dark, dark, dark, amid the blaze of noon!
The prosodians would thus measure it:


## p. 161 (#167) ############################################

161
Oh dark dark dark | amid | the blaze | of noon |
I
and thus destroy all the force and passion of the line: a rational
prosody, preserving the feeling, as well as the rhythın of the
verse, would thus divide it into eight bars, timing it duly, and
marking it with rests that add to its beauty and power.
|-||-|-♪

2. | Oh | dark | dark | dark | a- | mid the blaze of | noon.

Thus we preserve all the expression of the verse, and dis-
tinguish its melody and rhythm from such a verse as the fol-
lowing, which has exactly the same number of syllables as the
above line, and would, by the prosodians, be scanned exactly in
the same manner; yet it has quite a different movement:
A burdenous drone, to visitants a gaze.
If we follow the prosodians, we shall thus scan this line:
Å burd' | nous drone | to vis | itants | ǎ gaze.
If we follow good taste, common sense, and rhythmical accen-
tuation, we shall thus measure it:
3. |~~ A | burdenous | drone to visitants a | gaze."
It is thus a line of five bars, in triple time: and the change
from common time is in keeping with the expression.
The same of the following line, which owes its lightness and
beauty to its accentuation and triple time:
3. Love-darting eyes, or tresses like the morn.
It is on the variation of time and accentuation that the verse of
Milton depends so much for its force and melody. The poet has
studiously adapted the time and movement of his verse to the
effect intended to be produced; but the system of scanning re-
duces all verse to the same humdrum jog-trot.

"The native wood-notes, wild," says Kemble, "which could
delight the cultivated ear of a Milton, are not to be regu-
lated by those who measure verses by their fingers."
And yet it is recorded of Kemble, (and the anecdote is an
excellent satire upon prosodial scanning,) that, in obedience
to this finger-measuring of verse, the second of the following
lines, in the Tempest,
"
I'll rack thee with old cramps,
Fill all thy bones with aches; make thee roar,
That beasts shall tremble at thy din”—
was thus read by Kemble:
"Fill all thy bones with aitches, make thee roar,”—
an absurdity really ridiculous, committed in order to make
up the full number of ten syllables, or five feet, of which,
according to prosodial scanning, the verse is composed. The
time, measure, and reading of the line are thus:
Į
~
▾
པ
2. Fill all thy | bones with | aches | make thee | roar |
|
The rest after "aches" fills up the rhythm, prevents the
absurdity of perverting "aches" into a word of two syllables,
and adds to the force and expression of the line. Thus we
see that, in rhythmical reading, the rests or pauses are as
necessary to the measure as the notes or syllables themselves.
The Casural pause, spoken of by Blair and the prosodians,
may sometimes suffice, with the rest at the close of the line,
to make out the rhythm and sense of the verse; but, for fine,
musical, and expressive reading of verse, other rests are ne-
cessary, not only in the middle and at the close of the line,
but in the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, or whatever bar
the rhythm, sense, or feeling demands them. And the accen-
tuation of the lines will not run on in the same unvarying

time, and back again, just as the poet, (if he have a fine
ear,) shall vary his verse, to produce a severe or light and
airy effect.
The following lines in blank verse and common
time, are exceedingly rhythmical and melodious; but
their rhythm will be almost destroyed, and they will
become merely poetical prose, if, in delivering them,
we neglect to mark the variation, which is occasion-
ally made by the poet in the movement of his verse,—
by change of time and accentuation.

A rest, or slight suspension of voice, at the end of
each line, is essential to the rhythmical reading of all
verse: it can never be omitted except in the delivery of
DRAMATIC POETRY;
in which, the suspension at the close of each line must
not be allowed to interrupt the flow of language and
feeling. The great object of dramatic poetry is the
natural and powerful expression of passion: this is the
grace paramount, to which all others must bend, and
which must not be sacrificed to any minor embellish-
ments. It is true, the verse in which that passionate
expression is clothed lends it dignity and grace, and
therefore, even on the stage, rhythm and metre must
be preserved in delivery: but it must be done easily
and without pedantry or apparent effort. For he
would make but a poor impression on the heart, who,
in an overwhelming burst of passion, should stop to
note a cæsural pause, or the rest which, in ordinary
poetical reading, marks the close of the line. If he be
an artist, a correct ear and good taste will prevent
the actor wantonly destroying the poet's rhythm;
judgment will guide him in passages where he may,
with propriety and grace, linger on the melody of the
lines; while the power of truthful feeling and passion-
ate enthusiasm, will exalt him above the trammels

of ordinary rule which would tame his imagination,
and fetter his energies.
This much is all that I have thought necessary to
remark on the subject of the delivery of dramatic
poetry. Its further study, with constant and patient
practice, added to a good ear, a cultivated voice, and
a taste refined by reading and education, is requisite
to the actor. What I have here incidentally observed
is sufficient for the orator, the scholar, and the unpro-
fessional reader, aiming at an elegant style of Elocu-
tion.
2. MELODY and CADENCE are requisite to give finish
to rhythmical Elocution.
Melody and Cadence are graces arising from the arrange-
ment and variation of pitch by inflection of voice.
Read aloud, as marked, the following
EXAMPLE
On her white breast a sparkling cross she wore
Which Jews might kiss and infidels adore.
Experiment will convince the reader that no other arrange-
ment of inflections on these lines, can produce a melody
equal to that which is here given. That melody pervades both
verses in the closing line of the sense, I call it cadence, for ca-
dence is the consummation or close of a melody.
This melody is produced by alternation of inflection: the
cadence marked in the second line of the couplet is distinguish-

ART OF ELOCUTION.
ed as the HARMONIC CADENCE ;* it is formed by the introduc-
tion of two intermediate rising inflections of a third and fifth,
between two falling inflections: the melody of the first line is
composed of a similar alternation of inflection, with the varia-
tion of a rising inflection to mark the suspension of sense, at
the termination of the line.
The introduction of this melody and cadence, where the
sense will admit of it, lends additional music to the rhythm:
but they must not be used to supersede just inflection or Em-
phasis required by the sense: for the melody must never be
permitted to destroy the force of the line. Nor must this ca-
dence be too frequently resorted to, or it will give a sing-song
sameness to the reading-tiresome and unmeaning.
It is to be observed that the inflections of the voice,
in the reading of verse, are not to be marked so
strongly, or, as I may say, so angularly, as in prose-
reading. Smoothness, and an easy, flowing style, are
to be cultivated; and, therefore, the inflections must
be, as it were, rounded and polished; so that the
voice shall not leap, but gently undulate from tone to
tone, and float along in an unbroken stream of sound.
A great fault in the reading of verse, is the too
strongly marking, or, as I call it, hammering the
rhyme this is destructive of melody, and has a most
unpleasing effect on the ear. To avoid it, we must
* The harmonic cadence may.be used with grace in prose-
declamation, as well as in verse; when the passage does not
demand any particular force, as:

that number who are ignorant in spite of experience.—Johns.

keep the voice suspended, avoiding a frequent re-
currence of the falling inflection at the close of the
line, except where the close of the sense, too, demands
it. Otherwise we shall fall into that methodical, alter-
nate, closing rise and fall, which deprives rhythmical
Elocution of all variety and grace.
Pope's lines are good practice for melodious read-
ing for he frequently suspends the sense through se-
veral successive lines, and, so, affords opportunity for
variety of inflection and cadence. I therefore give
(marked,) a passage extracted from his Essay on
Man.

It is not within the scope of this work to analyse the differ-
ent rhythms and metres used in versification: but for the con-
venience of the reader, the Practice at the end of this Division
contains extracts in a variety of rhythm; by exercise on which,
in accordance with the preceding rules and directions, he may
acquire an elegant and easy style of rhythmical Elocution.
We now proceed to
EXPRESSION.
Expression is the modulating or regulating the
organ of the voice to tones of gentleness or force, ac-
cording to the nature and degree of feeling, or passion
expressed in words. Expression is the natural lan-
guage of emotion. It is, in Elocution, to a certain ex-
tent, a vocal imitation of passion. But this must be
done without "aggravating the voice" (as Bottom has
it). It is a grace which requires the nicest manage-
ment; and cannot be achieved but with the best cul-
tivation of ear and voice; in order to catch and re-
echo the tones of the heart to the ears and hearts of
others. It depends mainly upon pitch of voice, and
the expression of each different feeling has its appropri-
ate pitch.*
* Roger Ascham, tutor to Queen Elizabeth, thus quaintly
writes, touching the matter of pitch of voice:
"Where a matter is spoken with an apte voyce for everye
affection, the hearers, for the most part, are moved as the

EXPRESSION.-MONOTONE.
169
Expression therefore is a refinement on Intonation:
they go hand in hand: we cannot think of the one
without the other. Intonation gives the voice volume
and power; expression uses and adapts it to the feel-
ing of the moment.
Even monotone has its expression.
MONOTONE
is intonation without change of pitch: that is, preserving a
fullness of tone, without ascent or descent on the scale.
THE EXPRESSION OF MONOTONE.
It expresses repose of feeling or scene-the calm confidence
of power-vastness of thought-veneration—and the over-aw-
ing sublimity of grandeur.
But it must not be listless, vapid, soulless monotone;
it must be a deep, swelling, crescendo monotone, speak-
ing as it were from the recesses of the heart; as,
Calm-ness sits throned on yon un

or roaring like a bull, as some lawyers do, which thinke they
do best when they crye loudest; these shall never move, as I
know many well-learned have done, because theyr voyces were
not stayed afore, with learninge to singe. For all voyces, great

point by learninge to singe."

ART OF ELOCUTION.
It requires practice; and the practice of monotone
tends essentially to the improvement of intonation.
The sign of monotone is an even line or mark (denoting an
even tone of voice) over the words to be spoken without inflec-
tion: but mark,-the sound must swell and gather volume as it
proceeds.

PITCH OF VOICE.
1
Expression, as I have said, depends chiefly upon
pitch of voice.
We all know that the tones of the voice vary con-
siderably, according to the affection of mind or passion
under which a person speaks. We see this daily in
nature-we hear a man give a command in one tone,
and make an entreaty or ask a favor in another: his

is light and rapid in pleasure,-low, moaning, and
broken in grief,-dull and heavy in pain,-cracked,
wild, and shrieking in despair. The voice of deep
passion,-sorrow, love, woe, remorse, pity, &c.-is
seated in the chest, (voce di petto,) and its pitch is low :
while that of more impulsive passion, as rage, delight,
triumph, &c. is high in pitch, and partakes of the qual-
ity of the head voice-(voce di testa). It is on our
power to command our voice at will to any pitch, that
we must rely for vocal expression: that is, the adapta-
tion of tone to sentiment and passion.
Pitch is quite distinct from force; by which, how-
ever, its effect may be aided and increased.
The pitch of the speaking voice may be divided into
MIDDLE PITCH,
HIGH PITCH,
LOW PITCH.
By middle, or mean pitch, I intend the ordinary
pitch of voice, as used in common conversation, un-
marked by passion. That pitch varies according to the
quality or character of the individual voice, whether
it be soprano, tenor, or bass.
Suppose, for example, the natural key of any voice
to be Bb, and the prevailing tone of its ordinary
b
speech to be
the middle pitch of that voice
may be considered to extend a third above and a
third below that tone: and so of any other prevailing
tone of
any voice.
1


## p. 173 (#179) ############################################

MIDDLE PITCH.
1/3
Above and below the range of the middle pitch, are
the high and low pitch respectively. Low pitch may
be said to be a third below the mean pitch; and high
pitch, a third above it: so that where middle pitch as-
cending ends, high pitch begins; where middle pitch
descending ends, low pitch begins: the range of each,
high or low, depending of course on the compass of
the speaker's voice.
These are the clearest and most distinct indicia
that I am able to give for the regulation of pitch on
the speaking voice.
Now each of these three pitches,-the middle, the
high, and the low,—has its appropriate sphere of use
or expression.
1. THE MIDDLE is the proper pitch for narration,
description, (when not particularly animated,) state-
ment, and moral reflection, or calm reasoning.
Such a poetical description as the following, for example, re-
quires only middle pitch.
EXERCISE ON MIDDLE PITCH.
Sometime we see a cloud that's dragonish;
A vapor, sometime, like a bear, or lion,
A tower'd citadel, or pendant rock,
A forked mountain, or blue promontory,
With trees upon it, that nod unto the world,
And mock our eyes with air; thou hast seen these signs;
They are black vesper's pageants.
That which is now a horse, even with a thought,
The rack dislimns; and makes it indistinct
As water is in water.
Shaks.

ART OF ELOCUTION.
Again, such a passage as the following requires, for the most
part, with some variation, only middle pitch; but the delivery
should be energetic and forceful:
Breathes there the man with soul so dead
Who never to himself hath said,
This is my own, my native land?
Whose heart hath ne'er within him burn'd,
As home his foot-steps he hath turn'd
From wandering on a foreign strand?
If such there breathe, go mark him well:
For him no minstrel's raptures swell.
High tho' his titles, proud his name,
Boundless his wealth, as wish can claim;
Despite these titles, power, and pelf,
The wretch concentred all in self,
Living, shall forfeit fair renown,
And doubly dying, shall go down
To the vile dust from whence he sprung,
Unwept, unhonored, and unsung!
Scott.
In fine, for all passages where there is no passion expressed,
or which are not marked by strong excitement, or impetuosity
of feeling, or are not descriptive of stirring action, the middle
pitch is in general sufficient.
2. HIGH PITCH is the representative of elevated
feeling, and impetuous, impulsive passion: joy, exul-
tation, rage, invective, threat, eagerness, all speak
naturally in high pitch it is also proper to stirring
description, or animated narration.
It is the proper pitch for such a passage as the following,-
the buoyant, joyous feeling of which is best expressed by the
light and sparkling tones of high pitch.

And the following picture of Cheerfulness requires high pitch,
and a light and brisk articulation, to harmonise with its airy
and elastic effect:
But oh! how altered was its sprightlier tone
When CHEERFULNESS, a nymph of healthiest hue,
Her bow across her shoulder flung,
Her buskins gemm'd with morning dew,
Blew an inspiring air that dale and thicket rung:
The hunter's call, to Faun and Dryad known.

Satyrs and sylvan boys were seen,
Peeping from forth their allies green;
Brown Exercise rejoic'd to hear,
And Sport leap'd up, and seiz'd his beechen spear.
Collins.
The lofty enthusiasm of the aspiring Hotspur, in the well-
known speech which follows, is also best expressed in the high
pitch, (with a variation, for effect, to low pitch in the fourth line.)
By heavens! methinks it were an easy leap
To pluck bright honor from the pale-fac'd moon;
Or dive into the bottom of the deep
Where fathom line could never touch the ground,
And pluck up drowned honor by the locks;
So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
Without corrival all her dignities;-
But out upon this half-fac'd fellowship!
Shaks.

3. Low PITCH is the natural expression of deep-
seated feeling and concentrated passion, nursed dark-
ly in the inmost recesses of the heart it is the tone
of grief,-suppressed rage,-brooding thought,—
very solemn reflection,- melancholy, -hate,- re-
morse; and also, in its softest and deepest expression,
of love and veneration.

With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
Moves like a ghost.

Oh! now, for ever,
Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!
Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars
That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!
Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,
The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
The royal banner, and all quality,
Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!
And oh, you mortal engines, whose rude throats
The immortal Jove's dread clamors counterfeit,
Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!
Shaks.


## p. 177 (#183) ############################################

FORCE.
177
Now it is on the change and variation of these se-
veral pitches that an orator or an actor must depend
for power of expression; and the greater the facility
with which he can make his transitions from pitch to
pitch, the greater will be his effect on his audience.
For there are many passages in vehement oratory,
poetry, and especially dramatic poetry, that require
rapid and frequent transitions from high pitch to low,
and run through every variety of tone.
ENERGY, OR FORCE.
Intimately allied to expression, is energy, or force.
As Expression is variety of Intonation, Energy may
be called the Emphasis of Expression. It is the life,
the soul, the animating spirit. Without it, the speaker
may be correct, and even agreeable, by a due observance
of rule; but if he lack energy, he will be listened to with-
out interest; his voice will fall powerless on the ear, and
neither "awake the senses," nor "stir the blood."
Energy, it is true, depends somewhat on individual
temperament and constitution. But even where natu-
ral or physical energy is deficient, an energetic manner
may be acquired by practice and exercise under judi-
cious direction; just as the muscular powers may be
improved, and bodily vigor increased, even in a feeble
frame, under a course of training and well-regulated
exercise.
The first requisite, in order to create an interest in
others, is to feel, or at least to exhibit, an earnestness
ourselves. We must be in earnest. Between the ora-
H*

ART OF ELOCUTION.
tor and his auditory, there is a certain involuntary
sympathy communicated from one to the other. If he
be himself animated and energetic, his audience soon
acknowledge a kindred spirit; if, on the contrary, he
be cold, they catch the infection; if he be tame, they
are apathetic; if he be spiritless, they are listless: their
torpor again re-acts upon him, and both orator and
audience sleep together.
Energy quickens and infuses life into the style: it
warms, it revivifies with its touch. It adds a brisker
movement to the voice: it flushes the cheek, it lights
the eye, it animates the frame; and passing like an
electric spark from speaker to audience, it enkindles in
them a sympathetic spirit, it arouses their enthusiasm,
it takes possession of their hearts, and places their feel-
ings, their reason, and their will, in the hands of him
whose power has agitated the recesses of their souls.
FORCE is, after pitch, the next constituent of Expres-
sion: and the increasing or diminishing the amount of
force on any passage is a matter requiring nice taste,
and artistical execution, in governing the voice to forte
(loud), and piano (soft).
TIME.
The last constituent of Expression is-Time. The
time, that is, the rapidity or slowness of our delivery,
must accord with the character of the feeling or pas-
sion expressed,-whether impetuous or concentrated;
—of the action, or scene described,--whether stirring
or tranquil;-or of the sentiment that pervades the

179-
language, whether it be elevated, impulsive, glow-
ing, or deep, solemn, and enduring. For, different
sentiments and passions, as they use different pitch,
also speak in different time: the utterance of grief
is slow and heavy; while that of hope and joy is
light, bounding, and rapid. Again, the rush of an
impetuous torrent, roaring and bursting over the
plains, destroying vegetation, tearing up trees, carry-
ing away cottages, in its resistless course, must be
painted, as it were, to the ear, not only by appropri-
ate pitch and force, but by a rapidity of utterance
whose time shall be in keeping with the sweeping
destruction described: while the placid flow of a gen-
tle river, calmly gliding between its flower-spangled
banks, amid a landscape of richest verdure, whose un-
broken silence, and golden smile, caught from the
rays of the setting sun, breathe the quiet happiness
of content and peace,-this requires to be painted by
a slow and even movement of the voice,-whose time
shall accord with the tranquillity of the scene, and
allow the hearer to dwell on the placid picture before
him.
As an illustration, continuing the speech of Brutus, which we
have already commenced as an Exercise on Intonation, we pro-
ceed thus:
ཡ
As Cæsar loved me, I weep for him; as he was fortunate,
I rejoice at it; as he was valiant, I honor him; but, as he
was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for his love;
ཡ

+
joy for his fortune; honor for his valor, and death for his
ambition.
Such is the correct pausing, and such the just, and even for-
cible inflection and emphasis on this passage. But it wants
much more, before it can be perfectly delivered: it wants ex-
pression for it is clear that "weeping," "rejoicing," and
"slaying," result from very different and opposite affections
or passions of the mind; and this change in sentiment must
be indicated by a correspondent transition in the pitch, and
variation in force and time of delivery.
To denote the varieties and changes of these three constitu-
ents of Expression, I must employ the following signs and
terms:

As in that beautiful description, in Shakspeare's Henry IV,
of the gallant Prince Henry and his comrades armed for battle:

Glitt'ring in golden coats like images;
As full of spirit as the month of May,
And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;

His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd,—

Ánd vaulted with such ease into his seat,
dolco.
As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,
fo

And witch the world with noble horsemanship!
Unless this description, full of poetic imagination and color-
ing as it is, be delivered with warmth, energy, and the pitch or
tone of enthusiasm, it will fall very short of its due impression;
and thus the poet will be deprived, by the speaker's coldness,
of the full appreciation, by the hearer, of the exquisite beauty
of the picture. The reader must catch the spirit of the lan-
guage, in order to be a fit interpreter of the poet's conception;
as he proceeds, he must warm and kindle with the glowing
coloring of the picture, till the finishing touch is given to it, in
the closing, crowning line.
But the force of his elocution must be greatly increased, and
the expression must become impassioned, and rise almost to
fierceness, to produce the full effect of Hotspur's heroic and in-
spiring answer: which breathes the highest enthusiasm of
confident and daring valor, undaunted resolution, and impatient
thirst of glory.

The mimicry of Passion, by the simultaneous ex-
pression of voice, gesture, face, and attitude, is the
Actor's study. It is not my design to form a theatri-
cal style; but it is desirable that the student should
make himself master of certain tones and variations
of expression, a judicious use of which will add much
to the beauty and power of his declamation, and is, in
fact, absolutely necessary to be attained before he can
aspire to the high character of a perfect ORATOR.

Are a nation wide and strong;
And danger and doubt I have led them through,
And they worship me in song;
And over their bright and glancing arms,
On field, and lake, and sea,
With an eye that fires, and a spell that charms,
I guide them to victory!"
SPRING.-N. P. WILLIS.
THE spring is here, the delicate-footed May,
With its slight fingers full of leaves and flowers;
And with it comes a thirst to be away,
Wasting in wood-paths its voluptuous hours;
A feeling that is like a sense of wings,
Restless to soar above these perishing things.
We pass out from the city's feverish hum,
To find refreshment in the silent woods;
And nature, that is beautiful and dumb,
Like a cool sleep upon the pulses broods;
Yét, even there, a restless thought will steal,
To teach the índolent heart it still must feel.

Strange that the audible stillness of the noon,
The waters tripping with their silver feet,
The turning to the light of leaves in June,
And the light whisper as their edges meet,-
Strange that they fill not with their tranquil tone,
The spirit walking in their midst, alone!

There is no contentment in a world like this,
Save in forgetting the immortal dream;
We may not gaze upon the stars of bliss,

And pine, till it is hooded from the sky!

Know ye the land where the cypress and myrtle
Are emblems of deeds that are done in their clíme,
Where the rage of the vulture, the love of the turtle
Now melt into sorrow, now madden to crime?
Know ye the land of the cedar and vine
Where the flowers ever blossom, the leaves ever shine;
Where the light wings of zephyr, oppress'd with perfume,
Wax faint o'er the gardens of Gul* in her bloom;
Where the cítron and olive are fairest of fruit,

In color though varied, in beauty may vie,
And the purple of Ocean is deepest in dye;

And all, save the spirit of man, is divine?

3. EXERCISE IN EXPRESSION.
I have chosen the following well-known and beautiful ode,
as the vehicle of instruction, and as a particular Exercise in
Expression, although quite familiar to the reader, as a compo-
sition, because it affords great scope for transition of pitch, vari-
ation of force, and change of time, in accordance with the varied
action and quality of the personification of each individual
passion. It is in these transitions and variations that the main
beauty of the ode lies; and on the marking of them distinctly,
depends the effect in delivery.
The ode is also a good practice in rhythmical reading, from
the variety as well as polish of the versification.

Anger is high in pitch, loud, and quick in the time

burst out in sudden starts, indicative of the rashness
of passion.
This is distinct from the expression of dignified
anger, just severity, and reproof, which is solemn and
measured in its delivery, and low in pitch.

shrieking. Both shades of expression are beautifully

The tone must be fiercer, harsher, and more concen-
trated than mere Anger. Revenge, when most in-
tense, speaks between the set teeth; and utters its de-
nunciations in a hoarse, guttural voice; and with fit-
ful bursts of passion.
PITY, on the contrary, speaks in a low, soft, and
gentle tone of voice; but full and flowing, as from the
exuberance of a warm heart.

Cheerfulness-which is the direct contrast of the
last passion-speaks in a high pitch, briskly and

(6
10. Joy;
whose tone is richer and fuller, and utterance still
more lively and animated. Under the influence of
joy, the words bound and gush from the lips, and the
delivery becomes excited and enthusiastic.
The distinction between these two affections of the
mind, is, that Cheerfulness is a state or enduring
condition of the mind, and therefore has a certain re-
pose of expression; while Joy is an active emotion
or passion, temporarily exciting and agitating the
mind, and accordingly its expression is of a higher
character, and must be more powerfully delineated.
Joy usually subsides into the happy tranquillity of
cheerfulness; unless it be dashed by grief, in which
case it sometimes changes into the darkest despair.

Therefore, ye men of Harfleur,
Take pity of your town, and of your people,
Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command!
If not, why in a moment look to see
The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters:
Your fathers taken by the silver beards,
And their most reverend heads dashed to the walls!
Your naked infants spitted upon pikes :
Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
Do break the clouds ;-as did the wives of Jewry
At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen!-
How say you? will you yield, and this avoid?

This concluding extract from Childe Harold, affords
an opportunity, in a short space, for great variety and
quick transition of tone. in accordance with the change
of Expression from Pity to Indignation, mounting
to Revenge. The pupil will find the key to the cor-
rect expression of these changing feelings in the re-
marks on Collins's Ode to the Passions,-which I de-
sign as a key to Expression in general.
In the present instance, I have also marked the
pauses which are necessary to be observed; they add
much to the effect of the passage.

GESTURE.

GESTURE, AND VOCAL GYMNASTICS.
I know of no means of teaching Gesture by written
instructions; nor do I think that much assistance can
be gathered from plates of figures representing dif-
ferent actions and attitudes. Austin's Chironomia
was the first work that attempted this, and the book
is not without advantage to a professor, or to one who
has made some progress, by practice under good tui-
tion, in giving force to an oration by certain well-regu-
lated and appropriate gestures, or in the expression of
the passions by the action of the face and the attitude.
of the body. Austin has been followed by a crowd
of copyists, who have adopted his plates and figures,
but whose instructions appear to me to tend rather to
give the pupil a stiff and constrained style of gesti-
culation, than to invest him with that easy and grace-
ful action, and powerful but unexaggerated attitude,
which alone are pleasing and effective in the orator or
the actor.
The first point to be aimed at, as the foundation of
a good style of gesture, is a natural and easy carriage
of the body,-erect, not stiff,—but firm, manly, and
free. This is a thing, unfortunately, too much ne-
glected in education generally: the drill-sergeant
will be found of use in helping us to this; and the
dancing-master's assistance is also of service. Not
that we are to aim at the stiff and measured profes-
sional step of the soldier, or the mincing gait of a

maitre-de-danse; we must avoid the extreme of each;
a manly and graceful carriage lies between the two.
An excellent exercise both for voice and health,-
one that will both improve the strength of the lungs
and the carriage of the body, is to walk and speak
aloud at the same time; a task which at first will ap-
pear difficult and tiresome, but by practice,-carefully
observing the rules which I have laid down for pause
and inspiration, to supply expended breath,-will be-
come easy; and I answer for it, that the voice will be
by this means much increased in strength, the carri-
age of the body improved, and the health of the lungs
greatly promoted. I recommend any person whose
profession calls on him to speak loud and long,—
either in the Pulpit, the Senate, at the Bar, or in the
Lecture-Room,-to make frequent trial of this exer-
cise. Let him take Brutus's speech, for example,
particularly observing the pauses as I have marked
them; let him commence, the first day, by walking
slowly while he recites aloud with the proper inflec-
tions, &c., but not with too great an effort of voice,
as much of the speech as is so marked, (p. 148.) Let
him continue this exercise daily, gradually increasing
in exertion of voice, and rapidity of walk, and I will
undertake that, in a very short time, (provided there
be no disease in his lungs,) he shall be able not only
to execute the whole of that speech while walking in
the open air, but that he shall be able at length to
speak it clearly, distinctly, and forcibly, while run-
ning gently up-hill.
This exercise will also, infallibly, tend to the im-

209
provement of his general carriage; for, the effort of
speaking whilst walking will compel him, instinctive-
ly, to hold his body straight and to expand his chest,
for the more easy delivery of his voice, which cannot
have fair play with a stooping body or rounded
shoulders. To speak well, easily, and powerfully,
the body must be erect, the chest expanded, the legs
firmly set under the hips, to support the body, and
form a good fulcrum for the efforts of the voice.
And this is the first step towards Gesture.
The next is to acquire an easy and free use of
the arms; and a pliancy of wrist. In this, the
fencing-master is the best assistant. His practice
will correct the prevailing awkwardness of gesture
which consists in keeping the elbows glued, (if I may
say so,) to the side; and working the arm in a con-
tinued angular movement, most unsightly, and utter-
ly irreconcileable with power or grace of action.
Next, let the speaker always bear in mind, that the
object of gesture is to assist or enforce the words
which it accompanies. Gesture is, in fact, the ally of
speech. Its province is to second the voice. "Action
and utterance" go together: Shakspeare has so placed
them; and the action must be akin to the utterance;
the gesture must be relative to the words. Gesture,
therefore, must not be vague, unmeaning, motionless;
or it will be a mere 66
sawing of the air." It must
have purport and force; it must be, as it were, an
animated comment on the text which it accompanies.
To effect this, the following hints may be of some
service in guiding the young speaker to a correct and

ART OF ELOCUTION.
pleasing system of action; at the same time, I must
repeat, it is next to impossible to teach gesture by
written instructions: three practical lessons with a
good and experienced professor will do more towards
giving the pupil ease, grace, and force of action,
than all the books and plates in the world. My own
pupils have found some aid from the following
Sketch of a System of Gesture.
ALL GESTURE is
ACTIVE (or passionate)-i. e. dictated by, and expressing
the action, or affection of the speaker's mind; or,
DEMONSTRATIVE (or descriptive)—of some object, action,
or scene spoken of or referred to.
GESTURE is made up of
1. POSITION of the BODY, which must be properly balanced
and firmly fixed, whether advanced (adv.) or retired
(ret.)—that is, at rest.
2. The FORM of the HAND, which defines the nature of the
gesture.
3. The POSITION or direction of the ARM; and,
4. The MOTION of the ARM-which defines the extent and
limit of the gesture.
5. The STROKE or BEAT from the WRIST-which (being
made on the emphatic word or expression, or the one
to which the gesture, if descriptive, refers,) finishes
and perfects the action.
EXPRESSION OF FACE.
Nor should the FACE and EYE be silent, or idle: they must as-
sist the gesture and movement of body, arm, hand, by a corres-
ponding expression,—whether of inquiry or denial,—calmness
or excitement, sorrow, joy, triumph, scorn, defiance, pity, anger,
&c. It is the harmonious combination and expression of the
WHOLE MAN that make powerful and graceful gesture.
ATTITUDE is the extravagance or exaggeration of gesture, un-
der the most powerful excitement of PASSION; its study and prac-
tice belong to the Actor, and are therefore not introduced here.

DELICACY OF TASTE.-HUME.
NOTHING is so improving to the temper as the study
of the beauties either of poetry, eloquence, music, or
painting. They give a certain elegance of sentiment,
to which the rest of mankind are strangers. The
emotions which they excite are soft and tender.
They draw off the mind from the hurry of business
and interest; cherish reflection; dispose to tranquilli-
ty; and produce an agreeable melancholy, which, of
all dispositions of the mind, is the best suited to love.
and friendship. In the second place, a delicacy of
taste is favorable to love and friendship, by confining
our choice to few people, and making us indifferent to
the company and conversation of the greater part of
men. You will seldom find that mere men of the
world, whatever strong sense they may be endowed
with, are very nice in distinguishing characters, or in
marking those insensible differences and gradations

tainment: they talk to him of their pleasures and af-
fairs with the same frankness that they would to
another; and finding many who are fit to supply his
place, they never feel any vacancy or want in his
absence.
But, to make use of the allusion of a celebrated
French author, the judgment may be compared to a
clock or watch, where the most ordinary machine is
sufficient to tell the hours, but the most elaborate alone
can point at the minutes and seconds, and distinguish
the smallest differences of time. One that has well
digested his knowledge, both of books and men, has lit-
tle enjoyment but in the company of a few select com-
panions. He feels too sensibly how much all the rest
of mankind fall short of the notions which he has en-
tertained; and his affections being thus confined with-
in a narrow circle, no wonder he carries them further
than if they were more general and undistinguished.
The gaiety and frolic of a bottle companion improve,
with him, into a solid friendship; and the ardors of a
youthful appetite become an elegant passion.
DESCRIPTION OF THE COLISEUM.-FORSYTH.
A COLOSSAL taste gave rise to the Coliseum. Here,
indeed, gigantic dimensions were necessary; for
though hundreds could enter at once, and fifty thou-
sand find seats, the space was still insufficient for
Rome, and the crowd for the morning games began at

midnight. Vespasian and Titus, as if presaging their
own deaths, hurried the building, and left several
marks of their precipitancy behind.
In the upper
walls, they have inserted stones which were evidently
dressed for a different purpose. Some of the arcades
are grossly unequal; no moulding preserves the same
level and form round the whole ellipse, and every or-
der is full of license. The Doric has no triglyphs
nor metopes, and its arch is too low for its columns;
the Ionic repeats the entablature of the Doric; the
third order is but a rough cast of the Corinthian, and
its foliage the thickest water-plants; and the whole is
crowned by a heavy Attic. Happily for the Coliseum,
the shape necessary to an amphitheatre has given it a
stability of construction sufficient to resist fires, and
earthquakes, and sieges. Its elliptical form was the
hoop which bound and held it entire till barbarians
burst that consolidating ring; popes widened the
breach; and time, not unassisted, continues the work
of dilapidation. At this moment, the hermitage is
threatened with a dreadful crash, and a generation not
very remote must be content, I apprehend, with the
picture of this stupendous monument. Of the interi-
or elevation, two slopes, by some called meniana, are
already demolished; the arena, the podium, are in-
terred. No member runs entire round the whole el-
lipse; but every member made such a circuit, and re-
appears so often, that plans, sections, and elevations of
the original work are drawn with the precision of a
modern fabric. When the whole amphitheatre was
entire, a child might comprehend its design in a mo-

ment, and go direct to his place without straying in
the porticos, for each arcade bears its number engrav-
ed, and opposite to every fourth arcade was a staircase.
This multiplicity of wide, straight, and separate pass-
ages, proves the attention which the ancients paid to
the safe discharge of a crowd; it finely illustrates the
precept of Vitruvius, and exposes the perplexity of
some modern theatres.
Every nation has undergone its revolution of vices
and as cruelty is not the present vice of ours, we can
all humanely execrate the purpose of amphitheatres
now that they lie in ruins. Moralists may tell us that
the truly brave are never cruel; but this monument
says 'No.' Here sat the conquerors of the world,
coolly to enjoy the tortures and death of men who had
never offended them. Two aqueducts were scarcely
sufficient to wash off the human blood which a few
hours' sport shed in the imperial shambles. Twice in
one day came the senators and matrons of Rome to
the butchery; a virgin always gave the signal for
slaughter; and when glutted with bloodshed, those
ladies sat down in the wet and streaming arena to a
luxurious supper! Such reflections check our regret
for its ruin.
As it now stands, the Coliseum is a striking image
of Rome itself-decayed, vacant, serious, yet grand-
half-gray and half-green-erect on one side, and fallen
on the other, with consecrated ground in its bosom ; in-
habited by a beadsman, visited by every caste; for mo-
ralists, antiquaries, painters, architects, devotees all meet
here to examine, to draw, to measure, and to pray!

DEATH AND CHARACTER OF QUEEN ELIZABETH.
HUME.
SOME incidents happened which revived her tender-
ness for Essex, and filled her with the deepest sorrow
for the consent which she had unwarily given for his
execution.
The Earl of Essex, after his return from the fortu-
nate expedition against Cadiz, observing the increase
of the Queen's fond attachment towards him, took oc-
casion to regret that the necessity of her service re-
quired him often to be absent from her person, and
exposed him to all those ill offices which his enemies,
more assiduous in their attentions, could employ
against him. She was moved with this tender jea-
lousy; and making him the present of a ring, desired
him to keep that pledge of her affection, and assured
him, in whatever disgrace he should fall, whatever
prejudices she might be induced to entertain against
him, yet, if he sent her that ring, she would immedi-
ately, upon sight of it, recall her former tenderness,
would afford him a patient hearing, and would lend
a favorable ear to his apology. Essex, notwithstand-
ing all his misfortunes, reserved this precious gift to
the last extremity; but, after his trial and condemna-
tion, he resolved to try the experiment, and he com-
mitted the ring to the Countess of Nottingham, whom
he desired to deliver it to the Queen. The Countess
was prevailed on by her husband, the mortal enemy
of Essex, not to execute the commission; and Eliza-
beth, who still expected that her favorite would make

this last appeal to her tenderness, and who ascribed the
neglect of it to his invincible obstinacy, was, after
much delay and many internal combats, pushed by
resentment and policy to sign the warrant for his ex-
ecution.
:
The Countess of Nottingham, falling into sickness,
and affected with the near approach of death, was
seized with remorse for her conduct; and, having ob-
tained a visit from the Queen, she craved her pardon
and revealed to her the fatal secret. The Queen, as-
tonished with this incident, burst into a furious pas-
sion she shook the dying Countess in her bed; and
crying to her, that God might pardon her, but she
never could, she broke from her, and thenceforth re-
signed herself over to the deepest and most incurable
melancholy. She rejected all consolation; she even
refused food and sustenance; and, throwing herself on
the floor, she remained sullen and immoveable, feed-
ing her thoughts on her afflictions, and declaring life
and existence an insufferable burden to her. Few
words she uttered; and they were all expressive of
some inward grief which she cared not to reveal: but
sighs and groans were the chief vent which she gave
to her despondency, and which, though they dis-
covered her sorrows, were never able to ease or assuage
them. Ten days and nights she lay upon the carpet,
leaning upon cushions which her maids brought her;
and her physicians could not persuade her to allow
herself to be put to bed, still less to make trial of any
remedies which they prescribed to her. Her anxious
mind at last had so long preyed on her frail body, that

her end was visibly approaching; and the Council,
being assembled, sent the keeper, admiral and secre-
tary to know her will with regard to her successor.
She answered with a faint voice, that as she had held
a regal sceptre, she desired no other than a royal suc-
cessor. Cecil requesting her to explain herself more
particularly, she subjoined that she would have a king
to succeed her; and who should that be but her near-
est kinsman, the King of Scots ? Being then advised
by the Archbishop of Canterbury to fix her thoughts
upon God, she replied that she did so, nor did her
mind in the least wander from him. Her voice soon
after left her; her senses failed; she fell into a lethar-
gic slumber, which continued some hours, and she ex-
pired gently, without struggle or convulsion, in the
seventieth year of her age and forty-fifth of her reign.
So dark a cloud overcast the evening of that day,
which had shone out with a mighty lustre in the eyes
of all Europe. There are few great personages in
history who have been more exposed to the calumnies
of enemies, and the adulation of friends, than Queen
Elizabeth; and yet there is scarcely any whose repu-
tation has been more certainly determined by the
unanimous consent of posterity. The unusual length
of her administration, and the strong features of her
character, were able to overcome all prejudices; and
obliging her detractors to abate much of their invec-
tives, and her admirers somewhat of their panegyrics,
have at last, in spite of political factions, and what is
more, of religious animosities, produced a uniform
judgment with regard to her conduct. Her vigour,

her constancy, her magnanimity, her penetration,
vigilance and address, are allowed to merit the highest
praises, and appear not to have been surpassed by any
person that ever filled a throne: a conduct less rigor-
ous, more sincere, more indulgent to her people would
have been requisite to form a perfect character. By
the force of her mind she controlled all her more ac-
tive and stronger qualities, and prevented them from
running into excess: her heroism was exempt from
temerity, her frugality from avarice, her friendship
from partiality, her active temper from turbulency and
a vain ambition: she guarded not herself with equal
care or equal success from lesser infirmities; the
rivalship of beauty, the desire of admiration, the jea-
lousy of love, and the sallies of anger.
Her singular talents for government were founded
equally on her temper and on her capacity. Endowed
with a great command over herself, she soon obtained
an uncontrolled ascendant over her people; and, while
she merited all their esteem by her real virtues, she
also engaged their affections by her pretended ones.
Few sovereigns of England succeeded to the throne
in more difficult circumstances; and none ever con-
ducted the government with such uniform success and
felicity. Though unacquainted with the practice of
toleration-the true secret for managing religious fac-
tions-she preserved her people by her superior pru-
dence, from those confusions in which theological
controversy had involved all the neighboring nations :
and though her enemies were the most powerful prin-
ces of Europe, the most active, the most enterprising,

the least scrupulous, she was able by her vigor to
make deep impressions on their states; her own great-
ness meanwhile remained untouched and unimpaired.
The wise ministers and brave warriors who flourish-
ed under her reign share the praise of her success;
but instead of lessening the applause due to her, they
make great addition to it. They owed, all of them,
their advancement to her choice; they were supported
by her constancy, and with all their abilities they
were never able to acquire any undue ascendant over
her. In her family, in her court, in her kingdom, she
remained equally mistress; the force of the tender
passions was great over her, but the force of her mind
was still superior; and the combat which her victory
visibly cost her, serves only to display the firmness of
her resolution, and the loftiness of her ambitious
sentiments.
The fame of this princess, though it has surmounted
the prejudices both of faction and bigotry, yet lies still
exposed to another prejudice, which is more durable
because more natural, and which, according to the
different views in which we survey her, is capable of
exalting beyond measure, or diminishing the lustre
of her character. This prejudice is founded on the
consideration of her sex. When we contemplate her
as a woman, we are apt to be struck with the highest
admiration of her great qualities and extensive capa-
city; but we are also apt to require some more softness
of disposition, some greater lenity of temper, some of
those amiable weaknesses by which her sex is distin-
guished. But the true method of estimating her merit

is to lay aside all these considerations, and consider
her merely as a rational being placed in authority,
and entrusted with the government of mankind. We
may find it difficult to reconcile our fancy to her as a
wife or a mistress; but her qualities as a sovereign,
though with some considerable exceptions, are the ob-
ject of undisputed applause and approbation.
CHARACTER OF MARY QUEEN OF SCOTS.
ROBERTSON.
TO ALL the charms of beauty and the utmost ele-
gance of external form, she added those accomplish-
ments which render their impression irresistible. Po-
lite, affable, insinuating, sprightly, and capable of
speaking and of writing with equal ease and dignity.
Sudden, however, and violent in all her attachments,
because her heart was warm and unsuspicious. Im-
patient of contradiction, because she had been accus-
tomed from her infancy to be treated as a queen. No
stranger, on some occasions, to dissimulation, which,
in that perfidious court where she received her educa-
tion, was reckoned among the necessary arts of govern-
Not insensible of flattery, or unconscious of
that pleasure with which almost every woman beholds
the influence of her own beauty. Formed with the
qualities that we love, not with the talents that we
admire, she was an agreeable woman rather than an
illustrious queen. The vivacity of her spirit not suf-
ficiently tempered with sound judgment, and the
warmth of her heart, which was not always under the
ment.

restraint of discretion, betrayed her both into errors
and into crimes. To say that she was always unfor-
tunate, will not account for that long and almost unin-
terrupted succession of calamities that befel her; we
must likewise add that she was often imprudent. Her
passion for Darnley was rash, youthful and excessive:
and though the sudden transition to the opposite ex-
treme was the natural effect of her ill-requited love,
and of his ingratitude, insolence and brutality, yet
neither these, nor Bothwell's artful address and im-
portant services, can justify her attachment to that
nobleman. Even the manners of the age, licentious
as they were, are no apology for this unhappy passion:
nor can they induce us to look on that tragical and
infamous scene which followed upon it, with less ab-
horrence. Humanity will draw a veil over this part
of her character which it cannot approve, and may
perhaps prompt some to impute her actions to her situ-
ation, more than to her disposition, and to lament the
unhappiness of the former, rather than accuse the per-
verseness of the latter. Mary's sufferings exceed, both
in degree and in duration, those tragical distresses
which fancy has feigned to excite sorrow and com-
miseration; and while we survey them, we are apt
altogether to forget her frailties; we think of her
faults with less indignation, and approve of our tears
as if they were shed for a person who had attained
much nearer to pure virtue.
With regard to the queen's person, a circumstance
not to be omitted in writing the history of a female
reign, all contemporary authors agree in ascribing to

Mary the utmost beauty of countenance and elegance
of shape of which the human form is capable. Her
hair was black; though, according to the fashion of
that age, she frequently wore borrowed locks, and of
different colors. Her eyes were a dark gray, her
complexion was exquisitely fine, and her hands and
arms remarkably delicate, both as regards shape and
color. Her stature was of a height that rose to the
majestic. She danced, she walked and rode with
equal grace. Her taste for music was just; and she
both sang, and played upon the lute with uncommon
skill. Towards the end of her life she began to grow
fat; and her long confinement, and the coldness of the
houses in which she had been imprisoned, brought on
a rheumatism, which deprived her of the use of her
limbs.

It is now sixteen or seventeen years since I saw the
Queen of France, then the Dauphiness, at Versailles;
and surely never lighted on this orb, which she hardly
seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. I saw her
just above the horizon, decorating and cheering the
elevated sphere she just began to move in-glittering
like the morning star, full of life, and splendor, and
joy. Oh! what a revolution! and what a heart must

I have to contemplate, without emotion, that elevation
and that fall! Little did I dream, when she added
titles of veneration to that enthusiastic, distant, respect-
ful love, that she should ever be obliged to carry the
sharp antidote against disgrace concealed in that bo-
som;
little did I dream that I should have lived to see
such disasters fallen upon her in a nation of gallant
men, in a nation of men of honor and of cavaliers.
I thought ten thousand swords must have leaped from
their scabbards to avenge even a look that threatened
her with insult. But the age of chivalry is gone.
That of sophisters, economists, and calculators has
succeeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished
for ever! Never, never more shall we behold that
generous loyalty to rank and sex, that proud submis-
sion, that dignified obedience, that subordination of the
heart, which kept alive, even in servitude itself, the
spirit of an exalted freedom. The unbought grace of
life, the cheap defence of nations, the nurse of manly
sentiment and heroic enterprise is gone! It is gone,
that sensibility of principle, that chastity of honor,
which felt a stain like a wound, which inspired cou-
rage whilst it mitigated ferocity, and ennobled what-
ever it touched, and under which vice itself lost half
its evil by losing all its grossness.

was not till after a long and obstinate contest that
Babylon and Rome could prevail against the obstina-
cy of the people, the craggy ground that might super-
sede the necessity of fortifications, and the walls and
towers that would have fortified the most accessible
plain. These obstacles were diminished in the age
of the Crusades. The bulwarks had been complete-
ly destroyed, and imperfectly restored; the Jews, their
nation and worship, were forever banished; but na-
ture is less changeable than man, and the site of Je-
rusalem, though somewhat softened, and somewhat
removed, was still strong against the assaults of an
enemy. By the experience of a recent siege, and a
three years' possession, the Saracens of Egypt had
been taught to discern, and in some degree to remedy,
the defects of a place which religion as well as honor
forbade them to resign. Aladin, or Iftikhar, the Ca-
liph's lieutenant, was entrusted with the defence; his
policy strove to restrain the native Christians by the
dread of their own ruin and that of the holy sepul-
chre; to animate the Moslems by the assurance of
temporal and eternal rewards. His garrison is said
to have consisted of forty thousand Turks and Arabi-
ans; and if he could muster twenty thousand of the
inhabitants, it must be confessed that the besieged
were more numerous than the besicging army. Had
the diminished strength and numbers of the Latins
allowed them to grasp the whole circumference of
four thousand yards, (about two English miles and a
half,) to what useful purpose should they have de-
scended into the valley of Ben Himmon and torrent

of Cedron, or approached the precipices of the south
and east, from whence they had nothing either to
hope or fear? Their siege was more reasonably di-
rected against the northern and western sides of the
city. Godfrey of Bouillon erected his standard on the
first swell of Mount Calvary; to the left, as far as St.
Stephen's gate, the line of attack was continued by
Tancred and the two Roberts; and Count Raymond
established his quarters from the citadel to the foot of
Mount Sinai, which was no longer included within
the precincts of the city. On the fifth day, the cru-
saders made a general assault, in the fanatic hope of
battering down the walls without engines, and of sca-
ling them without ladders. By dint of brutal force
they burst the first barrier; but they were driven
back with shame and slaughter to the camp: the in-
fluence of vision and prophecy was deadened by the
too frequent abuse of those pious stratagems, and
time and labor were found to be the only means of
victory. The time of the siege was indeed fulfilled in
forty days, but they were forty days of calamity and
anguish. A repetition of the old complaint of famine
may be imputed in some degree to the voracious or
disorderly appetite of the Franks, but the stony soil
of Jerusalem is almost destitute of water; the scanty
springs and hasty torrents were dry in the summer
season; nor was the thirst of the besiegers relieved,
as in the city, by the artificial supply of cisterns and
aqueducts. The circumjacent country is equally des-
titute of trees for the uses of shade or building, but
some large beams were discovered in a cave by the

crusaders a wood near Sichem, the enchanted grove
of Tasso, was cut down; the necessary timber was
transported to the camp by the vigor and dexterity
of Tancred; and the engines were framed by some
Genoese artists, who had fortunately landed in
the harbor of Jaffa. Two moveable turrets were
constructed at the expense and in the stations of the
Duke of Lorraine and the Count of Tholouse, and
rolled forwards with devout labor, not to the most
accessible, but to the most neglected parts of the
fortification. Raymond's tower was reduced to ashes
by the fire of the besieged, but his colleague was
more vigilant and successful; the enemies were driv-
en by his archers from the rampart; the drawbridge
was let down; and, on Friday, at three in the after-
noon, Godfrey of Bouillon stood victorious on the
walls of Jerusalem. His example was followed on
every side by the emulation of valor; and about
four hundred and sixty years after the conquest of
Omar, the holy city was rescued from the Mahomme-
dan yoke.
In the pillage of public and private wealth, the ad-
venturers had agreed to respect the exclusive property
of the first occupant; and the spoils of the great
mosque-seventy lamps and massy vases of gold and
silver-rewarded the diligence and displayed the gen-
erosity of Tancred. A bloody sacrifice was offered
by his mistaken votaries to the God of the Christians;
resistance might provoke, but neither age nor sex
could mollify their implacable rage: they indulged
themselves three days in a promiscuous massacre, and

the infection of the dead bodies produced an epidem-
ical disease. After seventy thousand Moslems had
been put to the sword, and the harmless Jews had
been burnt in their synagogue, they could still reserve
a multitude of captives, whom interest or lassitude
persuaded them to spare. Of these savage heroes of
the Cross, Tancred alone betrayed some sentiments of
compassion; yet we may praise the more selfish len-
ity of Raymond, who granted a capitulation and safe
conduct to the garrison of the citadel.
The holy sepulchre was now free; and the bloody
victors prepared to accomplish their vow. Barehead-
ed and barefoot, with contrite hearts, and in an hum-
ble posture, they ascended the hill of Calvary amidst
the loud anthems of the clergy; kissed the stone
which had covered the Saviour of the world, and be-
dewed with tears of joy and penitence the monument
of their redemption.
STORY OF LA ROCHE.-MACKENZIE.*

there, from having found, in this retreat, where
the connexions even of nation and language were
avoided, a perfect seclusion and retirement, highly fa-
vorable to the developement of abstract subjects, in
which he excelled all the writers of his time.
Perhaps in the structure of such a mind as Mr.
Hume's, the finer and more delicate sensibilities are
seldom known to have place; or, if originally im-
planted there, are in a great measure extinguished by
the exertions of intense study and profound investiga-
tion. Hence the idea of philosophy and unfeelingness
being united, has become proverbial, and, in common
language, the former word is often used to express the
latter. Our philosopher has been censured by some
as deficient in warmth and feeling: but the mildness
of his manners has been allowed by all; and it is
certain that, if he was not easily melted to compas-
sion, it was at least not difficult to awaken his benev-
olence.
One morning, while he sat busied in those specula-
tions which afterwards astonished the world, an old
female domestic, who served him for a housekeeper,
brought him word that an elderly gentleman and his
daughter had arrived in the village the preceding even-
ing, on their way to some distant country, and that
the father had been suddenly seized in the night with
a dangerous disorder, which the people of the inn.
where they lodged feared would prove mortal; that
she had been sent for as having some knowledge
in medicine, the village surgeon being then absent;
and that it was truly piteous to see the good old man,

who seemed not so much afflicted by his own distress
as that which it caused to his daughter. Her master
laid aside the volume in his hand, and broke off the
chain of ideas it had inspired. His night gown* was
exchanged for a coat, and he followed his gouver-
nante to the sick man's apartment.
"Twas the best in the little inn where they lay, but
a paltry one, notwithstanding. Mr. Hume was
obliged to stoop as he entered it. It was floored with
earth, and above were the joists not plastered, and
hung with cobwebs. On a flock-bed, at one end, lay'
the old man he came to visit; at the foot of it, sat his
daughter. She was dressed in a clean white bed-
gown; her dark locks hung loosely over it as she
bent forward, watching the languid looks of her fa-
ther. Mr. Hume and his housekeeper had stood
some moments in the room, without the young lady's
being sensible of their entering it.
"Mademoiselle!" said the old woman at last, in a
soft tone.
She turned, and showed one of the finest
faces in the world. It was touched, not spoiled, with
sorrow; and when she perceived a stranger, whom
the old woman now introduced to her, a blush at first,
and then the gentle ceremonial of native politeness,
which the affliction of the time tempered, but did not
extinguish, crossed it for a moment and changed its
expression. "Twas sweetness, all, however, and our
philosopher felt it strongly. It was not a time

He had a spare bed for a friend, and there was
a garret-room unoccupied, next to the gouvernante's.
It was contrived accordingly. The scruples of the
stranger, who could look scruples though he could
not speak them, were overcome, and the bashful re-
luctance of his daughter gave way to her belief of its
use to her father. The sick man was wrapt in
blankets and carried across the streets to the English
gentleman's. The old woman helped his daughter to
nurse him there. The surgeon, who arrived soon
after, prescribed a little, and nature did much for him;
in a week he was able to thank his benefactor.
By this time, his host had learned the name and
character of his guest. He was a Protestant clergy-
man of Switzerland, called La Roche, a widower,
who had lately buried his wife after a long and linger-
ing illness, for which travelling had been prescribed;
and was now returning home, after an ineffectual and
melancholy journey, with his only child, the daugh-
ter we have mentioned.
He was a devout man, as became his profession.
He possessed devotion with all its warmth, but none
of its asperity; I mean that asperity which men, call-
ed devout, sometimes indulge in. Mr. Hume, though
he felt no devotion, never quarrelled with it in others.

with his long staff and his dog, and left them to their
prayers and their thanksgivings.

for it! I would he were a Christian !"
"There is a pride in human knowledge, my child,"
said her father, "which often blinds men to the sub-
lime truths of revelation; hence, opposers of Christi-
anity are found among men of virtuous lives, as well
as among those of dissipated and licentious characters.
Nay, sometimes I have known the latter more easi-
ly converted to the true faith than the former, because
the fume of passion is more easily dissipated than the
mist of false theory and delusive speculation."
"But Mr. Hume," said his daughter; "alas! my fa-
ther, he shall be a Christian before he dies."
She was interrupted by the arrival of their landlord.
He took her hand with an air of kindness; she drew
it away from him in silence, threw down her eyes to
the ground and left the room.
"I have been thanking God," said the good La
Roche, "for my recovery."
"That is right,” replied his landlord.
"I would not wish," continued the old man hesitat-
ingly, "to think otherwise. Did I not look up with
gratitude to that Being, I should barely be satisfied

with my recovery as a continuation of life, which, it
may be, is not a real good. Alas! I may live to wish
I had died, that you had left me to die, sir, instead of
kindly relieving me (he clasped Mr. Hume's hand);
but when I look on this renovated being as the gift of
the Almighty, I feel a far different sentiment: my
heart dilates with love and gratitude to him; it is pre-
pared for doing his will, not as a duty, but as a plea-
sure; and regards every breach of it, not with disap-
probation, but with horror."
"You say right, my dear sir," replied the philoso-
pher; "but you are not yet re-established enough to
talk much; you must take care of your health, and
neither study nor preach for some time. I have been
thinking over a scheme that struck me to-day when
you mentioned your intended departure. I never was
in Switzerland; I have a great mind to accompany
your daughter and you into that country. I will help
to take care of you by the road; for, as I was your first
physician, I hold myself responsible for your cure."
La Roche's eyes glistened at the proposal; his
daughter was called in and told of it. She was equal-
ly pleased, with her father; for they really loved.
their landlord-not perhaps the less for his infidelity;
at least, that circumstance mixed a sort of pity with
their regard for him: their souls were not of a mould
for harsher feelings; hatred never dwelt in them.
They travelled by short stages; for the philosopher
was as good as his word, in taking care that the old
man should not be fatigued. The party had time to
be well acquainted with one another, and their friend-

ship was increased by acquaintance. La Roche
found a degree of simpleness and gentleness in his
companion which is not always annexed to the char-
acter of a learned or a wise man. His daughter, who
was prepared to be afraid of him, was equally unde-
ceived. She found in him nothing of that self-import-
ance which superior parts, or great cultivation of them,
is apt to confer. He talked of everything but philos-
ophy or religion; he seemed to enjoy every pleasure
and amusement of ordinary life, and to be interested
in the most common topics of discourse: when his
knowledge or learning at any time appeared, it was de-
livered with the utmost plainness, and without the
least shadow of dogmatism. On his part, he was
charmed with the society of the good clergyman and
his lovely daughter. He found in them the guileless
manner of the earliest times, with the culture and ac-
complishment of the most refined ones. Every better
feeling warm and vivid; every ungentle one repress-
ed or overcome. He was not addicted to love; but
he felt himself happy in being the friend of Mademoi-
selle La Roche, and sometimes envied her father the
possession of such a child.
After a journey of eleven days, they arrived at the
dwelling of La Roche. It was situated in one of those
valleys of the Canton of Berne, where nature seems
to repose, as it were, in quiet, and has enclosed her
retreat with mountains inaccessible. A stream, that
spent its fury in the hills above, ran in front of the
house, and a broken waterfall was seen through the
woods that covered its sides; below, it circled round

a tufted plain, and formed a little lake in front of a
village, at the end of which appeared the spire of La
Roche's church, rising above a clump of beeches. Mr.
Hume enjoyed the beauty of the scene; but to his
companions it recalled the memory of a wife and pa-
rent they had lost. The old man's sorrow was silent
-his daughter sobbed and wept. Her father took her
hand, kissed it twice, pressed it to his bosom, threw
up his eyes to heaven, and having wiped off a tear
that was just about to drop from each, began to point
out to his guest some of the most striking objects
which the prospect afforded. The philosopher inter-
preted all this; and he could but slightly censure the
creed from which it arose.
They had not been long arrived, when a number
of La Roche's parishioners, who had heard of his re-
turn, came to the house to see and welcome him. The
honest folks were awkward but sincere in their pro-
fessions of regard. They made some attempts at con-
dolence; it was too delicate for their handling, but
La Roche took it in good part.
"It has pleased God," said he; and they saw he
had settled the matter with himself.
Philosophy could not have done so much in a thou-
sand words.
It was now evening, and the good peasants were
about to depart, when the clock was heard to strike
seven, and the hour was followed by a particular
chime. The country folks who had come to welcome
their pastor, turned their looks towards him at the
sound: he explained their meaning to his guest.

"That is the signal," said he, " for our evening exer-
cise; this is one of the nights of the week in which
some of my parishioners are wont to join in it; a little
rustic saloon serves for the chapel of our family, and
such of the good people as are with us. If you choose
rather to walk out, I will furnish you with an attend-
ant; or, here are a few old books that may afford you
some entertainment within.”
"By no means," answered the philosopher. "I will
attend Mademoiselle at her devotions."
"She is our organist," said La Roche: "our neigh-
borhood is the country of musical mechanism, and I
have a small organ fitted up to assist our singing."
""Tis an additional inducement," replied the other;
and they walked into the room together.
At the end, stood the organ mentioned by La Roche;
before it was a curtain, which his daughter drew aside,
and placing herself on a seat within, and drawing the
curtain close, so as to save herself the awkwardness
of an exhibition, began a voluntary solemn and beau-
tiful in the highest degree. Mr. Hume was no musi-
cian, but he was not altogether insensible to music;
this fastened on his mind more strongly, from its beauty
being unexpected. The solemn prelude introduced a
hymn, in which such of the audience as could sing
immediately joined; the words were mostly taken
from holy writ; it spoke the praises of God and his
care of good men. The organ was touched with a
hand less firm: it paused, it ceased, and the sobbing
of Mademoiselle La Roche was heard in its stead.
Her father gave a sign for stopping the psalmody, and

rose to pray. He was discomposed at first, and his
voice faltered as he spoke; but his heart was in his
words, and his warmth overcame his embarrassment.
He addressed a Being whom he loved, and he spoke
for those he loved. His parishioners caught the ardor
of the good old man; even the philosopher felt him-
self moved, and forgot for a moment to think why he
should not. La Roche's religion was that of senti-
ment, not theory, and his guest was averse to disputa-
tion their discourse, therefore, did not lead to ques-
tions concerning the belief of either; yet would the
old man sometimes speak of his from the fulness of a
heart impressed with its force, and wishing to spread
the pleasure he enjoyed in it. The ideas of his God
and his Saviour were so congenial to his mind that
every emotion of it naturally awaked them. A phi-
losopher might have called him an enthusiast; but
if he possessed the fervor of enthusiasts, he was guilt-
less of their bigotry. "Our father which art in
heaven!" might the good man say, for he felt it, and
all mankind were his brethren.
"You regret, my friend," said he to Mr. Hume,
"when my daughter and I talk of the exquisite plea-
sure derived from music, you regret your want of mu-
sical powers and musical feelings; it is a department
of soul, you say, which nature has almost denied you,
which, from the effects you see it have on others, you
are sure must be highly delightful. Why should not
the same thing be said of religion? Trust me, I feel
it in the same way—an energy, an inspiration, which
I would not lose for all the blessings of sense, or en-

joyments of the world; yet, so far from lessening my
relish of the pleasures of life, methinks I feel it heighten
them all. The thought of receiving it from God adds
the blessing of sentiment to that of sensation in every
good thing I possess; and when calamities overtake
me—and I have had my share-it confers a dignity
on my affliction, so lifts me above the world. Man, I
know, is but a worm, yet, methinks, I am then allied
to God."
It would have been inhuman in our philosopher to
have clouded, even with a doubt, the sunshine of this
belief. His discourse, indeed, was very remote from
metaphysical disquisition, or religious controversy. Of
all men I ever knew, his ordinary conversation was the
least tinctured with pedantry, or liable to dissertation.
With La Roche and his daughter it was perfectly fa-
miliar. The country around them, the manners of the
village, the comparison of both with those of England,
remarks on the works of favorite authors, on the senti-
ments they conveyed, and the passions they excited,
with many other topics in which there was an equality
or alternate advantage among the speakers, were the
subjects they talked on. Their hours, too, of riding
and walking were many, in which Mr. Hume, as a
stranger, was shown the remarkable scenes and curi-
osities of the country. They would sometimes make
little expeditions to contemplate, in different altitudes,
those astonishing mountains, the cliffs of which, cover-
ed with eternal snows, and sometimes shooting into
fantastic shapes, form the termination of most of the
Swiss prospects. Our philosopher asked many ques-

La
tions as to their natural history and productions.
Roche observed the sublimity of the ideas which the
view of their stupendous summits, inaccessible to mor-
tal foot, was calculated to inspire, which naturally,
said he, leads the mind to that Being by whom their
foundations were laid.
"They are not seen in Flanders," said Mademoiselle,
with a sigh.
"That's an odd remark," said Mr. Hume, smiling.
She blushed, and he inquired no further.
"Twas with regret he left a society in which he
found himself so happy; but he settled with La Roche
and his daughter a plan of correspondence; and they
took his promise, that if ever he came within fifty
leagues of their dwelling, he should travel those fifty
leagues to visit them.
About three years after, our philosopher was on a
visit at Geneva; the promise he made to La Roche
and his daughter in his former visit was recalled to his
mind by a view of that range of mountains on a part
of which they had often looked together. There was
a reproach, too, conveyed along with the recollection,
for his having failed to write to either for several
months past. The truth was that indolence was the
habit most natural to him, from which he was not easi-
ly roused by the claims of correspondence either of his
friends or of his enemies; when the latter drew their
pens in controversy, they were often unanswered as
well as the former. While he was hesitating about a
visit to La Roche, which he wished to make, but found
the effort rather too much for him, he received a let-

ter from the old man, which had been forwarded to
him from Paris, where he had then his fixed residence.
It contained a gentle complaint of Mr. Hume's want
of punctuality, but an assurance of continued grati-
tude for his former good offices; and as a friend whom
the writer considered interested in his family, it in-
formed him of the approaching nuptials of Mademoi-
selle La Roche with a young man, a relation of her
own, and formerly a pupil of her father's, of the most
amiable disposition and respectable character. At-
tached from their earliest years, they had been sepa-
rated by his joining one of the subsidiary regiments of
the Canton, then in the service of a foreign power. In
this situation, he had distinguished himself as much for
courage and military skill as for the other endowments.
which he had cultivated at home. The term of his
service was now expired, and they expected him to
return in a few weeks, when the old man hoped, as
he expressed it in his letter, to join their hands, and
see them happy before he died.
Our philosopher felt himself interested in this event;
but he was not, perhaps, altogether so happy in the
tidings of Mademoiselle La Roche's marriage as her
father supposed him. Not that he was ever a lover of
the lady's; but he thought her one of the most ami-
able women he had seen, and there was something in
the idea of her being another's for ever that struck him,
he knew not why, like a disappointment. After some
little speculation on the matter, however, he could
look on it as a thing fitting, if not quite agreeable;

and determined on this visit to see his old friend and
his daughter happy.
On the last day of his journey, different accidents
had retarded his progress; he was benighted before
he reached the quarter where La Roche resided. His
guide, however, was well acquainted with the road,
and he found himself at last in view of the lake,
which I have before described, in the neighborhood
of La Roche's dwelling. A light gleamed on the wa-
ter that seemed to proceed from the house; it moved
slowly along as he proceeded up the side of the lake,
and at last he saw it glimmer through the trees, and
stop at some distance from the place where he then
He supposed it some piece of bridal merriment,
and pushed on his horse, that he might be a specta-
tor of the scene; but he was a good deal shocked, on
approaching the spot, to find it proceeded from the
torch of a person clothed in the dress of an attendant
on a funeral, and accompanied by several others, who,
like him, seemed to have been employed in the rites
of sepulture.
was.
On Mr. Hume's making inquiry who was the per-
son they had been burying, one of them, with an ac-
cent more mournful than is common to their profes-
sion, answered, "Then you knew not Mademoiselle,
sir? You never beheld a lovelier."
"La Roche!" exclaimed he, in reply.
"Alas! it was e, indeed!"
The appearance of surprise and grief which his
countenance assumed attracted the notice of the pea-
sant with whom he talked. He came up close to Mr.

Hume: "I perceive, sir, you were acquainted with
Mademoiselle La Roche."
"Acquainted with her! Good God! when-how--
where did she die? Where is her father?"
"She died of heart-break, I believe, sir; the young
gentleman to whom she was to have been married,
was killed in a duel by a French officer, his intimate
companion, and to whom, before this quarrel, he had
often done the greatest favors. Her worthy father
bears her death as he has often told us a Christian
should; he is even so composed as to be now in his
pulpit, ready to deliver a few exhortations to his pa-
rishioners, as is the custom with us on such occasions :
follow us, sir, and you shall hear him."-He followed
the man without answering.
The church was dimly lighted, except near the pul-
pit, where the venerable La Roche was seated. His
people were now lifting up their voices in a psalm to
that Being whom their pastor had taught them ever
to bless and to revere. La Roche sat, his figure bend-
ing gently forward, his eyes half-closed, lifted up in
silent devotion. A lamp placed near him threw its
light strong on his head, and marked the shadowy
lines of age across the paleness of his brow, thinly
covered with gray hairs. The music ceased. La
Roche sat for a few moments, and nature wrung a
few tears from him. His people were loud in their
grief. Mr. Hume was not less affected than they.
La Roche arose: "Father of mercies," said he,
"forgive these tears; assist thy servant to lift up his
soul to thee; to lift to thee the souls of thy people.

My friends, it is good so to do, at all seasons it is
good; but in the day of our distress, what a privilege
it is! Well saith the sacred book, Trust in the
Lord; at all times trust in the Lord.' When every
other support fails us, when the fountains of worldly
comfort are dried up, let us then seek those living wa-
ters which flow from the throne of God. 'Tis only
from the belief of the goodness and wisdom of a Su
preme Being that our calamities can be borne in that
manner which becomes a man. Human wisdom is
here of little use; for, in proportion as it bestows
comfort, it represses feeling, without which we may
cease to be hurt by calamity, but we shall also cease
to enjoy happiness. I will not bid you be insensible,
my friends-I cannot, I cannot, if I would, (his tears
flowed afresh)-I feel too much myself, and I am not
ashamed of my feelings; but therefore may I the
more willingly be heard; therefore have I prayed to
God to give me strength to speak to you, to direct you
to him, not with empty words, but with these tears;
not from speculation, but from experience; that while
you see me suffer, you may know also my consola-
tion.
"You behold the mourner of his only child, the
last earthly stay and blessing of his declining years!
Such a child too! It becomes not me to speak of her
virtues; yet it is but gratitude to mention them, be-
cause they were exerted towards myself. Not many
days ago you saw her young, beautiful, virtuous, and
happy: ye who are parents will judge of my felicity
then-ye will judge of my affliction now. But I

look towards Him who struck me; I see the hand
of a father amidst the chastenings of my God. Oh!
could I make you feel what it is to pour out the heart
when it is pressed down with many sorrows, to pour
it out with confidence to Him in whose hands are life
and death, on whose power awaits all that the first
enjoys, and in contemplation of whom disappears all
that the last can inflict! For we are not as those who
die without hope; we know that our Redeemer liveth-
that we shall live with him, with our friends, his ser-
vants, in that blessed land where sorrow is unknown,
and happiness is endless as it is perfect. Go then,
mourn not for me; I have not lost my child: but a
little while and we shall meet again, never to be
separated! But ye are also my children: would you
that I should not grieve without comfort? So live as
she lived; that when your death cometh, it may be
the death of the righteous, and your latter end like
his."
—
Such was the exhortation of La Roche; his audi-
ence answered it with their tears. The good old man
had dried up his at the altar of the Lord; his counte-
nance had lost its sadness, and assumed the glow of
faith and of hope. Mr. Hume followed him into his
house. The inspiration of the pulpit was past; at
the sight of him, the scene they had just passed rushed
again on his mind; La Roche threw his arms round
his neck and watered it with his tears. The other
was equally affected; they went together in silence
into the parlor where the evening service was wont to
be performed. The curtains of the organ were open;

La Roche started back at the sight. "Oh my friend,"
said he; and his tears burst forth again. Mr. Hume
had now recollected himself; he stept forward and
drew the curtains close. The old man wiped off his
tears, and taking his friend's hand, "You see my
weakness," said he; "'tis the weakness of humanity;
but my comfort is not therefore lost."
"I heard you," said the other, "in the pulpit; I re-
joice that such consolation is yours."
"It is, my friend," said he, " and I trust I shall ever
hold it fast. If there are any who doubt our faith, let
them think of what importance religion is to calamity,
and forbear to weaken its force; if they cannot re-
store our happiness, let them not take away the solace
of our affliction !"
Mr. Hume's heart was smitten; and I have heard
him long after confess that there were moments when
the remembrance overcame him even to weakness;
when, amidst all the pleasures of philosophical dis-
covery, and the pride of literary fame, he recalled to
his mind the venerable figure of the good La Roche,
and wished that he had never doubted!
MODERN GALLANTRY.-C. LAMB.
In comparing modern with ancient manners, we are
pleased to compliment ourselves upon the point of gal-
lantry; a certain obsequiousness, or deferential re-
spect, which we are supposed to pay to females, as
females. I shall believe that this principle animates
our conduct, when I can forget, that in the nineteenth

century from the era when we date our civility, we
are but just beginning to leave off the very frequent
practice of whipping females in public, in common
with the coarsest male offenders. I shall believe it to
be influential, when I can shut my eyes to the fact,
that in England women are still occasionally-hanged.
I shall believe in it, when Dorimant hands a fish-wife
across the kennel, or assists the apple-woman to pick
up her wandering fruit, which some unlucky dray has
just dissipated. I shall believe in it, when the Dori-
mants in humbler life, who would be thought, in their
way, notable adepts in refinement, shall act upon it in
places where they are not known, or think themselves
not observed-when I shall see the traveller for some
rich tradesman part with his admired box-coat, to
spread it over the defenceless shoulders of the poor
woman who is passing to her parish, on the roof of
the same stage-coach with him, drenched with the
rain-when I shall no longer see a woman standing
up in the pit of a London theatre, till she is sick and
faint with the exertion, with men about her, seated at
their ease, and jeering at her distress; till one that
seems to have more manners or conscience than the
rest, significantly declares "she should be welcome to
his seat if she were a little younger and handsomer."
Place this dapper warehouseman, or that rider, in a
circle of their own female acquaintance, and you shall
confess you have not seen a politer bred man in Loth-
bury. Lastly, I shall begin to believe that there is
some such principle influencing our conduct, when
more than one half the drudgery and coarse ser-

vitude of the world shall cease to be performed by
woman.
Until that day comes, I shall never believe this
boasted point to be anything more than a conventional
fiction; a pageant got up between the sexes, in a cer-
tain rank and at a certain time of life, in which both
find their account equally. I shall be even disposed
to rank it among the salutary fictions of life, when in
polite circles I shall see the same attentions paid to
age as to youth, to homely features as to handsome,
to coarse complexions as to clear-to the woman, as
she is a woman, not as she is a beauty, a fortune, or a
title. I shall believe it to be something more than a
name, when a well-dressed gentleman in a well-
dressed company can advert to the topic of female
old age without exciting, and intending to excite, a
sneer:when the phrases "antiquated virginity," and
such a one has "overstood her market," pronounced
in good company, shall raise immediate offence in
man, or woman, that shall hear them spoken.
CHARACTER OF PITT, (LORD CHATHAM.)
GRATTAN.
THE secretary stood alone. Modern degeneracy
had not reached him. Original and unaccommodating,
the features of his character had the hardihood of an-
tiquity. His august mind overawed majesty; and
one of his sovereigns thought royalty so impaired in
his presence, that he conspired to remove him, in or-
der to be relieved from his superiority. No state chi-

canery, no narrow system of vicious politics, sunk him
to the vulgar level of the great; but, overbearing, per-
suasive, and impracticable, his object was England,
his ambition was fame. Without dividing, he de-
stroyed party; without corrupting, he made a venal
age unanimous. France sunk beneath him. With one
hand he smote the house of Bourbon, and wielded in
the other the democracy of England. The sight of
his mind was infinite; and his schemes were to affect,
not England, not the present age only, but Europe and
posterity. Wonderful were the means by which these
schemes were accomplished; always seasonable, al-
ways adequate, the suggestions of an understanding
animated by ardor, and enlightened by prophecy.
The ordinary feelings which make life amiable and
indolent were unknown to him. No domestic diffi-
culties, no domestic weakness, reached him; but aloof
from the sordid occurrences of his life, and unsullied
by its intercourse, he came bccasionally into our sys-
tem to counsel and to decide.
A character so exalted, so strenuous, so various, so
authoritative, astonished a corrupt age, and the treasu
ry trembled at the name of Pitt through all the classes
of venality. Corruption imagined, indeed, that she
had found defects in this statesman, and talked much
of the inconsistency of his glory, and the ruin of his vic-
tories; but the history of his country and the calami-
ties of the enemy answered and refuted her. Nor
were his political abilities his only talents: his elo-
quence was, an era in the senate, peculiar and sponta-
neous, familiarly expressing gigantic sentiments and

instinctive wisdom; not like the torrent of Demo
thenes, or the splendid conflagration of Tully; it re-
sembled sometimes the thunder, and sometimes the
music of the spheres. Like Murray, he did not conduct
the understanding through the painful subtlety of ar-
gumentation; nor was he, like Townsend, for ever on
the rack of exertion; but rather lightened upon the
subject, and reached the point by the flashings of the
mind, which, like those of his eye, were felt, but could
not be followed. Upon the whole, there was in this
man something that could create, subvert, or reform;
an understanding, a spirit, and an eloquence to sum-
mon mankind to society, or to break the bonds of
slavery asunder, and to rule the wilderness of free
minds with unbounded authority; something that
could establish and overwhelm empire, and strike a
blow in the world that should resound through the
universe.

a will, despotic in its dictates,-an energy that dis-

touch of interest, marked the outline of this extraor-

or fell.

Flung into life, in the midst of a Revolution, that
quickened every energy of a people who acknow-
ledged no superior, he commenced his course
stranger by birth, and a scholar by charity. With
no friend but his sword, and no fortune but his
talents, he rushed into the lists where rank and genius
had arrayed themselves, and competition fled from
him as from the glance of destiny. He knew no motive
but interest-he acknowledged no criterion but suc-
cess-he worshipped no God but ambition; and with
an eastern devotion, he knelt at the altar of his idola-
try. Subsidiary to this, there was no creed that he
did not profess, there was no opinion that he did not
promulgate in the hope of a dynasty, he upheld
the crescent; for the sake of a divorce, he bowed be-
fore the Cross: the orphan of St. Louis, he became the
adopted child of the republic; and with a parricidal
ingratitude, on the ruins both of the throne and the
tribune, he reared the throne of his despotism. A pro-
fessed Catholic, he imprisoned the Pope; a pretended
patriot, he impoverished the country; and under the
name of Brutus, he grasped without remorse, and
wore without shame, the diadem of the Cæsars!

crowns crumbled, beggars reigned, systems vanished,
the wildest theories took the color of his whims, and
all that was venerable, and all that was novel,
changed places with the rapidity of a drama. Even
apparent defeat assumed the appearance of victory—
his flight from Egypt confirmed his destiny-ruin it-
self only elevated him to Empire. But, if his fortune
was great, his genius was transcendent, decision
flashed upon his counsels and it was the same to de-
cide and to perform. To inferior intellects, his com-
binations appeared perfectly impossible, his plans per-
fectly impracticable; but, in his hands, simplicity
marked their developement, and success vindicated
their adoption. His person partook of the character
of his mind; if the one never yielded in the cabinet,
the other never bent in the field. Nature had no ob-
stacles that he did not surmount, space no opposition
that he did not spurn;-and whether, amid Alpine
rocks, Arabian sands, or polar snows, he seemed proof
against peril, and empowered with ubiquity. The
whole continent of Europe trembled at beholding the
andacity of his designs, and the miracle of their exe-
cution. Scepticism bowed to the prodigies of his per-
formance; romance assumed the air of history; nor
was there aught too incredible for belief, or too fanci-
ful for expectation, when the world saw a subaltern
of Corsica waving his imperial flag over her most an-
cient capitals. All the visions of antiquity became
common places in his contemplation; kings were his
people-nations were his outposts; and he disposed
of courts, and crowns, and camps, and churches, and

cabinets, as if they were the titular dignitaries of the
chess-board.
Amid all these changes, he stood immutable as
adamant. It mattered little whether in the field or
the drawing-room-with the mob or the levee-wear-
ing the jacobin bonnet or the iron crown-banishing
a Braganza, or espousing a Hapsburgh-dictating
peace on a raft to the Czar of Russia, or contemplating
defeat at the gallows of Leipsic-he was still the
same military despot.
Cradled in the camp, he was to the last hour the
darling of the army; and whether in the camp or the
cabinet, he never forsook a friend, or forgot a favor.
Of all his soldiers, not one abandoned him, till affec-
tion was useless; and their first stipulation was for
the safety of their favorite. They knew well that if
he was lavish of them, he was prodigal of himself;
and that if he exposed them to peril, he repaid them
with plunder. For the soldier, he subsidized every
people; to the people, he made even pride pay tribute.
The victorious veteran glittered with his gains; and
the capital, gorgeous with the spoils of art, became
the miniature metropolis of the universe. In this
wonderful combination, his affectation of literature
must not be omitted. The jailor of the press, he af-
fected the patronage of letters-the proscriber of books,
he encouraged philosophy-the persecutor of authors,
and the murderer of printers, he yet pretended to the
patronage of learning-the assassin of Palm, the si-
lencer of De Stael, and the denouncer of Kotzebue, he
was the friend of David, the benefactor of De Lille, and

sent his academic prize to the philosopher of England.*
-Such a medley of contradictions, and at the same
time such an individual consistency, were never united
in the same character. A royalist, a republican, and
an emperor-a Mahometan, a Catholic, and a patron
of the Synagogue-a traitor and a tyrant-a Christian
and an Infidel-he was, through all his vicissitudes,
the same stern, impatient, inflexible original-the
same mysterious, incomprehensible self-the man
without a model, and without a shadow. His fall, like
his life, baffled all speculation. In short, his whole
history was like a dream to the world; and no man
can tell how or why he was awakened from the reverie.
Such is a faint and feeble picture of Napoleon
Bonaparte; the first, (and it is to be hoped, the last,)
Emperor of the French. That he has done much
evil, there is little doubt: that he has been the origin
of much good, there is just as little. Through his
means, intentional or not, Spain, Portugal, and France,
have arisen to the blessings of a free constitution ;
superstition has found her grave in the ruins of the
Inquisition; and the feudal system, with its whole
train of tyrannic satellites, has fled for ever. Kings
may learn from him that their safest study, as well as
their noblest, is the interest of the people; the people
are taught by him that there is no despotism so stupen-
dous against which they have not a resource; and to
those who would rise upon the ruins of both, he is a liv-
ing lesson, that if ambition can raise them from the low-
est station, it can also prostrate them from the highest.

AGAINST THE CHARGE OF BRITISH PREDILEC-
TION. RANDOLPH, (1811.)
AGAINST Whom are these charges of British predilec-
tion brought? Against men, who, in the war of the
Revolution, were in the councils of the nation, or
fighting the battles of your country. It is insuffera-
ble: it cannot be borne. It must and ought, with se-
verity to be put down in this house, and out of it to
meet the lie direct! Strange, that we should have no
objection to any other people or government, civilized
or savage, in the whole world! The great Autocrat
of all the Russias receives the homage of our high
consideration. The Dey of Algiers and his divan of
pirates, are very civil good sort of people, with whom
we find no difficulty in maintaining the relations of
peace and amity. Turks, Jews, and Infidels, Melim-
elli or the Little Turtle; barbarians and savages of
every clime and every color, are welcome to our arms.
With chiefs of banditti, negro or mulatto, we can treat
and can trade. Name, however, but England, and all
our antipathies are up in arms against her. Against

whom? Against those whose blood runs in our veins;
in common with whom we claim Shakspeare, and
Newton, and Chatham, for our countrymen; whose
form of government is the freest on earth, our own
only excepted; from whom every valuable principle of
our own institutions has been borrowed-representa-
tion-trial by jury-voting the supplies-writ of
habeas corpus--our whole civil and criminal juris-
prudence ;-against our fellow-Protestants, identified
in blood, in language, in religion with ourselves!
In what school did the worthies of our land, the
Washingtons, Henrys, Hancocks, Franklins, Rut-
ledges of America, learn those principles of civil liber-
ty, which were so nobly asserted by their wisdom and
their valor? American resistance to British usurpa-
tion has not been more warmly cherished by these
great men and their compatriots-by Washington,
Hancock and Henry-than by Chatham, and his il-
lustrious associates in the British Parliament. It
ought to be remembered, too, that the heart of the
English people was with us in our struggle. It was
a selfish and corrupt ministry, and their servile tools,
to whom we were not more opposed than they were.
I trust that none such may ever exist among us; for
tools will never be wanting to subserve the purposes,
however ruinous or wicked, of kings and ministers of
state. I acknowledge the influence of a Shakspeare
and a Milton upon my imagination, of a Locke upon
my understanding, of a Sydney upon my political
principles, of a Chatham upon qualities, which, would

THE ADVANTAGES OF CLASSICAL LEARNING.
STORY.
THE importance of classical learning to professional
education is so obvious, that the surprise is, that it
could ever have become matter of disputation. I
speak not of its power in refining the taste, in disci-
plining the judgment, in invigorating the understand-
ing, or in warming the heart with elevated sentiments;
but of its power of direct, positive, necessary instruc-
tion. Until the eighteenth century, the mass of sci-
ence, in its principal branches, was deposited in the
dead languages, and much of it still reposes there.
To be ignorant of these languages is to shut out the
lights of former times, or to examine them only
through the glimmerings of inadequate translations.
What should we say of the jurist who never aspired
to learn the maxims of law and equity which adorn
the Roman codes? What of the physician who could
deliberately surrender all the knowledge heaped up,
for so many centuries, in the Latinity of continental
Europe? What of the minister of religion who
should choose not to study the Scriptures in the ori
ental tongue, and should be content to trust his faith
and his hopes, for time and for eternity, to the dimness
of translations which may reflect the literal import,

but rarely can reflect, with unbroken force, the beau-
tiful spirit of the text? Shall he, whose vocation it is
"to allure to brighter worlds, and lead the way," be
himself the blind leader of the blind? Shall he pro-
claim the doctrines of salvation, who knows not and
cares not, whether he preaches an idle gloss or the
genuine text of revelation? If a theologian may not
pass his life in collating the various readings, he may
and ought to aspire to that criticism which illustrates
religion by all the resources of human learning-
which studies the manners and institutions of the age
and country in which Christianity was first promul-
gated-which kindles an enthusiasm for its precepts
by familiarity with the persuasive language of Him
who poured out his blessings on the innocent, and of
Him at whose impressive appeal Felix trembled.
I pass over all consideration of the written treasures
of antiquity which have survived the wreck of em-
pires and dynasties-of instrumental trophies and tri-
umphal arches of palaces of princes and temples of
the gods. I pass over all consideration of those ad-
mired compositions in which wisdom speaks as with
a voice from heaven; of those sublime efforts of poeti-
cal genius, which still freshen, as they pass from age
to age, with undying vigor; of those finished histories
which still enlighten and instruct governments in
their duty and their destiny; of those matchless ora-
tions which roused nations to arms and chained sen-
ates to the chariot wheels of all-conquering eloquence.
These all may now be read in our vernacular tongue.
Aye; as one remembers the face of a dead friend, by

gathering up the broken fragments of his image;-as
one listens to the tale of a dream twice-told ;-as one
catches the roar of the ocean in the ripple of a rivu-
let;
-as one sees the blaze of noon in the first glim-
mer of twilight.
There is one objection, however, on which I would
for a moment dwell, because it has a commanding in-
fluence over many minds, and is clothed with a spe-
cions importance. It is often said, that there have
been eminent men and eminent writers, to whom the
ancient languages were unknown,-men who have
risen by the force of their own talents, and writers
who have written with a purity and ease which hold
them up as models for imitation. On the other hand,
it is as often said, that scholars do not always com-
pose either with ease or chasteness; that their diction.
is sometimes loose and harsh, and sometimes ponder-
ous and affected. Be it so: I am not disposed to call
in question the accuracy of either statement. But I
would, nevertheless, say that the presence of classical
learning was not the cause of the faults of the one
class, nor the absence of it the cause of the excellence
of the other. And I would put this fact, as an answer
to all such reasonings, that there is not a single lan-
guage of modern Europe, in which literature has made
any considerable advances, which is not directly of
Roman origin, or has not incorporated into its very
structure many, very many, of the idioms and peculi-
arities of the ancient tongues. The English language
affords a strong illustration of the truth of this remark:
it abounds with words and meanings drawn from clas-

262
PRACTICE OF ELOCUTION.
sical sources. Innumerable phrases retain the sym-
metry of their ancient dress. Innumerable expressions
have received their vivid tints from the beautiful dyes
of Roman and Grecian roots. If scholars, therefore,
do not write our language with ease, or purity, or ele-
gance, the cause must lie somewhat deeper than a
conjectural ignorance of its true diction.
There is not a single nation, from the north to the
south of Europe-from the bleak shores of the Baltic
to the bright plains of immortal Italy-whose litera-
ture is not imbedded in the very elements of classical
learning. The literature of England is, in an em-
phatic sense, the production of her scholars-of men
who have cultivated letters in her universities, and
colleges, and grammar schools-of men who thought
any life too short, chiefly because it left some relic of
antiquity unmastered, and any other fame humble,
because it faded in the presence of Roman and
Grecian genius. It is no exaggeration to declare, that
he who proposes to abolish classical studies, proposes
to render, in a great measure, inert and unedifying
the mass of English literature for three centuries; to
rob us of much of the glory of the past, and much of
the instruction of future ages; to blind us to excel-
lences which few may hope to equal and none to sur-
pass; to annihilate associations which are interwoven
with our best sentiments, and give to distant times
and countries a presence and reality, as if they were,
in fact, our own.

EXTRACT FROM EMMET'S SPEECH BEFORE SEN-
TENCE OF DEATH BEING PASSED ON HIM.
MY LORDS,-
What have I to say, why sentence of death should
not be pronounced on me, according to law?--I have
nothing to say that can alter your predetermination,
nor that it will become me to say, with any view to
the mitigation of that sentence which you are here to
pronounce, and I must abide by. But I have that to
say, which interests me more than life, and which
you have labored, (as was necessarily your office in
the present circumstances of this oppressed country,)
to destroy. I have much to say, why my reputation
should be rescued from the load of false accusation
and calumny which has been heaped upon it. I do
not imagine that, seated where you are, your minds
can be so free from impurity, as to receive the least
impression from what I am going to utter. I have no
hopes that I can anchor my character in the breast of
a Court constituted and trammelled as this is.-I only
wish, and it is the utmost I expect, that your lordships
may suffer it to float down your memories untainted
by the foul breath of prejudice, until it find some more
hospitable harbor to shelter it from the storm by
which it is at present buffeted.
Were I only to suffer death, after being adjudged
guilty by your tribunal, I should bow in silence, and
meet the fate that awaits me without a murmur: but
the sentence of law which delivers my body to the
executioner, will, through the ministry of that law,

labor, in its own vindication, to consign my character
to obloquy-for there must be guilt somewhere:
whether in the sentence of the Court, or in the catas-
trophe, posterity must determine. A man in my situ-
ation, my lords, has not only to encounter the difficul-
ties of fortune, and the force of power over minds
which it has corrupted or subjugated, but the difficul-
ties of established prejudice. The man dies, but his
memory lives. That mine may not perish, that it
may live in the respect of my countrymen, I seize
upon this opportunity to vindicate myself from some
of the charges alleged against me. When my spirit
shall be wafted to a more friendly port; when my shade
shall have joined the bands of those martyred heroes
who have shed their blood on the scaffold and in the
field, in defence of their country and virtue, this is my
hope,-I wish that my memory and name may ani-
mate those who survive me, while I look down with
complacency on the destruction of that perfidious
government, which upholds its domination by blas-
phemy of the Most High-which displays its power
over man as over the beasts of the forest-which sets
man upon his brother, and lifts his hand, in the name
of God, against the throat of his fellow who believes
or doubts a little more or less than the government
standard-a government which is steeled to barbarity
by the cries of the orphans and the tears of the
widows which its cruelty has made.
I swear by the throne of Heaven, before which I
must shortly appear-by the blood of the murdered
patriots who have gone before me-that my conduct

has been, through all this peril, and all my purposes,
governed only by the convictions which I have utter-
ed, and by no other view than that of the emancipa-
tion of my country from the superinhuman oppression
under which she has so long, and too patiently, tra-
vailed; and that I confidently and assuredly hope,
(wild and chimerical as it may appear,) there is still
union and strength in Ireland to accomplish this noble
enterprise.
Let no man dare, when I am dead, to charge me
with dishonor; let no man attaint my memory by be-
lieving that I could have engaged in any cause but
that of my country's liberty and independence; or that
I could have become the pliant minion of power, in
the oppression or the miseries of my countrymen.
The proclamation of the provisional government
speaks for our views; no inference can be tortured
from it to countenance barbarity or debasement at
home, or subjection, humiliation, or treachery from
abroad. I would not have submitted to a foreign op-
pressor, for the same reason that I would resist the
domestic tyrant; in the dignity of freedom, I would
have fought upon the threshold of my country, and
her enemy should enter only by passing over my life-
less corpse. Am I, who lived but for my country, and
who have subjected myself to the vengeance of the
jealous and watchful oppressor, and to the bondage of
the grave, only to give my countrymen their rights,-
am I to be loaded with calumny, and not to be suffer-
ed to resent or repel it? No,-God forbid !

illustrious dead participate in

of my departed father, look down with scrutiny on the
conduct of your suffering son; and see if I have even
for a moment deviated from those principles of moral-
ity and patriotism which it was your care to instil into
my youthful mind,-and for an adherence to which I
am now to offer up my life!
My lords, you are impatient for the sacrifice-the
blood which you seek, is not congealed by the artifi-
cial terrors which surround your victim; it circulates
warmly and unruffled, through the channels which
God created for noble purposes, but which you are
bent to destroy, for purposes so grievous that they cry
to heaven!-Be yet patient! I have but a few words
more to say.-I am going to my silent grave: my
lamp of life is nearly extinguished: my race is run :
the grave opens to receive me, and I sink into its bo-
som.-I have but one request to ask at my departure
from this world,-it is the charity of its silence. Let
no man write my epitaph: for, as no one who knows
my motives dare now vindicate them, let not preju-
dice or ignorance asperse them. Let them and me
repose in obscurity and peace, and my tomb remain
uninscribed, -until other times, and other men, can
do justice to my character. When my country shall
take her place among the nations of the earth, then,
and not till then, let my epitaph be written!

ever stained earth or shocked high heaven? at the
ferocious deeds of a savage and infuriated soldiery,
stimulated and urged on by the clergy of a fanatical

the whole of a miserable trade, and lose its liberties?

The atrocious crime of being a young man, which
the honorable gentleman has, with such spirit and de-
cency, charged upon me, I shall neither attempt to
palliate nor deny; but content myself with wishing
that I may be one of those whose follies may cease
with their youth, and not of that number who are ig-
norant in spite of experience. Whether youth can be

imputed to any man as a reproach, I will not, sir, as-
sume the province of determining; but surely age
may become justly contemptible, if the opportunities
which it brings have passed away without improve-
ment, and vice appear to prevail when the passions
have subsided. The wretch who, after having seen
the consequences of a thousand errors, continues still
to blunder, and whose age has only added obstinacy
to stupidity, is surely the object either of abhorrence,
or contempt, and deserves not that his gray hairs
should secure him from insult. Much more, sir, is he
to be abhorred who, as he has advanced in age, has
receded from virtue, and become more wicked with
less temptation; who prostitutes himself for money
which he cannot enjoy, and spends the remains of his
life in the ruin of his country.
But youth, sir, is not my only crime; I have been
accused of acting a theatrical part. A theatrical part
may either imply some peculiarities of gesture, or a
dissimulation of my real sentiments, and an adoption
of the opinions and language of another man.
In the first sense, sir, the charge is too trifling to be
confuted, and deserves only to be mentioned that it
may be despised. I am at liberty, like every other
man, to use my own language; and though, perhaps,
I may have some ambition to please this gentleman, I
shall not lay myself under any restraint, nor very so-
licitously copy his diction or his mien, however ma-
tured by age, or modelled by experience. But if any
man shall, by charging me with theatrical behaviour,
imply that I utter any sentiments but my own, I shall

treat him as a calumniator and a villain; nor shall
any protection shelter him from the treatment he de-
serves. I shall, on such an occasion, without scruple,
trample upon all those forms with which wealth and
dignity intrench themselves; nor shall anything, but
age, restrain my resentment,--age, which always
brings one privilege, that of being insolent and super-
cilious without punishment.
But with regard, sir, to those whom I have offend-
ed, I am of opinion that if I had acted a borrowed
part, I should have avoided their censure: the heat
that offended them is the ardor of conviction, and that
zeal for the service of my country which neither hope
nor fear shall influence me to suppress. I will not sit
unconcerned while my liberty is invaded, nor look in
silence upon public robbery. I will exert my endea-
vors, at whatever hazard, to repel the aggressor, and
drag the thief to justice, whoever may protect him in
his villany, and whoever may partake of his plunder.

while his reputation abroad reflects the highest honor
on his country and its institutions. I would cheer-
fully put the question to-day to the intelligence of Eu-
rope and the world, what character of the century,
upon the whole, stands out in the relief of history,
most pure, most respectable, most sublime; and I
doubt not, that, by a suffrage approaching to unani-
mity, the answer would be Washington!
This structure,* by its uprightness, its solidity, its
durability, is no unfit emblem of his character. His
public virtues and public principles were as firm as
the earth on which it stands; his personal motives as
pure as the serene heaven in which its summit is lost.
But, indeed, though a fit, it is an inadequate emblem.

vindication of our transatlantic liberty. Born upon

our fervid liberty can be combined with law, with
order, with the security of property, with the pursuit

AGAINST PAINE'S AGE OF REASON. ERSKINE.
BUT it seems this is an Age of Reason, and the
time, and the person, are at last arrived, that are to
dissipate the errors which have overspread the past
generations of ignorance. The believers in Christi-
anity are many, but it belongs to the few that are
wise to correct their credulity. Belief is an act of
reason, and superior reason may, therefore, dictate to
the weak. In running the mind along the long list of
sincere and devout Christians, I cannot help lament-
ing that Newton had not lived to this day, to have
had his shallowness filled up with this new flood of
light.
But the subject is too awful for irony.--I will speak
plainly and directly. Newton was a Christian! New-
ton, whose mind burst forth from the fetters fastened
by Nature upon our finite conceptions-Newton,
whose science was truth, and the foundation of whose
knowledge of it was philosophy-not those visionary
and arrogant presumptions which too often usurp its
name, but philosophy resting on the basis of mathe-
matics, which, like figures, cannot lie-Newton, who
carried the line and rule to the uttermost barriers of
creation, and explored the principles by which all
created matter exists and is held together.
* The irony with which Erskine ridicules Paine's preten-
sions to superior wisdom, in this speech, must be distinctly
marked. This extract is therefore a good practice on compound

But this extraordinary man, in the mighty reach of
his mind, overlooked, perhaps, the errors, which a
minuter investigation of the created things on this
earth might have taught him. What, then, shall be
said of the great Mr. Boyle,-who looked into the or-
ganic structure of all matter, even to the inanimate
substances which the foot treads upon ?-Such a man
may be supposed to have been equally qualified with
Mr. Paine, to look up through Nature to Nature's
God! Yet the result of all his contemplations was
the most confirmed and devout belief in all which the
other holds in contempt, as despicable and drivelling
superstition.
But this error might, perhaps, arise from a want of
due attention to the foundations of human judgment,
and the structure of that understanding which God
has given us for the investigation of truth.-Let that
question be answered by Mr. Locke, who, to the high-
est pitch of devotion and adoration, was a Christian !
-Mr. Locke, whose office it was to detect the errors
of thinking, by going up to the very fountain of
thought; and to direct into the proper tract of reason-
ing, the devious mind of man, by showing him its
whole process, from the first perceptions of sense, to
the last conclusions of ratiocination :-putting a rein
upon false opinion, by practical rules for the conduct
of human judgment.
But these men, it may be said, were only deep
thinkers, and lived in their closets, unaccustomed to
the traffic of the world, and to the laws which prac-
tically regulate mankind.-Gentlemen! in the place

where we now sit to administer the justice of this
great country, the never-to-be-forgotten Sir Matthew
Hale presided ;-whose faith in Christianity is an ex-
alted commentary upon its truth and reason, and
whose life was a glorious example of its fruits :-whose
justice, drawn from the pure fountain of the Christian
dispensation, will be, in all ages, a subject of the
highest reverence and admiration.
But it is said by the author, that the Christian fable
is but the tale of the more ancient superstitions of the
world, and may be easily detected by a proper under-
standing of the mythologies of the Heathens.-Did
Milton understand those mythologies?-was he less
versed than Mr. Paine in the superstitions of the
world? No, they were the subject of his immortal
song; and though shut out from all recurrence to
them, he poured them forth from the stores of a me-
mory rich with all that man ever knew, and laid
them in their order as the illustration of real and ex-
alted faith ;-the unquestionable source of that fervid
genius which has cast a kind of shade upon all the
other works of man.
He pass'd the bounds of flaming space,
Where angels tremble while they gaze—
He saw-till blasted with excess of light,
He closed his eyes in endless night!
But it was the light of the body only, that was ex-
tinguished; "the celestial light shone inward, and
enabled him to justify the ways of God to man.”-
The result of his thinking was, nevertheless, not quite
the same as that of the author before us.

terious incarnation of our blessed Saviour, (which this
work blasphemes, in words so wholly unfit for the
mouth of a Christian, and the ears of a court of jus-
tice, that I dare not, and will not give them utterance,)
Milton made the grand conclusion of his Paradise
Lost, the rest from his finished labors, and the ulti-
mate hope, expectation, and glory of the world.
A virgin is his mother, but his sire,
The power of the Most High ;-he shall ascend
The throne hereditary, and bound his reign
With earth's wide bounds, his glory with the heavens!
Thus you find all that is great, or wise, or splendid,
or illustrious, amongst created beings-all the minds
gifted beyond ordinary nature, if not inspired by its
universal Author, for the advancement and dignity of
the world, though divided by distant ages, and by
clashing opinions, yet joining, as it were, in one sub-
lime chorus, to celebrate the truths of Christianity,
and laying upon its holy altars the never-fading offer-
ings of their immortal wisdom.

AWAKE, Æolian lyre, awake,
And give to rapture all thy trembling strings!
From Helicon's harmonious springs,
A thousand rills their mazy progress take;
The laughing flowers that round them blow
Drink life and fragrance as they flow.
Now the rich stream of music winds along,
Deep, majestic, smooth, and strong,
Through verdant vales and Ceres' golden reign:
Now rushing down the steep amain,
Headlong, impetuous see it pour;
The rocks and nodding groves rebellow to the roar!
Oh! sovereign of the willing soul,
Parent of sweet and solemn-breathing airs,
Enchanting shell! the sullen cares
And frantic passions hear thy soft control.
On Thracia's hills the lord of war
Has curb'd the fury of his car,
And dropp'd his thirsty lance at thy command:
Perching on the scepter'd hand

Of Jove, thy magic lulls the feather'd king
With ruffled plumes and flagging wing:
Quench'd in dark clouds of slumber, lie
The terror of his beak, and lightning of his eye.
Thee the voice, the dance obey,
Temper'd to thy warbled lay;
O'er Idalia's velvet green
The rosy-crowned loves are seen
On Cytherea's day,
With antic sports and blue-ey'd pleasures
Frisking light in frolic measures:
Now pursuing, now retreating,
Now in circling troops they meet;
To brisk notes, in cadence beating,
Glance their many-twinkling feet.
Slow, melting strains their Queen's approach declare;
Where'er she turns the graces homage pay,
With arts sublime, that float upon the air;
In gliding state she wins her easy way:
O'er her warm cheek and rising bosom, move
The bloom of young Desire, and purple light of Love.

Man's feeble race what ills await,-
Labor, and Penury, the racks of Pain,
Disease, and Sorrow's weeping train,
And Death, sad refuge from the storms of Fate!
The fond complaint, my song, disprove,
And justify the laws of Jove.
Say, has he giv'n in vain the heav'nly Muse?
Night, and all her sickly dews,
Her spectres wan, and birds of boding cry,
He gives to range the dreary sky:
Till down the eastern cliffs afar,
Hyperion's march they spy, and glittering shafts of war.

In climes beyond the solar road,
Where shaggy forms o'er ice-built mountains roam,
The Muse has broke the twilight gloom,
To cheer the natives' dull abode.
And oft, beneath the odorous shade
Of Chili's boundless forests laid,
She deigns to hear the savage youth repeat,
In loose numbers wildly sweet,
Their feather-cinctur'd chiefs, and dusky loves.
Her track, where'er the Goddess roves,
Glory pursues, and generous shame,
Th' unconquerable mind, and Freedom's holy flame.
Woods that wave o'er Delphi's steep,
Isles that crown the Ægean deep,
Fields, that cool Ilissus laves,
Or where Mæander's amber waves
In lingering labyrinths creep,
How do your tuneful echoes languish,
Mute, but to the voice of Anguish?
Where each old poetic mountain
Inspiration breath'd around,
Every shade and hallow'd fountain
Murmur'd deep a solemn sound:
Till the sad Nine, in Greece's evil hour,
Left their Parnassus for the Latin plains,
Alike they scorn the pomp of tyrant Power,
And coward Vice, that revels in her chains;
When Latium had her lofty spirit lost,
They sought, O Albion! next thy sea-encircled coast.

Communion with her visible forms, she speaks
A various language. For his gayer hours

To mix for ever with the elements;
To be a brother to the insensible rock,
And to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain
Turns with his share, and treads upon. The oak
Shall send his roots abroad and pierce thy mould.
Yet not to thy eternal resting-place
Shalt thou retire alone; nor could'st thou wish

With patriarchs of the infant world—with kings,
The powerful of the earth-the wise, the good,
Fair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,
All in one mighty sepulchre! The hills
Rock-ribb'd and ancient as the sun; the vales,
Stretching in pensive quietness between;
The venerable woods; rivers that move
In majesty; and the complaining brooks,
That make the meadow green; and, pour'd round all
Old Ocean's grey and melancholy waste,-
Are but the solemn decorations all
Of the great tomb of man. The golden sun,
The planets, all the infinite host of heav'n,
Are shining as the sad abodes of death,
Thro' the still lapse of ages. All that tread
The globe are but a handful to the tribes
That slumber in its bosom. Take the wings
Of morning, and the Barcan desert pierce;
Or lose thyself in the continuous woods
Where rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound,
Save of his own dashings; yet,-the dead are there;
And millions in those solitudes, since first
The flight of years began, have laid them down

Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care
Plod on, and each one, as before, will chase
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come,
And make their bed with thee. As the long train
Of ages glide away,-the sons of men,
The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes
In the full strength of years, matron, and maid,
The bowed with age, the infant, in the smiles
And beauty of its innocence cut off-
Shall, one by one, be gather'd to thy side,
By those who in their turn shall follow them!
So live, that, when thy summons comes to join
The innumerable caravan, that moves
To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take
His chamber in the silent halls of death,
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,
Scourg'd to his dungeon; but, sustain'd and sooth'd
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams!

AT summer eve, when Heaven's ethereal bow
Spans with bright arch the glittering hills below,
Why to yon mountains turns the musing eye,
Whose sunbright summit mingles with the sky?
Why do those cliffs of shadowy tint appear
More sweet than all the landscape smiling near?
'Tis distance lends enchantment to the view,
And robes the mountain in its azure hue.

Thus, with delight, we linger to survey
The promised joys of life's unmeasured way;
Thus, from afar, each dim-discovered scene
More pleasing seems than all the past have been,
And every form, that Fancy can repair
From dark oblivion, glows divinely there.
What potent spirit guides the raptured eye
To pierce the shades of dim futurity?
Can Wisdom lend, with all her heavenly power,
The pledge of Joy's anticipated hour?
Ah, no! she darkly sees the fate of man-
Her dim horizon bounded to a span;
Or, if she hold a pleasure to the view,
'Tis Nature pictured too severely true.
With thee, sweet Hope! resides the heavenly light,
That pours remotest rapture on the sight:
Thine is the charm of life's bewilder'd way,
That calls each slumbering passion into play.
Waked by thy touch, I see the sister band,
On tiptoe watching, start at thy command,
And fly where'er thy mandate bids them steer,
To Pleasure's path, or Glory's bright career.

When Peace and Mercy, banish'd from the plain,
Sprung on the viewless winds to Heaven again,-
All, all forsook the friendless, guilty mind,
But HOPE, the charmer, linger'd still behind!

Wreaths for each toil, a charm for every woe;
Won by their sweets, in Nature's languid hour,
The way-worn pilgrim seeks thy summer bower;
There, as the wild bee murmurs on the wing,
What peaceful dreams thy handmaid spirits bring!
Angel of life! thy glittering wings explore
Earth's loneliest bounds, and Ocean's wildest shore:
Lo! to the wintry winds the pilot yields
His bark careering o'er unfathom'd fields;
Now on Atlantic waves he rides afar,
Where Andes, giant of the western star,
With meteor-standard to the winds unfurl'd,
Looks from his throne of clouds, o'er half the world!
Now far he sweeps, where scarce a summer smiles,
On Behring's rocks, or Greenland's naked isles;
Cold on his midnight watch, the breezes blow,
From wastes that slumber in eternal snow;
And waft, across the wave's tumultuous roar,
The wolf's long howl from Oonalaska's shore.
Poor child of danger, nursling of the storm,
Sad are the woes that wreck thy manly form!
Rocks, waves, and winds, the shatter'd bark delay

And sing to charm the spirit of the deep:
Swift as yon streamer lights the starry pole,
Her visions warm the watchman's pensive soul;

Thro' all the wide border his steel was the best,
And save his good broadsword, he weapons had none,
He rode all unarm'd, and he rode all alone!
So faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,
There never was knight like the young Lochinvar!
He stay'd not for brake, and he stopp'd not for stone,
He swam the Eske river where ford there was none;-
But ere he alighted at Netherby gate
The bride had consented,-the gallant came late:
For a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,
Was to wed the fair Ellen of young Lochinvar!
So, boldly he entered the Netherby Hall,
Among bridesmen, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all:-
Then spoke the bride's father, his hand on his sword,
(For the poor craven bridegroom said never a word!)
"Oh! come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,
Or to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar ?"
"I long woo'd your daughter, my suit you denied:
Love swells like the Solway,—but ebbs like its tide:
And now I am come, with this lost love of mine,
To lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine!
There are maidens in Scotland, more lovely by far,-
That would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar !”
The bride kiss'd the goblet,-the knight took it up,—
He quaff'd off the wine, and he threw down the cup.

In mighty graduations, part by part,
The glory which at once upon thee did not dart,-

Is but of gradual grasp; and, as it is
That what we have of feeling most intense
Outstrips our faint expression, even so this

Till, growing with its growth, we thus dilate

Then pause and be enlighten'd; there is more
In such a survey than the sating gaze
Of wonder pleased, or awe which would adore
The worship of the place, or the mere praise

The fountain of sublimity displays
Its depth, and thence may draw the mind of man
Its golden sands, and learn what great conceptions can.

NIGHT closed around the conqueror's way,
And lightnings show'd the distant hill,
Where those who lost that dreadful day
Stood, few and faint, but fearless still!
The soldier's hope, the patron's zeal,
For ever dimm'd, for ever cross'd-
Oh! who shall say what heroes feel,
When all but life and honor's lost!
The last sad hour of freedom's dream,
And valor's task, moved slowly by,
While mute they watch'd, till morning's beam
Should rise and give them light to die!—
There is a world where souls are free,
Where tyrants taint not nature's bliss;
If death that world's bright opening be,
Oh! who would live a slave in this?
SAUL.-BYRON.
I.
THOU whose spell can raise the dead,
Bid the prophet's form appear,-
"Samuel, raise thy buried head!
King, behold the phantom seer!"
Earth yawn'd; he stood, the centre of a cloud;
Light changed its hue, retiring from his shroud.
Death stood all glassy in his fixed eye;
His hand was wither'd, and his veins were dry;
His foot, in bony whiteness glitter'd there,
Shrunken and sinewless, and ghastly bare;
From lips that moved not, and unbreathing frame,
Like cavern'd winds, the hollow accents came.

"Why is my sleep disquieted?
Who is he that calls the dead?
Is it thou, O king? Behold,
Bloodless are these limbs, and cold:
Such are mine; and such shall be
Thine to-morrow, when with me:
Ere the coming day be done,
Such shalt thou be, such thy son!
Fare thee well! but for a day,
Then we mix our mouldering clay;
Then thy race, lie pale and low,
Pierced by shafts of many a bow;
And the falchion by thy side
To thy heart thy hand shall guide;
Crownless, breathless, headless, fall
Son and sire, the house of Saul!"
ELIZA.-Darwin.
Now stood Eliza on the wood-crowned height,
O'er Minden's plain, spectatress of the fight.
Sought with bold eye amid the bloody strife,
Her dearer self, the partner of her life;
From hill to hill the rushing host pursued,
And viewed his banner, or believed she viewed.
Pleased with the distant roar, with quicker tread
Fast by his hand one lisping boy she led ;
And one fair girl, amid the loud alarm,
Slept on her kerchief, cradled by her arm;
While round her brows bright beams of honor dart,
And love's warm eddies circle round her heart.

Near and more near the intrepid beauty prest,
Saw through the driving smoke his dancing crest;
Saw on his helm, her virgin hands inwove,
Bright stars of gold, and mystic knots of love;
Heard the exulting shout, "They run, they run !"
"Great heav'n!" she cried, "he's safe! the battle's won!'
A ball now hisses through the airy tides,
(Some fury winged it, and some demon guides!)
Parts the fine locks her graceful head that deck,
Wounds her fair ear and sinks into her neck;
The red stream issuing from her azure veins,
Dyes her white veil, her ivory bosom stains.
'Ah me!" she cried, and sinking on the ground,
Kiss'd her dear babes, regardless of the wound;
"Oh! cease not yet to beat, thou vital urn!
Wait, gushing life, oh wait my love's retnrn!"
Hoarse barks the wolf, the vulture screams from far;
The angel Pity shuns the ranks of war!
"Oh! spare, ye war-hounds, spare their tender age;
On me, on me," she cried, "exhaust your rage!"
Then with weak arms her weeping babes caress'd,
And, sighing, hid them in her blood-stain'd vest.
-From tent to tent the impatient warrior flies,
Fear in his heart and frenzy in his eyes;
Eliza's name along the camp he calls,-
"Eliza" echoes through the canvass walls.
Quick through the murmuring gloom his footsteps tread,
O'er groaning heaps, the dying and the dead;
Vault o'er the plain, and in the tangled wood
Lo! dead Eliza weltering in her blood!
Soon hears his listening son the welcome sounds,
With open arms and sparkling eye he bounds;
"Speak low," he cries, and gives his little hand,
"Eliza sleeps upon the dew-cold sand:"
Poor weeping babe with bloody fingers press'd,
And tried with pouting lips, her milkless breast:

"Alas! we both with cold and hunger quake-
Why do you weep? Mamma will soon awake."-
"She'll wake no more!" the hapless mourner cried,
Upturn'd his eyes, and clasp'd his hands and sigh'd;
Stretch'd on the ground awhile entranced he lay,
And press'd warm kisses on the lifeless clay:
And then upsprung, with wild convulsive start,
And all the father kindled in his heart:
"Oh heavens!" he cried, "my first rash vow forgive;
These bind to earth, for these I pray to live!"
Round his chill babes he wrapt his crimson vest,
And clasp'd them sobbing to his aching breast.
NIGHT.-MONTGOMERY.
NIGHT is the time for rest:
How sweet when labors close,
To gather round an aching breast
The curtain of repose,—
Stretch the tired limbs and lay the head
Upon our own delightful bed!
Night is the time for dreams:
The gay romance of life,-
When truth that is, and truth that seems,
Blend in fantastic strife:
Ah! visions less beguiling far,
Than waking dreams by daylight are !
-
Night is the time to weep:
To wet with unseen tears
Those graves of memory where sleep
The joys of other years;
Hopes that were angels in their birth,
But perish'd young, like things on earth!

Night is the time to watch;
On Ocean's dark expanse,
To hail the Pleiades, or catch
The full moon's earliest glance,
That brings unto the home-sick mind
All we have loved, and left behind.
Night is the time for care:
Brooding on hours misspent,
To see the spectre of despair
Come to our lonely tent;
Like Brutus, midst his slumb'ring host,
Startled by Cæsar's stalwart ghost.
Night is the time to muse:
Then, from the eye the soul
Takes flight, and, with expanding views,
Beyond the starry pole,
Descries athwart the abyss of night,
The dawn of uncreated light.
Night is the time to pray:
Our Saviour oft withdrew
To desert mountains far away;
So will his followers do ;-
Steal from the throng to haunts untrod,
And hold communion there with God.
Night is the time for death;
When all around is peace,
Calmly to yield the weary breath,
From sin and suffering cease:
Think of heaven's bliss, and give the sign
To parting friends :-such death be mine!*
* I have omitted the stanza beginning "Night is the time for
toil," because, however beautiful in expression, it inculcates a
false principle, inconsistent with a just economy of life.

MODERN GREECE.-BYRON.
He who hath bent him o'er the dead,
Ere the first day of death is fled,
The first dark day of nothingness,
The last of danger and distress-
Before Decay's effacing fingers
Have swept the lines where beauty lingers-
And mark'd the mild, angelic air,
The rapture of repose that's there,
The fix'd yet tender traits that streak
The languor of the placid cheek,
And-but for that sad shrouded eye,
That fires not, wins not, weeps not, now,-
And but for that chill, changeless brow,
Where cold Obstruction's apathy
Appals the gazing mourner's heart,
As if to him it could impart
The doom he dreads, yet dwells upon;
Yes, but for these, and these alone,
Some moments, aye, one treacherous hour,
He still might doubt the tyrant's power,
So fair, so calm, so softly seal'd,
The first, last look by death reveal'd!
Such is the aspect of this shore;
'Tis Greece, but living Greece no more!
So coldly sweet, so deadly fair,
We start, for soul is wanting there.
Her's is the loveliness in death,
That parts not quite, with parting breath;
But beauty with that fearful bloom,
That hue which haunts it to the tomb,
Expression's last receding ray,
A gilded halo hovering round decay,
The farewell beam of feeling past away,—

Spark of that flame, perchance of heavenly birth,
Which gleams, but warms no more its cherish'd earth!
Clime of the unforgotten brave!
Whose land, from plain to mountain cave,
Was Freedom's home, or Glory's grave,—
Shrine of the mighty! can it be,
That this is all remains of thee?
Approach, thou craven, crouching slave:
Say, is not this Thermopyla?
These waters blue that round you lave,-
Oh servile offspring of the free-
Pronounce what sea, what shore is this?—
The gulf, the rock of Salamis.
These scenes, their story not unknown,
Arise, and make again your own;
Snatch from the ashes of your sires
The embers of their former fires:
And he who in the strife expires,
Will add to theirs a name of fear,
That tyranny shall quake to hear;
And leave his sons a hope, a fame,
They too will rather die than shame:
For, Freedom's battle once begun,
Bequeath'd by bleeding sire to son,
Though baffled oft, is ever won.
Bear witness, Greece, thy living page
Attest it many a deathless age!
While kings, in dusty darkness hid,
Have left a nameless pyramid,
Thy heroes, though the general doom
Hath swept the column from their tomb,
A mightier monument command,-
The mountains of their native land!

THE LEPER.-WILLIS.
"ROOM for the leper! room!"-And, as he came
The cry pass'd on-❝ Room for the leper! room!"-
Sunrise was slanting on the city's gates,
Rosy and beautiful; and from the hills
The early risen poor were coming in,
Duly and cheerfully to their toil; and up
Rose the sharp hammer's clink, and the far hum
Of moving wheels, and multitudes astir,
And all that in a city murmur swells,-
Unheard but by the watcher's weary ear,
Aching with night's dull silence,—or the sick,
Hailing the welcome light and sounds, that chase
The death-like images of the dark away.
"Room for the leper!" And aside they stood-
Matron, and child, and pitiless manhood,—all
Who met him on his way,-and let him pass.
And onward through the open gate he came,
A leper with the ashes on his brow,
Sackcloth about his loins, and on his lip
A covering,-stepping painfully and slow,
And with a difficult utterance, like one
Whose heart is with an iron nerve put down,
Crying "Unclean! Unclean!"
'Twas now the first
Of the Judean autumn, and the leaves,
Whose shadows lay so still upon his path,
Had put their beauty forth beneath the eye
Of Judah's loftiest noble. He was young,
And eminently beautiful; and life.
Mantled in elegant fulness on his lip.
And sparkled in his glance; and in his mien
There was a gracious pride, that every eye
Followed with benisons ;-and this was he!

And he went forth-alone! Not one of all
The many whom he loved, nor she whose name
Was woven in the fibres of his heart
Breaking within him now, to come and speak
Comfort unto him. Yea, he went his way,
Sick, and heart-broken, and alone,-to die!
For God had cursed the leper!
It was noon,
And Helon knelt beside a stagnant pool
In the lone wilderness, and bathed his brow,
Hot with the burning leprosy, and touch'd
The loathsome water to his fever'd lips,
Praying that he might be so blest,—to die!
-Footsteps approach'd; and with no strength to flee,
He drew the covering closer on his lip,
Crying, "Unclean! Unclean!" and in the folds
Of the coarse sackcloth shrouding up his face,
He fell upon the earth till they should pass.
Nearer the stranger came, and bending o'er
The leper's prostrate form, pronounced his name.
"Helon!"-The voice was like the master-tone
Of a rich instrument,-most strangely sweet;
And the dull pulses of disease awoke,
And, for a moment, beat beneath the hot
And leprous scales with a restoring thrill!
"Helon! arise !"-and he forgot his curse,
And rose and stood before Him.
Love and awe
Mingled in the regard of Helon's eye,
As he beheld the stranger.-He was not
In costly raiment clad, nor on His brow
The symbol of a princely lineage wore ;-
No followers at His back,-nor in His hand
Buckler, or sword, or spear;-yet if He smiled,
A kingly condescension graced His lips,

A lion would have crouched to in his lair.
His garb was simple, and His sandals worn,
His stature modelled with a perfect grace;
His countenance the impress of a God,
Touch'd with the opening innocence of a child;
His eye was blue and calm, as is the sky
In the serenest noon; His hair unshorn
Fell to His shoulders; and His curling beard
The fullness of perfected manhood bore.
-He look'd on Helon earnestly awhile,
As if His heart were moved, and, stooping down,
He took a little water in His hand,
And laid it on his brow, and said, "Be clean!"
And lo! the scales fell from him; and his blood
Coursed with delicious coolness through his veins,
And his dry palms grew moist; and on his brow
The dewy softness of an infant's sole:
His leprosy was cleans'd; and he fell down
Prostrate at Jesus' feet, and worshipped Him.

Each little cottage of my native vale
Swells out its earthen sides, upheaves its roof,
Like to a hillock moved by laboring mole,
And with green trail-weeds clambering up its walls,
Roses, and every gay and fragrant plant,
Before my fancy stands a fairy bower;
Aye, and within it, too, do fairies dwell.
Peep through its wreathed window, if, indeed,
The flowers grow not too close; and there within,
Thou'lt see some half a dozen rosy brats,
Eating from wooden bowls their dainty milk-

Those are my mountain elves. Seest thou not
Their very forms distinctly?—
I'll gather round my board
All that heav'n sends to me of way-worn folks,
And noble travellers and neighboring friends,
Both young and old. Within my ample hall,
The worn-out man of arms shall o' tip-toe tread,
Tossing his gray locks from his wrinkled brow,
With cheerful freedom, as he boasts his feats
Of days gone by. Music we'll have, and oft
The bickering dance upon our oaken floors
Shall, thundering loud, strike on the distant ear
Of nighted travellers, who shall gladly bend
Their doubtful footsteps towards the cheering din.
Solemn, and grave, and cloister'd and demure,
We shall not be: but every season
Shall have its suited pastime: even winter
In its deep noon, when mountains piled with snow,
And choked up valleys, to our mansion bar
All entrance, and nor guest nor traveller
Sounds at our gate; the empty hall forsaken,
In some warm chamber by the crackling fire,
We'll hold our little, snug, domestic court,
Plying our work with song and tale between.

Where are those dreamers now?
One 'midst the forests of the west,
By a dark stream is laid-
The Indian knows his place of rest,
Far in the cedar shade.
The sea, the blue lone sea, hath one,
He lies where pearls lie deep;
He was the lov'd of all, yet none
O'er his low bed may weep.
One sleeps where southern vines are dress'd
Above the noble slain :
He wrapt his colors round his breast
On a blood-red field of Spain.
And one-o'er her the myrtle showers
Its leaves, by soft winds fann'd;
She faded 'midst Italian flowers-
The last of that bright band.
And parted thus, they rest who play'd
Beneath the same green tree;
Whose voices mingled as they pray'd
Around one parent knee!
They that with smiles lit up the hall
And cheer'd with song the hearth-
Alas! for love, if thou wert all,
And nought beyond, on earth!

I bring thee faith, my liege, my lord!-oh, break my father's

"Rise, rise! ev'n now thy father comes, a ransom'd man this day,
Mount thy good horse, and thou and I will meet him on his way."
Then lightly rose that loyal son, and bounded on his steed,
And urged, as if with lance in rest, the charger's foamy speed.
And lo! from far, as on they press'd, there came a glittering band,
With one that 'midst them stately rode, as a leader in the land;
"Now haste, Bernardo, haste! for there in very truth is he,
The father whom thy faithful heart hath yearn'd so long to see."
His dark eye flash'd, his proud breast heav'd, his cheek's blood
came and went;
He reach'd that grey-hair'd chieftain's side, and there dismount-

A lowly knee to earth he bent, his father's hand he took,—
What was there in its touch that all his fiery spirit shook?
That hand was cold—a frozen thing-it dropp'd from his like
lead,-
He look'd up to the face above,-the face was of the dead!
A plume waved o'er the noble brow, the brow was fix'd and white;
He met at last his father's eyes,-but in them was no sight!
Up from the ground he sprung, and gaz'd, but who could paint
that gaze?
They hush'd their very hearts that saw its horror and amaze;
They might have chain'd him, as before that stony form he stood,
For the power was stricken from his arm, and from his lip the
blood.
"Father!" at length, he murmur'd low, and wept like child-
hood then:-
Talk not of grief till thou hast seen the tears of warlike men!—
He thought on all his glorious hopes, on all his young renown,-
He flung the falchion from his side, and in the dust sat down.

I would that there our kindred blood on Spain's free soil had met ;
Thou wouldst have known my spirit then,-for thee my fields

And thou hast perish'd in thy chains, as if thou hadst no son."
Then starting from the ground once more, he seized the mon-
arch's rein,
Amidst the pale and wilder'd looks of all the courtier train ;
And with a fierce, o'ermastering grasp, the raging war-horse led,
And sternly set them face to face,—the king before the dead!
"Came I not forth upon thy pledge, my father's hand to kiss?
Be still, and gaze thou on, false king! and tell me what is this?

Bid these white lips a blessing speak-this earth is not my sire!
Give me back him for whom I strove, for whom my blood was
shed,-
Thou canst not-and a king ?-His dust be mountains on thy
head!"
He loos'd the steed; his slack hand fell;-upon the silent face
He cast one long, deep, troubled look, then turn'd from tha
sad place:
His hope was crush'd, his after-fate untold in martial strain,—
His banner led the spears no more amidst the hills of Spain!

THE GLOVE AND THE LIONS.-L. HUNT.
KING Francis was a hearty king, and lov'd a royal sport,
And one day, as his lions fought, sat looking on the court;
The nobles fill'd the benches round, the ladies by their side,
And 'mongst them sat the Count de Lorge, with one for whom
he sigh'd:
And truly 'twas a gallant thing to see that crowning show,
Valor and love, and a king above, and the royal hearts below.
Ramp'd and roar'd the lions, with horrid laughing jaws;
They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with
their paws:
With wallowing might and stifled roar, they roll'd on one another,
Till all the pit, with sand and mane, was in a thund'rous smother;
The bloody foam above the bars came whizzing thro' the air;
Said Francis then, "Faith! gentlemen, we're better here than
there!"
De Lorge's love o'er-heard the king, a beauteous lively dame,
With smiling lips and sharp bright eyes, which always seem'd
the same;
She thought, The Count my lover is brave as brave can be—
He surely would do wondrous things to show his love of me:
King, ladies, lovers, all look on; the occasion is divine!
I'll drop my glove, to prove his love; great glory will be mine!
She dropp'd her glove, to prove his love, then look'd at him
and smil❜d;
He bow'd, and in a moment leap'd among the lions wild.
The leap was quick, return was quick-he has regain'd the
place,-
Then threw the glove-but not with love-right in the lady's face.
"By heaven!" cried Francis, "rightly done!" and he rose from
where he sat:
"No love," quoth he, "but vanity, sets love a task like that!"

Heed ye those hundred rings, concentric from the core,
Eddying in various waves to the red bark's shore-like rim?
These be the gatherings of yesterdays, present all to-day,

This is the tree's judgment, self-history that cannot be gainsaid.
Seven years agone there was a drought, and the seventh ring
is narrow'd,
The fifth from hence was half a deluge,—the fifth is cellular
and broad;
Thus, Man, thou art a result of the growth of many yesterdays,
That stamp thy secret soul with growth of weal or woe;
Thou art an almanac of self, the living record of thy deeds;
Spirit has its scars as well as body, sore and aching in their
season:
Here is a knot,—it was a crime: there is a canker,—selfishness;
Lo, here the heart-wood rotten; lo, there, perchance, the sap-
wood sound;
Nature teacheth not in vain; thy works are in thee, of thee;
Some present evil bent hath grown of older errors.
And what if thou be walking now uprightly? Salve not thy
wounds with poison,
As if a petty goodness of to-day hath blotted out the sin of yes-
terday.
It is well, thou hast life and light; and the Hewer showeth
mercy,
Dressing the root, pruning the branch, and looking for thy
tardy fruits;
But even here, as thou standest, cheerful belike and careless,
The stains of ancient evil are upon thee, the record of thy
wrong is in thee:
For, a curse of many yesterdays is thine, many yesterdays
of sin,
That, haply little heeded now, shall blast thy many morrows.
Shall then a man reck nothing, but hurl mad defiance at his
Judge,
Knowing that less than an omnipotent cannot make the has
been, not been?
He ought, so Satan spake; he must, so Atheism urgeth;
He may, it was the libertine's thought; he doth,—the bad world
said it.

But thou of humbler heart, thou student wiser for simplicity,
While Nature warmeth thee betimes, heed the loving counsel
of Religion.
True, this change is good, and penitence most precious;
But trust not thou thy change; nor rest upon repentance;
For we all are corrupted at the core, smooth as our surface
seemeth;
What health can bloom in a beautiful skin, when rottenness
hath fed upon the bones?
And guilt is parcel of us all; not thou, sweet nursling of affection,
Art spotless, though so passing fair, nor thou, wild patriarch of
virtue ;
Behold then the better tree of Life, free unto us all for grafting,
Cut thee from the hollow root of self, to be budded on a richer vine,
Be desperate, O man, as of evil so of good; tear that tunic from
thee;
The past can never be retriev'd, be the present what it may.
Vain is the penance and the scourge, vain the fast and vigil;
The fencer's cautious skill to-day, can this erase his scars?
It is man's to famish as a faquir, it is man's to die a devotee;
Light is the torture and the toil, balanced with the wages of
Eternity:
But, it is God's to yearn in love on the humblest, the poorest,
and the worst;
For he has giv'n freely, as a King, asking only thanks for mercy.
Look upon this noble-hearted Substitute; seeing thy woes, he
pitied thee;
Bow'd beneath the mountain of thy sin and perish'd,—but for
God-head.
There stood the Atlas in his power, and Prometheus in his love
is there,
Emptying, on wretched man, the blessings earn'd from heav'n.
Put them not away-hide them in thy breast, poor and penitent
receiver;
Be gratitude thy counsellor to good, and wholesome fear unto
obedience:

Remember the pruning knife is keen, cutting cankers even from
the vine;
Remember, twelve were chosen, and one among them liveth in
perdition.
Yea, for standing unatoned, the soul is a bison on the prairie,
Hunted by those trooping wolves, the many sinful yesterdays:
And it speedeth a terrified Deucalion, flinging back the pebble
in his flight,—
The pebble that must add one more to those pursuing ghosts.
Oman! there is a storm behind, should drive in thy bark to haven:
The foe, the foe, is on thy track, patient, certain and avenging ;
Day by day, solemnly and silently followeth the fearful past,-
His step is lame but sure; for he catcheth the present in eternity:
And how to escape that foe, the present-past in future?
How to avert that fate, living consequence of causes unexistent?
Boldly we must overleap his birth, and date above his memories,
Grafted on the living Tree that was before a yesterday;
No refuge of a younger birth than one that saw creation,
Can hide the child of time from still condemning yesterday.
There is the Sanctuary-city, mocking at the wrath of thine
Avenger,
Close at hand, with its wicket on the latch; haste for thy life,
poor hunted one!
The gladiator, Guilt, fighteth as of old, armed with net and
dagger;
Snaring in the mesh of yesterdays, stabbing with the poniard
of to-day;
Fly, thy sword is broken at the hilt; fly, thy shield is shiver'd;
Leap the barriers and baffle him; the arena of the past is his.
The bounds of guilt are the cycles of time; thou must be safe
within Eternity;
The arms of God alone shall rescue thee from yesterday.

A POET'S PARTING THOUGHT.*-MOTHERWELL.
WHEN I beneath the cold red earth am sleeping,
Life's fever o'er,
Will there for me be any bright eye weeping
That I'm no more?
Will there be any heart still memory keeping
Of heretofore?
When the great winds through leafless forests rushing,
Sad music make;
When the swollen streams, o'er crag and gully gushing,
Like full hearts break,-
Will there then one, whose heart despair is crushing,
Mourn for my sake?
When the bright sun upon that spot is shining,
With purest ray,
And the small flowers, their buds and blossoms twining,
Burst through that clay,-
Will there be one still on that spot repining
Lost hopes all day?
-
When no star twinkles with its eye of glory,
On that low mound,
And wintry storms have, with their ruins hoary,
Its loneness crown'd,-
Will there be then one, vers'd in misery's story,
Pacing it round ?—
It may be so, but this is selfish sorrow
To ask such meed,—
*These lines of Motherwell,- -so touching in their simple
pathos, and so unselfish in the calm resignation of their close,
—were given to a friend by the author, a day or two before his
decease.

LOCHIEL'S WARNING.-CAMPBELL.
WIZARD-LOCHIEL.*
Wiz.-Lochiel, Lochiel! beware of the day
When the lowlands shall meet thee in battle array!
For a field of the dead rushes red on my sight,
And the clans of Culloden are scatter'd in fight.
They rally, they bleed for their kingdom and crown;
Woe, woe to the riders that trample them down!
Proud Cumberland prances, insulting the slain,
And their hoof-beaten bosoms are trod to the plain!
But hark! through the fast flashing lightning of war,
What steed to the desert flies frantic and far?
'Tis thine, oh Glenullin! whose bride shall await,
Like a love-lighted watch-fire, all night at the gate.
A steed comes at morning; no rider is there ;
But its bridle is red with the sign of despair.
Weep, Albin! to death and captivity led!
Oh weep! but thy tears cannot number the dead.
* In this dialogue, the tone of the Wizard, or Seer-who is
supposed to be gifted with second-sight-must be deep, and
solemn; increasing in pitch and force as the images of horror
crowd upon his vision, and varied occasionally by the soft tones
of grief. The expression of the chieftain Lochiel must be that
of bold confidence, daring, and contempt of the Wizard's pre-
diction. His pitch will therefore be higher, and his tone louder.

For a merciless sword on Culloden shall wave,
Culloden! that reeks with the blood of the brave.
Loc.-Go preach to the coward, thou death-telling seer!
Or, if gory Culloden so dreadful appear,
Draw, dotard, around thy old wavering sight
This mantle-to cover the phantoms of flight.
Wiz.-Ha! laugh'st thou, Lochiel, my vision to scorn?
Proud bird of the mountain, thy plume shall be torn !—
Say, rush'd the bold eagle exultingly forth
From his home, in the dark-rolling clouds of the north?
Lo! the death-shot of foemen outspeeding, he rode,
Companionless, bearing destruction abroad:
But down let him stoop from his havoc on high!
Ah! home let him speed, for the spoiler is nigh.
Why flames the far summit? Why shoot to the blast
Those embers, like stars from the firmament cast?
'Tis the fire-shower of ruin, all dreadfully driven
From his eyrie, that beacons the darkness of heaven.
Oh! crested Lochiel! the peerless in might,
Whose banners arise on the battlements' height,
Heaven's fire is around thee, to blast and to burn ;
Return to thy dwelling; all lonely return!
For the blackness of ashes shall mark where it stood,
And a wild mother scream o'er her famishing brood!
Loc.-False Wizard, avaunt! I have marshall'd my clan,
Their swords are a thousand, their hearts are but one!
They are true to the last of their blood and their breath,
And like reapers descend to the harvest of death.
Then welcome be Cumberland's steed to the shock!
Let him dash his proud foam like a wave on the rock!
But woe to his kindred, and woe to his cause,
When Albin her claymore indignantly draws;
When her bonneted chieftains to victory crowd,
Clanronald the dauntless, and Moray the proud,
All plaided and plumed in their tartan array—
Wiz.-Lochiel, Lochiel! beware of the day!

For, dark and despairing my sight I may seal,
But man cannot cover what God would reveal;
'Tis the sunset of life gives me mystical lore,
And coming events cast their shadows before.-
I tell thee, Culloden's dread echoes shall ring
With the blood-hounds that bark for thy fugitive king.
Lo! anointed by Heaven with the vials of wrath,
Behold where he flies on his desolate path!
Now in darkness and billows, he sweeps from my sight;
Rise, rise! ye wild tempests, and cover his flight !—
'Tis finish'd! Their thunders are hush'd on the moors;
Culloden is lost, and my country deplores!
But where is the iron-bound prisoner? Where ?—
For the red eye of battle is shut in despair.
Say, mounts he the ocean-wave, banish'd, forlorn,
Like a limb from his country cast bleeding and torn?
Ah no! for a darker departure is near;
The war-drum is muffled, and black is the bier;
His death-bell is tolling! Oh! Mercy, dispel
Yon sight, that it freezes my bosom to tell!
Life flutters convulsed in his quivering limbs,
And his blood-streaming nostril in agony swims.
Accurs'd be the faggots that blaze at his feet,
Where his heart shall be thrown ere it ceases to beat,
With the smoke of its ashes to poison the gale-
Loc.-Down, soothless insulter! I trust not the tale:
For never shall Albin a destiny meet,
So black with dishonor, so foul with retreat.
Though my perishing ranks should be strew'd in their gore,
Like ocean-weeds heap'd on the surf-beaten shore,
Lochiel, untainted by flight or by chains,
While the kindling of life in his bosom remains,
Shall victor exult or in death be laid low-
With his back to the field, and his feet to the foe!
And, leaving in battle no blot on his name,
Look proudly to heaven from the death-bed of fame!

CATO ON THE SOUL'S IMMORTALITY.-ADDISON.
[CATO is seated with Plato's treatise in his hand, and beside
him his sword.-The expression should be solemn, and the
declamation of a lofty and dignified character.]
It must be so! Plato, thou reasonest well:
Else whence this fond desire, this pleasing hope,
This longing after immortality?
Or whence this secret dread, and inward horror
Of falling into nought? Why shrinks the soul
Back on herself, and shudders at destruction?
'Tis the divinity that stirs within us;
'Tis heaven itself that points out a hereafter,
And intimates eternity to man!—
Eternity! thou pleasing, dreadful thought!-
Through what variety of untried being,
Through what new forms and changes must we pass
The wide, the unbounded prospect lies before me;
But shadows, clouds, and darkness rest upon it.
Here will I hold- -If there's a power above,-
And that there is all Nature cries aloud
?
Through all her works,―he must delight in virtue;
And that which he delights in must be happy:
But when? or how ?-This world was made for Cæsar.
I'm weary of conjectures; this must end 'em!
(taking up the sword.)
Thus am I doubly arm'd: my life and death,
My bane and antidote, are both before me.
This, in a moment, brings me to an end;
But this assures me I shall never die!
The soul, secure in her existence, smiles
At the drawn dagger, and defies its point.
The stars shall fade away, the Sun himself
Grow dim with age, and Nature sink in years,-
Thou still shalt flourish in eternal youth,

MARC ANTONY'S APOSTROPHE* TO CÆSAR'S
BODY.-SHAKS.
O PARDON me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
That ever lived in the tide of times!
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood,
Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,—
Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue,
A curse shall light upon the line of men;
Domestic fury, and fierce civil strife
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
And dreadful objects so familiar,
That mothers shall but smile, when they behold
Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war ;-
All pity chok'd with custom of fell deeds ;—
And Cæsar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
With Até by his side, come hot from hell,
Shall in these confines, with a monarch's voice,
Cry Havoc, and let slip the dogs of war ;—
That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
With carrion men groaning for burial!
* This apostrophe is a fine practice in intonation and power-
ful and impassioned declamation. The speaker should com-
mence in the deep, solemn tone of grief; making a burst of
passion as he prophesies the curse that is to follow; and in-
crease in energy till he reach the climax at the close.

Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires:
I'll leave you.
Cas. Brutus, I do observe you now of late;
I have not from your eyes that gentleness,
And show of love, as was wont to have:
You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
Over your friend that loves you.
Bru.-Cassius,
Be not deceived: If I have veil'd my look,
I turn the trouble of my countenance
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am,
Of late, with passions of some difference,
Conceptions only proper to myself,
Which give some soil, perhaps, to my
behaviours;
Bnt let not therefore my good friends be grieved;
Among which number, Cassius, be you one;
Nor construe any further my neglect,
Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
Forgets the shows of love to other men.
Cas.-Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
By means whereof, this breast of mine hath buried
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
Bru.-No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
But by reflection, by some other things.

That you might see your shadow-I have heard,
Where many of the best respect in Rome-
Except immortal Cæsar-speaking of Brutus,-
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
Bru.-Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
That you would have me seek into myself
For that which is not in me?
Cas.-Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
And, since you know you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
Will modestly discover to yourself
That of yourself which you yet know not of.
And be not jealous of me, gentle Brutus:
Were I a common laugher, or did use
To stale with ordinary oaths my love
To every new protester: if you know
That I do fawn on men, and hug them hard,
And, after, scandal them: or if you know
That I profess myself in banquetting
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous,
Bru.-What means this shouting?—I do fear the people
Choose Cæsar for their king.
Cas.-Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think, you would not have it so.
:-
Bru.-I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well :-
But, wherefore do you hold me here so long?
What is it that you would impart to me?
If it be aught toward the general good,
Set honor in one eye, and death i' the other,
And I will look on both indifferently:
For let the gods so speed me, as I love
The name of honor more than I fear death.

As well as I do know your outward favor.
Well, honor is the subject of my story.—

I cannot tell, what you and other men
Think of this life; but, for my single self,
I had as lief not be, as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself.
I was born free as Cæsar; so were you;
We both have fed as well; and we can both
Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
The troubled Tyber chafing with his shores,
Cæsar said to me, "Dar'st thou. Cassius, now,
Leap in with me into this angry flood,
And swim to yonder point?"-Upon the word,
Accoutred as I was, 1 plunged in,
And bade him follow: so, indeed, he did.
The torrent roar'd; and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews, throwing it aside,
And stemming it with hearts of controversy.
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
Cæsar cried, "Help me, Cassius, or I sink."
I-as Æneas, our great ancestor,
Did from the flames of Troy, upon his shoulders,
The old Anchises bear, so, from the waves of Tyber,
Did I the tired Cæsar: And this man
Is now become a god; and Cassius is
A wretched creature, and must bend his body,
If Cæsar carelessly but nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
And when the fit was on him, I did mark
How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
His coward lips did from their color fly;
And that same eye, whose bend doth awe the world,
Did lose its lustre: I did hear him groan:
Ay, and that tongue of his, that bade the Romans
Mark him, and write his speeches in their books,
Alas, it cried, "Give me some drink, Titinius,"
As a sick girl. Ye gods! it doth amaze me,

And bear the palm alone.

For some new honors that are heap'd on Cæsar.
Cas.-Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world,
Like a Colossus; and we, petty men,
Walk under his huge legs, and peep about,
To find ourselves dishonorable graves.
Men at some times are masters of their fates:
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
Brutus, and Cæsar: What should be in that Cæsar?
Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Cæsar.-
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
Upon what meat doth this our Cæsar feed,
That he has grown so great? Age, thou art shamed:
Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
When went there by an age, since the great flood,
But it was famed with more than with one man!
When could they say, till now, that talk'd of Rome,
That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
Oh! you and I have heard our fathers say,
There was a Brutus once, that would have brook'd
The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome,
As easily as a king.
Bru.-That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
What you would work me to, I have some aim:
How I have thought of this, and of these times,
I shall recount hereafter; for this present,

You, that did void your rheum upon my beard,
And foot me, as you spurn a stranger cur
Over your threshold: monies is your suit.

"Hath a dog money? Is it possible
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?" Or
Shall I bend low, and in a bondsman's key,
With 'bated breath, and whispering humbleness,
Say this-
"Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
You spurn'd me such a day; another time
You call'd me-dog; and for these courtesies
I'll lend you thus much monies."

In cradle of the rude, imperious surge,
And in the visitation of the winds,

Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them
With deaf'ning clamors in the slippery clouds,

And one man, in his time, plays many parts,
His acts being seven ages. At first, the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms:
Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel,
And shining morning face, creeping, like snail,
Unwillingly to school. And then, the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woful ballad
Made to his mistress' eye-brow: Then, a soldier;
Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honor, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation,
Ev'n in the cannon's mouth: And then, the justice;
In fair round belly, with good capon line
With eyes severe, aud beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws, and modern instances,
And so he plays his part: The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank, and his big manly voice.
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound:-Last scene of all,

Is second childishness, and mere oblivion;
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything!

Will haunt thee to the grave!
Ion. It is most true;
Thou spar'dst my life, and therefore do the gods
Ordain me to this office, lest thy fall
Seem the chance forfeit of some single sin,
And not the great redress of Argos. Now-
Now, while I parley-spirits that have left,
Within this hour, their plague-tormented flesh
To rot untomb'd, glide by, and frown on me,
Their slow avenger,—and the chamber swarms
With looks of Furies.-Yet a moment wait,
Ye dreadful prompters! If there is a friend,
Whom dying thou wouldst greet by word or token,
Speak thy last bidding.
Adras. I have none on earth.
If thou hast courage, end me!
Ion. Not one friend!
Most piteous doom!
Adras.-Art melted?
Ion.-If I am,
Hope nothing from my weakness; mortal arms,
And eyes unseen that sleep not, gird us round,
And we shall fall together. Be it so!
Adras.-No; strike at once; my hour is come: in thee
I recognise the minister of Jove,
And, kneeling thus, submit me to his power. [Adrastus kneels.]
Ion.-Avert thy face!
Adras.-No; let me meet thy gaze ;
For breathing pity lights thy features up
Into more awful likeness of a form
Which once shone on me ;—and which now my sense
Shapes palpable-in habit of the grave,
Inviting me to the sad realm where shades
Of innocents, whom passionate regard
Link'd with the guilty, are content to pace
With them the margin of the inky flood,

Her pallid hand in circle o'er thy head,
As if to bless thee-and I bless thee too,
Death's gracious angel! Do not turn away.
Ion.-Gods! to what office have ye doom'd me!-Now!
[ION raises his arm to stab ADRASTUS, who is kneel-

of MEDON is heard without, calling "Ion! Ion!"-
ION drops his arm.]
Adras.-Be quick, or thou art lost!
[MEDON rushes in behind him.]
Medon.-Ion, forbear!
Behold thy son, Adrastus!
[ION drops the knife and stands stupified with horror.]
Adras.- -What strange words
Are these which call my senses from the death
They were composed to welcome ?-Son! 'tis false-
I had but one—and the deep wave rolls o'er him!
Medon. That wave received, instead of the fair nurseling,
One of the slaves who bore him from thy sight
In wicked haste to slay; I'll give thee proofs.
Adras.-Great Jove, I thank thee !-proofs !
Are there not here the lineaments of her
Who made me happy once-the voice, now still,
That bade the long-seal'd fount of love gush out,
While with a prince's constancy he came
To lay his noble life down; and the sure,
The dreadful proof, that he whose guileless brow
Is instinct with her spirit, stood above me,
Arm❜d for the traitor's deed ?—It is my child!
[ION sinks on one knee before ADRASTUS.]
[A noise without.]
Ion.-Father!
Medon. The clang of arms!
Ion, (starting up.)-They come ! they come!
They who are leagued with me against thy life.
Here let us fall!
Adras.-I will confront them yet.

QUARREL SCENE FROM JULIUS CÆSAR.-SHAKS.
[In this dialogue, the manner of Brutus should be dignified,
and sarcastic; while that of Cassius should be quick, impetu-
ous, and passionate.]
CASSIUS AND BRUTUS.
Cas.—That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella,
For taking bribes here of the Sardians,―
Wherein, my letters, praying on his side,
(Because I knew the man,) were slighted off.
Bru.-You wrong'd yourself to write in such a case.
Cas. In such a time as this, it is not meet
That every nice offence should bear his comment.
Bru.-Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;
To sell and mart your offices for gold
To undeservers.
Cas.-I an itching palm !—
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
Or, by the gods, that speech were else your last.
Bru.-The name of Cassius honors this
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
corruption,
Cas.-Chastisement!
Bru.-Remember March-the ides of March remember!
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
And not for justice? What, shall one of us,
That struck the foremost man of all this world,

But for supporting robbers-shall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,
And sell the mighty space of our large honors
For so much trash, as may be grasped thus?
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
Than such a Roman.
Cas.-Brutus, bay not me,
I'll not endure it: I am a soldier, I,
Older in practice, abler than yourself
To make conditions.
Bru.-Go to; you're not, Cassius.
Cas.-I am.
Bru.-I say, you are not.
Cas.-Urge me no more: I shall forget myself:
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.
Bru-Away, slight man!
Cas.-Is't possible?
Bru.-Hear me, for I will speak.—
Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
Cas.-Ye gods! ye gods! Must I endure all this?
Bru.-All this? ay, more.-Fret, till your proud heart break.-
Go, show your slaves how choleric you are,
And make your bondmen tremble: Must I budge?
Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humor!—By the gods!
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
Though it do split you: for, from this day forth,
I'll use you for my mirth-yea, for my laughter-
When you are waspish.
Cas.-Is it come to this?
Bru.-You say, you are a better soldier:
Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
And it shall please me well: for mine own part,
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.

I said, an elder soldier, not a better !—
Did I say better?
Bru.—If you did I care not.
Cas.-When Cæsar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
Bru.-Peace, peace: you durst not so have tempted him.
Cas.-I durst not?
Bru.-No.
Cas.-What? durst not tempt him?
Bru.-For your life, you durst not.
Cas. Do not presume too much upon my love;
I may do that I shall be sorry for.
Bru.-You have done that you should be sorry for.
There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats;
For I am arm'd so strong in honesty,
That they pass by me as the idle wind
Which I respect not. I did send to you
For certain sums of gold, which you denied me;
For I can raise no money by vile means:
By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash,
By any indirection. I did send
To you
gold to pay my legions;
Which you denied me: Was that done like Cassius?
Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?-
When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts,
Dash him to pieces!
Cas.-I denied you not.
Bru.-You did.
Cas.-I did not :-He was but a fool
That brought my answer back.-Brutus hath rived my heart:
A friend should bear a friend's infirmities,
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
Bru.-I do not, till you practise them on me.

Cas.-You love me not.
Bru.-I do not like your faults.
Cas.-A friendly eye could never see such faults.
Bru.-A flatterer's would though they do appear
As huge as high Olympus.
Cas.-Come, Antony, and, young Octavius, come,
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
For Cassius is aweary of the world:
Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
Check'd like a bondman: all his faults observed,
Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
My spirit from mine eyes!-There is my dagger,
And here my naked breast: within, a heart
Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
Strike, as thou didst at Cæsar: for, I know,
When thou didst hate him worst, thou lov'dst him better
Than ever thou lov'dst Cassius.
Bru-Sheath your dagger:
Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.
O, Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
That carries anger, as the flint bears fire;
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
And straight is cold again.
Cas.-Hath Cassius lived
To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?
Bru.-When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
Cas. Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
Bru.-And my heart too!

BOBADIL'S MILITARY TACTICS.-BEN JONSON.
[With the bombastic expression of an empty braggart.]
I WILL tell you, Sir, by the way of private and under seal,
I am a gentleman, and live here obscure and to myself; but,
were I known to his majesty and the lords, observe me, I would
undertake, upon this poor head and life, for the public benefit
of the state, not only to spare the entire lives of his subjects in
general, but to save the one half, nay, three parts of his yearly
charge in holding war, and against what enemy soever. And
how would I do it, think you? Why thus, sir. I would se-
lect nineteen more to myself; gentlemen they should be, of a
good spirit, strong and able constitution; I would choose them
by an instinct, a character that I have: and I would teach
these nineteen the special rules, as your Punto, your Reverso,
your Stoccato, your Imbrocato, your Passado, your Montanto ;*
till they could all play very near, or altogether as well as my-
self. This done, say the enemy were forty thousand strong,
we twenty would come into the field the tenth of March or
thereabouts; and we would challenge twenty of the enemy;
they could not in their honor refuse us! Well, we would kill
them; challenge twenty more, kill them; twenty more, kill them;
twenty more, kill them too: and thus would we kill, every man
his twenty a day, that's twenty score; twenty score, that's two

MARC ANTONY'S ORATION.-SHAKS.
FRIENDS, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones;
So let it be with Cæsar. The noble Brutus
Hath told you, Cæsar was ambitious;
If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it.
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest—
(For Brutus is an honorable man,
So are they all, all honorable men)—
Come I to speak in Cæsar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says, he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious!
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept:
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff-
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
You all did see that, on the Lupercal,
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse.
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And sure he is an honorable man.
Was this ambition?
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once, not without cause;

What cause withholds you then to mourn for him?
O judgment, thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason!-Bear with me:
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar,
And I must pause till it come back to me.
But yesterday, the word of Cæsar might
Have stood against the world: now lies he there,
And none so poor to do him reverence.
O masters! if I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honorable men:
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
•
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself, and you,
Than I will wrong such honorable men.
But here's a parchment, with the seal of Cæsar,
I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
Let but the commons hear his testament,
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,
And they would go and kiss dear Cæsar's wounds,
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood:
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing it, as a rich legacy,
Unto their issue.-
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this mantle; I remember
The first time ever Cæsar put it on;
'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,-
That day he overcame the Nervii :-
Look, in this place, ran Cassius' dagger through:
See, what a rent the envious Casca made:
Through this, the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
And, as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Cæsar followed it,
As rushing out of doors, to be resolv'd
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no!
For Brutus, as you know, was Cæsar's angel:

Judge, O you gods, how dearly Cæsar loved him!
This was the most unkindest cut of all:
For when the noble Cæsar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey's statue,
Which all the while ran blood, great Cæsar fell.
O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.―
O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
The dint of pity; these are gracious drops;
Kind souls! What, weep you, when you but behold
Our Cæsar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.-
Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
They that have done this deed, are honorable;
What private griefs they have, alas! I know not,
That made them do it: They are wise and honorable:
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
I am no orator, as Brutus is;
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
That love my friend: and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him;
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
To stir men's blood. I only speak right on;
I tell you that, which you yourselves do know;
Show you sweet Cæsar's wounds, poor dumb mouths,
And bid them speak for me: But, were I Brutus,
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue
In every wound of Cæsar, that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny!

If you sit here to guide the course of justice,
Why these disgraceful chains upon the limbs
That have so often labor'd in your service?
Are these the wreaths of triumph you bestow
On those that bring you conquest home, and honors?
Duke.-Go on: you shall be heard, sir.
Pier.-Are these the trophies I've deserv'd for fighting
Your battles with confederated powers?
When winds and seas conspir'd to overthrow you,
And brought the fleets of Spain to your own harbors;
When you, great duke, shrunk trembling in your palace;
Stepp'd not I forth, and taught your loose Venetians
The task of honor, and the way to greatness?
Rais'd you from your capitulating fears
To stipulate the terms of sued-for peace?
And this my recompense! If I'm a traitor,
Produce my charge; or show the wretch that's base,
And brave enough to tell me, I'm a traitor !

From a hard father, taught me first to love him.

And carry up and down this hated city
A discontented and repining spirit,

Stout. And too much sense for a bigot.
Gloss.-A bigot, sir!

Both.-Battledore !
Evelyn.-Battledore-that is, a contest between two parties:
both parties knock about something with singular skill-some-
thing is kept up-high-low-here-there-everywhere-no-
where! How grave are the players! how anxious the by-
standers! how noisy the battledores! But, when this some-

Sharp. In the heart, I suppose, sir.
Evelyn. Mr. Sharp, it exists in the breeches' pocket! Ob-
serve, I lay this piece of yellow earth on the table-I contem-
plate you both; the man there--the gold here. Now, there is
many a man in those streets as honest as you are, who moves,
thinks, feels, and reasons, as well as we do; excellent in form,
imperishable in soul; who, if his pockets were three days
empty, would sell thought, reason, body, and soul too, for that
little coin! Is that the fault of the man? No! it is the fault
of mankind. God made man; behold what mankind has made
a god! By the bye, Sharp, send a hundred pounds to the poor

War.-Your honor is right welcome into Kent. I am proud
to see Sir Charles Cropland on his estate again. I hope you
mean to stay on the spot for some time, Sir Charles.
Sir C.-A very tedious time-three days, Mr. Warner.
War.-Ah, good sir! things would prosper better if you hon-
ored us with your presence a little more. I wish you lived en-
tirely upon the estate, Sir Charles.
Sir C.-Thank you, Warner; but modern men of fashion
find it devilish difficult to live upon their estates.
War. The country about you so charming!

Sir C.-Look ye, Warner: I must hunt in Leicestershire-
for that's the thing. In the frosts, and the spring months, I
must be in town, at the clubs-for that's the thing. In summer,
I must be at the watering-places-for that's the thing. Now,
Warner, under these circumstances, how is it possible for me
to reside upon my estate? For my estate being in Kent-
War. The most beautiful part of the country!
Sir C.-Hang beauty! We don't mind that in Leicester-
shire. My estate, I say, being in Kent-
War.-A land of milk and honey!
Sir C.-I hate milk and honey!
War.-A land of fat!
Sir C.-Melt your fat! Listen to me: my estate being in
Kent-
War. So woody!
Sir C.-Burn the wood! No, that's wrong—for its conveni-
ent; I am come on purpose to cut it.
War.-Ah! I was afraid so! Dice on the table, and then,
the axe to the root! Money lost at play, and then, good lack!
the forest groans for it.
Sir. C.-But you are not the forest, and why the deuce do
you groan for it?
War. I heartily wish, Sir Charles, you may not encumber
the goodly estate. Your worthy ancestors had views for their
posterity.
Sir C.—And I shall have views for my posterity: I shall take
especial care the trees sha'nt intercept their prospect. In short,
Mr. Warner, I must have three thousand pounds in three days.
Fell timber to that amount, immediately. 'Tis my peremptory
order, sir.
War. I shall obey you, Sir Charles; but 'tis with a heavy
heart. Forgive an old servant of the family, if he grieves to

upon you.
Sir C.--What do you mean by duties?
War. Duties, Sir Charles, which the extravagant man of
property can never fulfil: such as to support the dignity of an

the welfare of his honest tenants; and to succor the industrious
poor, who naturally look up to him for assistance. But I shall
obey you, Sir Charles.

Sir C.-A tiresome old blockhead!-But where is this Olla-
pod? His jumble of physic and shooting may enliven me ; and
to a man of gallantry, in the country, his intelligence is by no
means uninteresting, nor his services inconvenient.
Enter OLLAPOD.
Ah! Ollapod!
Oll.-Sir Charles, I have the honor to be your slave! Hope
your health is good. Been a hard winter here-sore throats
were plenty-so were woodcocks. Flushed four couple one
morning, in a half-mile walk from our town, to cure Mrs.
Quarles of a quinsey. May coming on soon, Sir Charles-
season of delight, love, and campaigning! Hope you come to
sojourn, Sir Charles. Should'nt be always on the wing—that's
being too flighty. [Laughing.] He! he he! Do you take,
good sir? do you take?
Sir C.-Oh, yes, I take. But by the cockade in your hat,
Ollapod, you have added lately, it seems, to your avocations.
Oll.-He! he! Yes, Sir Charles. I have now the honor to
be cornet in the volunteer association corps of our town. It fell
out unexpected-pop, on a sudden; like the going off of a field-
piece, or an alderman in an apoplexy.
Sir C.-Explain.
Oll.-Happening to be at home-rainy day-no going out to
sport, blister, shoot, nor bleed-was busy behind the counter.—
You know my shop, Sir Charles-Galen's head over the door-

sleek as a dray-horse-in a smart scarlet jacket, tastily turned
up with a rhubarb-colored lapelle! I confess his figure struck
me. I looked at him, as I was thumping the mortar, and felt
instantly inoculated with a military ardor.
Sir C.-Inoculated! I hope your ardor was of a favorable
sort.
Oll.-Ha! ha! That's very well-very well, indeed!—
Thank you, good sir-I owe you one! We first talked of
shooting-he knew my celebrity that way, Sir Charles. I told
him, the day before, I had killed six brace of birds. I thumped
on at the mortar.-We then talked of physic: I told him, the
day before, I had killed-lost, I mean, six brace of patients. I
thumped on at the mortar, eyeing him all the while; for he
looked devilish flashy, to be sure; and I felt an itching to be-
long to the corps. The medical and military both deal in death,
you know-so, 'twas natural. He! he!-Do you take, good
sir? do you take?
Sir C.-Take!-Oh, nobody can miss.
Oll. He then talked of the corps itself; said it was sickly;
and if a professional person would administer to the health of
the association, dose the men, and drench the horses, he could,
perhaps, procure him a cornetcy.
Sir C.-Well, you jumped at the offer?
Oll.-Jumped! I jumped over the counter; kicked down
Churchwarden Posh's cathartic into the pocket of Lieutenant
Grains's smart scarlet jacket, tastily turned up with a rhubarb-
colored lapelle; embraced him and his offer; and I am now
Cornet Ollapod, apothecary, at the Galen's Head, of the associ-
ation corps of cavalry, at your service!
Sir C.-I wish you joy of your appointment. You may
now distil water for the shop from the laurels you gather in
the field.
Oll. Water for-Oh! laurel-water. He! he! Come, that's

Sir C.-A mistake!
Oll. Having to attend Lady Kitty Carbuncle, on a grand
field-day, I clapped a pint bottle of her ladyship's diet-drink into
one of my holsters, intending to proceed to the patient, after the
exercise was over. I reached the martial ground, and jalloped
---galloped, I mean--wheeled, and flourished, with great eclat;
but when the word "Fire!" was given, meaning to pull out my
pistol, in a deuce of a hurry, I presented, neck foremost, the
diet-drink of Lady Kitty Carbuncle; and the medicine being,
unfortunately, fermented, by the jolting of my horse, it forced
out the cork, with a prodigious pop, full in the face of my gal-
lant commander.
Sir C.-Ha! ha! ha! A mistake indeed.
Oll.-Rather awkward!-But, Sir Charles, excuse me-your
servant! I must march-patients impatient. You take?
Sir C.-O yes: and so will they, I fancy, before you've done
with them.
Oll.-Ha! physic-certainly! Salts, rhubarb, senna, colo-
quintida, scammony, gambouge. Good, good! thank you,

HAMLET'S SOLILOQUY ON LIFE AND DEATH.
SHAKS.
[In the deep tone of solemn reflection.]
TO BE or not to be ?-that is the question!
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,→
Or, to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by opposing end them!-To die?—to sleep:
No more and by a sleep to say we end
The heart-ache, and the thousand natural shocks
That flesh is heir to :-'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd!-To die,-to sleep:-
To sleep?-perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub:

For, in that sleep of death, what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
Must give us pause! There's the respect
Which makes calamity of so long life:
For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
The pangs of despis'd love, the law's delay,
The insolence of office, and the spurns
Which patient merit of the unworthy takes,
When he himself might his quietus make
With a bare bodkin? Who would fardles bear,
To groan and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death-
That undiscover'd country from whose bourne
No traveller returns-puzzles the will,
And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
Than fly to others that we know not of.-
Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,
And thus the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
And enterprises of great pith and moment,
With this regard, their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action,

The gayest we have held, for many moons.

A damp, like death, rose o'er my brow; I strove
To laugh the thought away, but 'twould not be;
So that I left the festival before
It reached its zenith, and will woo my pillow
For thoughts more tranquil, or forgetfulness.-
I will try
Whether the air will calm my spirits: 'tis
A goodly night: the cloudy wind which blew
From the Levant, hath crept into its cave,
And the broad moon has brightened. What a stillness!
And what a contrast with the scene I left,
Where the tall torches' glare, and silver lamps'
More pallid gleam along the tap'stried walls,
Spread over the reluctant gloom which haunts
Those vast and dimly-latticed galleries,
A dazzling mass of artificial light,
Which showed all things, but nothing as they were!
Around me are the stars and waters,-
Worlds mirrored in the ocean, goodlier sight
Than torches glared back by a gaudy glass;
And the great element, which is to space
What ocean is to earth, spreads its blue depths,
Softened with the first breathings of the spring;
The high moon sails upon her beauteous way,
Serenely smoothing o'er the lofty walls
Of those tall piles, and sea-girt palaces,
Whose porphyry pillars, and whose costly fronts,
Fraught with the orient spoil of many marbles,
Like altars ranged along the broad canal,
Seem each a trophy of some mighty deed.
Rear'd up from out the waters, scarce less strangely
Than those more massy and mysterious giants
Of architecture, those Titanian fabrics,
Which point in Egypt's plains to times that have
No other record. All is gentle: nought
Stirs rudely; but, congenial with the night,
Whatever walks, is gliding like a spirit.

The tinkling of some vigilant guitars
Of sleepless lovers to a wakeful mistress,
And cautious opening of the casement, showing
That he is not unheard; while her young hand,—
Fair as the moonlight, of which it seems part,
So delicately white, it trembles in
The act of opening the forbidden lattice,
To let in love through music,--makes his heart
Thrill like his lyre-strings at the sight; the dash
Phosphoric of the oar, or rapid twinkle
Of the far lights of skimming gondolas,
And the responsive voices of the choir
Of boatmen, answering back, with verse for verse-
Some dusky shadow, checkering the Rialto-
Some glimmering palace-roof, or tapering spire-
Are all the sights and sounds which here pervade
The ocean-born and earth-commanding city.
How sweet and soothing is the hour of calm!
I thank thee, Night! for thou hast chased away
Those horrid bodements, which, amidst the throng,
I could not dissipate, and,-with the blessing
Of thy benign and quiet influence,-
Now will I to my couch, although to rest
Is almost wronging such a night as this.

Than is thy strange apparent cruelty:
And, where thou now exact'st the penalty,
(Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,)
Thou wilt not only lose the forfeiture,
But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
Forgive a moiety of the principal:
Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
That have of late so huddled on his back;
Enough to press a royal merchant down,
And pluck commiseration of his state
From brassy bosoms, and rough hearts of flint,
From stubborn Turks, and Tartars, never train'd
To offices of tender courtesy.-
We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
Shy. I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
And by our holy sabbath have I sworn,
To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
If you deny it, let the danger light
Upon your charter, and your city's freedom.
You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
A weight of carrion flesh, than to receive
Three thousand ducats; I'll not answer that;
But say, it is my humour: is it answered?
What if my house be troubled with a rat,
And I be pleas'd to give ten thousand ducats
To have it ban'd:-what are you answered yet?
Some men there are, love not a gaping pig:
Some, that are mad, if they behold a cat;
Now for your answer:
As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
So can I give no reason, nor will I not,
More than a lodg'd hate, and a certain loathing,
I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?

Bass.-This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
To excuse the current of thy cruelty,
Shy. I am not bound to please thee with my answer.
Bass.-Do all men kill the things they do not love?
Shy.-Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
Bass.-Every offence is not a hate at first.
Shy.-What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
Ant. I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
You may as well go stand upon the beach,
And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
You may as well use question with the wolf,
Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
You may as well forbid the mountain pines
To wag their high tops, and to make no noise,
When they are fretted with the gusts of heaven;
You may as well-do any thing most hard,
As seek to soften that—(than which what's harder?)—
His Jewish heart: therefore I do beseech you,
Make no more offers, use no further means,
But, with all brief and plain conveniency,
Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will.
Bass.-For thy three thousand ducats here are six.
Shy. If every ducat in six thousand ducats
Were in six parts, and every part a ducat,
I would not draw them ; I would have my bond.
Duke.-How shalt thou hope for mercy, rend'ring none?
Shy.-What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
You have among you many a purchas'd slave,
Which, like your asses, and your dogs, and mules,
You use in abject and in slavish parts,
Because you bought them :-shall I say to you,
Let them be free, marry them to your heirs:
Why sweat they under their burdens ?-let their beds
Be made as soft as yours, let their palates
Be season'd with such viands? You will answer,
The slaves are ours:-So do I answer you:

Shy.-Shylock is my name.
Por.-Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
Yet in such rule, that the Venetian law
Cannot impugn you, as you do proceed.
You stand within his danger, do you not?
Ant.—Ay, so he says.
Por.-Do you confess the bond?
Ant.-I do.
Por.-Then must the Jew be merciful.
Shy. On what compulsion must I? tell me that.
Por.-The quality of mercy is not strain'd;
It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven,
Upon the place beneath; it is twice bless'd;
It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes:
'Tis mightiest in the mightiest; it becomes
The throned monarch better than his crown:
His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
The attribute to awe and majesty,

Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
But mercy is above the scepter'd sway,
It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
It is an attribute to God himself;
And earthly power doth then show likest God's,
When mercy seasons justice: therefore, Jew,
Though justice be thy plea, consider this-
That, in the course of justice, none of us
Should see salvation; we do pray for mercy;
And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
The deeds of mercy.-I have spoke thus much,
To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
Shy. My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
Por.-Is he not able to discharge the money?
Bass.-Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
Yea, thrice the sum; if that will not suffice,
I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart;
If this will not suffice, it must appear
That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
Wrest once the law to your authority;
To do a great right, do a little wrong:
And curb this cruel devil of his will.
Por.-It must not be; there is no power in Venice
Can alter a decree established:
"Twill be recorded for a precedent;
And many an error, by the same example,
Will rush into the state: it cannot be.

Shall I lay perjury on my soul?
No, not for Venice.
Por.-Why, this bond is forfeit;
And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
Nearest the merchant's heart:-Be merciful;
Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
Shy. When it is paid according to the tenor.-
It doth appear, you are a worthy judge;
You know the law, your exposition
Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
Proceed to judgment; by my soul I swear
There is no power in the tongue of man
To alter me: I stay here on my bond.

To give the judgment.
Por.-Why, then, thus it is.
You must prepare your bosom for his knife;-
Shy.—O, noble judge! O, excellent young man!
Por.-For the intent and purpose of the law
Hath full relation to the penalty,
Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
Shy.-'Tis very true: O, wise and upright judge!
How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
Por.-Therefore, lay bare your bosom.
Shy.-Ay, his breast:
So says the bond:-Doth it not, noble judge?—
Nearest his heart; those are the very words.

The flesh ?

Ant.-But little; I am arm'd, and well prepar'd.
Give me your hand, Bassanio; fare you well!
Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
For herein fortune shows herself more kind
Than is her custom: it is still her use,
To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
To view with hollow eye, and wrinkled brow,
An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
Of such a misery doth she cut me off.
Repent not you that you shall lose your friend,
And he repents not that he pays your debt;
For, if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
I'll pay it instantly with all my heart.
Shy. We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.
Por.-[Comes forward.]—A pound of that same merchant's
flesh is thine;
The court awards it, and the law doth give it.
Shy. Most rightful judge!
Por.-And you must cut this flesh from off his breast;
The law allows it, and the court awards it.
Shy.-Most learned judge !—a sentence; come, prepare.
Por.-Tarry a little; there is something else.-
This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
The words expressly are, a pound of flesh;
Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
But, in the cutting of it, if thou dost shed
One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
Unto the state of Venice.

Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate.
Gra.-A second Daniel! a Daniel, Jew!
Now, infidel, I have thee on the hip.
Por.-Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.
Shy.-Give me my principal, and let me go.
Bass. I have it ready for thee; here it is.
Por.-He hath refus'd it in the open court;
He shall have merely justice, and his bond.
Gra.-A Daniel, still say I; a second Daniel!—
I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
Shy. Shall I not barely have my principal?
Por. Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
Shy. Why then the devil give him good of it!
I'll stay no longer question.
Por-Tarry, Jew:
The law hath yet another hold on you
It is enacted in the laws of Venice-
If it be prov'd against an alien,

That by direct or indirect attempts,
He seek the life of any citizen,
The party, 'gainst the which he doth contrive,
Shall seize on half his goods; the other half
Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
And the offender's life lies in the mercy
Of the Duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
In which predicament I say, thou stand'st:
For it appears by manifest proceeding,
That, indirectly, and directly too,
Thou hast contrived against the very life
Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
The danger formerly by me rehears'd.—
Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the Duke.
[Retires to the Duke.]
Gra.-Beg, that thou may'st have leave to hang thyself:
And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
Therefore, thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.
Duke. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit:
I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it.
For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
The other half comes to the general state,
Which humbleness may drive into a fine.
Por. [Seated by the DUKE.]-Ay, for the state; not for Antonio.
Shy.-Nay, take my life and all, pardon not that:
You take my house, when you do take the prop
That doth sustain my house: you take my life,
When you do take the means whereby I live.
Por.-What mercy can you render him, Antonio ?
Gra. A halter gratis; nothing else, for heaven's sake.
Ant. So please my lord the duke, and all the court,
To quit the fine for one half of his goods;
I am content, so he will let me have
The other half in use-to render it,
Upon his death, unto the gentleman
That lately stole his daughter.

Two things provided more-that, for this favor,
He presently become a Christian;
The other, that he do record a gift,
Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
Unto his son Lorenzo, and his daughter.
Duke. He shall do this; or else I do recant
The pardon that I late pronounced here.
Por.-Art thou contented, Jew? What dost thou say?
Shy. I am content.-
I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
I am not well; send the deed after me,
And I will sign it.
Duke.-Get thee gone, but do it.
Gra. In christening thou shalt have two godfathers;
Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
Duke.—Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
[Exit SHYLOCK.]
[TO PORTIA.]
Por. I humbly desire your grace of pardon;
I must away this night toward Padua,
And it is meet I presently set forth.
Duke. I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.

SCENE FROM HENRY VIII.-SHAKS.
The tone of WOLSEY should be that of a proud spirit,
broken, but not subdued; and at last agonised with remorse.
That of CROMWELL should mark the humble, but faithful and
sympathising friend.]
WOLSEY [alone.]
FAREWELL, a long farewell to all my greatness !—
This is the state of man; to-day he puts forth

The tender leaves of hope, to-morrow blossoms,
And bears his blushing honors thick upon him:
The third day comes a frost, a killing frost;
And-when he thinks, good easy man! full surely
His greatness is a-ripening-nips his root,
And then he falls as I do. I have ventured,
Like little wanton boys, that swim on bladders,
These many summers in a sea of glory;
But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
At length broke under me; and now has left me,
Weary, and old with service, to the mercy
Of a rude stream that must for ever hide me.
Vain pomp, and glory of the world, I hate ye!
I feel my heart new open'd: O, how wretched
Is that poor man that hangs on prince's favors!
There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
That sweet aspect of princes, and our ruin,
More pangs and fears than war or women have;
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
Never to hope again!—
Enter CROMWELL.
Wol.-Why, how now, Cromwell?
Crom. I have no power to speak, sir.
Wol.—What, amazed
At my misfortunes? Can thy spirit wonder,
A great man should decline? Nay, an' you weep,
I'm fallen indeed.
Crom.-How does your grace?
Wol.-Why, well;
Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.
I know myself now; and I feel within me
A peace above all earthly dignities,
A still and quiet conscience.
Crom.-I'm glad your grace has made that right use of it.
Wol.-I hope I have: I'm able now,
methinks,
Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,

To endure more miseries and greater far,
Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.-
What news abroad?
Crom.-The heaviest and worst
Is your displeasure with the king.
Wol.-God bless him!
-
Crom.-The next is that Sir Thomas More is chosen
Lord Chancellor in your place.
Wol.-That's somewhat sudden :—
But he's a learned man. May he continue
Long in his highness's favor, and do justice
For truth's sake and his conscience, that his bones,
When he has run his course, and sleeps in blessings,
May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on them!—
What more?
Crom.-That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,
Install'd Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.
Wol.-That's news indeed!
Crom.-Last, that the lady Anne,
Whom the king hath in secresy long married,
This day was viewed in open as his queen,
Going to chapel: and the voice is now
Only about her coronation.
Wol.-There was the weight that pull'd me down! O Crom-
well!
The king has gone beyond me; all my glories,
In that one woman, I have lost for ever:
No sun shall ever usher forth my honors,
Or gild again the noble troops that waited
On my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell!
I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now
To be thy lord and master: seek the king:
I have told him
What and how true thou art; he will advance thee:
Some little memory of me will stir him,
(I know his noble nature) not to let,
Thy hopeful service perish too :-
:-go, Cromwell!

Crom.-O my lord,
Must I then leave you? Must I needs forego
So good, so noble, and so true a master ?—
Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,
With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord!—
The king shall have my service, but my prayers
For ever, and for ever, shall be yours!
Wol.-Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,
Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.—
Let's dry our eyes, and thus far hear me, Cromwell;
And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention
Of me more must be heard of-say I taught thee-
Say, Wolsey-that once trod the ways of glory,
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honor-
Found thee a way out of his wreck to rise in ;
A sure and safe one, tho' thy master miss'd it!
Mark but my fall, and that, that ruin'd me.
Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:
By that sin fell the angels; how can man then,
The image of his maker, hope to win by't?
Love thyself last; cherish those hearts that hate thee;
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace
To silence envious tongues. Be just and fear not:
Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
Thy God's and truth's: then, if thou fall'st,
O Cromwell, thou fall'st a blessed martyr !—
Lead me in;
There take an inventory of all I have,
To the last penny-'tis the king's: my robe,
And my integrity to Heaven, is all
I dare now call mine own.-O Cromwell, Cromwell!
Had I but served my God, with half the zeal
I served my king, he would not, in mine age,
Have left me naked to mine enemies!
Crom.-Good sir, have patience.

CATO'S SPEECH OVER HIS DEAD SON.-ADDISON.
[With a heroic, but dignified expression.]
THANKS to the Gods! my boy has done his duty.-
Welcome, my son! Here set him down, my friends,
Full in my sight; that I may view at leisure
The bloody corse, and count those glorious wounds.
How beautiful is death, when earn'd by virtue!
Who would not be that youth ?—what pity is it
That we can die but once to serve our country!
Why sits this sadness on your brow, my friends?
I should have blush'd if Cato's house had stood
Secure, and flourish'd in a civil war.-
Porcius, behold thy brother! and remember,
Thy life is not thy own, when Rome demands it!
When Rome demands !—but Rome is now no more!
The Roman Empire's fall'n !—(Oh! curs'd ambition!)—
Fall'n into Cæsar's hands! Our great forefathers
Had left him nought to conquer but his country.—
*Porcius, come hither to me!—Ah! my son,
Despairing of success,
Let me advise thee to withdraw, betimes,
To our paternal seat, the Sabine field,
Where the great Censor toil'd with his own hands,
And all our frugal ancestors were bless'd
In humble virtues and a rural life.
There live retired: content thyself to be
Obscurely good.

When vice prevails, and impious men bear sway,
The post of honor is a private station! *
Farewell, my friends! If there be any of you
Who dare not trust the victor's clemency,
Know, there are ships prepar'd by my command-
Their sails already op'ning to the winds,—
That shall convey you to the wish'd for port.
The conqueror draws near-once more, farewell!
If e'er we meet hereafter, we shall meet
In happier climes, and on a safer shore,
Where Cæsar never shall approach us more!
There, the brave youth with love of virtue fired,
Who greatly in his country's cause expired,
Shall know he conquer'd! The firm patriot there,
Who made the welfare of mankind his care,
Tho' still by faction, vice and fortune, cross'd,
Shall find the generous labor was not lost.
