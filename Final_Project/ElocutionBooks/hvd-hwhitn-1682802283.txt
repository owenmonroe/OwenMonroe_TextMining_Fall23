ELOCUTION FOR SCHOOLS.-Professor
Caldwell, of Dickinson college, Carlisle,
(Pa.) has prepared a practical "Manual
of Elocution," including voice and ges-
ture, designed for schools, academies, and
colleges. It has been published in a neat
12mo. volume, by Sorin and Ball, of Phi-
ladelphia. The author has availed him-
self of the materials and principles found
in Rush's celebrated work on the Philo-
sophy of the Voice, and Austin's Chiro-
orator.
Its plan is good. It discusses the en-
tire subject; and yet the various portions
are so arranged, that the learner dis-nomia, so celebrated as a standard au-

both Teachers and learners; and its ge-
neral use in our schools, academies, and
colleges, can scarcely fail to render the
art of public speaking a common acquire-
ment, which in our country will be most
desirable and useful, as it is now most
abominably neglected.
From the Christian Repository, Phila-
delphia.
The objects also, are precisely what it
is desirable to have accomplished by a
work on Elocution; to wit, to make the
business of speaking effective,-to give
success to the efforts of the orator; and
also to guard the speaker against the dis-
eases of the vocal organs, which are now
carrying so many to their graves. This
system almost demonstrates the feasibi-
lity of accomplishing these objects-of
actually learning "the orator's art." If In the preparation of this work, the

TO THOSE, who during the last sixteen years have, from time to
time, been under my tuition,—many of whom are now occupying
posts of honor and usefulness, in the Church, in the State, and
in the various departments of Instruction,-this Manual is most
respectfully dedicated, by
THE AUTHOR.

PREFACE.
THE preparation of this Manual would not have been
undertaken, but for the obvious want, at the present time, of
a suitable text-book in Elocution, for the use of classes in our
colleges, academies, and schools. And if undertaken, the
effort would have proved comparatively futile, but for the
existence of such works as "The Philosophy of the human
Voice," by JAMES RUSH, M. D., of Philadelphia, from the
valuable materials of which I have been permitted to draw
at pleasure, and the "Chironomia," of AUSTIN, which
for nearly forty years has been the common source from
which have been derived the principles of Gesture. I take
pleasure in acknowledging my obligations to these emi-
nently philosophical works; and this acknowledgment I
wish to make in this preface in terms so general, as not
again to need to recur to the subject. Having used these
books for several years as works of almost daily reference,
nothing but the most studied affectation could prevent me
from employing the materials which they so richly furnish
for the use of all future learners in the principles of the voice
and of gesture. But aside from this general use of these
works, I have referred directly to them, in the preparation
of almost every chapter and section of this Manual; nor
could I otherwise have done justice to the ordinary learner,
since these books, both by their scarcity and their price, are
placed beyond his reach.

PREFACE.
The principles adopted as the basis of this Manual, and
which are developed in its successive pages, it is believed,
do not differ materially from those views of the subject
which have already received the stamp of public approba-
tion. But this concession is not intended to prejudice the
claim of this book to all the originality, as regards either ar-
rangement, method of illustration, or matter, which experi-
ence in the business of teaching could be expected to sug-
gest on such a subject.
The work of Dr. Rush, just referred to, relates to a single
branch only; and neither this nor the Chironomia professes
to be a practical manual. Several practical works, both on
the Voice and on Gesture, are, however, before the public.
From the merits of these I would not wish to detract one
tittle. Had they fewer faults and greater excellences, the
future authors of text-books in this interesting but neglected
branch of science would find less formidable prejudices to
contend with. I have, as I trust, too just a sense of the
responsibility involved in the preparation of a Text-Book
for Learners, to dare to assume it with any feeling of care-
lessness or indifference. He who prepares a popular text-
book becomes the benefactor or the curse of the age in
which he lives; and, in the last case, may be held answer-
able even to posterity for the injury inflicted on the world.
All these elementary works, also, which were within my
reach, have therefore been consulted; and from them some
useful suggestions have been adopted. They possess very
different degrees of excellence; but it is sufficient to au-
thorize another attempt at setting forth this difficult subject,
that no one of them presumes to bring in a claim to perfec-
tion. Neither does the present work; though it has at least
one advantage over others that of presenting both branches
of the subject in the same volume, which must prove a great
convenience to the teacher, as well as to the learner.

Though some new technical terms will present them-
selves to the student of this Manual, as few such have been
used as the objects and nature of the work would possibly
allow; and from among those employed by different writers,
such have been selected as were judged best fitted to ex-
press the ideas embraced in them. So far as the nomencla-
ture of this science is concerned, the authors before named
have left little for future writers to supply; and to their
works the faithful teacher will not fail to make frequent
reference, till he shall have fully imbibed their spirit.*
I am aware of the difficulty of setting forth with perfect
clearness a subject which is new; and such will this be to
many into whose hands this book will fall. Yet I flatter
myself that I have succeeded in rendering the entire sub,
ject so simple that any person of ordinary resolution and
perseverance can master it, even without an instructor. This
object I have had constantly in view, with the hope that
many a young man, already engaged in the duties of the
holy ministry, may be induced to subject himself to a course
of private training, which may both prolong his life, and
make every portion of it more useful. Still, a few lessons
from a good teacher, when access can be had to one, will
greatly facilitate the progress of the learner.
* In describing the vocal phenomena, I have but rarely found occasion
to deviate from the technical forms of expression used by Dr. Rush; and
still less frequently to dissent from the principles established in his mas-
terly work on the Human Voice. In setting forth the elementary sounds
of the English language, however, I have chosen to retain the old distinc-
tion into vowels and consonants, as well adapted to a popular text-book;
and have used the term tonic, to designate a portion of the consonants,-
a term which he applies only to the vowel elements. The term Slide also,
is not employed by Dr. Rush, which proves that it is not indispensable
even in a full discussion of the functions of the voice. It is used in this
work merely as a matter of convenience, being both a short and expres-
sive designation of one of the most important functions of the speaking
voice.

PREFACE.
To the intelligent and observing, the remark will appear
trite, that in our age, and particularly in our country, a good
delivery is one of the most important acquisitions to the
scholar. To the man who wishes to produce a strong im-
pression on the present age, what other acquisition promises
so much? But the truth that a good delivery can be ac-,
quired by study and practice, is now almost as generally
admitted by the intelligent as is the fact of its importance;
and this Manual is presented but as a more perfect develop-
ment of the same system which has produced nearly all the
accomplished orators of our day. This is but a system of
principles, by which the learner is to be led into the very
arcana of the orator's art, instead of acquiring by mere imi-
tation the power of mimicking some of his tones and ges-
tures.
The section on Expression, it is believed, is a more full
attempt to present the vocal "language of the passions," in
intelligible terms, than has ever before been made. In this
it is not proposed to furnish a substitute for real feeling, In
oratory there can be no substitute for this. The object of
this section is, First, to do for the learner what is done for
the student in many other branches of science-to give him
a theoretical knowledge of that, the practice of which nature
may perhaps have taught him; Secondly, to enable him, by
the use of the appropriate symbols of feeling, to awaken
within himself emotion, when perhaps it may not exist to
the extent he desires, for the natural language of any
passion tends to excite that passion, as directly as the exist-
ence of the passion prompts to its natural expression;
Thirdly, to assist him in overcoming bad habits, whether
of extravagance or of feebleness, in the vocal expression of
the passions; and, Fourthly, to furnish what appears to me
the best system of training for the voice that can be de-
vised.—one that will best develop all its powers, at the

same time that it makes the learner familiar with their prac-
tical uses.
The art of engraving was little understood by the an-
cients. In modern works on elocution much advantage has
been taken of the improvements in this art; and in regard
to gesture, abundant illustrations have been furnished, which
addressing the eye, make a stronger as well as a more de-
finite impression on the mind than could well be made by
words. The Chironomia, in particular, contains a very full
set of excellent illustrations of the principles of gesture,
which most of the later writers on elocution have very judi-
ciously used, instead of attempting to furnish new and infe-
rior drawings. From these I have selected such as would
fully answer my purpose; but have added whatever I
judged necessary to a complete set of illustrations for my
work.*
While examples have been selected for illustrating all the
principles of vocal modulation and expression, the book has
not been encumbered with extracts from other authors merely
for practice. This part of the business has been well done
by others; and there are books enough before the public
containing selections, both for reading and speaking. Per-
haps a book of selections might be made better suited to
improve the higher powers of elocution than any we now
have; it was not, however, any part of the object of this
Manual to supply such defect. Without any such matter,
the pages of my book have multiplied beyond what was
contemplated when it was undertaken, and that, though
brevity has been most assiduously studied.
If the objects proposed in this Manual have been accom-

speaker for his responsible work. But many of the princi-
ples of reading and speaking are the same; so that he, also,
who would become a good reader must study some such
work as this, to render him familiar with these principles.
Aside, however, from all these considerations, there are
reasons why elocution should be studied. The natural
sciences are taught in all our schools, that those who study
them may be able to classify and give names to the various
objects of nature. Even the young lady studies Botany and
the Geography of the heavens, that she may be able to name
the plants and the stars. And is it a matter of no interest
to her to be able to speak intelligibly of the excellences and
defects of those whom from time to time she hears speak?-
to give names to the qualities of the voice and of the action
which they employ? It is not, perhaps, too much to say,
that the time will come, when the power to criticise a speech
shall be considered as essential to the scholar as is now the
ability to criticise a written composition,-when Elocution
and Rhetoric shall be studied as constituting sister depart-
ments, even in a common English education. Then would
every professed speaker cultivate his natural powers, so that
a failure in the management of his voice or in gesture
would be as rare as such a failure now is among professed
singers or performers on musical instruments. On the same
principle that men can learn to sing, or to handle the bow,
or touch the keys of an instrument for the production of
harmonious sounds, they can learn to manage the voice in
speaking, or the arms and hands in gesture.

INTRODUCTION.
Importance of the study of Elocution.-How it must be prose-
cuted. Encouragement to the learner.-Plan of the work.
Is a good Elocution of sufficient importance to deserve
the attention of the American scholar? and can the princi-
ples of Elocution be so taught as to become practically
useful to the speaker, or to him who is destined to become
a speaker? These are important questions; and while a
doubt remains in regard to them, even the youthful learner
must hesitate to enter on the subject with the zeal neces-
sary to ensure success in this or any other branch of useful
study. In regard to the first, I should be doing injustice
to the intelligence of the reader, to attempt to discuss it.
Who are the men that in our great republic are now
attracting universal attention? Who are they, to hear
whom our Senate Houses, our Halls of Justice, and our
Churches, are thronged to overflowing? Who are they,
whom assembled multitudes, in our public halls, in the

INTRODUCTION.
crowded squares and streets of our cities clamor for, and
whose voices they will hear? They are not always the
most learned men among us, nor are they always the most
profound thinkers. Generally speaking, they are men of
good sound common sense, who have a good Elocution.
Eighteen hundred years ago, Quintilian said, "That even
an indifferent discourse, assisted by a lively and graceful
action [comprehending both voice and gesture] will have
greater efficacy than the finest harangue which wants that
advantage." So it has ever been; so it will ever be.
But of what interest is all this to the American scholar-
to the reader of these pages? The same that he has in any
question that concerns his future usefulness, or his future
fame. Ours is a land of civil liberty, where force is never per-
mitted to take the place of persuasion, where tyranny wrests
not from man his native freedom of thought and speech,
and where corruption and venality can never long hold the
control of public affairs. Our institutions then are such as
have ever fostered eloquence. We have a language, too,
superior in several important respects to any modern tongue,
and deficient perhaps in no single requisite to a strong and
effective eloquence. The demand of the public also for a
more spirit-stirring oratory is most obviously increasing.
The evidence of this is found in the public favor, just re-
ferred to, which is bestowed on those who have culti-
vated a good elocution. If we look out upon the stage of
political life, what attracts our eyes more strongly than the
conspicuous positions assigned to those who have the action,
the utterance, and the power of speech to stir men's blood?
We see the same, if we look at the great moral movements
of the day. Whenever the eyes of the public centre on any
human agent, as destined under Providence to effect any

great moral reform, who is he but some one who can wield
the omnipotent power of oral eloquence? This demand ex-
tends even to the sacred desk; and men begin to be restless
when the pulpit is dull and prosing. Whenever they else-
where see exhibited the attractions of an effective elocution,
their minds revert to that day, when the simple preaching
of righteousness, temperance and judgment could make
even a Felix tremble, and they pray for its return.
Nor is this a mere capricious movement of the times.
Intelligent men have begun to reason on the subject. They
have satisfied themselves, that we possess all the essential
elements of oratory which have ever been possessed by
any people; and that the occasions for their development
are not wanting. They see the freedom of debate allowed.
in our legislative halls; the constantly recurring opportu-
nities for the statesman-orator to make his appeals directly
to the popular assembly; the moral enterprises also, that
are to be carried by direct appeals to the popular ear; the
vast interests involved in questions which are discussed in
our ecclesiastical assemblies, and which may well call forth
the orator's best powers; and last, not least, they see the
pulpit, where from week to week thousands stand to ad-
dress their fellows, freely and unconstrained, on the sacred
truths of a sublime religion, to impress on them the claims
of a system of morality singularly pure and attractive, and
to discuss topics of the most elevating and interesting
nature. They see, too, that men can feel as well as reason,
and that they love the feelings which eloquence inspires ;—
that whenever a good elocution exhibits itself in the speaker,
the legitimate effects follow as certainly as when Demos-
thenes or Henry spoke in the senate house, or at the bar,
and as certainly as when Whitefield electrified the multi-

tudes who everywhere thronged-not more to hear the
tones of his voice, and to see his action, than to feel the
overwhelming power of his eloquence. A demand based
on the clear perception of such truths shall not decline;
and green and unfading are the laurels already entwined
for the brows of those who-now rising into life-shall
prepare themselves to bear off the honors in such a contest
for usefulness and honorable distinction.
Eloquence, or even oratory, does not however consist
wholly in a good elocution. Elocution concerns only the
external part of oratory, and may be considered both as a
science and as an art. As a science, it teaches the prin-
ciples from which are deduced rules for the effective deli-
very of what is eloquent in thought and language; as an art,
it is the actual embodying in delivery of every accom-
plishment, whether of voice or of gesture, by which ora-
torical excitement is superadded to the eloquence of thought
and language. In this last sense, it implies the culti-
vation of every external grace with which the delivery of
language should be accompanied, whether in reading, in
recitation, or in spontaneous utterance. As a science, then,
it relates to the knowledge and the taste necessary to direct
in the correct delivery of what is forcible in thought and
expression; and as an art, to the ability practically to exe-
cute that which is dictated by a well-instructed taste. This
presents the general subject in a twofold light; and clearly
points out the double office of a teacher of elocution, and
the twofold excellencies of a perfect Text-Book in this
interesting branch of study. It should give the taste to
direct, and the power to execute.
These are perfectly distinct, though closely allied. Many
speakers fail, not so much from not knowing how a passage

or discourse ought to be pronounced, as for want of the
ability to execute what their cultivated taste has learned.
to admire; while others, it is admitted, have no love
for what is excellent, whether in the intonations of the
voice, or in the action which accompanies them. The
latter blunder heedlessly along, and, without perceiving
it, are guilty of a thousand errors, which of course they
never attempt to correct; while the former too often per-
ceive their errors and defects but to lament them, often
fail in their attempts at improvement, and at other times,
for fear of a failure, neglect to attempt what, had they
dared to risk the experiment, they might successfully
have performed.-It is the object of this Manual, to culti-
vate the taste; and to give to all who will consent to make
it a study the ability to perform whatever a good taste can
direct.
It is generally admitted, that few persons can safely rely,
for the effect of their discourses, solely on a favorable
combination of circumstances, or on their weight of cha-
rácter, or even on mere force of thought or eloquence of
language. The "ornaments of eloquence" must be super-
added. These consist in the various melodies of the voice
and in suitable gesture of the body. "He who arms him-
self with these," says one of the ancient Rhetoricians,
"assaults his hearers in three ways. He invades their un-
derstanding by his eloquence, he subdues their ears by the
charms of his voice, and their eyes by the attractions of
his gesture."-Whether ease and grace of gesture can be
acquired, cannot admit of one rational doubt. In general,
the gestures are performed by the action of the voluntary
muscles; and thus gesture is as much an art, considered
with reference to the mode in which it is to be performed,

as is penmanship, dancing, or any handicraft employ-
ment.
But can instruction improve the voice also? To this
interrogatory it might seem sufficient to reply, that the at-
tractions of the stage in all ages have depended very ma-
terially on the power of vocal execution possessed by the
actors—a power not unfrequently wholly acquired, and ac-
quired too, in the only schools where, in modern times, the
art of speaking has been cultivated. Besides this, the two
great orators of antiquity studied this branch of elocu-
tion in particular as an art. Demosthenes, whose voice
was weak, whose articulation was defective, and whose
tongue stammered, after an unsuccessful effort in which
he was hissed from the assembly, was persuaded by a
player whom he met, to undertake the study of elocution;
and by a course of training such as few have ever sub-
jected themselves to, he demonstrated that the practical
application of the principles of this art can be learned.
Even his great adversary and rival in oratory, after reciting
before the Rhodians, at their request, the oration of Demos-
thenes for Ctesiphon, replied to their expressions of admi-
ration, "What would you have said if you had heard him
deliver it!" With Cicero, too, it was much the same. At
the age of twenty-seven, according to Plutarch, after having
arrived at some eminence as a pleader, "though his voice
had a variety of inflections, it was at the same time harsh
and unformed; and as in the vehemence and enthusiasm
of speaking, he always rose into a loud key, there was rea-
son to apprehend that it might injure his health." He
consequently applied himself to teachers. At a subsequent
period, this writer tells us, "his voice was formed; and at
the same time that it was full and sonorous, had gained a

21
sufficient sweetness, and was brought to a key which his
constitution could bear." But-to show how elocution
was studied in ancient times-he stopped not here, but
visited Asia and Rhodes, to listen to the greatest orators,
and to receive instruction from the best teachers. And it
was at the latter place, when declaiming in Greek before
Apollonius, that the rhetorician, with sadness of heart at
the recollection of the wasted glory of his native land, the
country of Demosthenes, said, "As for you, Cicero, I
praise and admire you, but I am concerned for the fate of
Greece. She had nothing left her but the glory of elo-
quence and erudition, and you are carrying that too to
Rome." The ancient orators and rhetoricians all treated
of the voice as among the first objects of culture; and
wherever great excellence was attained in its management,
it was duly appreciated.
This science has also been studied by many of England's
most eminent orators. Mr. Pitt learned elocution under the
tuition of his noble and eloquent father; and it was of one
of his speeches that even Fox could say, "The orators of
antiquity would have admired, probably would have envied
it ;" and after listening to another, Mr. Windham says of
himself, that "he walked home lost in amazement at the
compass, till then unknown to him, of human eloquence."
The case of Sheridan is still more striking. To adopt
the language of Lord Brougham,-"With a position by
birth and profession little suited to command the respect
of the most aristocratic country in Europe-the son of an
actor, the manager himself of a theatre-he came into that
parliament which was enlightened by the vast and various
knowledge, as well as fortified and adorned by the most
choice literary fame of a Burke, and which owned the

sway of consummate orators like Fox and Pitt." But he
had studied the elocution of the stage-his father had been
his teacher; and although he never acquired any great
eminence as a statesman, yet Pitt himself at one time
writhed under his eloquence. It was at the close of one
of his celebrated speeches before the House of Com-
mons, that the practice of cheering the speaker was first
introduced; and it was on this occasion that Mr. Pitt,
then prime minister of England, besought the House, as
being incapacitated for forming a just judgment under the
influence of such powerful eloquence, to adjourn the deci-
sion of the question. Several of our distinguished Ameri-
can orators, also, it is asserted, are ever ready to acknow-
ledge their obligation to the study of the principles of
that art which is procuring for them so rich a reward of
fame. And some of those who have been most admired,
are far from being those for whom nature had done the
most.
The following system of instruction, both as regards
voice and gesture, consists of principles rather than of spe-
cific rules; and of principles believed to be drawn from
nature, and which, when applied even fully to practice,
will leave the learner sufficiently in possession of all his
natural peculiarities. Their entire object is to refine and
perfect nature; not to pervert it. The greatest orators,
even the most popular players, are those who have made
art subservient to the development of their own native
powers; and who at least seem to have been formed on no
model. Here, as elsewhere, art is supposed to be but the
handmaid of nature.
It is believed that the careful study, on the part of the
learner, of the principles here presented him, even though

thus restricted, if accompanied with proper practice on the
tables and exercises, will do for him all that study has ever
done, or can do, to make the speaker.
First, it will greatly assist to cultivate the taste, as re-
gards all the excellences of a good delivery.
Second, it will give him a distinct articulation; and fur-
nishes the means by which even the more permanent
impediments in speech may be corrected.
Third, it will give him a distinct enunciation, by which
we mean nothing more than perfect distinctness of articula-
tion carried into the general delivery.
Fourth, it will give him the command of the various
elements both of voice and gesture, which give effect to
the expression of thought and feeling, and which, when
properly employed, constitute the external graces of elo-
quence.
Fifth, it will teach him the principles on which these
elements are to be employed the most successfully for the
purposes just named.
Sixth, it will give him such a familiarity with these ele-
ments, and such a command of all his vocal powers, as
will enable him practically to execute whatever he is dis-
posed to attempt. And
Seventh, it will do all this, by perfecting and improving
his own natural powers, rather than by substituting, or at-
tempting to substitute, others for them.
The taste may indeed be improved in various ways,—
by reading works and attending lectures on Elocution, as
also by studying living models of excellence in oratory;
but the power of execution can be learned only by practice.
If it can be acquired by other means, the author of this
Manual has not discovered them. On practice, and on that

alone, we rely in the work before us. It was this alone
that perfected the orators of antiquity. But for this, Demos-
thenes and Cicero would not have been the master orators
of Greece and Rome; yet we hesitate not to say, that the
text-books of Elocution to which the scholar of our day
can have access furnish him facilities for successful practice
which they never enjoyed, though they sought it long and
even in foreign lands. Much of the discipline of the
scholar must like theirs be preparatory and private,-—must
consist in the practice of attitude and action, in loud read-
ing, and in declamation, continued till all the excellences of
a good elocution become a part of his own nature. Nor
will it in general be so long as might be supposed, before
he begins to experience these results. Then will he, with-
out the least embarrassment, as though they were the direct
gifts of nature, carry them into the practice of oratory. So
will he even who is already in public life-in the habit, it
may be, of daily public speaking-by such private prac-
tice find the graces of gesture imperceptibly incorporating
themselves with his public action, and all the defects of his
voice, whether natural or acquired, gradually supplanted by
the opposite excellences. Thus may one learn to speak
according to the strictest rules of art, and yet never be em-
barrassed in any of his public performances by the thought
of these rules.
The practice recommended in the first part of this Man-
ual has a further object than merely to give a command
of the various intonations and inflections of the voice;
though this of itself would be sufficient to recommend it.
If it went no further than this, it would break up the dull
monotony of delivery, and demonstrate to the learner, that
the speaker's want of power to stir men's blood' is not to

be referred to any deficiency in the general provisions of
nature. The practice recommended in our future pages
will show that, without violating any law of the voice, an
endless variety is presented in the expedients which nature
has furnished to give power and efficiency to expression.—
The further purpose however to be secured by this practice
is that healthful discipline of the vocal organs, which it is
believed will make them almost proof against the diseases
by which so many speakers are now laid aside from their
labors in the very prime of their lives and of their useful-
ness. The young man who enters the ministry in parti-
cular, without having his vocal organs inured to the labor
involved in speaking, is always in danger of laying the
foundation, even in his early efforts, of his future decline,
and of his premature death. How many such cases can
the reader call to mind!
In our definition of Elocution, we have made it relate to
all the graces of delivery, whether in reading, in recitation,
or in spontaneous utterance. This suggests what we deem
an important view in connection with this subject, to wit,
that the principles of reading and speaking are the same.
He who knows how to read well can speak well, so far at
least as concerns the management of the voice; and he
who can speak well is left without excuse, if he does not
read with correctness and rhetorical effect. The only dif-
ference between reading and speaking, as regards the
principles of this branch of elocution, is, that the latter
presupposes more emotion, and consequently admits a more
forcible application of its principles.
But Elocution, in the comprehensive signification we
have given to it, relates to gesture as well as to the voice.
Both the voice and the action of the body have a strong

INTRODUCTION.
sympathy with the emotions; in so much, that the state of
the mind can be confidently inferred from the muscular
movements of the individual, as also from the pecu-
liarities of his voice-its loudness or softness, together
with its tones and inflections-though his words may
not be heard. This suggests a strong correspondence
between the voice and the action in delivery; and yet
they are so distinct, that it is presumed the learner will
study them most successfully, if treated separately. Thus
our treatise is divided into two PARTS, to each of which is
appropriated one entire subject.
Something will be gained, if thus early the learner can
be impressed with the full belief, that the principles of this
work, both as regards the voice and gesture, are drawn
from nature, and are thus no work of invention. This is
the origin given of the principles of the orator's art by
Quintilian, who says, "As in physic, men, by seeing that
some things promote health and others destroy it, formed
the art upon those observations; in like manner by per-
ceiving that some things in discourse are said to advantage,
and others not, they accordingly marked those things, in
order to imitate the one and avoid the other;" and such
emphatically is believed to be the origin of all the princi-
ples embraced in the successive chapters of this Manual.
These principles, to be fully appropriated by the learner,
must, so far as they shall be new to him, be dwelt upon
till they become perfectly familiar-as familiar as the rules
of English syntax to the English scholar, or the principles
of logic to the reasoner. Where habits either of voice or
of gesture are to be overcome, other habits must be sub-
stituted. Nothing short of habits of correct speaking and
of correct action can meet all the demands of the speaker,

as he stands up to deliver his sentiments before multitudes
of assembled men. He has no time then to make the in-
tonations of his voice or the movements of his body a
study. To secure the formation of these habits, it is indis-
pensable that the principles hereafter presented should be
contemplated as strictly practical, and be carried from the
exercises of the book into the daily practice of reading and
speaking. The success of the ancient orators, as also of
Pitt, of Sheridan, and many of the distinguished actors of
modern times-proves, as we have seen, the practicability
of thus learning the art of speaking.*

CHAPTER I.
ELEMENTARY EXERCISES OF THE VOICE.
SECTION I.
OF THE ELEMENTARY SOUNDS OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE.
To one who had never thought on the subject, it might
seem strange to commence a treatise on Elocution, by re-
ferring to the elementary sounds of the language; but a
moment's reflection will show its propriety. It is of these
elements that all speech is composed. These constitute the
very basis of all good delivery, and consequently should be
placed at the foundation of all instruction in this elegant
accomplishment. But where are these elementary sounds
to be found? He who would discover them must divest
himself of the idea that they are faithfully represented by
the symbols composing our graphic alphabet. Much less
are they represented by the names of the alphabetic cha-
racters, nearly all of which are complex sounds. It is,
then, only by a careful analysis of our spoken language,
that the elementary sounds entering into it can be disco-
vered.
Having made this analysis, we shall find that some of
our alphabetic characters have no separate sound appropri-
ated to them, as c and x; while others represent several
sounds. Thus a often represents four, and sometimes a
fifth; and the other vowels, each two or more.* There
* Where the same character is used in the following tables to re-
present different elementary sounds, we shall distinguish it, for the
sake of future reference, by the marks which are used in Webster's
Dictionary.
31


## p. 32 (#42) ##############################################

32
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
are still other sounds which have no single character to re-
present them, as ou, oo, oi and oo among the vowels, and
ng, th, sh, &c., among the consonants; yet which are as
elementary as the former. With each of these sounds we
shall present a short word in which it occurs, by the pro-
nunciation of which it is believed the learner will, without
much difficulty, discover the true element intended. The
way in which this is to be done, is to arrest the voice in the
very act of uttering the element in question, and then to
repeat that sound free from combination with any other.
Thus the true sound of a will be caught, by arresting the
voice on the word a-le, before the l is touched by the or-
gans of speech; and thus also of b or l, before entering on
the vowel sound that follows them in the words b-ow and
l-ove. And so of all the others.
In arriving at these elementary sounds, the learner will
derive much advantage from a living teacher; but it is
believed he will find no great difficulty in discovering
the true sound of every element presented in the two fol-
lowing tables. Should there at first appear something ludi-
crous in the attempt, let him remember that it is only a
matter of habit, and that a little familiarity will make these
sounds as familiar as are the names now usually but erro-
neously given to our alphabetic characters. And when
these fundamental sounds are once fairly mastered, we shall
hereafter see that they can be turned to great account. Of
these sounds, as heard in the pronunciation of the English
language, there are forty-two,-sixteen vowel and twenty-
six consonant sounds.-If the following tables are not phi-
losophically correct, it is believed they are practically so.

*NOTE TO THE TEACHER.-On this and all the following Tables
and other exercises for practice, the first business of the teacher is
to exemplify and illustrate to the learner or to his class the prin-
ciple, or principles involved; and let the practice on these consti-
tute the preparation for the next interview. Then let the learner, or,
in case of a class, each pupil separately, repeat the proposed exer-
cise, with such correction and further instruction as may be called
for. For securing a greater familiarity with the exercise, a class
may then repeat it together, under the teacher's direction. Mutual
correction is recommended in this and all the future exercises, when
practiced by a class.

REMARKS ON THE TABLES.
35
On the foregoing Tables we shall make only the follow-
ing practical remarks:-
1. By prolonging the sounds of the long vowels, and
dwelling upon them, the learner will perceive, that except
a, a, e, and oo, they are not pure, but pass into other
sounds; thus a, i and oi pass into ē; ō, u and ou, into oo.
It appears, therefore, that these latter are strictly diphthongs.
This characteristic of these elements cannot fail to become
apparent even to the unpracticed student, by making each
of them terminate an interrogative sentence. Thus, Is this
called ā? Is that called ? &c.-This peculiarity in the
structure of these sounds needs to be carefully marked and
attended to; otherwise, when they are prolonged, they may
lose their true pronunciation. The sound with which they
commence must not be dwelt upon too long, nor must they
be allowed to pass on to the final sound too soon; as, in
either case, the true sound of these elements as heard in
speech is lost.
2. There follows the utterance of the consonant elements,
a breathing or little voice, which has been conveniently de-
signated the vocula, or vocule. This is most apparent after
the utterance of the mutes, to which indeed it is essential.
As a function of the voice, it possesses a power in speech
which will be referred to hereafter. In the utterance of
these elements however, the vocule should not occupy a
prominent place.
3. Except the first four, the tonic consonant elements
are most obviously capable of being prolonged at pleasure.
These also may be prolonged by practice, and may acquire
a considerable degree of fulness and force. When thus
protracted, they exhibit a guttural murmur which, when
sounded alone, has no peculiar beauty, but in the com-

36
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
pounds of speech often adds much to the grace, as well as
to the effect of utterance.
4. R should be made vibrant, whenever it is followed
by vowel which is articulated; and in energetic expres-
sion, may be thus uttered even when followed by a conso-
nant. The peculiarity here referred to, in the articulation
of this element, consists in giving a single percussion of the
tongue against the roof of the mouth. If, in common dis-
course, the vibration of the tongue is continued, or if the r
is made vibrant at all, except before the open vowels, it
savors of affectation, or presents the provincialism which
so strongly characterizes the dialect of the Irish. The full
beauty of this sound can be developed only by much prac-
tice; and cannot be mistaken, when heard in such words
as ruin, pray, &c.
5. The z is one of the most agreeable sounds to the ear
that our language furnishes. But its agreeable qualities are
developed only as the tongue recedes from the teeth. It
should be entirely divested of the hissing sound of s; and
this can be done only by withdrawing the tongue, in its
utterance, not only from a contact with the teeth, but from
a close approximation to them.—It is worthy of remark, that
in our written composition, this element is sometimes repre-
sented by x, as in exhibit, &c.; and much more frequently
by s than by z, its proper representative. Thus the aspi-
rated hiss heard in the words sin, yes, &c., even though
sometimes represented by c, and even by x, does not occur
in our language nearly so often as its appropriate sign pre-
sents itself to the eye.
6. The atonics, including the mutes and aspirates,—
take the name we give them from the fact of their being
destitute of vocality in their utterance. The learner will

REMARKS ON THE TABLES.
37
not then expect to produce a sound, in his attempts to utter
these elements.
7. In the attempt to utter the mutes, nothing can be
heard but the vocule of which we have before spoken.
8. In practicing on the elements, as well as in ordinary
speech, the aspirates should be passed over lightly. All
prolongation of these is a defect in utterance.
9. In the exercises on these simple elements, as well as
on all the future tables, great care should be taken to open
the mouth so as to afford a free passage for the sound.
The lips should never be compressed in speaking. Ex-
cept in the pronunciation of the elements ō, oo, and ou, all
protrusion of the lips however should be avoided. It is
this erroneous position of the lips that produces the fault of
articulation called Mouthing.*
Before leaving this section, the learner should be certain
that he has the exact sound of each of the alphabetic
elements fully at his command; and when he has become
entirely familiar with them, he may be assured that he will
not be likely to fail in any of his attempts to utter them in
the compounds of speech. Unfortunately, the graphic
characters employed in our language do not, except in a
few cases, of themselves indicate the exact sound to be
given to them in the words in which they occur. This
must be learned from Dictionaries, and by observing the
best usage. But when this is done, the learner has but to
employ his already disciplined organs in the execution of
what usage and taste shall dictate.
* Sheridan uses this term differently. "By Mouthing," he says,
"is meant dwelling upon syllables that have no accent, and ought
therefore to be uttered as quickly as consistent with distinct articu
lation; or prolonging the sound of the accented syllables beyond
their due proportion of time."

SECTION II.
OF ARTICULATION.
A GOOD articulation is a rare excellence even among
those who are called good speakers; and such is its
value, that it can even atone for many other deficiencies.
It is of great service to the speaker, as it enables him to
make himself heard anywhere, without any great effort of
the lungs, and also secures to him the attention of his
hearers. A good articulation can scarcely fail to secure
attention. And to the hearers also, it is a matter of much
interest; since it enables them distinctly to hear what is
said, and that with an agreeable satisfaction, instead of
having to put forth a painful effort. When the alphabetic
elements found in the tables of the last section can be ut-
tered with facility, and with accuracy and neatness, a
foundation deep and broad has been laid for a good articu-
lation. For these are the very sounds which occur in
speech, though not such as are heard in the pronunciation
of the names of the graphic characters composing our
alphabet. When once, then, the learner has them at
command, he can rarely fail in his articulation for want of
ability to utter them as they occur in the compounds of
speech. As regards the vowel sounds, though not difficult
of utterance, yet, inasmuch as the letters by which they
are represented have no uniform sound, and are often not
sounded at all, in vulgar pronunciation they are not unfre-
quently substituted the one for the other, or suppressed alto-
gether. Thus we are compelled to hear sudden, hyphen,
sloven, mountain, uncertain, Latin, satin, gospel, chapel,
poem, pronounced as if spelled-suddn, hyphn, slovn,
mountn, uncertn, Latn,satn, gospl, chapl, pom; and so of a

ARTICULATION.
39
great number of words of similar pronunciation. The è and
the ō are likewise often suppressed in the whole class of
words beginning with pre and pro, as in predict, prevent, pro-
duce, promote, pronounced-prdict, prvent, prduce, prmote.
The unaccented ū is also often suppressed, or made to sound
like e, in such words as particular, regular, singular, &c.;
and on the contrary, the unaccented e and a are as often
suppressed, or converted in pronunciation to u, in the final
syllable of words ending in ent, ar, ant, ence and ance, as
in-government, auricular, inhabitant, evidence, igno-
rance. Indeed bad habits of articulating the vowels
are liable to deform in utterance almost every word and
syllable of the language. The effect of the exercise recom-
mended in the different sections of this chapter will be to
correct all such errors of articulation. If however after
practicing these exercises, the learner shall detect himself
in any error of this kind, he should make out a list of such
words as he fails to articulate correctly, and practice on
them daily, not only till he can utter them, but till he can
do it with naturalness and ease.
Many of the combinations of consonant sounds, which
occur in our language, are really difficult of utterance, and
may be appropriately exhibited here for the express pur-
pose of practice on them.-The following list will be found
to contain all the difficult combinations that can occur in
speech. To many, some of them will seem almost impos-
sible to be uttered; but let such recollect that the difficulty
is not produced by us. We select only combinations which
actually exist, and which any one is constantly liable to
meet with in reading or speaking. Many of these can be
rendered easy of utterance only by familiarity with them.
At first, they will probably be pronounced by the learner

in a stiff, affected, and perhaps awkward manner. Practice
however will overcome all the difficulty; and ease and
grace may be combined in the utterance with dignity and
force. And with most persons this can result only from
practice, practice, the same that gives ease and grace in
the exercise of any of the other physical functions. Na-
tural impediments, or defective organs of speech, are much
more rare than is usually supposed.

to direct the special attention of the learner to their execu-
tion, whenever they occur in his reading exercises. A
vicious articulation is sometimes more apparent in the cur-
rent of discourse, than in the pronunciation of single sylla-
bles or words. This is not unfrequently induced by the
animal and intellectual temperament; and the habit, if it
has been otherwise formed, is always rendered more in-
veterate where there is a sluggish action of the mind, or an
excess either of vivacity or of sensibility. In the one case,
the sounds proceed from the organs of speech half-formed,
and indicate to every one that the reader or speaker is too
slothful to make the necessary effort for distinct enuncia-
tion; while in the others the confusion arises from too
much haste. In either of these cases, after all the practice.
recommended in this and in succeeding sections, additional
exercises may be found necessary; and these may consist
simply in reading aloud an hour each day, in a slow and
distinct manner, and in the presence of some one who will
notice and correct the slightest tendency to let fall a conso-
nant or a syllable from the organs of speech unfinished, or
to hasten the rate of utterance beyond that of the utmost
deliberation.-An attention to this whole matter is the more
important, as our language furnishes none of those expe-
dients for preventing difficult collisions of sound, or for
facilitating their articulation, which the Greek afforded and
in which several of the modern languages abound.
SECTION III.
OF THE TIME OF THE VOICE.
TIME means the same with quantity; and syllables are
considered as long or short, according to the time given

OF THE TIME OF THE VOICE.
49
them in utterance. When, however, time is spoken of with
reference to the utterance of a sentence or of a discourse,
it is designated as slow or quick. The power to prolong
the sound of syllables capable of quantity is of infinite im-
portance to the effect of delivery, at the same time that
it may be considered an elegant accomplishment in the
speaker.
In music there are terms to express the nicest shades of
quantity, from the demi-semiquaver to the semibreve. In
elocution, the same phenomena exist, though we have no
terms to express them. Every elementary sound however,
or every syllable, is not equally capable of protraction.
The short vowels, for example, cannot be prolonged like
the long vowels; and when one of these standing alone is
followed by a mute, the syllable is of the shortest kind.
Thus ak, ap, at, ac-count, ap-point, at-tic. These are
called Immutable syllables. If however, even in this situ-
ation, the short vowel is preceded by a tonic consonant, it
is lengthened somewhat. Thus trap, des-truc-tion, grat-
itude. These, with syllables ending in b, d, g, or j, as
also those ending in the aspirates, are called Mutable sylla-
bles. But if the syllable terminates with a long vowel, or
with any tonic consonant except b, d, g, j, it may be pro-
longed, or shortened, to any desired extent; and hence
they are called Indefinite syllables.
Quantity, although most obviously a distinct element,
and deserving of this separate consideration, yet can never
be represented free from combination with other elements.
Hence we shall not present any exercises for practice under
this head; but having now obtained a distinct idea of its
nature, without delaying at this point to set forth its useful

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
applications, shall pass to consider another of the attributes
of good delivery.*
SECTION IV.
OF STRESS.
EVERY sound capable of prolongation, uttered without
excitement, and in a natural manner, commences full and
somewhat abrupt, and gradually decreases in fulness, till it
becomes a mere breathing. Though this movement of the
voice may be varied almost at pleasure, yet it has suggested
the designation of the Radical movement as applicable to
the first part of the sound; while the last part-the gradual
decrease and final termination of the sound-has been
called the Vanishing movement of the voice. And these
designations continue the same, on whatever part of the
sound the principal force of the voice is laid. This force
of voice however is called STRESS; and, when given at the
opening of the sound, is called Radical stress, because
given on the radical part of the vocal movement. The
stress may be given so as to fall on the middle of the move-
ment, when it is called the Median stress; or it may fall
at the vanish, that is, at the close of the sound, in which
case it is called the Vanishing stress. A command of the
several functions here described, is of the utmost importance
to the speaker, since they each have their peculiar signifi-
cancy, and since, with few exceptions, some one of them must
enter into the pronunciation of every syllable forcibly ut-
tered. We shall therefore propose some exercises which,
*The exercises proposed in the next section on Stress are equally
well adapted to the improvement of the voice, as regards Quantity.


## p. 51 (#61) ##############################################

OF STRESS.
51
while they illustrate this subject, will give the learner the
command of quantity, and lay a foundation for general
improvement in all the vocal powers.
Radical Stress.-This is the kind of stress heard in the
successive strokes upon the keys of a piano. It may also
be given by the voice, on both the long and the short
vowels; and is the only kind of stress which the Immuta-
ble syllables can take. The exercise, however, on sounds
or syllables of short quantity, we shall reserve for another
section; and here use only such as combine both stress and
quantity. And we shall use, for this purpose, the simple
elements, and the simplest combinations; because, though
we might employ short words, we could scarcely find
words embracing all the various elementary sounds, and
thus the learner would lose the improvement in articulation,
which we purpose to combine with the exercises of this
and several of the following sections. Let the learner then
refer to Table I; and striking each of the long vowels
successively full at the opening, let the voice gradually die
away till it becomes inaudible. This will exhibit the sim-
plest modification of quantity; and may perhaps be repre-
sented with sufficient accuracy to the eye thus:-
Let this exercise be continued till the learner has acquired
perfect smoothness of voice, and the command of the equa-
ble movement which decreases gradually till it dies away
in silence. When all the beauties of this vanishing
movement are developed in execution, the ear is scarcely
less delighted than in listening to the higher excellences of
music. This function of the voice should then be carefully
cultivated; and to aid in its further training, and at the same

*NOTE TO THE TEACHER.-This and the four following Tables
are carried out so as to embrace all the possible combinations, for
the purpose of detecting in the learner any defects of articulation,
should such exist. On any combination which proves difficult of
utterance, the practice should be continued till the sound is per-
fectly familiar to the organs of speech.-For the mere purpose of
exercise in regard to stress or quantity, where no such difficulty of
articulation presents itself, a few only of the most common and
agreeable combinations may be used.

and fully uttered; but without prolonging them, let the
voice abruptly burst upon the vowels, taken one by one,
which are to be protracted as in the exercise recommended

consistently with a neat pronunciation.

the learner should be cautioned against habitually protracting the
initial consonants in ordinary delivery. When thus prolonged, the
enunciation becomes disagreeable and affected. This is sometimes
heard in the pulpit; and Dr. Rush speaks of having heard this de-
fect in the pronunciation of the following words of Macbeth, by a
distinguished actor-

TABLES FOR PRACTICE.
55
In the foregoing Table the vowels are to receive short
quantity, while the consonants are lengthened as much as
possible. In this, as in the VIth Table, the learner will
find the consonant elements b, d and g more difficult of
prolongation than the others, and more difficult than in
the other exercises; but the ability to extend the quantity
of these elements is so desirable, that the practice on them
as well as on the others is here recommended.
In all these exercises, the learner should be careful to
exhibit a distinct articulation of the elements, composing the
syllabic combinations, to give the usual relative quantity to
these elements, and carefully to execute the delicate vanish
which sho terminate the vocal movement. Most of the
combinations thus formed, however strange to the ear they
may sound on receiving this separate pronunciation, actu-
ally occur in the regular flow of ordinary speech; and he
who leaves these exercises, either from their inherent diffi-
culty of execution or from disgust, leaves them but to find
them again, where, from inability to execute them, he may
experience the chagrin of a failure, for having avoided the
trouble of a preparation.
Median stress.-This is designated in music by the term
swell; and in works of music is represented to the eye by
the following sign:-
The sound here indicated gradually swells to a full vo-
lume, and then gently subsides, exhibiting all the charm
connected with the vanishing movement as before described.
It is suited only to syllables of long quantity, and therefore
the long vowels of Table I, and Tables IV, V, VI, and VII,
are all that can be used for exercise on this form of stress,


## p. 56 (#66) ##############################################

56
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
and they may be used under these two conditions: First,
care should be taken that the middle point of the sound
have the greatest fulness, and that the swell and vanish be
smoothly and equably formed; and secondly, that in the
Vth and VIIth Tables, embracing the atonics, the protrac
tion of sound should be confined to the vowels, while in
the others, it should extend to the consonants.
Vanishing stress.-This can be given only on syllables
of long quantity; and is the exact reverse of the Radical
stress when combined with quantity. This then would be
represented to the eye thus:-
It consists of a gradual increase in the fulness of the
sound from the radical to the extreme of the vanish, which
should exhibit a high degree of abruptness. For practice,
use the long vowels of Table I, and Tables IV, V, VI and
VII.
There is another kind of stress occasionally though
rarely used, which is laid on both the radical and vanish
of a syllable of long quantity; and is called the Compound
stress. This has its peculiar force in delivery, as will be
seen under the head of Emphasis; but its recurrence is not
sufficiently frequent to suggest in relation to it any system
of practice. There is still another form of stress which
consists simply in the addition of force to the natural con-
crete movement, and which is designated as the Loud
Concrete. This is employed particularly in accent.
It may not be amiss to remind the inexperienced learner
that all these forms of stress, not less than the combinations
of elements employed in the Tables of this section, are
among the constantly recurring phenomena of actual speech.

PITCH OF THE VOICE.
57
The lessons of this section are then of the most practical
character, whatever the learner may be inclined to think
of them; and thus should not be hastily abandoned even
in the first place, and then should be often recurred to as a
discipline of the voice.
SECTION V.
OF THE PITCH OF THE VOICE.
PITCH has exclusive regard to the place of the sound
with reference to the musical scale; thus its variations are
denoted by the terms high and low, rise and fall. Dif-
ferences in pitch are always presented by touching different
keys of a piano; and the extent to which the learner can
rise or fall on the musical scale determines the compass of
his voice. The Natural or Diatonic scale to which we
here refer consists of a succession of eight sounds either
in an ascending or descending series. A simple sound
produced at any point in the scale, is called a note; and
the first of these sounds in an ascending series is called.
the keynote. The distance between any two points of the
scale, whether proximate or remote, is called an interval.
The intervals between the proximate points are called tones,
except between the third and fourth, and the seventh and
eighth; in which cases they are but half the length of the
others, and are called semitones.
The intervals between the first or keynote and the others
successively are called the second, the third, the fourth,
the fifth, the sixth, the seventh and the eighth or octave;
and this irrespective of the point assumed on the scale as
the keynote.
Compass of voice, or the power to rise and fall at plea-

sure through a wide scale, is of great importance to the
speaker. It relieves his vocal organs from the fatigue of
efforts long continued on the same pitch, and also furnishes
the basis of an agreeable variety in his intonation. The
compass of the voice may be sufficiently extended by
proper exercise on the Tables of the foregoing sections, on
words, or on sentences. First, let the example be uttered
on as low a note as possible; then let it be repeated, gra-
dually rising to the highest pitch of which the voice is ca-
pable. This exercise judiciously and perseveringly prac-
ticed cannot fail to give the learner the command of a suffi-
ciently extensive compass of voice.
The changes of pitch produced by striking the different
keys of the piano are called discrete changes of pitch. The
same may be produced by drawing a bow across the differ-
ent strings of a viol. The space between these successive
notes is called a discrete interval. Another kind of change
may be produced by sliding the finger along the string of the
viol at the same time the bow is drawn, which is called a
concrete change of pitch; and it is this which is heard in
every effort of the human voice at speech as distinguished
from song. In song, as produced by instruments, the
sound is continuous on the same note; and it is the same
with the human voice also, after the intended note is once
reached by a slight upward movement. The continuity
of sound on the same line of pitch is peculiar to song.
This never properly belongs to speech; but, as a defect in
delivery, is sometimes heard in the pulpit exercises of some
of the minor Christian sects. This "puritanical whine," or
system of "speech singing," which prevailed so generally
two hundred years ago, is now however passing away.
This peculiarity of speech we shall illustrate. Let the

learner propose to himself in a familiar manner, this question:
Do I say ā, or ā? and he will perceive a difference in the
successive modes of uttering this vowel. In the first, the
movement is upward, and in the latter it is downward.
And now if he shall attempt to repeat the vowel elements,
he will find that the voice will naturally fall into the one or
the other of these modes of utterance; that is, it will either
rise or fall on each successive effort. And the result will
be the same, if he shall attempt to pronounce syllables or
words.
Having satisfied himself of the existence of a rise or fall in
these cases, let him repeat the same question with different
degrees of earnestness; and he will find that the rise and
fall will become greater, as the énergy with which he pro-
poses the question increases. The space in all these cases
between the radical and vanish is called a concrete interval.
And these movements, according as they are upward or
downward, are called upward or downward Slides of the
voice.*
The slides of the voice which occur mostly in speech,
are those of the semitone, of a full tone or second, of the
third or two full tones, of the fifth, and of the octave; all
of which, except the first, may be represented by the aid of
the musical scale.

Upward
Fifth.
1. The slide of a Semitone.-This is heard in the com-
plaints of children, and is also the element which gives the
peculiar expression to the language of grief, or of pity. It
should be at the command of every speaker, and yet there
is danger of using it too freely. It can be caught by
the experienced ear, in the attempt to imitate the tender
emotions, and can then be readily transferred to any desired
syllable or word; but the exercise will be most successful
if confined to passages expressing complaint, grief or pity.
This element, when extended beyond mere words or
phrases, is called the Chromatic melody.
2. The slide of the Second.-This is the slide employed
in the reading of simple narrative, and in unimpassioned
discourse, and when used continuously constitutes the Dia-
tonic melody.
3. The slides of the Third, Fifth, and Octave.-Exercise
on these several functions of speech, after the extent of each
shall be determined, is peculiarly important; and the ex-
ercise may extend to both the upward and downward
movements. The upward movement may be given either
with the radical or vanishing stress; the downward usually
though not always requires the radical.
The musical scale will suggest to the learner the means
of measuring the extent of a slide, by fixing in the mind
the radical and vanishing points and thus determining the

interval.
It will also enable him to fix beforehand the ex-
tent of the slide which he wishes to practice. Suppose it
to be a Third, he will rise two notes above the key thus
fa-sol-la, or do-re-mi, discretely; and then, instead
of going up by skips, will rise on the sound fa or do con-
cretely up to the place of la, or mi; and thus fix for him-
self the limit of the desired slide. Then it may be repeated
on one of the vowel elements, or on any syllable or word
at pleasure. The same, if it be a fifth or an octave. And
when he has learned to determine these points, he is pre-
pared for practice on this branch of the subject; and prac-
tice obviously is all that is necessary to enable the learner
to extend the slides from any one point to another within
the compass of his voice.
For practice on these slides, both upward and downward,
we would recommend to the learner,
1. To use the long vowel elements of Table I.
2. To use the words employed in the same Table to
illustrate these elementary sounds; thus, ale, all, arm, &c.
This table of words may be extended at pleasure.
3. It is recommended to the learner, to apply these slides
to words, as they occur in current discourse. In the fol-
lowing exercises, the acute accent-' is used to denote the
rising slide, and the grave accent- the falling. And
whenever this latter inflection occurs, it is to be specially
borne in mind, that the downward movement does not
commence on the same line of pitch with the current
melody, but always on a line above it.
1. Will you gó-or stày? Will you ride-or walk? Will you
go to-day-or to-morrow?

believest.

render more secure those who stand; not to irritate the hearts of the

THE DIATONIC SLIDES.
63
The teacher, or learner, can multiply these examples at
pleasure; and the subject should not be passed over, till
the ear of the learner can distinguish instantly between the
rising and the failing slide, as it occurs in speech; nor till
he can execute them at pleasure.
The learner need scarcely be reminded, though we treat
the different functions of the voice separately and devote to
them different sections in our Manual, yet that in speech
they are often united. Thus, the slides can never be
given without involving quantity, and some one of the dif-
ferent kinds of stress. But though so closely allied, still
they are entirely distinct elements.
Before leaving this subject, we proceed to notice some
of the practical uses of the slides, and the rules which
direct their employment.
I. THE DIATONIC SLIDES.
These are slides through a single tone only, and are not
used for purposes of Expression. These slides distinguish
speech from song, and in discourse belong to the utter-
ance of every syllable, which does not take in a wider con-
crete interval for the purpose of Emphasis or Interrogation.
In the simple melody of speech, the rising slide greatly
predominates over the falling; as the latter occurs only at
the close of sentences, or members of sentences, nor always
there. Rules then are only requisite to determine the slide
before pauses. These have been multiplied by writers on
Elocution; but, reserving the rules for Emphasis and Inter-
rogation for another place, it is believed that the rules for
the Diatonic Slides may be briefly summed up thus:-
RULE I.—The proper Cadence, at the close of a com-
plete sentence, requires that the last syllable, and in some


## p. 64 (#74) ##############################################

64
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
constructions several of the concluding syllables-rarely
however exceeding five,-should take the Falling Slide.-
This principle will find ample illustration in the section on
Cadence.
RULE II.-Members of sentences which express a com-
plete and independent sense, require the Falling Slide on
the last accented syllable, and on all that follow it.
EXAMPLES.
1. Charity suffereth long, and is kìnd; charity ènvieth not; cha-
rity vàunteth not itself; is not puffed ùp; doth not behave itself
unseemly; seeketh not her òwn; is not easily provòked; thinketh
no èvil.
2. The wind and rain are òver; calm is the noon of dày; the
clouds are divided in heaven; over the green hill flies the incon-
stant sùn; red through the stony vale comes down the stream of
the hill.
3. The soul can exert herself in many different ways of action:
she can understànd, will, imàgine-sèe and hear—lòve and dis-
course and apply herself to many other like exercises of different
kinds and nàtures.
4. I observed that those who had but just begun to climb the
hill, thought themselves not far from the tòp; but as they proceed-
ed, new hills were continually rising to their view; and the sum-
mit of the highest they could before discern, seemed but the foot of
anòther: till the mountain, at length, appeared to lose itself in the
clouds.
RULE III.-Members of sentences which do not express
a complete and independent sense require the Rising Slide.
-The pauses which follow such members or clauses-are
called Pauses of Suspension.
EXAMPLES.
1. If some of the branches be broken óff, and thou, being a wild
olive-trée, wert grafted in among them, and with them partakest


## p. 65 (#75) ##############################################

THE DIATONIC SLIDES.
65
of the root and fatness of the olive-trée; boast not against the
branches.
NOTE. This rule may be applied, even when the hypothetical
member occupies the last place in the sentence; as in the follow-
ing: We are bound to set apart one day in seven for religious
ties, if the fourth commandment is obligatory on ús.
2. His father dy'ing, and no heir being left except himself, he
succeded to the estàte.
3. To be pure in heart, to be pious and benévolent, constitutes
human happiness.
4. My lord, I think I saw him yèsternight.
5. If we exercise upright prínciples, (and we cannot have them,
unless we éxercise them,) they must be perpetually on the increase.
NOTE. Here, the parenthetic clause, though expressing a perfect
sense, cannot take the Falling Slide, because the sense of the mat-
ter which immediately precedes it is suspended, and thus the mind
is not prepared for the rest indicated by such a slide.
6. So when the faithful pencil has designed
Some bright idea of the master's mind;
Where a new world leaps out at his command,
And ready nature waits upon his hand;
When the ripe colors soften and unite,
And sweetly melt into just shade and líght;
When mellowing years their full perfection give,
And the bold figure just begins to líve,—
The treacherous colors the fair art betray,
And all the bright creation fades away!*
In practice, a single exception to Rule II is sometimes
heard, and is allowable, though rarely demanded :-
:-When,
in a sentence expressing a complete sense, the emphasis of
the Rising Slide is given to some word or syllable preceding
the last, the syllables which follow it may all take the dia-
*It is not a little surprising, that Mr. Walker, and after him Mr.
Knowles, have referred the Rising Slides in the reading of this pas-
sage, to the influence of tender or pathetic sentiment.

·
tonic rise; as the syllables which follow the rising emphasis
in the following examples :—
1. You are not left alone to climb the arduous ascent.
2. It was an enemy, not a friend, who did this.
The occasions for the recurrence of this form of emphatic
distinction will be fully illustrated in the section on Em-
phasis.
There is another apparent exception to this Rule, which
however is not real. It is, when the matter, which would
express a perfect sense if it should stand alone, is closely
connected with other matter; and in reading may, or may
not, take the Rising Slide, though it often does. Thus,
1. There was a man in the land of U'z, whose name was Job.
2. The dew of night falls, and the earth is refreshed.
The words, in such cases, may be considered but as con-
stituting part of a proposition, and thus as not coming un-
der the rule. But separate these introductory clauses, so
that they shall of themselves constitute entire propositions
expressing a complete sense, and they will then take the
Falling Slide. Thus,—
There was a man of distinguished excellence in the land of U`z;
his name was Job.
The dew of night fàlls; and by its fall the earth is fertilised and
refreshed.
It is believed the learner will find these rules and re-
marks sufficient for his purpose; and that he could not, till
he becomes acquainted with the principles of Emphasis,
prosecute the subject further to advantage.
II. EMPHATIC SLIDES.
All the slides enumerated in this section as employed in
speech, except that of the Second, may be used for pur-
1

67
poses of Emphasis. This subject will be found illustrated
at some length, in Section III, Chapter II.-The employ-
ment of the wider intervals of the Third or Fifth, instead
of the Second, in the current melody, is inconsistent with
dignified utterance, and is a very marked defect in delivery.
III. INTERROGATIVE INTONATION.
Before leaving this section, we wish to see how its
principles can be applied to the expression of Interroga-
tion. The question is usually indicated by the form of the
sentence; but in order to exhibit the power of intonation
alone, it is necessary to take a sentence which has not the
interrogative form. Let the following passage be read as
an imperative order ;-
Give Brutus a statue with his ancestors;
and it will be perceived that each syllable takes the down-
ward inflection. If now, without any change in phrase-
ology, the same line be repeated with the rising slide
of the third or fifth on each syllable, it will at once ap-
pear to the ear to take the character of sneering interroga-
tion. From this it may be confidently inferred, that the
rising slide is the prime element in interrogation. This
may be further illustrated by the following passage from
the Coriolanus of Shakspeare.
Serv. Where dwellest thou?
Under the canopy.
Cor.
Serv. Under the canopy?
Cor.
Ay.
Serv.
Where's that?
Cor.
In the city of kites and crows.
Serv. In the city of kites and crows?
But the rising inflection does not prevail throughout the
whole of all interrogative sentences. To illustrate this, as


## p. 68 (#78) ##############################################

68
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
also to ascertain the law which regulates this matter, we
will present the following questions selected at random.
1. What night is this?
2
2. Must I leave thee, Paradise?
3. What! threat you me with telling of the king?
4. Sir, are you my father?
5. How can you say to me I am a king?
6. Who's there?
7. Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
In the natural reading of these examples, it will be per-
ceived that the second, third and fourth take the rising in-
flection throughout, and close also with the rising slide;
while the others close with the falling. The characteristic
element in those which take the rising inflection through-
out, is the direct inquiry they contain; by which we mean,
that they are such questions as demand for an answer—yes,
or no. The others, not admitting the answers, yes and no,
may be called indirect questions. This first form of vocal
movement we shall denominate the Thorough Interrogative
Intonation, as opposed to the other, which may be called
the Partial. The rule then which we deduce from these
principles may be expressed thus;-The Direct Question
takes the Thorough Interrogative Intonation, while the Indi-
rect Question takes the Partial.
――――――――――
These two forms of question may be presented to the
eye thus :-
Thorough Interrogative Intonation.
What! threat you me with tell- ing of the king?

can you say to me, I am
EXAMPLES.
Judge me, ye Gods! wrong I mine enemies?
And if not so, how should I wrong my brother?
This last form of the interrogation admits the use of the
concrete slide of a third or fifth on one or a few of the syl-
lables, while the rest, and particularly those near the close,
take the melody of common discourse, and constitute a
regular cadence.
We add the following practical remarks:-
1. In interrogation, the extent of the upward slide on
those syllables that receive it, varies from the third to the
octave, with the degree of earnestness with which the
question is put.
2. Some expressions which have the grammatical form
of the direct question, as in earnest appeals, exclamatory
sentences, and argument, are intended to express only
positiveness of conviction; and thus they take the partial in-
tonation only.
You all did see, that on the Lupercal,
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?
a king?
He now appears before a jury of his country for redress. Will
you deny him this redress?
Do you think that your conditions will be accepted? Can you
even imagine they will be listened to?
Such interrogations open with a rising slide of a fifth or
octave, but immediately change to the deep downward

concrete, or the direct wave-soon to be explained. This
downward movement furnishes the appropriate expression
of positive conviction, as the rising does of doubt and un-
certainty.
3. Even the Direct Question, if very long, and especi-
ally if at the same time it concludes a paragraph or a dis-
course, may take the Partial Intonation.
4. In questions which admit the Thorough Intonation,
though the syllables generally are pronounced with the
rising concrete of a given interval which prevails through-
out the whole, yet those which are emphatic may pass
through a wider interval than the others. This will be
illustrated under the head of Emphasis.
5. The mere form in which the question is stated does
not always determine whether it is Direct or Indirect.
Thus, the question,-"Did you see him or his brother?"—
has two meanings, according as or is understood disjunc-
tively or conjunctively. If the latter, the question is direct
and takes the rising slide; if the former it is indirect and
takes the falling.-In this case, however, the first member
always takes the intonation of the Direct Question.
Though we have dwelt thus long on the Diatonic and
Interrogative Slides, we are not prepared to affirm, that the
sense is always or even generally dependent on these inflec-
tions of the voice. Sometimes they do determine the sense;
but the English, the Scotch, the Irish and the Americans
all use them differently and yet understand each other. In
some portions of our own country, even the direct question
universally receives only the partial interrogative intona-
tion,-terminating with the falling slide, or perhaps the
inverted wave of a second-soon to be described. Dif-

71
ferences in the use of these inflections, more perhaps than
any thing else, mark the provincial peculiarities which
characterize the speech, in different parts of our country.
The rules here laid down, it is believed, correspond with
the best usage of the country; and a conformity to such
usage alone can guard the speaker against the charge of
provincialism, or impropriety.
SECTION VI.
OF THE WAVES OF THE VOICE.
THE Rising and the Falling Slides are often united on
the same long syllable, and this complex movement of the
voice is called a Wave.* The parts of which it consists
are called constituents. These upward and downward
movements may pass through the same, or through different,
intervals; for example, the wave may be formed by the
rising and falling third conjoined; or by a rising third,
passing into and being terminated by a falling fifth. This
gives rise to the designation of waves as equal or unequal.
Whether equal or unequal, they may consist of two, three,
or more constituents; and this gives rise to the distinction.
of waves as single, double or continued. And whether con-
sisting of constituents of equal or of unequal length, or of
two constituents or more, the wave may commence with
an ascending or descending slide. The wave commencing
with an upward movement is called the Direct Wave, the
other the Inverted Wave.
When it is suggested that all the slides which we have
described, varying from a semitone to an octave, enter as
*This is called by Steele and Walker the circumflex accent.


## p. 72 (#82) ##############################################

72
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
constituents into these waves, it will appear, that, in theory-
at least, the wave may be almost endlessly varied. It is
found however, that in the practice of those who speak the
English language, the variations employed are not very
numerous, and of these the following are the most im-
portant.
The Equal Wave of the Semitone. This cannot be re-
presented to the eye in a manner to make the subject any
more plain. If, on any long syllable, the learner will com-
bine the Median Stress with the expression of pathetic or
solemn sentiment, he cannot fail to give either the direct or
inverted wave of the semitone. These are both heard in
the slow utterance of the tender emotions, serving beau-
tifully to vary this melody of the voice.
Direct.
Inverted.
The Equal Wave of the Second.-This movement of the
voice, aside from the consideration of stress, may be repre-
sented to the eye thus ;-the heavy
part simply marking the radical
point, which may or may not be
characterized by fulness of sound. Indeed the median stress
rather than the radical prevails in the wave of the second.
It is by the frequent recurrence of these waves, that grave
discourse, even where the words cannot be attended to, is
distinguished from the gay and sprightly. They occur on the
syllables of long quantity, and, for the sake of variety the
direct and the inverted are interchanged instinctively by a
well-trained voice. Whenever the waves of the semitone
or of the second become double, it is for the purpose of
lengthening the quantity, on a word which is intended to
be strongly marked.
The Equal Wave of the Third.-This is often heard in
ordinary spirited conversation. It may be represented to

73
the eye, as may also the equal waves of the higher inter-
vals, thus:-
Of the Third.
Direct.
Inverted.
EQUAL WAVES.
Of the Octave.
Of the Fifth.
Direct. Inverted. Direct. Inverted.
The Waves of the Fifth and the Octave, as also the Un-
equal Waves, are reserved for the expression of the stronger
passions, as exhibited in dramatic dialogue, and in the
higher efforts of the orator. Irony, scorn and strong sur-
prise cannot be expressed without their aid.
To aid the learner in acquiring the command of the vo-
cal movement here called the Wave, the following illustra-
tions are given, the substance of which is found in the
Grammar of Elocution.
66
Pity the sorrows of a poor old man."
If long quantity and a plaintive tone be given to the
words "poor" and "old," in the foregoing example, they
will exhibit the direct wave of the semitone: and if the
word "man" receive a plaintive expression and extended
quantity, and the voice be made to rise on the second
part of the wave, it will show the inverted wave of the
semitone.
"Hail! holy light."
If the word "hail" is uttered with long quantity, with a
perceptible downward ending, and without any emphatic
stress, it will show the direct equal wave of the second.
"High on a throne of royal state."
17


## p. 74 (#84) ##############################################

74
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
If this line be pronounced in a similar manner, it will
exhibit the inverted equal wave of a second on the syllables
"high," "throne," and "roy."
"I said he was my friend."
Let this sentence be slowly uttered, with long quantity
upon "my," accompanied with such an emphasis as to
contrast it with your friend, and the word "my" will
show the direct equal wave of a third.
"Ah! is he your friend, then?"
Let this last sentence be uttered as a reply to the pre-
ceding, and with an air of surprise, though with long
quantity and a natural emphasis upon "your," and it will
display the inverted equal wave of a third.
(6 Yes, I said he was my friend."
If this sentence be reiterated with a strong positive em-
phasis upon "my," and with extended quantity, it will
exhibit the direct equal wave of a fifth.
"Is he solely your friend?"
By increasing the emphasis of surprise, making the in-
terrogation more piercing, and extending the quantity of
the word "your" in this sentence, the inverted equal wave
of the fifth will be heard.
If, in the sentence, "I said he was my friend," the word
"my" be uttered with a strongly taunting and at the same
time positive expression, that word will show the direct
unequal wave.
If, in the sentence, "Is he your friend?" the word
"your" be uttered with a strong expression of scorn and in-
terrogation, it will exhibit the inverted unequal wave.
When these waves have once become familiar to the
ear, the voice may be trained to their execution, by com-
bining them with the long vowel elements, or with any of

the combinations which admit of protracted quantity. The
uses of these functions of the voice will be pointed out in
the sections which treat of Emphasis and Expression, in
Chapter II.*
SECTION VII.
OF FORCE OF VOICE.
By Force of Voice, we mean simply strength or power
of voice. The lion has more force of voice than the dog.
The sound of the bugle or the organ has more force than
the flute. Great force of voice is not always needed; but
*NOTE TO THE TEACHER. The learner should, at this point, be
subjected to something like the following system of exercise. Let
some one of the elements, say ā, be selected, or some word suscepti-
ble of long quantity, and the learner be required, without the aid of
the teacher's voice, to pronounce it-
1st. With the Radical [Median or Vanishing] stress.
2nd. On a high [or low] pitch.
3rd. With the Falling [or Rising] Slide of the Second, [Third,
Fifth, or Eighth.]
4th. On the Equal Direct [or Inverted] Wave of the Second,
[Third, or Fifth.] And let this exercise be continued on these sim-
ple functions of the voice, at pleasure.
Then let him be required to combine such of these functions as
are susceptible of combination: as, for example, to pronounce the
designated element—
1st. With Radical Stress, and on the Low Pitch.
2nd. With the Radical Stress, and with the Falling Slide of a
Third.
3rd. With the Median Stress, and in the Equal Inverted Wave
of a Third.
4th. With the Vanishing Stress, and the Rising Slide of a Fifth.
5th. With Long Quantity, and on the Direct Wave of the Semi-
tone, &c.
This exercise may likewise be advantageously continued, till the
learner has acquired a facility-not in imitating, but in executing
for himself, under the teacher's direction, all these vocal functions,
both singly and in combination.

to the speaker it is sometimes of infinite importance, while
it cannot interfere with any other vocal function. To him
who is called to address large assemblies, or to speak in the
open air, a powerful voice gives the double advantage of
making himself distinctly heard, and of exhibiting what is
always strongly demanded by a popular audience—evi-
dence of earnestness and sincerity. Its acquisition, then,
should be among the first objects of him who would pre-
pare for the practice of the orator's art. The capabilities
of the human voice, in point of power, are rarely deve-
loped, for the simple reason that they can be brought out
only by education; and education, in any proper sense of
the term, is here rarely applied. The hand is trained to
penmanship, and even the voice is sometimes slightly dis-
ciplined in regard to some of its functions, by the teacher
of music; but who now thinks of giving the voice a full
system of training for the high and responsible duties con-
nected with oratory? Had it been thus in Greece, she
would have had no Demosthenes: had it been thus in
Rome, Cicero would have lived for nought. Unless per-
chance we should except a very few of those trained for the
stage, the practical speaker is not now to be found, who
has been trained as was either of these men whose oratori-
cal powers have made them immortal.
If I mistake not, the learner has already thought that our
exercises and suggestions for practice were becoming too
numerous and too tedious. But there is no "royal road"
to the orator's proud elevation. We suggest the system of
elementary practice, because we know of no other in which
the future orator can learn to execute the high principles of
his art. It is a very different thing to judge of a good
piece of workmanship in the handicraft arts, from what it

77
is to execute such a piece. There is the same difference
between the mere theoretical and the practical orator ;-
between him who has learned the principles of good speak-
ing by study and by listening to lectures, and him who has
been instructed on such a system as is here taught.
In no respect is the voice more capable of improvement
than in regard to its force; and this may be combined with
long or with short quantity, with all the kinds of stress,
with every variety of pitch, and with all the slides and
waves of the voice. Thus for the purpose of training this
function of the voice, the learner may repeat all or any of
the lessons suggested for practice in the preceding sections,
only with greater fulness and energy. But while a careless
and transient recurrence to these lessons will be of little
service in developing the full powers of the voice, an inju-
dicious exercise on them may produce permanent injury.
An hour spent in vociferating the elements or syllabic
combinations, and that perhaps on an improper pitch, or
without due regard to the proper radical and vanishing
movements of the voice, might with subsequent exposure
of itself produce the results we are preparing to guard
the future speaker against. These exercises, when pro-
perly conducted, have a twofold operation: first, they teach
how the various functions of the voice can be employed
the most successfully, and with the greatest ease; and
secondly, they habituate the voice to the exercise of its
powers. That the greatest good however may result from
the training here proposed, the following rules ought to be
observed.
1. Let the exercise be repeated daily, or perhaps twice.
each day, if it is found the voice will bear it.
2. Let not the exercise at first be long continued, not

more than ten or fifteen minutes,-nor till any degree of
hoarseness is produced.
3. Let not the voice at first be exercised to the full ex-
tent of its powers; nor the exercise be long continued,
either on the highest or the lowest pitch of the voice.
4. Special care should be used to guard against harsh-
ness or hoarseness of voice in these exercises. The voice
should be formed low down in the throat, the tongue being
retracted and depressed, and the mouth sufficiently open to
emit a smooth volume of sound.
5. The articulation of every element employed in the
exercise should be perfect. Austin in his Chironomia says,
in regard to the articulation of words, "They are not to be
hurried over; nor precipitated syllable over syllable; nor
as it were melted together into a mass of confusion. They
should be neither abridged nor prolonged; nor swallowed,
nor forced; they should not be trailed, nor drawled, nor
let to slip out carelessly, so as to drop unfinished. They
are to be delivered out from the lips as beautiful coins
newly issued from the mint, deeply and accurately im-
pressed, perfectly finished, neatly struck by the proper
organs, distinct, in due succession, and of due weight."
But the articulation of the words depends on the articula-
tion of the elements which compose them.
6. When in these exercises force is connected with long
quantity, whether radical or median stress is employed,
special care should be given to the utterance of the vanish.
The gentle and gradual decline of sound, as heard in the
finely executed vanish, delights the ear scarcely less than the
higher graces attending musical execution.
7. At first, these exercises should be remitted during a
period of feeble health, or during the hoarseness attendant

FORCE OF VOICE.
79
on a cold; or else abated in energy, so as not greatly to
fatigue the vocal organs. With a little familiarity however,
and special care to preserve the erect position, and to use
chiefly for the production of sound the abdominal and in-
tercostal muscles, this will be found a most healthful exer-
cise. It should not follow immediately a hearty meal,
nor be preceded or followed by stimulating drinks; nor,
if the exercise has been violent, should it be followed by a
careless exposure to the cold or damp air.
8. There is a period of youth, when the voice begins to
break and to assume the manly tone, during which no vio-
lent exertion of the voice should be made. While all the
other exercises of this Manual may be practiced during
this period, those of this section should be reserved till
the voice becomes confirmed and established.
9. Any successful effort to attain great power of voice
must presuppose an observance of all the rules essential to
the general health. Intemperance in drink, the use of to-
bacco, or excess of any kind, injures the voice, not less
than the other powers of both body and mind.
But there is an exercise still to be suggested, which
aids perhaps in a higher degree the acquisition of a powerful
voice, than any of those already proposed. It is on what
Dr. Rush calls the explosive power of the vowel elements.
To commence this exercise, let each of these elements as
presented in Table I, be uttered with a suddenness like
that presented in the abrupt vocality heard in the cough.
The organs of speech must be open and free from com-
pression, according to one of the foregoing directions, and
each sound must be produced by a single instantaneous
effort of the voice; which is neither more nor less than the
forcible application of the radical stress, with the shortest

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
possible quantity. And when a facility of thus producing
these sounds has been acquired, let the learner repeat
them with increasing degrees of force on all the different
degrees of pitch from the lowest to the highest of which
his voice has the command. This exercise may be con-
tinued and varied by using Table IV, and extending it by
adding to the foot of each vertical column the six short
vowel elements as found in Table I. Then let it be re-
peated, sometimes giving the shortest possible quantity
both to consonants and vowels; and at others, protracting
the consonants as much as possible, and bursting with
sudden full explosive force on the vowel sounds, giving
them as before the shortest possible quantity.
Table V, extended as it has just been proposed to ex-
tend Table IV, may also be used for practice, never at-
tempting however to protract the atonic elements.
Energy and perseverance can alone overcome difficulties,
and it seems the decree of Heaven that real value cannot
be procured but by labor. If the learner supposes that
the full benefits proposed by this and the preceding exer-
cises are to be obtained by the few occasional exercises
of the lecture room, or in an ordinary course of lessons by
a master, he has mistaken the nature of his undertaking.
It is not in this way that the arts of penmanship, of fencing,
or horsemanship are brought to their perfection. The
business of the teacher here is to direct the learner how to
educate his own powers; and this discipline, conducted in
the way we have proposed, may be advantageously carried
on for years. And what would men think of the clergy-
man, the lawyer, or the physician, who should count his
education finished, when he entered on the practice of his
profession!

QUALITY OF THE VOICE.
81
Before leaving this subject, it may be suggested that
loud and rapid reading or speaking also furnishes a very
valuable kind of training for the purpose of giving force
and energy to the voice. These cannot however fully
supply the lack of a prior discipline of the voice on the
elementary sounds of our language, and on the simple
combination of these elements; since without this the
enunciation will be apt to be indistinct. A few speakers
have acquired wonderful power of voice, mainly by the
exercise of speaking. Dr. Porter says, "The habit of
speaking gave to the utterance of Garrick so wonderful an
energy, that even his underkey was distinctly audible to
ten thousand people. In the same way the French mis-
sionary Bridaine brought his vocal powers to such strength,
as to be easily heard by ten thousand persons, in the open
air; and twice this number of listening auditors were
sometimes addressed by Whitefield." Thousands, less for-
tunate than these, have broken down in the attempt to ac-
quire this power by other means than we here recommend,
and have been compelled to retire from public life, or have
gone prematurely to their graves.
SECTION VIII.
OF THE QUALITY OF THE VOICE.
THE Quality of the voice is usually designated by such
terms as rough, smooth, harsh, soft, full, slender, musical,
shrill, nasal, &c. Without going into any definition of
these terms, we may remark that the quality of the voice,
as regards all its general characters of excellence, cannot
but be improved by the exercises and practice suggested
in the preceding sections. In this section, instead of going

82
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
into an explanation of these popular terms, it will better
subserve the interests of the learner to examine the quality
of the voice under the following heads;-the Orotund, the
Tremor, the Aspiration, the Guttural, the Falsette, and the
Whisper.
1. The Orotund.-The quality of voice implied in this.
term is possessed naturally by some, but more frequently
has to be acquired by exercise and practice. It is pos-
sessed in no degree by a very large part even of public
speakers, and in very different degrees by actors and ora-
tors of eminence. When possessed, it presents the follow-
ing advantages, as set forth by Dr. Rush. First, The mere
sound is more musical than that of the common voice.
Secondly, It is fuller in volume than the common voice;
and as its smooth musical quality gives a delicate attenua-
tion to the vanishing movement, its fulness, with no less
appropriate effect, displays the stronger body of the radical.
Thirdly, It has a pureness of vocality that gives distinct-
ness to pronunciation. Fourthly, It has a greater degree
of strength than the common voice. Fifthly, From the
discipline of cultivation it is more under command than the
common voice; and is consequently more efficient and pre-
cise in the production of long quantity, in varying the
degrees of force, and in fulfilling all the other purposes of
expressive intonation. Sixthly, It is the only kind of
voice appropriate to the master style of epic and dramatic
reading. It is the only voice capable of fulfilling the ma-
jesty of Shakspeare and Milton. Through it alone the
actor consummates the outward sign of the dignity and
energy of his conceptions. Finally, Its use does not
destroy the ability to use at will the common voice; their
contrast may therefore throw a sort of vocal light and shade,

THE ASPIRATION.
83
so to speak, over the other means of oratorical coloring and
design.
The practice which we have recommended in the pre-
ceding sections--particularly the last, cannot fail to secure
to the learner this quality of voice, in a higher or lower de-
gree.
2. The Tremor.-This expresses the tremulous move-
ments of the voice heard in the act of laughing and of
crying, and is naturally associated with the language of
mirth and of sorrow. It is an important function of the
voice, and may be readily caught by the learner from the
voice of the teacher, from the feigned effort of laughing,
or from the affected expression of a feeling of mirthfulness
or of deep sorrow. This function may be practiced on any
element, syllable, or word of long quantity: but when ac-
quired the learner should recollect that it has its peculiar
significancy, and can never be properly introduced into
ordinary delivery, when the feelings it expresses are want-
ing. Indeed, like the other most expressive elements of
speech, it requires to be used with great caution.
3. The Aspiration.-The basis of the quality of voice
here designated is found in the element h, which has been
pronounced to be only a breathing. In the sigh we hear
the sound of this single element associated with quantity,
and can mark its radical and vanishing movement. There
are several other elements which, admitting only of a whis-
per, are called aspirates; but these have a character and ex-
pression of their own, and are not to be confounded with
the form of aspiration under discussion.
When we speak
of this as a quality of the voice, it is implied that this ele-
ment is capable of so blending with the other elements
employed in speech, as to give a distinct character to the

utterance.
For example, let the following lines be read
with suppressed force, and with an expression of apprehen-
sion, or fear:-
-:
"Hah! dost thou not see by the moon's trembling light;
Directing his steps, where advances a knight,
His eye big with vengeance and fate?"
If the learner does not on this passage spontaneously ex-
press the quality of voice here described, it will at least
indicate to him one of the principal sentiments of which this
is the symbol.
((
If he succeed, he will find that such words as "dost,"
"moon," "trembling," vengeance," and "fate,” are
uttered as though spelled dhost, mhoon, trhembling, vhen-
geance, fhate; and this process of aspiration is carried on
according as the feeling rises, till the voice may be almost
or entirely sunk in whispers.-This function of the voice
requires to be used with caution.
4. The Guttural.-The quality of the voice here referred
to is thus designated, because it is formed in the throat. It
should never be employed in the current of discourse, nor
as a function of the voice does it ever stand alone. It is
usually combined with the radical or vanishing stress, and
the aspiration; and is thus used on the word "detestable,"
in the following passage:-
"Nothing I'll bear from thee
But nakedness, thou detestable town."
Any words of the same general import, such as despica-
ble, dastardly, contemptible, scorn, &c., uttered with an
affectation of the feeling which the use of them often im-
plies, will for the sake of practice on this function bear the
same modes of pronunciation. Dr. Rush says, "when
this element is compounded with the highest powers of

85
stress and aspiration, it produces the most impulsive blast
of speech."
5. The Falsette. This term is used and is well under-
stood in vocal music, as indicating the kind of voice em-
ployed by the singer when he wishes to rise above the
compass of his natural voice. This admits of cultiva-
tion and may by a little practice be employed on many
of the notes which the natural voice can reach. In speech
however it is always a defect, either heard in the current
melody of discourse, or in the breaking of the natural voice
of the public speaker. It is not uncommon in the voices
of women; and men of feeble voices, particularly if they
have occasion to speak to large assemblies, are in danger
of falling into it. It has its peculiar expression in the
whine of peevishness, the high tremulous pitch of mirth,
and in the scream of terror and of pain.
6. The Whisper.-This may be called a kind of voice,
but needs no illustration here. It is the symbol of secresy.
The voice generally used in common conversation, and
which differs from any which we have described as em-
ployed to give effect to delivery, may be called the natural
voice.
SECTION IX.
OF THE MELODIES OF THE VOICE.
IN speaking of the slides of the voice, in the section on
Pitch, the Slide of the Second was appropriated to simple
narrative and to unimpassioned discourse. The object of
this section is to develope the phenomena which occur,
when the movements of the voice extend only to intervals
of a single tone, as is the case always where neither feel-

ing nor emphasis enters into the expression. As the con-
crete movement of the voice on the successive syllables is
made through the interval of a tone, so the discrete move-
ment from syllable to syllable is made only through the
same space. This may be presented to the eye by calling
again to our aid the musical scale.

readily catch the melody of the two readings here sug-
gested; and can satisfy himself that others might still be
given which would not differ from what we often hear in

plain discourse. They both contain the conditions pro-
posed as to the concrete and discrete changes of pitch;
and however the order of the concrete tones may at first
seem to vary, they will all be found reducible to the six
following combinations.
Where two or more successive notes occupy the same
place of radical pitch, it is called the phrase of the Mono-
tone.
Where, of two successive notes, the one is next in radi-
cal pitch above the other, the phrase is called the Rising
Ditone; and where next below, the Falling Ditone.
Where the radicals of three successive notes ascend, it
is called the Rising Tritone, and where they descend, the
Falling Tritone.
Where there is a succession of three or more notes alter-
nately a tone above or below each other, it is called the
Alternate Phrase.
Where the falling tritone occurs at the end of a sen-
tence, it is called the Triad of the Cadence.
These several Phrases of Melody are thus presented by
Dr. Rush, on the following lines.

Thus, even for the expression of plain thought, has na-
ture furnished an interesting and beautiful variety in the
elements provided for the use of the human voice. Yet
under the influence of bad habits, this rich provision is
often entirely disregarded, and the ear is literally pained
by listening to the sentiments of those who might be good
speakers, doled out in an infinitely extended monotone, or
varied only to exhibit at set intervals the uniform recur-
rence of the same phrases of melody,-producing thus a
mechanical variety scarcely less inexpressive, or less offen-
sive to the improved ear than the dullest monotony.
We now proceed to enumerate some of the more simple
Melodies of the Voice, and to show how they are consti-
tuted.
1. The Diatonic Melody.- This is produced by the
varied succession of all the phrases just enumerated; and
is the only one adapted to the expression of plain
thought, interrupted neither by interrogation, emphasis,
nor emotion.
2. The Melody of the Monotone.-This is produced
whenever the Phrase of the Monotone predominates, as it
naturally and properly does in all dignified and solemn
subjects. When the speaker rises near to the top of his
Natural Voice, his utterance is apt to degenerate into the
monotone, simply because he cannot take a higher pitch
without falling into the Falsette. And, in passing, we may
express the belief, that this defective intonation of the
voice, from whatever cause it arises, produces more of
disease in the vocal organs, and brings more speakers to
an untimely grave, than all the causes connected with the
healthful use of these organs, and with necessary fatigue
and exposure conjoined.

3. The Melody of the Alternate Phrase.-This designa-
tion is applied to the melody, where the Alternate Phrase
predominates. It is well suited to the expression of the
higher passions, and to facetiousness.
4. The Melody of the Cadence.-This indicates the me-
lody at the close of sentences; and in unimpassioned dis-
course, it is usually produced by the Falling Tritone,-the
last constituent, at least, taking the downward slide.-This
subject will be treated at length in another place.
To these may be added two other forms of melody not
arising immediately out of the principles laid down in this
section.
5. The Chromatic Melody.-This designates the plain-
tive melody in which there is a predominance of the
semitone. The term is borrowed from music.
6. The Broken Melody.-This marks the peculiar ex-
pression of pain, deep grief, and of extreme exhaustion or
weakness; where the current melody, whatever it may be,
is broken by frequent pauses, beyond what the grammatical
connection requires or allows.
Here we shall close what may be called the technical
part of our work. We have now presented all the elements,
so far as the voice is concerned, which we deem essential
to an effective elocution; and most of those which are de-
veloped in perfect oratory. And the learner who has gone.
carefully over the preceding pages, successfully mastering
the difficulties he has had to meet, and training his voice
by the exercises which have been suggested for his prac-
tice, may feel assured that the course thus commenced will
soon place at his command all the vocal functions necessary
for the expression of every passion of the human heart, and

for the execution of whatever a good taste can dictate as
excellent in the highest efforts of the finished orator.
That these vocal functions may again be brought before
the mind and with some additional suggestions, we shall
close this chapter with a brief enumeration of such as are
hereafter to be applied to the execution of the principles of
the orator's art.
SECTION X.
RECAPITULATION.
IN SECTION I, after enumerating the alphabetic elements,
the Vocule was referred to as an incident connected with
the utterance of several of the consonants, and of the mutes
in particular. It will also be heard in the utterance of all
words terminating with one of these elements, and will be-
come more full and distinct just in proportion to the energy
with which the word is pronounced. From this it appears,
that the vocule is not only a means of giving emphasis,
but is the exact measure of the emphasis given on such
words.
It is the improper use of this element that is sometimes
heard at the close of each sentence, most frequently in the
language of prayer. Thus employed it is a great defect;
and is always the result of habit, which generally arises
from a slovenly mode of articulation, but may however
have its origin in the imitation of some bad model.
SECTION II is devoted exclusively to practice for the
purpose of acquiring a distinct and ready articulation.
IN SECTION III, Time as appropriated to syllables was
treated as long or short; but it should be borne in mind


## p. 91 (#101) #############################################

RECAPITULATION.
91
that Quantity, which is but another term for Time, varies
from the most hurried articulation of the syllable, to the
most protracted note implied in the term long quantity.
Syllables are called Indefinite, Mutable, and Immutable,
according as they are more or less susceptible of quantity.
This is an important function of the voice; and is always
employed in connection with others. When long quantity
is used to express sentiments which require short time, its
employment is characterized as Drawling.
In SECTION IV, Stress was considered under the designa-
tions Radical, Median, Vanishing and Compound. The
last three require long quantity for their execution; and
they are all supposed to be symbols fitted by nature to be
the representatives of distinct emotions and passions. To
these was added the Loud Concrete employed in accent.—
No form of stress is perhaps so frequently misapplied as
the Vanishing. This as a fault is most frequently heard in
the pronunciation of the Irish.
In SECTION V, Pitch was the term used to represent the
movements of the voice with reference to the musical scale;
and the changes in pitch as heard in speech, are limited
only by the compass of the natural voice of the speaker.—
In common reading, and in ordinary discourse, what may
properly be called the Middle Pitch of the voice is em-
ployed; and this is the note also on which sermons and
public addresses should be commenced, so as to allow an
elevation of pitch, as the speaker becomes warm in his
subject, without the danger of transcending the compass
of his natural voice.
The Diatonic Scale was said to consist of eight sounds
either in an ascending or descending series, embracing
seven Proximate Intervals, five of which are Tones, and

two Semitones. Each sound is called a Note; and the
changes of pitch from any one note to another are either
Discrete or Concrete, and may be either rising or falling.
Concrete Changes of Pitch are called Slides; and of these
movements there are appropriated to speech the slides
through five different intervals,-the Semitone, the Second,
the Third, the Fifth, and the Octave. The command of
all these slides is essential to an effective elocution; and
especially the higher, as they occupy a prominent place
among the symbols of emotion, and properly constitute the
lights and shades of discourse.-The Semitone, when mis-
applied, gives origin to the fault called Whining.
In this section the learner was introduced successively
to the Diatonic Slides-those which belong to common
discourse, and which distinguish speech from song; to
the Emphatic Slides, employed for the purposes of Em-
phasis; and to the Interrogative Intonation, which was
said to depend on the rising slide. This Intonation is
called Thorough, when the question is direct, and the
rising slide extends to each syllable of the question; and
Partial, when the question is indirect, and the interrogation
closes with the downward slide.-We may here repeat the
important practical remark, that in reading or speaking,
when the slide is downward, the radical point of the
movement, except when employed in the cadence, should
always be struck above, and in case of the emphatic
slides, considerably above, the key of the current melody.
The attempt to give the downward concrete from the line
of the current melody constitutes one of the most common
errors, particularly in reading.
In SECTION VI, the Waves or circumflex movements of
the voice are fully discussed. They are considered first as


## p. 93 (#103) #############################################

RECAPITULATION.
93
Equal and Unequal, according to the relative length of the
different constituents. These, then, are either Single,
Double, or Continued, according to the number of consti-
tuents which enter into them. And all of these may be
varied by giving to the first constituent an upward or a
downward inflection, which gives rise to the designation
of waves as Direct and Inverted. It is believed that these
distinctions in the form of the wave are founded in nature,
and that they are all heard in the delivery of accomplished
speakers.
As to the intervals to which these waves extend, it is
obvious that the only limit fixed by the capabilities of na-
ture is the compass of the voice. Nature however does
not always work to the full extent of her powers, but gra-
duates the application of those powers to the wants of the
case. So it seems to be here. Perhaps the wave never
extends in any of its constituents beyond the octave, nor
does it usually exceed the interval of the third.
Though so essential to the expression of its appropriate
sentiment, the learner should be reminded that even this
element cannot be indiscriminately used. Dr. Barber has
remarked of this, "that it is incompatible with a sustained
impression of dignity;" and thus that "persons prone to
the circumflex, can never read Milton or Shakspeare well."
By the same fault the dignity of the Holy Scriptures may
be obscured; and thus it is, that their sacred truths but too
often reach only the ear, even when read amidst all that is
impressive connected with the sanctuary of God. This
element occurs as a fault in the colloquial dialect of New
England, where the waves are often heard, instead of the
simple rising and falling slides.

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
SECTION VII is devoted to the improvement of the voice
with reference to Force. In practice, great force of voice
is generally connected with elevation of pitch; and thus
these elements though entirely distinct are often con-
founded with each other. The terms piano and forte, in
music, have no reference to key or pitch, but refer to force
alone. Neither great force nor a high pitch are at all times
demanded in delivery; indeed these are never required at
the opening of any ordinary address. The best practical
rule for the speaker as to force, is—to commence as though
addressing a person occupying about the middle of his
audience; thus avoiding the consequences of excessive
efforts of the voice too long continued, and at the same
time leaving room for such increase of force as sentiment
may demand.
Force of voice is the principal element in what is called
Ranting. It is however generally accompanied by other
excesses-violence in the use of the radical or vanishing
stress, or too high a pitch. And when from such causes,
the utterance of the speaker becomes obviously difficult,
the interest of his audience will soon become that of sym-
pathy for himself, when they can be expected to have little
feeling but that of anxiety for his relief and their own.
In SECTION VIII, the learner is presented with the voice
in which conversation is usually carried on, under the de-
signation of the Natural Voice. The full development of
the vocal powers essential to the higher displays of a per-
fect oratory, and which is acquired only by a system of
training, constitutes what is called the Orotund,—the kin
of voice, it may be remarked, by the aid of which some of
the masters of song charm and astonish an admiring audi-
ence. The other kinds of voice occasionally used and with

great effect are the Tremor, the Aspiration, the Guttural,
the Falsette, and the Whisper.
It is seen in SECTION IX, that by a careful analysis of the
speaking voice, its movements can be measured and set to
the musical scale; and that however various the combina-
tions of these vocal movements may at first appear, they
may readily be reduced to six, called Phrases of Melody.
These are the Monotone, the Rising and Falling Ditone,
the Rising and Falling Tritone, and the Alternate Phrase.
By a more careful analysis, we ascertain that some of the
simpler styles of delivery take their character from the pre-
dominance of some one of these phrases of melody. Thus
we have the Diatonic Melody, the Melody of the Monotone,
of the Alternate Phrase, and of the Cadence; and to these
are added the Chromatic Melody which arises from the
predominance of the Semitone, and the Broken Melody.
The Mechanical Variety in the employment of the Phrases
of Melody, referred to in this section, is often rendered still
more offensive, by being combined with a corresponding
variety in pitch and force. Thus, sentences are sometimes
successively commenced on a high note and with a full
voice, which however gradually falls and dies away in force,
till it becomes nearly inaudible; and at the same time the
melody will almost necessarily be mechanically varied.-
The learner will infer from this, that errors and faults of
delivery, not less than excellences, admit of combination ;
and indeed he may at this point be reminded, that such
faults as these rarely occur single. These faults thus oc-
curring both single and in combination, how varied are the
means of deforming the beautiful simplicity of nature's
workmanship!

ing voice with the single remark, that whatever of intricacy
or of complexity has appeared in this chapter, it has not
been produced by us.
Speech is the characteristic of man. Nature has been
profuse in those gifts which are connected with this divine
power. The learner can find nothing here of our own, or
of invention. If indeed he finds here delineated all the
resources which nature has placed at man's command, it is
perhaps more than we ought to hope. We shall see how-
ever, as we proceed with the next chapter, that even with
these resources the power and variety of human expression
may become almost infinite.

CHAPTER II.
PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES.
SECTION 1.
PRELIMINARY REMARKS. t.
We have now presented to the reader what we deem to
be the most important functions of the speaking voice.
These are not matters of invention, nor can any of the ele-
ments of effective delivery be properly such. They must
be dictated by nature herself, and must be drawn out from
her great store-house. When by analysis we have disco-
vered and examined them, and by practice and familiarity
have made them our own, we then ourselves become mas-
ters of the resources of nature.
The exercises of the foregoing chapter have had refer-
ence chiefly to the mechanical part of the orator's art; still
we have as yet little more than presented the learner with
the implements of his future trade. The principal office of
Elocution remains,-which is, to teach their use-to teach
the application of these principles to practice. And then,
if the organs of speech, or indeed any of the vocal organs, are
defective, even the mechanical part cannot be performed;
but if they are perfect, and yet there is a defective intel-
lect, a bad taste, or a feeble will, they cannot make a per-
fect orator. Great excellence in oratory must doubtless
have as a basis a well-balanced mind:-an intellect сара-
ble of a full development, sensibilities lively and suscep-
tible of powerful action, and the elements of a will ade-
9

quate to the control and regulation of all the powers of the
mind. The possession of these must be accompanied with
judicious and various exercise: the mind must be stored
with knowledge, the reasoning power improved, the judg-
ment matured and perfected, the powers of invention and
memory strengthened, and the imagination cultivated and
chastened; the original susceptibility of emotion must be
kept alive and a good taste grafted thereon; and the will
must be trained to a perfect self-possession. If to these
natural powers, thus trained, we add a knowledge of human
nature, a command of language, a sound body and a good
moral character, little can be wanting-but the power of
mechanical execution.
The lessons of this chapter, it is believed, will have a
tendency further to discipline the voice, at the same time
that they improve the judgment, and chasten and correct
the taste. The attention of the learner will be successively
called to Accent, Emphasis, Expression, the Drifts of Me-
lody, Transition, and Cadence.
SECTION II.
OF ACCENT.
ACCENT consists in distinguishing one or more syllables
of a word from the others, by some peculiarity in the utter-
ance; and such are the laws of the English language, that
every word which consists of more than one syllable, has
at least one to be thus characterized, whether uttered singly
or in current discourse. Accent then must be given irre-
spective of feeling or expression; and hence may be de-
fined the inexpressive distinction made between the syllables

OF ACCENT.
99
of a word. This obviously plays but a subordinate part
in speech; but yet it is a great source of variety, at the
same time that it is the principal instrument in our versifi-
cation.
In determining what syllables are to be marked by ac-
cent, taste or feeling has nothing to do; this is settled by
usage. Words however, spelled in the same way but
having different meanings, often have the place of their
accent changed : Thus désert, a wilderness; desert',
merit or demerit;—con'duct, behavior; conduct', to lead
or manage. And so of many others. But though good
taste has nothing to do with determining what syllables are
to receive the accent, it has much to do with the manner
in which they are to be thus distinguished.
There are three ways in which accent may be given; by
extending the natural time of the syllable, by giving it
throughout more than its natural force, and by laying a
stress on the radical point of the syllable. Here we are
presented with time, and two of the forms of stress, be-
fore explained, to wit, the loud concrete and the radical,
as elements which may be used in accent. The three forms
of accent thus defined may be designated as the Temporal,
the Forcible, and the Radical. The Temporal accent is
confined to syllables of indefinite quantity; but since in
English the accented syllables are generally the longest in
the word, this form of accent in current speaking and reading
is the most common. The accent of force may be given
to all but the immutable syllables, and to these the Radical
accent is specially appropriated.

The principal point to be observed here is, that the Tem-
poral accent is more melodious than either of the others,
while the Radical accent is least agreeable of the three.
To substitute either of the others for the first is, then, ob-
viously a violation of melody; and the last should be
confined to immutable syllables. It is a great accomplish-
ment in the poet, so to arrange his verses that the accent
shall in all cases be that of quantity; and just so far as he
approaches to this, will his lines, when properly read, flow
softly and strike musically upon the ear. But even this
excellence of an author might be annulled by the defective
mode of giving the accent, on the part of the reader. To
him then who is found inclined to substitute either of the
others for the Temporal accent, set exercises should be as-
signed in the reading of dignified prose and verse.
OF EMPHASIS.
WHILE accent is employed without regard to feeling or ex-
pression, Emphasis on the contrary implies emotion. Em-

EMPHASIS.
101-
phasis like accent is a stress laid on syllables, and usually
on the same syllables which take the accent. When how-
ever the claims of accent come into conflict with those of
emphasis, the former must yield; as "He must increase,
but I must decrease." "This mortal shall put on immor-
tality." Of the two, then, it is obvious that Emphasis
holds the higher rank.
The following are the purposes for which Emphasis is
mainly used. First, to distinguish words which are spe-
cially significant, either in themselves considered, or from
the relation in which they stand. Secondly, to mark the
antithetic relation existing between the words composing a
sentence, or the ideas embraced in it. Thirdly, to make
the sense of an elliptical sentence obvious, as addressed to
the ear; and fourthly to mark the syntax, in cases where
words holding a close grammatical relation are separated
by parentheses and interposed clauses. The occasions for
emphasis then are of constant recurrence ;—either of these
circumstances serving as a sufficient reason for its use.
And emphasis is often required on several words in succes-
sion, constituting a phrase or member of a sentence. How
then can emphasis be defined? In what does it consist?
and what are the means by which it is executed?
Emphasis may be defined-The EXPRESSIVE but occa-
sional distinction of syllables, and consequently of the words
of which they form a part. The degree of distinction
which is essential to constitute emphasis but slightly ex-
ceeds the natural accent; but the higher forms of emphasis
are strongly marked, and by whatever means this distinc-
tion is imparted to the word, its character cannot be mis-
taken.
The dash placed under the word is the visible symbol

of emphasis in writing, as a change of type is in printing;
the italic letter marking the slighter degrees of emphasis,
and the capital the stronger. Good taste directs that these
symbols which are addressed to the eye should rarely be
used and thus it is left to the discrimination of the reader
alone to determine the place of the emphasis, as well as
the kind of emphasis to be employed.
The object of emphasis being to distinguish some words
from others for the purpose of giving them more import-
ance in utterance, it is clear that whatever will serve to
arrest the ear and fix the attention upon a word performs
this office; and this may be done by the use of any of the
following elements, explained in the last chapter;-to wit,
Time, the various kinds of Stress, Pitch both concrete and
discrete, the Waves, Force, and several of the modifica-
tions of Quality, as the term is applied to the voice. We
proceed to give a few examples of these different kinds of
emphasis, in the order in which the elements employed
were introduced to the learner, in the last chapter. And
here the fact must force itself upon the attention, that if
emphasis can be given in so varied a manner, all apology
for monotony in spirited delivery is at once removed. In
no department of observation do we find that nature has
lavished her gifts in greater profusion, than in furnishing
the materials of an effective delivery.
I. TEMPORAL EMPHASIS.
The element of Time or Quantity, though never discon
nected from all other elements which contribute to empha-
sis, is yet the predominant characteristic in the expression
of serious dignity. It can be given only on syllables
which admit of indefinite extension.


## p. 103 (#113) ############################################

EMPHASIS OF STRESS.
103
EXAMPLES.*
1. Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean-roll.
2. Nine times the space that measures day and night
To mortal men, he with his horrid crew
Lay vanquished.
3.
For soon expect to feel
His thun-der on thy head, de-vour-ing fire.
Then who created thee lamenting learn,
When who can un-create thee thou shalt know.
So spake the seraph Abdiel, faithful found
Among the faithless, faithful on-ly he.
II. EMPHASIS OF STRESS.
Among the modes of distinguishing syllables are the
different modes of stress; and these are varied both with
the sentiment, and with the character of the syllable on
which the stress is to be employed
EXAMPLES.
Radical Emphasis.-This form of Emphasis is suited to
the expression of anger and all the violent emotions; and
is the one usually employed in rapid utterance. The Radi-
cal is the only kind of stress which immutable syllables
will bear, but it may be given on syllables of indefinite
time.
2.
1. The prison of his tyr-anny who reigns
By our delay.
Back to thy pun-ishment,
False fugitive.
3. The universal cry is-Let us march against Philip, let us fight
for our lib-erties-let us con-quer or die!
*NOTE TO THE TEACHER.-In the exercises of this section, the
learner should first be permitted to employ his own skill in exe-
cution. Afterwards he may read them with his teacher.


## p. 104 (#114) ############################################

104
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
Median Emphasis.-This form of Emphasis is more dig-
nified than the last, and is consequently well suited to the
expression of lofty and sublime sentiments, and to the lan-
guage of veneration and prayer. It can be given only on
syllables of indefinite quantity.
1. Wonder not, sovereign Mistress, if perhaps
Thou canst, who art sole wonder!
2. Oh swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
That monthly chan-ges in her circling orb.
3. Hail, ho-ly light, offspring of Heaven first-born!
Or of the Eternal co-eternal beam
May I express thee unblamed?
4. Spare thou those, O God, who confess their faults.-Res-tore
thou them that are penitent.
Vanishing Emphasis.-This form of Emphasis usually
expresses impatience, angry complaint, or some other mo-
dification of ill humor. It is especially adapted to hasty
interrogation, and may be given on any but the immutable
syllables. The tent scene between Brutus and Cassius
furnishes numerous examples of this.
-
1. Brutus. Let me tell you, Cassius, you your-self
Are much condemned to have an itching palm;
To sell and mart your offices for gold
To undeservers.
Cassius. I an itching palm?
You know that you are Bru-tus that speak this,
Or, by the Gods, this speech were else your last.
Brutus. The name of Cassius honors this corruption,
And chas-tisement doth therefore hide his head.
2. Brutus. Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
Shall I be frighted when a mad-man stares?
Cassius. O ye gods! ye gods! must I endure all this?

EMPHASIS OF PITCH.

3. Hamlet. Saw who?
Horatio. My lord, the King, your father.
Hamlet. The King, my fa-ther?
Compound Emphasis.-This consists in an application
of the compound stress to a syllable of indefinite time; ana
is the most forcible form of emphatic stress.—It is particu-
larly appropriate to the forcible expression of earnest or
angry interrogation.
1. Arm, warriors, arm for fight.
2. Dost thou come here to whine?
To outface me by leaping in her grave?
III. EMPHASIS OF PITCH.
The melody of unimpassioned discourse consists of a
succession of syllables, whose concrete movement is only
through a single tone, the discrete movement from syllable
to syllable being also through the same interval. This is
called the Diatonic melody. Any deviation from this
movement, like a slide or a skip through a third, fifth, or
octave, on any syllable, would most obviously produce
such a distinction as to answer the purpose of emphasis,
and that whether this movement were upward or down-
ward, whether concrete or discrete. As the rising and
falling movements of the voice have different expressions,
they will be treated separately.
1. EMPHASIS OF THE RISING INTERVALS.
The appropriate expression of the rising intervals is in-
terrogation. This subject has been introduced to the
learner in Sec. V, of Chap. I; and will be further dis-
cussed under the head of Expression. But beside the in-
terrogative expression, the rising movements both of a third

and a fifth may be used for purposes of emphasis merely;
while that of the octave probably always combines em-
phasis with the thorough interrogative intonation.—The
slide through the wider intervals should be struck on a
line below the current melody.
EXAMPLES.
Emphasis of the Rising Concrete Third.-This is the
emphasis of simple interrogation; and is also employed to
express the lower shades of emphatic distinction, as they
occur in the diatonic melody.
1. Gavest thou the goodly wings to the pea-cocks? or wings and
feathers unto the os-trich?
2. I love not man the less, but nature more,
From these our interviews.
3. Yet Bru-tus says he was ambitious.
Emphasis of the Rising Discrete Third.-This has the
same expression with the concrete rise of a third, and is
rarely used but on immutable syllables.
1. Canst thou draw out leviathan with a hook?
2. Which, if not vic-tory, is yet revenge.
3. Why then their loss deplore, that are not lost!
4. Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
Emphasis of the Rising Concrete and Discrete Fifth.—
The examples which illustrate the two preceding forms
may be used for illustration here, by adding to the energy
with which they are pronounced. The intervals of the
fifth are of more rare occurrence than the third. The fol-
lowing additional examples must suffice.
Concrete.
1. Wouldst thou be King?

2. Tears like the rain-drops may fall without measure,
But rapture and beauty they cannot recall.
3. Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow.
4. I am at liberty, like every other man, to use my own language.
5. You are not left alone to climb the arduous ascent-God is
with you; who never suffers the spirit which rests on him
to fail, nor the man who seeks his favor to seek it in vain.
6. What though the field be lost? all is not lost.
NOTE 1.-When the emphatic rise, as in this last example, oc-
curs on the last syllable or word of a declarative sentence, it must
of course annul the cadence. So also, if it occurs near the close.
NOTE 2. This emphatic rise, and the consequent suspension of
the cadence, may occur in the Indirect Question; as, What is that?
Who do you say that is?-These cases however are too rare to un-
settle the general rules of Interrogative Intonation laid down in the
first chapter.
Discrete.
1. Let me have men about me that are fat,
Sleek-headed men, and such as sleep o' nights.
2.
Or when we lay
1.
Chained on the burning lake!
That sure was worse.
Emphasis of the Rising Concrete and Discrete Octave.-
This is the most earnest expression of interrogative intona-
tion; and is never used in grave discourse. Its appropriate
expression is that of sneer or raillery.-The rise is concrete
when it occurs on long syllables; when on short or immu-
table syllables, it is formed by a change of radical pitch.
Concrete.
Moneys is your suit.
?
What should I say to you? Should I not say
Hath a dog money? Is it possible
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?
2. A King's son? You Prince of Wales?
Discrete.
Zounds, show me what thoul't do:
Woul't weep? woul't fight? woul't fast? woul't tear thyself?

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
2. EMPHASIS OF THE DOWNWARD INTervals.
As the rising movements of the voice express doubt and
uncertainty, so the downward intervals are the appropriate
symbol of surprise and positiveness. When the accented
syllable is susceptible of being protracted, the movement
is concrete; and in this case the radical point of the slide
is struck on a line above that of the current melody, the
vanish descending below it, when the force of the emphasis
is considerable.-On immutable syllables, the fall can be
made only by a discrete skip of the voice.
The fall for the purpose of emphasis, may be through a
third, a fifth or an octave, according to the degree of posi-
tiveness or surprise contemplated by the emphasis.
EXAMPLES.
Emphasis of the Downward Concrete Third.-
1. Does beauteous Tamar view, in this clear fount,
Herself, or heaven?
2. You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife.
3. The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in our-selves, that we are underlings.
4. The curfew tolls, the knell of parting day.
Emphasis of the Downward Concrete Fifth.-
1. Seems, madam! nay, it is, I know not seems.
2. Before the sun, before the heavens, thou wert.
Upon the watery plain
3.
The wrecks are all thy deed.
4. The man who is in the daily habit of using ardent spirits, if
he does not become a drunkard, is in danger of losing his
health and character.
NOTE. The sense itself, as well as the force of the expression,
often depends, as in the last example, on the giving of the down-
ward emphatic slide.

Emphasis of the Downward Concrete Octave. - The
learner scarcely need be informed, that this expresses the
highest degree of this species of emphasis, or that it is of
rare occurrence. Dr. Rush thinks that the following pas-
sage cannot be uttered with dramatic effect, but by giving
this form of emphasis on the word "hell."
So frowned the mighty combatants, that Hell
Grew darker at their frown.
The following example will illustrate the discrete rise of
a third on 66
that,'
" and the discrete fall of the same inter-
val on "too."
Cassius. They shouted thrice; what was the last cry for?
Casca. Why, for that too.
The downward discrete fifth or octave, for the purpose
of emphasis, is believed to be very rare. They cannot be
made from the current melody; nor is the voice ever suffi-
ciently high to admit of such a fall, except when it has
been carried up to give emphasis to a preceding word; and
then the fall is generally to be considered only as a simple
return to the current melody. If in any case, such return
is made on an immutable and emphatic syllable, then such
discrete fall may be construed as a form of emphasis, and
would be the only one that could properly be used.
IV. EMPHASIS OF THE WAVE.
In practice, as in theory, it is believed that the number
and variety of the waves is very great. They may be
equal or unequal, single or double, direct or inverted; and
in any of these, the individual constituents may be varied
from a semitone to an octave, though the intermediate in-
tervals of a second, third, or fifth. A full illustration of
this subject will not be attempted.

This form of emphasis can only be used on syllables of
long quantity; and expresses, according to its forms, sur
prise and admiration, sneer and scorn.
1. EMPHASIS OF THE EQUAl Wave.
EXAMPLES.
Equal Wave of the Semitone.-When the semitone is
employed to give distinction to long syllables, it usually
takes the form of the wave. This however gives it no new
expression: it remains the symbol of plaintiveness.
I heard the bell tolled on thy burial day,
And turning from my nursery window drew
A long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu.
Equal Wave of the Second.-This has no peculiar ex-
pression of its own. It is exhibited in all the examples.
when properly read, which illustrate either the Temporal
or the Median Emphasis; to these the learner would do
well again to recur.
Equal Wave of the Third, and of the Fifth.-
1. Yond' Cassius has a lean and hun-gry look.
2.
Hadst thou alleged
To thy deserted host this cause of flight,
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive.
3. Beyond that, I seek not to penetrate the veil. God grant, that
in my day, at least, that curtain may not rise. God grant,
that on my vision, never may be opened what lies behind.

1.
And breath'st defiance here and scorn
Where I reign King? and to enrage thee more
Thy King and lord!
2. So much the rather thou, celestial Light,
Shine inward, and the mind through all her powers
Irradiate.
3. I formed them free-
They them-selves ordained their fall.
In the following example, the first two syllables in italics
may receive the direct equal wave of the second; "I"
should take the wave of the third, and "we" of the
fifth.
Brutus. "Tis very like: he hath the falling sickness.
Cassius. No, Ca-sar hath it not; but you and I,
And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
NOTE.-In general it is believed, the Double wave has the same
expression indicated by the single wave, and only heightens it by
increasing the quantity of the syllable which receives the emphasis.
Nor does the Inverted wave always give a different expression from
the Direct; but sometimes seems to be used for the sake of variety.
When however the last constituent of the wave, whether single or
double, rises through the interval of a fifth or octave, it gives the
expression of interrogation; as when it takes the falling through
these intervals, it gives the expression of strong surprise.
2. EMPHASIS OF THE UNEQUAL WAVE.
The natural expression of inequality in the constituents
of the wave, is scorn and contempt. In dignified dis-
course this sentiment is expressed by combining with the
equal wave the vanishing stress, or the aspiration. With-
out the employment of these elements, the language of sar-
casm and irony loses all its point.
Dr. Rush gives the following as examples of the Unequal
Single Wave.-The word "boy," in the first, is pro-
nounced with the rise of a fifth, and the subsequent fall of
an octave.

False hound!
If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there
That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
Fluttered your Volces in Corioli;
Alone I did it.-Boy!
In the following, "yea" may be read with the rise of a
tone or a third, connected with the fall of a third or fifth.
For, from this day forth,
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
When you are waspish.
The second "wrong" in the following line, may be read
with the rise of a semitone and a fall of a third or fifth.
You wrong me every way, you wrong me, Brutus.
Emphasis of the Unequal Double Wave.-To be properly
uttered, the waves all require quantity; but the double
wave especially requires that the syllable on which it is.
given should be susceptible of indefinite time. It is heard
in peevish expression, in the colloquial cant of common
life, and often heightens the effect of dramatic sentiment.
This element may be exhibited on the word "they," as
repeated in the following example:-
They tell us to be moderate, while they, they revel in profusion.
It may be suggested to the learner, as one of the modes
of exhibiting the sentiment and feeling of the above pas-
sage, to pronounce "us" with a rapid movement of the
voice through the direct double wave of the second; the
first "they," with the direct single wave of the third ; and
to give to this word when repeated the double wave
having its first constituent the rising third, the second the
falling fifth, and the third the rise of a second.-Other
modes of inflection might be suggested.

V. EMPHASIS OF FORCE.
This form of emphasis is specially suited to short sylla-
bles, and differs but little in its sound or its expression
from the radical emphasis when combined with short quan-
tity. This however is characterized by the same fullness
of force throughout its whole extent, without the gradual
vanish of the radical emphasis. The following will suffice
as examples :-
1. Tell your invaders this, and tell them, too, we seek no change;
and least of all such a change as they would bring us.
Therefore as far
From granting he, as I from beg-ging peace.

The Emphasis of the Vocule, is but the Emphasis of
Force applied to a word consisting mainly of atonics, and
terminated by a mute. When such a word is followed by a
pause, this seems one of the most forcible modes of em-
phasis. The employment of this element, however, re-
quires great care, as it is so much more frequently used im-
properly than otherwise. Nothing short of the most vehe-
ment feeling authorizes its use.--
EXAMPLES.

Extort from me.

1. EMPHASIS OF THE TREMOR.
The tremulous movement of the voice described in the
last chapter is sometimes heard throughout short sentences;
but is often confined to single words, in which case it be-
comes one of the elements of emphatic distinction. When
combined with any other element than the semitone, it is
the symbol of joy and exultation; and when combined
with this, it expresses tenderness and grief.
EXAMPLES.
1. Thou art the ruins of the noblest man,
That ever lived in the tide of times.
2. Now give the hautboys breath, he comes, he comes.
3. Forsake me not thus, Adam!
Bereave me not,
Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,
Thy counsel in this uttermost distress,
My only strength and stay. Forlorn of thee,
Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?
2. EMPHASIS OF ASPIRATION.
EXAMPLES.
1. Brutus. What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
Choose Cæsar for their King.
Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think you would not have it so.
2. Brutus. The name of Cassius honors this corruption,
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
Cassius.
Cassius. Chastisement!
3. Brutus. Peace, peace; you durst not so have tempted him.
Cassius. I durst not!

3. GUTTURAL EMPHASIS.
EXAMPLES.
1. I know thee not, nor ever saw till now
Sight more de-test-able than him and thee.
2.
Whence these chains?
Whence the vile death, which I may meet this moment?
Whence this dishonor, but from thee, thou false one?
The learner will find examples for his further practice in
this important branch of elocution, in every piece of spirited
composition he reads. He should first mark the words.
which are emphatic in the selection under examination,
should satisfy himself, as to the most effective kind of em-
phatic distinction to be employed on each; and then should
endeavor to execute the emphasis in the best manner of
which he is capable. If the piece is to be recited, he
should be careful to lay the stress on those words only
which he had before so marked. The following additional
remarks may render the learner further assistance in such
practice.
1. Though the elements of emphasis have been treated
separately, they are often combined on the same word or
syllable; and some of them never occur alone: thus the
Wave is always associated with Quantity, and usually with
the Median Stress; and the Guttural voice is generally as-
sociated with the Aspiration.
2. The emphatic words are often, in themselves consi-
dered, very unimportant. Thus :-
If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
If you did know for whom I gave the ring,
And would conceive for what I gave the ring,
And how unwillingly I left the ring,
When nought would be accepted but the ring,
You would abate the strength of your displeasure.

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
3. Emphasis sometimes extends to several words, or an
entire clause; as, "I came not to baptize, but to preach the
gospel."-"Heaven and earth will witness, if Rome must
fall, that we are innocent.”
4. One of the objects of emphasis is to point out the an-
tithetic relation of words; and to exhibit this most strongly,
the emphasis of the Rising and Falling Slides and of the
Direct and Inverted Wave are often opposed to each other,
on the words thus related. When the emphasis falls on a
single word, in consequence of its importance in the sen-
tence, it is called absolute emphasis; in case of antithesis,
it is called relative emphasis. Several of these relations
frequently occur in the same passage. Thus, "The young
are slaves to novelty, the old to custom."—" The hope of
the righteous shall be gladness; but the expectation of the
wicked shall perish."
5. The emphasis of the Upward and Downward Slides,
as also of the Waves, is often heightened by extending the
movement to the unaccented syllables of the word on
which it occurs. Examples:-
What is it that a Roman would not suffer
That a Venetian prince must bear?
For no narrow frith he had to cross.
Though he will not rise and give him, because he is his friend,
yet because of his importunity he would rise and give him as
much as he needeth.
6. In the employment of emphasis, two cautions may
be given to the learner; viz.,-First, that he should never
allow himself to use the Wave-particularly the Unequal
Wave-where only the simple Slides are called for; and
Second, that he should avoid all excessive formality, in
marking the emphatic words. This seems to imply, on the

117
part of the speaker, a distrust of the ability of his audience
to perceive the force of his language unless accompanied
with peculiar efforts to exhibit it.
Having explained at length the means by which em-
phatic distinction is imparted to words, and the general
principles on which the emphasis depends, it may be ex-
pedient to give the learner the advantage of some more
specific rules in relation to
RELATIVE EMPHASIS.
To mark the relative distinction of words, the emphasis
of the Rising and Falling intervals is generally used. No
new element of emphasis then remains to be here intro-
duced. Under this head it is proposed simply to develope
a subordinate principle in emphasis, which makes the kind
of emphatic distinction employed, sometimes to depend on
the structure of the sentence, or at least to be coincident
with it. This should be considered only as a secondary
principle, having reference, like the Diatonic Slides, rather
to the sound than to the sense; and liable, therefore, at
any time, to be interrupted by the recurrence of the abso-
lute emphasis. Having only euphony for its basis, as
might be expected, there is not a perfect uniformity in the
directions of elocutionists respecting it, or in the usage of
good speakers. The following, it is believed, are all the
rules that the learner can profit by, or that can be laid down
without the danger of giving to speech an affected stiffness.
which ought not to belong to it.
RULE I. When the successive members of a sentence
consist of two clauses which correspond to each other, the
first clause in each takes the Rising, and the latter the Fall
ing Slide.


## p. 118 (#128) ############################################

118
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
EXAMPLES.
1. Here regard to virtue opposes insensibility to shame; purity to
pollution; integrity to injustice; virtue to villany; resolution to rage;
regularity to riot. The struggle lies between wealth and want; the
dignity and degeneracy of reason; the force and the phrenzy of the
soul; between well-grounded hope and widely extended despair.
2. By honor and dishonor; by evil report, and good report; as de-
ceivers, and yet true; as unknown, and yet well known; as dying,
and behold we live; as chastened, and not killed; as sorrowful, yet
always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having no-
thing, and yet possessing all things.
3. We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; perplexed
but not in despair; persecuted but not forsaken; cast down, but not
destroyed.
4. In the suitableness or unsuitableness, the proportion or dispro-
portion of the affection to the object which excites it, consists the
propriety or impropriety of the action.
NOTE. By observing these examples, it will be perceived, that
this rule holds good without regard to the nature of the relation be-
tween the clauses.—By the last, it appears, that when words which
are derived from the same root stand in opposition to each other, on
one of them at least the emphasis falls on the distinguishing sylla-
ble, without regard to the place of the ordinary accent.
RULE II. When any sentence has corresponding mem-
bers, expressing any other single relation than the antithesis
of negation and affirmation, the first member generally
takes the Rising and the latter the Falling Slide.
-
EXAMPLES.
1. Homer was the greater genius; Virgil, the better artist: in
the one, we more admire the man; in the other, the work. Homer
hurries us with a commanding impetuosity; Virgil leads us with an
attractive majesty. Homer scatters with a generous profusion; Vir-
gil bestows with a careful magnificence. Homer, like the Nile
pours out his riches with a sudden overflow; Virgil, like a river in
its banks, with a constant stream.

2. I am found, said virtue, in the vale, and illuminate the moun-
tains. I cheer the cottager at his toil, and inspire the sage at his
meditation: I mingle in the crowd of cities, and bless the hermit in
his cell.
3. Dryden knew more of man in his general nature, and Pope in
his local manners. The notions of Dryden were formed by compre-
hensive speculation, those of Pope by minute attention. There is
more dignity in the knowledge of Dryden, and more certainty in
that of Pope.
4. Never before were so many opposing interests, passions, and
principles, committed to such a decision. On one side an attach-
ment to the ancient order of things, on the other a passionate desire
of change; a wish in some to perpetuate, in others to destroy every
thing; every abuse sacred in the eyes of the former, every founda-
tion attempted to be demolished by the latter; a jealousy of power
shrinking from the slightest innovation, pretensions to freedom
pushed to madness and anarchy; superstition in all its dotage, im-
piety in all its fury-whatever, in short, could be found most dis-
cordant in the principles, or violent in the passions of men, were
the fearful ingredients which the hands of Divine justice selected
to mingle in this furnace of wrath.
5. Therefore, the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not.
6. Custom is the plague of wise men, and the idol of fools.
7. Cæsar was celebrated for his great generosity, Cato for his un-
sullied integrity.
NOTE. When the members are long, and especially if they ex-
press a complete sense, as in the last example,-both members are
often terminated with the falling inflection; nor do I consider that
objectionable. In that case, however, the antithesis may be pre-
sented on the leading words of the members; as, in this example, on
6 Cæsar' and 'Cato.' The following examples may also illustrate
the same point:-"The power of delicacy is chiefly seen in dis-
cerning the true merit of a work; the power of correctness, in re-
jecting false pretensions to merit."—"The Spartan [Lycurgus]
aimed to form a community of high-minded warriors; the Athenian
[Solon] sought rather a community of cultivated scholars."
RULE III.-When a sentence consists of two corres-
ponding members, the one negative, the other affirmative,


## p. 120 (#130) ############################################

120
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
the negative member takes the Rising Slide;-Except
when overruled by the absolute Emphatic Stress,
When the negative member comes first, it is obvious.
that this rule is entirely coincident with Rule II, as in the
following examples:-"I did not say a better soldier, but
an elder."—" These things I say now, not to insult one
who is fallen, but to render more secure those who
stand.' "He came not with the aspect of vengeance, but
of mercy."
The following examples, in which the negative member
occurs last, will show that the principle is of universal ap-
plication.
""
1. The duty of a soldier is to obey, not to direct his general.
2. It was an enemy, not a friend, who did this.
3. I came to bury Cæsar, not to praise him.
4. You were paid to fight against Alexander, not to rail at him.
Examples of exception to Rule III, founded on the abso-
lute emphasis:-
1. If we have no regard for our CHARACTER, we ought to have
some regard for our interest.
2. If you will not make the experiment for your own satisfac-
tion, you ought to make it for the satisfaction of your friends.
3. The man who is in the daily use of ardent spirit, if he does
not become a DRUNKARD, is in danger of losing his health and
character.
4. If we have no regard for religion in YOUTH, we ought to have
some respect for it in age.

NOTE 1.-When the negative is implied though not expressed,
the negative member still takes the Rising Slide: thus,-"A coun-
tenance more in sorrow than in anger." Here the inflections are as
though it were read,-"A countenance in sorrow, not in anger."
The following examples will further illustrate this principle :—“ He
is more knave than fool.”—“Napoleon merits praise, rather than
dispraise."-" Cæsar deserves blame, instead of fame."
NOTE 2. When only the negative part of such sentence is ex-
1
I

pressed, if the antithetic part is plainly obvious, it may take the
Rising Slide. Examples:-
:-
True politeness is not a mere compliance with arbitrary custom;
[it is the expression of a refined benevolence.]
God is not the author of sin, [but of moral excellence.]
To these rules may be added two others for the Falling
Slide; and they are given here, because, like the foregoing,
they seem to depend sufficiently on the structure of the
sentence, to receive some illustration from that principle
RULE IV. A succession of emphatic particulars takes
the Emphasis of the Falling Slide.
EXAMPLES.
1. Absalom's beauty, Jonathan's love, David's valor, Solomon's
wisdom, the patience of Job, the prudence of Augustus, the eloquence
of Cicero, the innocence of wisdom, and the intelligence of ALL,-
though faintly amiable in the creature, are found in immense per-
fection in the Creator.
2. The soul can exert herself in many different ways of action.
She can understand, will, imagine,—see and hear,-love and dis-
course, and apply herself to many other like exercises of different
kinds and natures.
3. His hopes, his happiness, his very life, hung upon the next
word from those lips.
4. Valor, humanity, courtesy, justice, and honor, were the charac-
teristics of chivalry,
NOTE. On each successive word of the emphatic series, the
slide should be made through a wider interval, and with increased
force.*
*Several eminent writers on elocution, have laid down the rule,
that the last member of a commencing series, or, more generally,
the penultimate clause of a sentence, should take the Rising Inflec-
tion. Thus, 'honor,' in the last example, according to this rule,
should receive the Rising Slide, instead of presenting to the ear
the climax which exists in the sense; and some very insufficient
reasons are assigned why it should be so. I would suggest, how-
ever, that a slight pause, after the last emphatic word, prepares the
11.

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
RULE V.--Emphatic repetition requires the Falling Slide.
EXAMPLES.
1. And the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven; and
said, Abraham, ABRAHAM. And he said, Here am I.
2. O Jerusalem, JERUSALEM, thou that killest the prophets, and
stonest them which are sent unto you, how often would I have
gathered thy children together, even as a hen gathereth her chick-
ens under her wings, and ye would not!
SECTION IV.
OF THE DRIFTS OF THE VOICE.
PREPARATORY to the next two sections, we here intro-
duce what Dr. Rush has well designated the "Drifts of the
Voice." In the first chapter of this Manual are enume-
rated and described all the elements which are supposed to
be essential to a perfect elocution. The learner must feel
an interest in knowing whether they are limited in their
application and use to the emphasis, as described in the last
way for a more melodious cadence than can be produced in the
way proposed; and this is believed to be the manner of many of
our best speakers.-Who ever hears, in the spirited utterance of
any of our most accomplished speakers, such specimens as occur in
the notation of Porter's Analysis? Witness the following, for ex-
ample.
"What, Tubero, did that naked sword of yours mean, in the
battle of Pharsalia? At whose breast was its point aimed? What
was the meaning of your arms, your spirit, your eyes, your hands,
your ardor of soul?"
"Thou shalt love the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with
all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind, and
thy neighbor as thyself."
The mere presentation of these examples furnishes a sufficient
refutation of the principle, as susceptible of general application
The exceptions which should be made to it in practice are sufficient
to render it entirely nugatory.

DRIFTS OF THE VOICE.
123
section; or whether they can be applied to entire periods,
paragraphs, or discourses; and thus give a character to
their expression. The answer to this interrogatory is, that
some of them are confined to single words, while others
may be extended to phrases, and still others to paragraphs,
or entire discourses. It is this repetition of the same ele-
ment, producing a style which runs through and character-
izes the utterance of entire passages of discourse, that is
called a drift of speech.
We shall here do little more than enumerate the elements
which belong to these three classes, leaving it to the
application which is to be made in following sections to
explain the import of these several drifts, and the circum-
stances which should determine their employment; as also
to furnish the practice necessary to their execution.
The Temporal Drift.—This designation of itself will
suggest to the learner no particular rate of utterance. In
fact, this is a general term; embracing the Drift of Quantity
or Slow Time, and the Drift of Quick Time, together with
the Natural Drift of unimpassioned speech. The Time of
the voice in any of its modifications may be applied to
portions of discourse of any extent.
The Drifts of Radical Stress, of Median Stress, and of
Vanishing Stress, can be extended throughout a discourse,
in as much as the sentiments which they severally represent
are restricted neither to words nor phrases.
The Drift of Pitch.—The different degrees of pitch, as
well as the different kinds of Stress, may be employed on
passages of some length, without any considerable variation.
The Drift of the Semitone, and the Diatonic Drift, only
indicate the prevalence of the elements necessary to con-
stitute their respective melodies.


## p. 124 (#134) ############################################

124
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
The Drift of the Downward Slides.-The downward
movements of the voice, though not limited to any parti-
cular interval, are sufficient to give a peculiar character to
the expression. The interval of the downward octave
however is never employed but for emphasis.
The Drifts of the Wave of the Semitone, and of the Wave
of the Second, are distinguished by the prevalence of their
respective elements, and are always connected with
Quantity.
The Drift of Force.-Like the temporal drift and the
drift of pitch, this may be characterized by difference in de-
gree. Loudness and Softness constitute styles of utterance,
as well marked as almost any other elements of speech.
The Drift of Quality.—Of the kinds of voice enume-
rated, perhaps none are adapted to produce drifts but the
Natural voice and the Orotund.
Those elements of speech which are suited only to
phrases, or very short portions of discourse, but which are
employed for purposes more extended than mere emphasis,
give rise to what Dr. Rush has called Partial Drifts of
Speech. They are as follows:-
The Partial Drift of the Rising Slides.-This is em-
ployed in Interrogation.
The Partial Drift of Quality, as heard in the Tremor,
the Aspiration, the Guttural, and the Falsette.
The Partial Drift of the Phrases of Melody. Of these
none perhaps are appropriated to purposes of expression,
but the Monotone, and the Alternate Phrase.
-
The following are never heard as Drifts of Speech, nor
used but for the mere purpose of emphasis on single words,
except as a fault of delivery:-The Vocule, the Compound

DRIFTS OF THE VOICE.
125
Stress, the Downward Octave, and the Waves of the Third,
Fifth, and Eighth. The use of these elements, then, has
been sufficiently set forth in the last section. It remains to
show how the Drifts of Speech may be further employed
for the purpose of Expression.
As a further suggestion preparatory to the application of
the principles here developed, it may be remarked, that
these drifts, or styles of speech, are often found united in
the same melody, though they have been treated thus sepa-
rately, and as distinct elements. There are few of them
that are incongruous the one with the other, and no one of
them but admits of a combination with some other. As
examples of such combination, it will be found that DIG-
NITY requires the union of the Drifts of Quantity, of the
Median Stress, of the Wave of the Second, and of the
Orotund, together with the Partial Drift of the Monotone;
and that ANGER combines the Drifts of Quick Time,
the Radical Stress, the Downward Slides, and of Force,
with the Partial Drifts of the Guttural voice and the
Aspiration.
The ease with which the learner will make these com-
binations will depend on his familiarity with these elements
in their uncombined state. In the examples, however,
which will be given for practice in the next section, it
will not be best to attempt the employment of all the sym-
bols at the first reading. For illustration, in a passage
containing angry sentiment, let the learner first read it with
Force and in Quick time, then repeat it in connection with
the Radical Stress and the Downward Slides. And when
this can be done with ease, as he becomes imbued with
the sentiment of the passage, let him add the Guttural
harshness and the Aspiration on such words and clauses

as will best bear their application. Indeed the effective
employment of the higher elements of speech, whether
single or in combination, will depend essentially on the
susceptibility of the reader or speaker to feel the sentiments
he utters. This exercise will do much to prevent any
misapplication of the functions of the voice, and thus to
protect him who might otherwise be guilty of such misap-
plication from the charge of affectation.
SECTION V.
OF EXPRESSION.
INTONATION has much to do with the expression of senti-
ment and passion. Some of the sensibilities, it is true,
can be expressed only by words; while others, on the con-
trary, can receive a full expression only by the tones of the
voice. These are often sufficient, even without any aid from
articulate words. Thus the tones expressive of want and
distress in the domestic animals are instinctively understood,
and have a wonderful power over the human heart. The
sigh and the groan produce in the hearer an emotion of pain,
which the substitution of words however full of grief or an-
guish tends to relieve. These tones, so expressive in them-
selves, cannot fail to be impressive when united with words.
The "Expression of the Passions" has been a favorite
subject with all writers on Elocution. Little has been done
however in the real development of the subject,-formerly
for the want of terms to express the various functions
of the voice. This defect having been supplied by Dr.
Rush, we see no reason why the learner may not now suc-
cessfully be taught the application of the principles set forth


## p. 127 (#137) ############################################

EXPRESSION.
127
in the first chapter, to the expression of sentiment and feel-
ing. We do not here propose a full exposition of this sub-
ject, because we do not deem it necessary. He who
acquires the full command of the elements already de-
scribed, who is free from bad habits, and possesses the
power of feeling deeply what he utters, will, we admit,
need little instruction in the application of these elements
to his purpose. So, on the contrary, he who is destitute
of the susceptibility of emotion, in view of the sentiments
which he reads, or of the thoughts which fill his mind in
extemporaneous utterance, will make but a poor piece of
work in the attempt to counterfeit this emotion, even after
studying all that can be said as to the modes of express-
ing it.
Frequently, however, the susceptibility of feeling is not
wanting; but yet has been suppressed, either by habits of
dull and monotonous delivery, or by a natural diffidence
which has refused a full expression of the language of
emotion. In such cases, it is believed the exercises of
this section will prove sufficient to put the learner upon the
right course of practice, while it is as confidently believed,
that nothing short of this would meet his wants. The
ready use of the natural language of emotion secures two
objects; first, to bring into active operation the suscepti-
bility of emotion which may exist in the speaker; and
second, to enable him to awaken in others what he him-
self feels. The first of these objects-the reaction of elo-
quent expression upon the mind of the speaker-is ofter
overlooked.
Before entering formally upon this part of our work, the
learner should be reminded, that while the voice alone
does much in the expression of feeling, much is also left

for language to do. The same element of vocal expression
is often used for sentiments widely different from each
other; he, then, who expects to find a vocal element pecu-
liarly adapted to every different sentiment, expects too
much. It will not be our object here fully to develop this
subject; nor in the development we shall give to it, shall
we have any reference to a scientific classification of the
passions. Our view will be strictly practical. Most of
the points will be illustrated by examples, which it is be-
lieved will prove sufficient for all the preliminary practice
of the learner. When these can be perfectly executed,
then further examples may be sought for and everywhere
found.
NARRATIVE, DESCRIPTION.
Common discourse or colloquial dialogue, which has for
its object the expression of thought without any admixture
of feeling, calls into use-The Natural Voice, and the Dia-
tonic Melody; and admits the Wave of the Second on
syllables susceptible of long quantity. These are the sim-
plest elements used in speech, and their combination
scarcely deserves a place under the head of Expression.
Even emphasis or interrogation breaks in on this simple
melody of speech.
DIGNITY, SOLEMNITY, GRAVITY, &c.
Dignified, solemn, and grave subjects are most naturally
and fully expressed by the Orotund voice, the Partial Drift
of the Monotone, Slow Time, and Long Quantity com-
bined with the Single Equal Wave of the Second, both
Direct and Inverted, and with the Median Stress.
The same symbols are also employed to express Re-
spect, Reverence, Veneration, and Adoration, as also Solemn

Rebuke, serious Admonition and Reproach; and they aid
in giving utterance to all other sentiments which embrace
the idea of Deliberation.
EXAMPLES.
1. High on a throne of royal state, which far
Outshone the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,
Or where the gorgeous east with richest hand
Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,
Satan exalted sat, by merit raised
To that bad eminence: and, from despair
Thus high uplifted beyond hope, aspires
Beyond thus high, insatiate to pursue
Vain war with Heaven; and, by success untaught,
His proud imaginations thus displayed.
2. Hail, holy Light! offspring of Heaven first-born!
Or of the Eternal co-eternal beam
May I express thee unblamed? since God is light,
And never but in unapproached light
Dwelt from eternity, dwelt then in thee,
Bright effluence of bright essence increate.
Or hear'st thou rather, pure ethereal Stream,
Whose fountain who shall tell? Before the sun,
Before the heavens thou wert; and, at the voice
Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest
The rising world of waters dark and deep,
Won from the void and formless infinite.
3. And the heaven departed as a scroll, when it is rolled together:
and every mountain and island were moved out of their places
And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich men,
and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every bondman,
* In the execution of the examples of this section, the teacher
must use a discretionary power, as to how far he will throw the
student upon his own resources. Before, however, leaving the ex-
ercises, under each head, he should present to his pupil the true
intonation, and thus lead him to the most perfect execution by the
aid of his example, as well as his instructions.

and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in the rocks of
the mountains; and said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us,
and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and
from the wrath of the Lamb:-For the great day of his wrath is
come; and who shall be able to stand?
4. Thou glorious mirror, where the Almighty's form
Glasses itself in tempests; in all time
Calm or convulsed-in breeze, or gale, or storm,
Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime
Dark-heaving;-boundless, endless, and sublime-
The image of eternity-the throne
Of the Invisible; even from out thy slime
The monsters of the deep are made; each zone
Obeys thee; thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone.
5. Fathers, we once again are met in council:
Cæsar's approach has summoned us together,
And Rome attends her fate from our resolves.
How shall we treat this bold aspiring man?
Success still follows him, and backs his crimes:
Pharsalia gave him Rome. Egypt has since
Received his yoke, and the whole Nile is Cæsar's.
Why should I mention Juba's overthrow,
Or Scipio's death? Numidia's burning sands
Still smoke with blood. "Tis time we should decree
What course to take; our foe advances on us,
And envies us even Lybia's sultry deserts.
Fathers, pronounce your thoughts; are they still fixed
To hold it out and fight it to the last?
Or are your hearts subdued at length, and wrought,
By time and ill success, to a submission?
Sempronius, speak.

from the superinhuman oppression under which she has so long and
too patiently travailed; and I confidently hope, that, wild and chi-
merical as it may appear, there are still union and strength in Ire-
land sufficient to accomplish this noblest enterprise.

All that breathe
Will share thy destiny. The gay will laugh
When thou art gone, the solemn brood of care
Plod on, and each one as before will chase
His favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave
Their mirth and their employments, and shall come
And make their bed with thee. As the long train
Of ages glide away, the sons of men,
The youth in life's green spring, and he who goes
In the full strength of years, matron and maid,
And the sweet babe, and the gray-headed man,—
Shall one by one be gathered to thy side,
By those who in their turn shall follow them.
So live, that when thy summons comes to join
The innumerable caravan, that moves
To that mysterious realm, where each shall take
His chamber in the silent halls of death,
Thou go not, like the quarry-slave at night,
Scourged to his jeon; but, sustained and soothed
By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,
Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch
About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.
8. Go, Sun, while Mercy holds me up
On Nature's awful waste
To drink this last and bitter cup
Of grief that man shall taste-
Go, tell that night that hides thy face,
Thou saw'st the last of Adam's race,
On earth's sepulchral clod,
The dark'ning universe defy
To quench his immortality,
Or shake his trust in God!

9. Two hundred years!-two hundred years!-
How much of human power and pride,
What glorious hopes, what gloomy fears,
Have sunk beneath their noiseless tide!—
God of our fathers,-in whose sight
The thousand years, that sweep away
Man, and the traces of his might,
Are but the break and close of day,-
Grant us that love of truth sublime,
That love of goodness and of thee,
That makes thy children, in all time,
To share thine own eternity.
10. Thy path is high in heaven;—we cannot gaze
On the intense of light that girds thy car;
There is a crown of glory in thy rays,
Which bears thy pure divinity afar,
To mingle with the equal light of star;
For thou, so vast to us, art, in the whole,
One of the sparks of night that fire the air;
And, as round thy centre planets roll,
So thou, too, hast thy path around the central soul.
11. O Thou that rollest above, round as the shield of my fathers!
whence are thy beams, O Sun! thy everlasting light? Thou
comest forth in thy awful beauty; the stars hide themselves in the
sky; the moon, cold and pale, sinks in the western wave. But
thou thyself movest above! Who can be a companion of thy
course? The oaks of the mountains fall: the mountains them-
selves decay with years: the ocean shrinks and grows again: the
moon herself is lost in the heavens: but thou art for ever the same,
rejoicing in the brightness of thy course. When the world is dark
with tempests, when thunder rolls, and lightning flies, thou
lookest in thy beauty from the clouds, and laughest at the storm.—
But to Ossian thou lookest in vain; for he beholds thy beams no
more, whether thy yellow hair floats on the eastern clouds, or thou
tremblest at the gates of the west. But thou art, perhaps, like me,
for a season; thy years will have an end. Thou shalt sleep in thy

clouds, careless of the voice of the morning. Exult then, O Sun!
in the strength of thy youth.-Age is dark and unlovely: it is like
the glimmering light of the moon, when it shines through broken
clouds, and the mist is on the hills; when the blast of the north is
on the plain, and the traveler shrinks in the midst of his journey.
12. Night, sable goddess! from her ebon throne,
In rayless majesty, now stretches forth
Her leaden sceptre o'er a slumbering world.
Silence how dead! and darkness how profound!
Nor eye nor listening ear can object find:
Creation sleeps. "Tis as the general pulse
Of life stood still, and Nature made a pause,
An awful pause, prophetic of her end.
13.
This is the place, the centre of the grove:
Here stands the oak, the monarch of the wood.
How sweet and solemn is this midnight scene!
The silver moon, unclouded, holds her way
Through skies where I could count each little star;
The fanning west-wind scarcely stirs the leaves;
The river rushing o'er its pebbled bed,
Imposes silence with a shrilly sound.-
In such a place as this, at such an hour,
(If ancestry can be in aught believed,)
Descending spirits have conversed with man,
And told the secrets of the world unknown.
GAYETY, &c.
Gayety is the exact opposite of dignity, and consequently
demands another class of elements for its expression.
Sprightliness of sentiment therefore, calls into requisition
the Natural Voice, Quick Time, and Short Quantity, the
Radical or Vanishing Stress, and the frequent recurrence
of the Alternate Phrase of Melody. Facetiousness, Eager
Argument, and Earnest Description employ these symbols

1.
Those two together long had lived
In mansion prudently contrived,
Where neither tree nor house could bar
The free detection of a star;
And nigh an ancient obelisk
Was raised by him, found out by Fisk,
On which was written, not in words,
But hieroglyphic mute of birds,
Many rare pithy saws concerning
The worth of astrologic learning.
From top of this there hung a rope,
To which he fastened telescope,
The spectacles with which the stars
He reads in smallest characters.
It happened as a boy, one night,
Did fly his tarsel of a kite,
The strangest long-winged hawk that flies,
That, like a bird of Paradise,
Or herald's martlet, has no legs,
Nor hatches young ones, nor lays eggs;
His train was six yards long, milk-white,
At the end of which there hung a light,
Inclosed in lantern, made of paper,
That far off like a star did appear:
This Sydrophel by chance espied,
And with amazement staring wide,
Bless us! quoth he, what dreadful wonder
Is that appears in Heaven yonder?
A comet, and without a beard!
Or star that ne'er before appeared?
I'm certain 'tis not in the scrowl
Of all those beasts, and fish, and fowl
With which like Indian plantations,
The learned stock the constellations;
Nor those that drawn for signs have been
To the houses where the planets inn.

It must be supernatural,
Unless it be that cannon-ball
That, shot i' th' air point-blank upright,
Was borne to that prodigious height;
That, learned philosophers maintain,
It ne'er came backwards down again,
But in the airy region's yet
Hangs, like the body of Mahomet:
For if it be above the shade
That by the earth's round bulk is made,
'Tis probable it may from far
Appear no bullet, but a star.
2. My poem's epic, and is meant to be
Divided in twelve books; each book containing,
With love, and war, a heavy gale at sea,
A list of ships and captains, and kings reigning,
New characters; the episodes are three:
A panorama view of hell's in training,
After the style of Virgil and of Homer,
So that my name of epic's no misnomer.
All these things will be specified in time,
With strict regard to Aristotle's rules;
The vade mecum of the true sublime,
Which makes so many poets, and some fools;
Prose poets like blank-verse, I'm fond of rhyme,
Good workmen never quarrel with their tools;
I've got new mythological machinery,
And very handsome supernatural scenery.
3. 'Twas the night before Christmas, when all thro' the house
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse:
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,
In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,
While visions of sugar-plums danced through their heads;
And mamma in her 'kerchief and I in my cap,
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap-

When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,
I sprang from the bed to see what was the matter:
Away to the window I flew like a flash,
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.
The moon, on the breast of the new fallen snow,
Gave the lustre of mid-day to objects below.
When, what to my wondering eyes should appear
But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,
With a little old driver, so lively and quick,
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick.
More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,
And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:
"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer! now, Vixen!
On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blixen-
To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!
Now, dash away, dash away, dash away all!"
4. Law is law-law is law; and as in such and so forth and
hereby, and aforesaid, provided always, nevertheless, notwithstand-
ing. Law is like a country dance, people are led up and down in
it till they are tired. Law is like a book of surgery, there are a
great many desperate cases in it. It is also like physic, they that
take least of it are best off. Law is like a homely gentlewoman,
very well to follow. Law is also like a scolding wife, very bad
when it follows us. Law is like a new fashion, people are be-
witched to get into it: it is also like bad weather, most people are
glad when they get out of it.
5. Come, dance, elfins, dance! for my harp is in tune,
The wave-rocking gales are all lulled to repose;
And the breath of this exquisite evening of June,
Is scented with laurel and myrtle and rose.
Each lily that bends to the breast of my stream,
And sleeps on the waters transparently bright,
Will in ecstasy wake, like a bride from her dream,
When my tones stir the dark plumes of silence and night.
My silken-winged bark shall career by the shore,
As calmly as yonder white cloud on the air;

And wine for the tremulous debauchee!
It cooleth the brow, it cooleth the brain,
It maketh the faint one strong again;
It comes o'er the sense like a breeze from the sea,
All freshness, like infant purity.
Oh! water, bright water for me, for me!
Give wine, give wine to the debauchee!
Fill to the brim! fill, fill to the brim,
Let the flowing crystal kiss the rim !
For my hand is steady, my eye is true,
For I, like the flowers, drink nought but dew.
Oh! water, bright water's a mine of wealth,
And the ores it yieldeth are vigor and health.
So water, pure water for me, for me!
And wine for the tremulous debauchee!
Fill again to the brim! again to the brim!
For water strengtheneth life and limb!
To the days of the aged it addeth length,
To the might of the strong it addeth strength,
It freshens the heart, it brightens the sight,
"Tis like quaffing a goblet of morning light!
So, water, I will drink nought but thee,
Thou parent of health and energy!
When over the hills like a gladsome bride
Morning walks forth in her beauty's pride,
And, leading a band of laughing hours,
Brushes the dew from the nodding flowers;
Oh! cheerily then my voice is heard
Mingling with that of the soaring bird,
Who flingeth abroad his matins loud,
As he freshens his wing in the cold gray cloud.
But when evening has quitted her sheltering yew,
Drowsily flying and weaving anew

Thou art silver and gold, thou art riband and star!
Hurrah! for bright water! hürrah, hurrah!
POSITIVENESS, CONFIDENCE, AUTHORITY, &c.
All expressions of full and settled Conviction or Confi-
dence on the part of the speaker, have their appropriate
symbols; and the same elements which express Certainty
are very naturally employed to express Authoritative Com-
mand. They will be found to be the same; and the ele-
ments for denoting these sentiments are the Downward
Slides, and the Radical Stress; and, in energetic expres-
sion, these are generally combined with Force. These
characteristics of speech belong also to Denying, Reprov-
ing, Refusing and Forbidding, to Reprehension and De-
nunciation, and to Defiance and Adjuration, as well as
to strong Affirmation; and even to warm Argument, when
employed in defence of one's own rights. Also in their
moderate degrees, these elements are suited to Instruc-
tion and Precept.—It is not perhaps surprising, that the
confidence even of Despair and Resignation should express
itself by the Downward movements of the voice.
Vaunting Authority, and a degree of positiveness which
implies Self-Admiration, require a Harsh Voice, and the
Vanishing Stress; and admit the Equal Direct Wave, com-
bined with the Median Stress on syllables which are em-
phatic and admit of long quantity.

Or useful serving-man and instrument
To any sovereign state throughout the world.
Your breath first kindled the dead coal of war
Between this chastised kingdom and myself,
And brought in matter that should feed this fire;
And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
You taught me how to know the face of right,
Acquainted me with interest to this land;
Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;
And come ye now to tell me, John hath made
His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?
I, by the honor of my marriage-bed,
After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;
And, now it is half conquered, must I back,
Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,
What men provided, what munition sent,
Is't not I
To underprop this action?
That undergo this charge? Who else but I,
And such as to my claim are liable,
Sweat in this business, and maintain this war?
Have I not heard these islanders shout out,
Vive le roy! as I have banked their towns;
Have I not here the best cards for the game,
To win this easy match played for a crown?
And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?
No, on my soul, it never shall be said.
However heaven or fortune cast my lot,
There lives or dies true to King Richard's throne,
A loyal, just, and upright gentleman:
Never did captive with a freer heart
Cast off his chains of bondage, and embrace
His golden, uncontrolled enfranchisement,
More than my dancing soul to celebrate
This feast of battle with mine adversary.—

And both return back to their chairs again :-
Withdraw from us, and let the trumpet sound
While we return these dukes what we decree.-
Draw near,
And list what with our council we have done.
For that our kingdom's earth should not be soiled
With that dear blood which it hath fostered;
And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
Of civil wounds, ploughed up with neighbors' swords;
Therefore we banish you our territories:
You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of death,
Till twice five summers have enriched our fields,
Shall not regreet our fair dominions,
But tread the stranger paths of banishment.

Or daring hardy as to touch the lists;

And turn pre-ordinance, and first decree,
Into the law of children. Be not fond,
To think that Cæsar bears such rebel blood,
That will be thawed from the true quality
With that which melteth fools; I mean sweet words,
Low-crooked curt'sies, and base spaniel fawning.

Be great in act as you have been in thought;
Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
Govern the motion of a kingly eye:

Threaten the threatener, and outface the brow
Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,
That borrow their behaviors from the great,
Grow great by your example, and put on
The dauntless spirit of resolution;
Show boldness and aspiring confidence.
What, shall they seek the lion in his den,
And fright him there, and make him tremble there ?-
Oh, let it not be said!-Forage, and run,
To meet displeasure farther from the doors,
And grapple with him ere he come so nigh.

That you unlace your reputation thus,
And spend your rich opinion for the name
Of a night brawler? Give me answer to it.

But as I come, I come for Lancaster:
And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace,
Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
You are my father, for, methinks, in you
I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father!
Will you permit that I should stand condemned
A wandering vagabond; my rights and loyalties
Plucked from my arms perforce, and given away
To upstart spendthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
If that my cousin king be king of England,
It must be granted, I am duke of Lancaster.

And yet my letters-patent give me leave:
My father's goods are all distrained and sold,

And challenge law: attorneys are denied me;
And therefore personally I lay my claim
To my inheritance of free descent.

To waste eternal days in wo and pain?
And reckon'st thou thyself with spirits of heaven,
Hell-doom'd, and breath'st defiance here and scorn
Where I reign king? and, to enrage thee more,

Strange horrors seize thee, and pangs unfelt before.”

Though castles topple on their warders' heads;

Even till destruction sicken, answer me

Thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward,
Thou little valiant, great in villainy !
Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
Thou fortune's champion, that dost never fight
But when her humorous ladyship is by
To teach thee safety!
NOTE. It is by the use of these symbols of expression, that man
maintains his authority over the domestic animals; and these are
among the first which children learn to interpret. So universally
are these employed to express their appropriate sentiments, that
they are sometimes heard on a clause occurring in a member whose
current melody presents the Rising Slide; thus,-"If a brother or
sister be naked, and destitute of daily food, and one of you say
unto him, Depart in peace, be ye warmed and filled-notwithstanding
ye give them not those things which are needful to the body: what
doth it profit?"
12. The following directions of Hamlet to the players,
exhibit a good specimen of the Didactic style of delivery.
"Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounce it to you, trip-
pingly on the tongue. But if you mouth it as many of our players
do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. And do not saw
the air too much with your hand, thus; but use all gently; for
in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say, whirlwind of your
passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it
smoothness.
"Be not too tame neither; but let your own discretion be your
tutor. Suit the action to the word, the word to the action; with
this special observance, that you o'erstep not the modesty of nature :
for any thing so overdone is from the purpose of playing; whose
end, both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as 'twere the
mirror up to nature; to show Virtue her own feature, Scorn her
own image, and the very age and body of the Time his form and
pressure. Now this overdone, or come tardy off, though it make
the unskilful laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the

censure of one of which, must in your allowance overweigh a whole
theatre of others.
"And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set
down for them; for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh too; though in
the meantime, some necessary part of the play be then to be consi-
dered. That's villainous, and shows a most pitiful ambition in the
fool that uses it."
ENERGY.
Energy in the expression of any of the passions, and
earnestness of utterance, are uniformly characterized by
Force or Loudness, combined with the Downward Slides,
and the Radical or Compound Stress. Great vehemence of
feeling authorizes the full exhibition of the Vibrant R, and
of the Aspiration, as well as the use of the Emphatic Vo-
cule at the close of those emphatic words which end with
a mute. Energetic expression sometimes passes into the
Falsette, but then it loses all its dignity.
As energy is a quality of utterance which never exists
but in connection with some passion or excitement as its
cause, it will more properly find its general illustrations
under other heads. A single example, however, will be
presented of the application of each of the last mentioned
symbols of expression.
1. In the following example, the r is put in italics,
wherever it should be made vibrant as a symbol of
energy.
Pent in this fortress of the North,
Think'st thou we will not sally forth,
To spoil the spoiler as we may,
And from the robber rend the prey?

The Saxon rears one shock of grain;

Shall with strong hand, redeem his share.
Where live the mountain chiefs who hold
That plundering lowland field and fold
Is aught but retribution true?

2. The Aspiration should be distinctly heard on the
word fear, in the following earnest interrogation.
Brutus. What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
Choose Cæsar for their king.
Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think you would not have it so.
Cassius.
3. The Vocule may be slightly heard in the following
example, on the words in italics. When heard too dis-
tinctly, or in improper places, it is a decided fault of de-
livery.
"Sir, I in the most express terms deny the competency of parlia-
ment to do this act. I warn you do not dare to lay your hand on
the constitution. I tell you, that if circumstanced as you are, you
pass this act, it will be a nullity, and that no man in Ireland will
be bound to obey it.
"I make the assertion deliberately. I repeat it, and call on any
man who hears me, to take down my words; you have not been
elected for this purpose, you are appointed to make laws, not legis-
latures; you are appointed to exercise the functions of legislators,
and not to transfer them; and if you do so, your act is a dissolu-
tion of the government; you resolve society into its original ele-
ments, and no man is bound to obey you.-Are you competent to
transfer your legislative rights to the French council of five hun-
dred? Are you competent to transfer them to the British parlia
ment? I answer,-No. When you transfer you abdicate, and the
great original trust reverts to the people from whom it issued.
Yourselves you may extinguish, but parliament you cannot ex-
tinguish,"

RAGE, ANGER, Wrath.
The expression of these malevolent feelings, combines
with the elements of Energy, Quick Time and Short Quan-
tity. Great violence in the expression of these emotions is
also characterized by frequent and great Discrete Changes
of Pitch and by wide Downward Intervals on the emphatic
words, which may at the same time be marked by the
Guttural Voice and by strong Aspiration. This is also the
expression of Severe Rebuke.

EXAMPLES.
Tut! tut!
Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle,
I am no traitor's uncle; and that word-grace
In an ungracious mouth is but profane;
Why have those banished and forbidden legs
Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
But more than why-Why have they dared to march
So many miles upon her peaceful bosom ;
Frighting her pale-faced villages with war,
And ostentation of despised arms?
Com'st thou because the anointed king is hence?
Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself
Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
From forth the ranks of many thousand French;
Oh, then, how quickly should this arm of mine,
Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee,
And minister correction to thy fault!
2. Cassius. That you have wronged me doth appear in this;
You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella,
For taking bribes here of the Sardians ;
Wherein, my letters, praying on his side,
Because I knew the man, were slighted of.

Cassius. In such a time as this, it is not meet
That every nice offence should bear his comment.
Brutus. Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
Are much condemned to have an itching palm;
To sell and mart your offices for gold,
To undeservers.
Cassius.
I an itching palm ?
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
Brutus. The name of Cassius honors this corruption,
And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
Cassius. Chastisement!
Brutus. Remember March, the ides of March remember!
Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
What villain touched his body that did stab
And not for justice? What, shall one of us,
That struck the foremost man of all this world,
But for supporting robbers; shall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes?
And sell the mighty space of our large honors
For so much trash as may be grasped thus ?—
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
Than such a Roman.
Cassius.
Brutus, bay not me,
I'll not endure it; you forget yourself,
To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,
Older in practice, abler than yourself
To make conditions.
Go to; you're not, Cassius.

Cassius. Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.

Cassius. O ye gods! ye gods! Must I endure all this?
Brutus. All this? ay, more; Fret till your proud heart break;
Go, show your slaves how choleric you are,
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humor? By the gods,
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
Though it do split you: for, from this day forth,
I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
When you are waspish.
Cassius.
Is it come to this?
Brutus. You say you are a better soldier:
Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
And it shall please me well: For mine own part
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
3. Let me look back upon thee, O thou wall,
That girdlest in those wolves!
Plagnes, incident to men,
Your potent and infectious fevers heap
On Athens, ripe for stroke! thou cold sciatica,
Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt
As lamely as their manners! lust and liberty
Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth;
That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,
And drown themselves in riot! itches, blains,
Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop
Be general leprosy! breath infect breath;
That their society, as their friendship, may
Be merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,
But nakedness, thou detestable town!
―
Take thou that too, with multiplying banns!
Timon will to the woods, where he shall find
The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.
The gods confound (hear me, ye good gods all,)
The Athenians both within and out that wall!
And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow
To the whole race of mankind, high and low.

MALICE, HATE, Revenge, &c.
These modifications of the malevolent feelings, with the
kindred sentiments, Indignation, Aversion, Abhorrence,
Envy, Jealousy, Disgust, and the language of Shaming
Rebuke, have less of Energy in their expression than the
preceding, and more of Deliberation. Combined with
Force, the Aspiration, and a harsh Guttural voice then, we
here employ a Longer Quantity, which admits both the
Wave and the Vanishing Stress; and with the Wave even
the Median Stress may be combined. These elements
properly combined furnish a form of expression of great
power and significancy.
EXAMPLES.
1. How like a fawning publican he looks:
I hate him, for he is a Christian,
But more for that in low simplicity
He lends out money gratis, and brings down
The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
If I can catch him once upon the hip,
I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
He hates our sacred nation; and he rails
Even there, where merchants most do congregate,
On me, my bargains, and my well-won thrift,
Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,
If I forgive him.
2.
Poison be their drink,
Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest meat they taste;
Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees,
Their sweetest prospects murdering basilisks,
Their softest touch as smart as lizard's stings,
Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,
And boding screech-owls make the concert full;
All the foul terrors of dark-seated hell.

3. I know not; if they speak but truth of her
These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honor
The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,
Nor age so eat up my invention,
Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
Nor my bad life 'reft me so much of friends,
But they shall find awaked in such a kind,
Both strength of limb and policy of mind,
Ability in means, and choice of friends,
To quit me of them thoroughly.
4.
Aside the devil turned
For envy, yet, with jealous leer malign,
Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plained.
"Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two
Imparadised in one another's arms,
The happier Eden, shall enjoy their fill
Of bliss on bliss; while I to hell am thrust,
Where neither joy, nor love, but fierce desire,
Among our other torments not the least,
Still unfulfilled, with pain of longing pines."
5. This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
And knows all qualities with a learned spirit
Of human dealings; if I do prove her haggard,
Though that her jesses were my dear heart-strings,
I'd whistle her off and let her down the wind
To prey at fortune. Haply, for I am black,
And have not those soft parts of conversation
That chamberers have; or, for I am declined
Into the vale of years;-yet that's not much ;-
She's gone, I am abused, and my relief
Must be to loathe her. Oh the curse of marriage,
That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
And not their appetites!

Thou little valiant, great in villainy!

Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
Thou fortune's champion, thou dost never fight,
But when her humorous ladyship is by
To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,
And sooth'st up greatness. What a fool art thou,
A ramping fool; to brag, and stamp, and swear,
Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,
Been sworn my soldier? Bidding me depend
Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength?
And dost thou now fall over to my foes?
Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame
And hang a calf's skin on those recreant limbs.
7. I remember a mass of things, but not distinctly; a quarrel,
nothing wherefore. O that men should put an enemy in their
mouths to steal away their brains! that we should with joy, plea-
sure, revel, applause, transform ourselves into beasts! I will ask
him for my place again; he shall tell me I am a drunkard: Had I
as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all.
To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a beast!
O strange! every inordinate cup is unblessed, and the ingredient
is a devil.
8.
What though the field be lost?
All is not lost; the unconquerable will,
And study of revenge, immortal hate,
And courage never to submit or yield,
And what is else not to be overcome;
That glory never shall his wrath or might
Extort from me. To bow and sue for grace
With suppliant knee, and deify his power,
Who from the terror of this arm so late
Doubted his empire; that were low indeed!
That were an ignominy and shame beneath
This downfall! since by fate the strength of gods
And this empyreal substance cannot fail,
Since, through experience of this great event,

In arms not worse, in foresight much advanced,
We may with more successful hope, resolve
To wage, by force or guile, eternal war;
Irreconcilable to our great foe,
Who now triumphs, and in the excess of joy,
Sole reigning, holds the tyranny of heaven.
It breaks my chain !

Banished from Rome! what's banished, but set free
From daily contact of the things I loathe?
"Tried and convicted traitor!" Who says this?
Who'll prove it, at his peril, on my head?
Banished? I thank you for't.
I held some slack allegiance till
But now my sword's my own. Smile on, my lords;
I scorn to count what feelings, withered hopes,
Strong provocations, bitter, burning wrongs,
I have within my heart's hot cells shut up,
To leave you in your lazy dignities.
But here I stand and scoff you :-here I fling
Hatred and full defiance in your face.
Your Consul's merciful. For this all thanks.
He dares not touch a hair of Catiline.
“Traitor!” I go—but I return. This—trial !
Here I devote your senate! I've had wrongs,
To stir a fever in the blood of age,
Or make the infant's sinews strong as steel.
This day's the birth of sorrows!—This hour's work
Will breed proscriptions.-Look to your hearths, my lords,
For there henceforth shall sit, for household gods,
Shapes hot from Tartarus !-all shames and crimes;—
Wan treachery, with his thirsty dagger drawn;
Suspicion poisoning his brother's cup;
Naked rebellion with the torch and axe,
Making his wild sport of your blazing thrones;
Till anarchy comes down on you like night,
And massacre seals Rome's eternal grave.

ILL HUMOR.
Under this head we may enumerate Dissatisfaction,
Peevishness, Discontent, Impatience, Petulance, Repining,
Vexation and Chagrin. The elements essential to the ex-
pression of these sentiments are the Guttural harshness of
voice and the Wave of the Semitone. The Radical or
Vanishing Stress prevails according as the utterance is
hurried or more slow; and on emphatic syllables of long
quantity the use of the Double and Unequal Wave height-
ens the effect of the expression. Impatience sometimes
raises the voice to Loudness, and the Falsette even may be
heard in the whine of peevishness. As these sentiments
never occur in grave delivery, we shall illustrate them by
but a single example.
Troilus, What, art thou angry, Pandarus? What, with me?
Pandarus. Because she is kin to me; therefore she's not so fair
as Helen; an she were not kin to me, she would be as fair on Fri-
day, as Helen is on Sunday. But what care I? I care not an she
were a blackamoor, 'tis all one to me.
Troi. Say I, she is not fair?
Pan. I do not care whether you do or no.
She's a fool to stay
behind her father: let her to the Greeks-and so I'll tell her the
next time I see her-for my part, I'll meddle nor make no more in
the matter.
Troi.
Pan. Not I.
Troi. Sweet Pandarus,
Pandarus,
Pan. Pray you speak no more to me;-I will leave all as I
found it, and there's an end.
SCORN, SNEER, CONTEMPT, &c.
Dignified Scorn, and the Sneer require for their expres-
sion Long Quantity, a good degree of Force, and, on the
emphatic words, the Vanishing Stress or Aspiration, com-

bined with the Concrete Rise or Fall through a Third or
Fifth, or with the Single Waves, either Direct or Inverted.
In the stronger expression of these sentiments, as also in
Derision, Scoffing, Mockery, and Execration, the Vanishing
Stress, the Aspiration, the Guttural Emphasis and the Tre-
mor may
all be combined on the Downward Concrete or
the Waves, which may be extended through an Octavę.
And the effect will be greatly heightened, if, instead of the
Equal and Single Waves, the Unequal Double Waves be
employed. When however the Aspiration or the Guttural
force is given on the Waves, it must be understood to be
confined to its last constituent.
EXAMPLES.
1. Satan beheld their plight,
And to his mates thus in derision called:
“O friends, why come not on those victors proud?
Ere while they fierce were coming; and when we,
To entertain them fair with open front
And breast, (what could we more?) propounded terms
Of composition, straight they changed their minds,
Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,
As they would dance: yet for a dance they seemed
Somewhat extravagant and wild, perhaps
For joy of offered peace; but I suppose,
If our proposals once again were heard,
We should compel them to a quick result."
2. Gaoler, look to him ;-Tell not me of mercy ;—
This is the fool that lent out money gratis ;-
Gaoler, look to him.
MIRTH, RAILLERY.
Mirth and Raillery require Quick Time and Short Quan-
tity, Loudness, and the Concrete Rise of the Second, com-
bined with the Radical Stress.

EXPRESSION.
155
If these sentiments become excessive, they may raise the
voice to the Falsette, either by a Concrete rise of the Oc-
tave, or by the Direct Wave of the same interval.-The
combination of the Tremor also heightens the effect.
EXAMPLE.
A fool, a fool!—I met a fool i' the forest,
A motley fool, a miserable varlet;
As I do live by food, I met a fool,
Who laid him down, and basked him in the sun,
And railed on lady Fortune in good terms,
In good set terms, and yet a motley fool.
Good morrow, fool, quoth I; no, sir, quoth he,
Call me not fool, till heaven hath sent me fortune:
And then he drew a dial from his poke,
And looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
Says, very wisely, it is ten o'clock;
Thus may we see, quoth he, how the world wags;
'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
And after one hour more 'twill be eleven,
And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe,
And then from hour to hour we rot and rot,
And thereby hangs a tale. When I did hear
The motley fool thus moral on the time,
My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
That fools should be so deep-contemplative;
And I did laugh, sans intermission
An hour by his dial.-O noble fool!
A worthy fool! motley's the only wear.
JOY, TRIUMPH, &c.
Joy and Delight are more dignified in their expression,
employing a longer Quantity, the Median Stress, and the
Alternate Phrase of Melody.-Rapture, Triumph or Exul-
tation adds to these elements the Tremor.

EXAMPLE.
O my soul's joy!
If after every tempest come such calms,
May the winds blow till they have wakened death!
And let the laboring bark climb hills of seas
Olympus high, and duck again as low
As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,
"Twere now to be most happy, for I fear
My soul hath her content so absolute,
That not another comfort like to this
Succeeds in unknown fate.
ASTONISHMENT, ADMIRATION, AMAZEMENT.
The dignified expression of these sentiments requires
Long Quantity, a good degree of Force, and the Emphasis
of the Downward Concrete, or of the Equal Direct Wave
of the Third or Fifth combined with the Median Stress.
Mirthful Wonder, or Surprise, may require the Down-
ward Octave, or the Equal Single Direct Wave of that
interval; and as the utterance becomes more rapid, the
Radical or Vanishing Stress is used.
Aspiration may be connected with the simple Downward
Slides; though with the Waves it would express scorn,
sneer, or contempt.
EXAMPLE.
Sir Richard, what think you? Have you beheld,
Or have you read, or heard? or could you think?
That you do see?
Form such another?
The height, the crest,
Or do you almost think, although you see,
Could thought, without this object,
This is the very top,
or crest unto the crest
Of Murder's arms: This is the bloodiest shame,
The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,
That ever wall-eyed Wrath, or starving Rage,
Presented to the tears of soft Remorse.

PLAINTIVE EXPRESSION, Tenderness.
The elements employed to express pathetic sentiments
or tender emotion are few, but strongly marked. They are
Softness of voice, Long Quantity, Slow Time and the
Semitone, or the Direct and Inverted Waves of that inter-
val, combined with the Median Stress.
The sentiments which require the Chromatic Intonation
are various and widely different from each other. The
difference however is marked by the language rather than
the intonation. Among other sentiments which may be
thus expressed are, Awe, Complaint, Contrition, Penitence,
Petition, Submission, Supplication, Fondness, Love, Pity,
Compassion, Commiseration, Condolence, Mercy, Grief,
Lamentation, and Sorrow.
The simple rise and fall of the Semitone, or the Wave
of that interval, is the most effective of the elements enu-
merated above, for the expression of the tender and pathetic
sentiments. The choice between the Simple Concrete and
the Wave is determined by the degree of Dignity, in the
sentiment expressed; and this may be still further enhanced
by combining with the other elements the Partial Drift of
the Monotone.
Many of the expressions which go under a common
name, as Complaint and Supplication, vary essentially at
different times in the degree of plaintiveness which they
express. When this emotion is wanting, the Simple Con-
crete and the Wave of the Second are substituted for those
of the Semitone; and on the contrary, when this emotion
becomes painfully strong, the Tremor and Aspiration are
added to the Semitone, on the emphatic words of Long
Quantity. Further to heighten the effect, the clauses may
14

terminate with the Rising Slide, or the Inverted Wave of
the Semitone; and the Broken Melody may be employed.
In the case of plaintive Exclamation, or whenever Sur-
prise or Positiveness are to be connected with the Chroma-
tic Melody, the Unequal Direct Wave is employed, the
first constituent being a Semitone.
EXAMPLES.
1. We have erred and strayed from thy ways, like lost sheep.
We have done those things which we ought not to have done, and
have left undone those things we ought to have done, and there is
no health in us. But thou, O Lord, have mercy upon us misera-
ble offenders. Spare thou those, O! God, who confess their faults.
Restore thou those who are penitent, according to thy promises de-
clared unto mankind in Christ Jesus our Lord. And grant, O!
most merciful Father, for his sake, that we may hereafter live a
godly, righteous, and sober life, to the glory of thy holy name.
2. Ah, Richard! with the eyes of heavy mind,
I see thy glory like a shooting star,
Fall to the base earth, from the firmament!
Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,
Witnessing storms to come, wo, and unrest;
Thy friends are fled, to wait upon thy foes,
And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.
3. Seems, madam! nay, it is; I know not seems.
'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
Nor customary suits of solemn black,
Nor windy suspirations of forced breath;
No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
Together with all forms, modes, shows of grief,
That can denote me truly: These indeed seem,
For they are actions that a man might play;
But I have that within, which passeth show;
These but the trappings, and the suits of wo.

4. Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me;
Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,
Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;
Then have I reason to be fond of grief.
5. My mother! when I learned that thou wast dead,
Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed?
Hovered thy spirit o'er thy sorrowing son,
Wretch even then, life's journey just begun?
I heard the bell tolled on thy burial day,
I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away,
And, turning from my nursery window, drew
A long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu.
6. The laurel shoots when those have passed away,
Once rivals for its crown, the brave, the free;
The rose is flourishing o'er beauty's clay,
The myrtle blows when love has ceased to be,
Green waves the bay when song and bard have fled,
And all that round us blooms, is blooming o'er the dead.
7. Death found strange beauty on that polished brow,
And dashed it out. There was a tint of rose
On cheek and lip;-he touched the veins with ice
And the rose faded. Forth from those blue eyes
There spake a wishful tenderness—a doubt
Whether to grieve or sleep, which innocence
Alone may wear. With ruthless haste he bound
The silken fringes of those curtaining lids
For ever. There has been a murmuring sound,
With which the babe would claim its mother's ear,
Charming her even to tears. The spoiler set
The seal of silence. But there beamed a smile
So fixed and holy from that cherub brow-
Death gazed, and left it there ;—he dared not steal
The signet-ring of heaven.

8. Sleep on-sleep on-above thy corse
The winds their Sabbath keep,-
The wave is round thee-and thy breast
Heaves with the heaving deep;
O'er thee, mild eve her beauty flings,
And there the white gull lifts her wings;
And the blue halcyon loves to lave
Her plumage in the holy wave.
Sleep on-thy corse is far away,
But love bewails thee yet-
For thee the heart-wrung sigh is breathed,
And lovely eyes are wet :—
And she, the young and beauteous bride,
Her thoughts are hovering by thy side:
As oft she turns to view with tears
The Eden of departed years.
9. The thoughts are strange that crowd into my brain,
While I gaze upward to thee.-It would seem
As though God poured thee from his hollow hand,
And spake in that loud voice which seemed to him
Who dwelt in Patmos, for his Saviour's sake,
The sound of many waters, and had bid
Thy flood to chronicle the ages back,
And notch his centuries in the eternal rock.
10. In this example the words in italics, to be read with
dramatic effect, should receive the Tremor.
Forsake me not thus, Adam! Witness, Heaven,
What love sincere, and reverence in my heart
I bear thee, and unwitting have offended,
Unhappily deceived! Thy suppliant,
I beg and clasp thy knees; bereave me not,
Whereon I live, thy gentle looks, thy aid,
Thy counsel in this uttermost distress,
My only strength and stay. Forlorn of thee,
Whither shall I betake me, where subsist?

While yet we live, scarce one short hour perhaps,
Between us two let there be peace, both joining,
As joined in injuries, one enmity
Against a foe by doom express assigned us
On me exercise not
That cruel Serpent.
Thy hatred for this misery befallen;
On me already lost, me than thyself
More miserable? Both have sinned; but thou
Against God only, I, against God and thee,
And to the place of judgment will return,
There with my cries importune Heaven, that all
The sentence, from thy head removed, may light
On me, sole cause to thee of all this wo;
Me, me only, just object of his ire!
11. The dignity and deep pathos of the following stanzas
cannot be fully expressed, but by the frequent union of the
Monotone and the Tremor with the simpler elements of
the Chromatic Melody.
The king stood still
Till the last echo died; then, throwing off
The sackcloth from his brow, and laying back
The pall from the stiff features of his child,
He bowed his head upon him, and broke forth
In the resistless eloquence of wo:—
"Alas! my noble boy! that thou shouldst die!
Thou, who wert made so beautifully fair!
That death should settle in thy glorious eye,
And leave his stillness in this clustering hair!
How could he mark thee for the silent tomb,
My proud boy, Absalom!
Cold is thy brow, my son! and I am chill,
As to my bosom I have tried to press thee.
How was I wont to feel my pulses thrill
Like a rich harp-string, yearning to caress thee,
And hear thy sweet-'my father,' from these dumb
And cold lips, Absalom!

The grave hath won thee. I shall hear the gush
Of music, and the voices of the young;
And life will pass me in the mantling blush,
And the dark tresses to the soft winds flung
But thou no more, with thy sweet voice shall come
To meet me, Absalom!
But, oh! when I am stricken, and my heart,
Like a bruised reed, is waiting to be broken,
How will its love for thee, as I depart,
Yearn for thine ear to drink its last deep token!
It were so sweet, amid death's gathering gloom,
To see thee, Absalom!
And now, farewell! 'Tis hard to give thee up,
With death so like a gentle slumber on thee :-
And thy dark sin!-Oh! I could drink the cup,
If from this wo its bitterness had won thee.
May God have called thee, like a wanderer, home,
My erring Absalom!”
He covered up his face, and bowed himself
A moment on his child: then, giving him
A look of melting tenderness, he clasped
His hands convulsively, as if in prayer;
And, as a strength were given him of God,
He rose up calmly, and composed the pall
Firmly and decently, and left him there,
As if his rest had been a breathing sleep.
PAIN.
Mental Suffering and Bodily Pain, when not excessive,
employ the vocal symbols of deep plaintiveness, even the
Semitone, the Tremor, the Aspiration, and the Broken
Melody.
Excessive bodily pain however, often substitutes for
feebleness of voice great Force-sometimes even on the
Falsette.

EXAMPLE.
Search there; nay, probe me; search my wounded reins-
Pull, draw it out-
Oh, I am shot! A forked burning arrow
Sticks across my shoulders: the sad venom flies
Like lightning through my flesh, my blood, my marrow.
Ha! what a change of torments I endure!
A bolt of ice runs hissing through my bowels:
"Tis, sure, the arm of death, give me a chair;
Cover me, for I freeze, and my teeth chatter,
And my knees knock together.
SECRECY, APPREHENSION, FEAR, &c.
Secrecy is expressed by that perfect Aspiration which we
call the Whisper.
Apprehension and Mystery combine the Aspiration with
a suppressed voice. Curiosity, Suspicion, Eagerness, and
Hope employ the same elements.
Suppressed Fear speaks in an under tone, and combines
with this kind of vocality both the Tremor and the Aspi-
ration.
EXAMPLES.
1. Angels and ministers of grace defend us—
Be thou a spirit of health, or goblin damned,
Bring with thee airs from heaven, or blasts from hell,
Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
Thou comest in such a questionable shape
That I will speak to thee.
Save me and hover o'er me with your wings,
You heavenly guards!—What would your gracious figure?
2. Hah! dost thou not see, by the moon's trembling light,
Directing his steps, where advances a knight,
His eye big with vengeance and fate?

His air was terrific, he uttered no sound;
He spoke not, he moved not, he looked not around,
But earnestly gazed on the bride.
4. Now, fair Hypolita, our nuptial hour
Draws on apace, four happy days brings in
Another moon; but oh! methinks, how slow
This old moon wanes! She lingers my desires,
Like to a step-dame, or a dowager
Long-withering out a young man's revenue.
5. Alas! I am afraid they have awaked,
And 'tis not done; the attempt, and not the deed,
Confounds us▬▬▬▬▬▬ -Hark!-I laid the daggers ready,
He could not miss them. Had he not resembled
My father as he slept, I had done it.
TERROR, HORror.
When danger becomes imminent, fear bursts through all
restraints, and the state of mind ensues which is called
Terror; and this is expressed by great Force of voice com-
bined with the Downward Inflection and a strongly marked
Aspiration. The voice of Terror sometimes breaks on the
ear in the scream of the Falsette.
Horror combines Force of voice and the Aspiration with
the Guttural Harshness, which as an element of speech is
never properly used but to give expression to the highest
emotions of the mind.
INTERROGATION.
In Section V, of Chap. I, we deduced the principle that
the Rising Slide is the prime element in Interrogation; and
though this is the universal symbol of doubt and uncer-
tainty, yet that the Thorough Interrogative Intonation is
given only in the case of the Direct Question.
We are now to show how this Thorough form of Into-

nation is modified by the conditions under which it is
employed.
The Unimpassioned Interrogation should employ the Con-
crete Third and the Radical Stress.
The more earnest question carries the voice through the
Fifth, and may employ the Vanishing Stress; as in the
following example :-
What! shall one of us,
That struck the foremost man of all this world
But for supporting robbers; shall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes ?
And sell the mighty space of our large honors,
For so much trash, as may be grasped thus ?—
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
Than such a Roman.
Dignity or Solemnity of expression will never allow the
use of a wider interval than the Fifth; and where the
question is characterized by these, Long Quantity and the
Median Stress should prevail, and the Inverted Wave may
take the place of the simple concrete.-Example:
Are these the pompous tidings ye proclaim,
Lights of the world, and demi-gods of Fame?
Is this your triumph-this your proud applause,
Children of Truth, and champions of her cause?
For this hath science searched, on weary wing,
By shore and sea-each mute and living thing?
Launched with Iberia's pilot from the steep,
To worlds unknown, and isles beyond the deep?
Or round the cope her living chariot driven,
And wheeled in triumph through the signs of Heaven?
Oh! star-eyed science, hast thou wandered there,
To waft us home the message of despair?
Vaunting or Mirthful Interrogation carries the voice
through an Octave; and the Vanishing Stress increases the
intensity of the inquiry, as in the following:-

Moneys is your suit.
Should I not say?
What should I say to you?
Hath a dog money? Is it possible
A cur can lend three thousand ducats?
Derision and Exultation are heightened by the combina-
tion of the Tremor with these symbols.
The inquiry of Apprehension or Suspicion is characterized
by the Aspiration. Examples:-
1. Horatio. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
Hamlet.
Saw! who?
Horatio.
Hamlet.
My lord, the king, your father.
The king, my father?
Pray you, once more-
2.
Is not your father grown incapable
Of reasonable affairs? Is he not stupid
With age and altering rheums? Can he speak, hear,
Know man from man, dispute his own estate?
Lies he not bed-rid, and again does nothing
But what he did being childish?
Angry or Authoritative Inquiry employs Loudness of
voice, and the Radical or Compound Emphasis, according
to the degree of emotion and the quantity of the emphatic
syllable. Example:-
"Zounds, show me what thou'lt do?
Woul't weep? woul't fight? woul't fast? woul't tear thyself?
Woul't drink up Esil? eat a crocodile ?
I'll do't.-Dost thou come here to whine?
To outface me by leaping in her grave?
Be buried quick with her, and so will I.
Contempt and Surprise, add to the Compound Stress the
Aspiration; and Scorn, if strongly expressed, combines
with these the Guttural quality of voice.
Example of Surprise :-
Gone to be married, gone to swear a peace!
False blood to false blood joined! Gone to be friends'

Shall Lewis have Blanch? and Blanch those provinces ?
It is not so: Thou hast mis-spoke, mis-heard;
Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again.
Plaintive Interrogation is the exact opposite of plaintive
Exclamation, and calls for the use of the Inverted instead
of the Direct Wave;-the first constituent being a Semi-
tone and the last a Rising Third, Fifth, or Eighth.
IRRESOLUTION, MODESTY, &c.
There is a class of emotions, not very closely allied to
each other in their nature, yet which are expressed by
nearly the same natural symbols. They have to be dis-
tinguished by the artificial language to which the voice
gives utterance.
Irresolution, Doubt, Caution, Apathy, Humility, Modesty,
Shame, Tranquillity, Fatigue, Drowsiness, and Weakness,
though usually expressed in the Diatonic Melody, yet are
characterized by Feebleness of voice, Slow Time, and oc-
casionally by the Wave of the Second. Weakness indeed
often employs the Broken Melody, and sometimes the Wave
of the Semitone.
EXAMPLES.
1. Adam. Dear master, I can go no farther: Oh, I die for food!
Here lie I down and measure out my grave. Farewell, kind master.
Duke. Welcome: set down your venerable burden,
And let him feed.
Orla. I thank you most for him.
Adam. So had you need;
I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
2. And wherefore should this good news make me sick?
I should rejoice now at this happy news,
And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy:-
O me! come near me, now I am much ill.
I pray you take up and bear me hence

SECTION VI.
OF TRANSITION.
By Transition is meant those changes of style which
may occur in the same discourse, and which depend en-
tirely on the changes of sentiment which take place. And
here is called into effective use every various element of
melody. There is no capability of the human voice which
may not be brought into requisition, for the expression of
the varying sentiments of a single discourse. Here also
may be brought near together the most opposite varieties
of intonation. Few are aware how much depends on an
agreeable variety in the melodies as well as in the into-
nation of the voice. And it may with great propriety be
remarked in passing, that the varying sentiment of what is
uttered furnishes a basis of modulation, which, from the
very nature of the case, excludes monotony and every
species of mechanical variety. Indeed variety in intona-
tion, depending on any other principle than this, becomes
not less disagreeable than the most inflexible monotony;
and in fact, usually degenerates into a species of monotony,
arising from the repetition of the same succession of
sounds; thus constituting a sort of regular tune. The
more violent transitions are confined to the stage. In

poetry they are often called for, and should be more
strongly marked in declamation than in reading. Even in
ordinary prose composition, changes of sentiment occur,
but are less violent and abrupt.
After what has been said of the various elements of ex-
pression, and of the mode of their combination, the learner
cannot be at a loss to apply the principles already laid
down, to the purposes of Transition. The following will
serve as good examples for exercise; and, except the first,
they are left without rhetorical notation, that the learner
may test his ability to detect changes of sentiment as they
occur, as well as to apply the various symbols of emotion
to their expression.
EXAMPLES.
1. ALEXANDER'S FEAST.

By Philip's warlike son;

Amid the tuneful choir,
With flying fingers touch'd the lyre:
The trembling notes ascend the sky,
And heavenly joys inspire.
The song began from Jove,
Who left his blissful seat above-
Dignity.
Such is the power of mighty love!—
A dragon's fiery form belied the god :
Sublime on radiant spheres he rode,
When he to fair Olympia pressed,
And stamped an image of himself, a sovereign of the world.
The listening crowd admire the lofty sound:
Admiration.
"A present deity!" they shout around ;—
"A present deity!" the vaulted roofs rebound.

With ravished ears
The monarch hears,

Assumes the god,
Affects to nod,
And seems to shake the spheres.

Of Bacchus ever fair and ever young!
The jolly god in triumph comes!

Flushed with a purple grace,
He shows his honest face.

Fallen fallen! fallen! fallen!-
Fallen from his high estate,
And weltering in his blood!
Deserted at his utmost need
By those his former bounty fed,
On the bare earth exposed he lies,
With not a friend to close his eyes!
With downcast look the joyless victor sate,
Revolving, in his altered soul,
The various turns of fate below;
And now and then a sigh he stole,
And tears began to flow!
Narrative.

That love was in the next degree:
"Twas but a kindred sound to move;
For pity melts the mind to love.

How they point to the Persian abodes,
And glittering temples of their hostile gods.

Thus, long ago,
Ere heaving bellows learned to blow,

At last, divine Cecilia came,
Inventress of the vocal frame.
The sweet enthusiast, from her sacred store,
Enlarged the former narrow bounds,
And added length to solemn sounds,
With nature's mother-wit, and arts unknown before.

Or both divide the crown:

And Belgium's capital had gathered then
Her beauty, and her chivalry, and bright
The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men:

Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,
And all went merry as a marriage-bell;
But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell !

Or the car rattling o'er the stony street:

To chase the glowing hours with flying feet—
But hark!-that heavy sound breaks in once more,
As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!
Arm! arm! it is—it is the cannon's opening roar!
3. Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,
And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,
And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago
Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness:
And there were sudden partings, such as press
The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
Which ne'er might be repeated;—who could guess
If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,
Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise?

The matin-trumpet sang: in arms they stood
Of golden panoply, refulgent host,
5 Soon banded; others from the dawning hills
Looked round, and scouts each coast light-armed scour,
Each quarter, to descry the distant foe,
Where lodged or whither fled, or if for fight
In motion or in halt: him soon they met
10 Under spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow
But firm battalion; back with speediest sail
Zophiel, of Cherubim the swiftest wing,
Came flying, and in mid-air aloud thus cried.
“Arm, warriors, arm for fight; the foe at hand,
15 Whom fled we thought, will save us long pursuit
This day; fear not his flight: so thick a cloud
He comes, and settled in his face I see
Sad resolution and secure; let each
His adamantine coat gird well, and each
20 Fit well his helm, gripe fast his orbed shield,
Borne even or high; for this day will pour down,
If I conjecture ought, no drizzling shower,
But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire."
So warned he them, aware themselves, and soon
25 In order, quit of all impediment;
Instant without disturb they took alarm,
And onward move embattled: when behold
Not distant far with heavy pace the foe
Approaching, gross and huge, in hollow cube
30 Training his devilish enginery, impaled
On every side with shadowing squadrons deep,
To hide the fraud. At interview both stood
A while; but suddenly at head appeared
Satan, and thus was heard commanding loud.
Vanguard, to right and left the front unfold;
That all may see who hate us, how we seek
Peace and composure, and with open breast
Stand ready to receive them, if they like

Freely our part; ye who appointed stand,

Had ended, when to right and left the front
Divided, and to either flank retired.

And David sat between the two gates; and the watchman

watchman cried, and told the king. And the king said, If he

and drew near. And the watchman saw another man running:
and the watchman called unto the porter, and said, Behold an-
other man running alone. And the king said, He also bringeth
tidings. And the watchman said, Methinketh the running
10 of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of

1. At midnight, in his guarded tent,
The Turk was dreaming of the hour,
When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,
Should tremble at his power;
In dreams, through camp and court, he bore
The trophies of a conqueror;
In dreams his song of triumph heard ;
Then wore his monarch's signet-ring,—
Then pressed that monarch's throne,—a king;
As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing,
As Eden's garden bird.

That bright dream was his last;
He woke to hear his sentry's shriek,
"To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!"
He woke to die midst flame and smoke,
And shout, and groan, and sabre-stroke,
And death-shots falling thick and fast
As lightnings from the mountain cloud;
And heard, with voice as trumpet loud,
Bozzaris cheer his band;
"Strike-till the last armed foe expires,
Strike-for your altars and your fires,
Strike-for the green graves of
your sires,
God-and your native land!"

They piled that ground with Moslem slain,
They conquered-but Bozzaris fell,
Bleeding at every vein.

Her giant form
O'er wrathful surge, through blackening storm,
Majestically calm, would go
Mid the deep darkness white as snow!
But gentler now the small waves glide,
5 Like playful lambs o'er a mountain's side.
So stately her bearing, so proud her array,
The main she will traverse for ever and aye.
Many ports will exult at the gleam of her mast!
Hush! hush! thou vain dreamer! this hour is her last.
10 Five hundred souls, in one instant of dread
Are hurried o'er the deck,
And fast the miserable ship
Becomes a lifeless wreck.
Her keel hath struck on a hidden rock,
15 Her planks are torn asunder,
And down come her masts with a reeling shock,
And a hideous crash like thunder.
Her sails are draggled in the brine,
That gladdened late the skies;
20 And her pendant, that kissed the fair moonshine,
Down many a fathom lies.
Her beauteous sides, whose rainbow hues
Gleamed softly from below,
And flung a warm and sunny flush
25 O'er the wreaths of murmuring snow,
To the coral rocks are hurrying down,
To sleep amid colors as bright as their own.
Oh! many a dream was in the ship,
An hour before her death;
30 And sights of home with sighs disturbed
The sleeper's long-drawn breath.
Instead of the murmur of the sea,
The sailor heard the humming tree,
Alive through all its leaves,

And the swallow's song in the eaves.
His arms enclosed a blooming boy,
Who listened with tears of sorrow and joy

As she looked on the father of her child
Returned to her heart at last.

Astounded the reeling deck he paces,
Mid hurrying forms and ghastly faces ;-
The whole ship's crew are there.
Wailings around and over head,
50 Brave spirits stupified or dead,
And madness and despair.
Now is the ocean's bosom bare,
Unbroken as the floating air;
The ship hath melted quite away,
55 Like a struggling dream at break of day,
No image meets my wandering eye
But the new-risen sun and the sunny sky.
Though the night-shades are gone, yet a vapor dull
Bedims the waves so beautiful;
60 While a low and melancholy moan
Mourns for the glory that hath flown.

When Music, heavenly maid! was young,
While yet in early Greece she sung,
The Passions oft, to hear her shell,
Thronged around her magic cell;
Exulting, trembling, raging, fainting,
Possessed beyond the muse's painting.
By turns, they felt the glowing mind
Disturbed, delighted, raised, refined:
Till once, 'tis said, when all were fired,
Filled with fury, rapt, inspired,

From the supporting myrtles round,
They snatched her instruments of sound;
And, as they oft had heard apart,
Sweet lessons of her forceful art,
Each, for madness ruled the hour,
Would prove his own expressive power.
First, Fear, his hand, its skill to try,
Amid the chords bewildered laid;
And back recoiled, he knew not why,
E'en at the sound himself had made.
Next Anger rushed, his eyes on fire,
In lightnings owned his secret stings,
In one rude clash he struck the lyre,
And swept with hurried hand the strings.
With woful measures, wan Despair-
Low sullen sounds!-his grief beguiled:
A solemn, strange, and mingled air;
'Twas sad by fits, by starts 'twas wild.
40
But thou, O Hope! with eyes so fair,
What was thy delighted measure?
Still it whispered promised pleasure,
And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail.
Still would her touch the strain prolong;
And from the rocks, the woods, the vale,
35 She called on Echo still through all her song:
And, where her sweetest theme she chose,
A soft responsive voice was heard at every close;
And Hope, enchanted, smiled, and waved her golden hair.
And longer had she sung-but, with a frown,
Revenge impatient rose.
He threw his blood-stained sword in thunder down;
And, with a withering look,
The war-denouncing trumpet took,
And blew a blast so loud and dread,
45 Were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of wo;

And, ever and anon, he beat
The doubling drum with furious heat:
And though, sometimes, each dreary pause between,
Dejected Pity at his side
Her soul-subduing voice applied,
Yet still he kept his wild unaltered mien,
While each strained ball of sight-seemed bursting from his head.
Thy numbers, Jealousy, to nought were fixed;
Sad proof of thy distressful state!
Of differing themes the veering song was mixed:
And, now it courted Love; now, raving, called on Hate.
With eyes upraised, as one inspired,
Pale Melancholy sat retired;
And, from her wild sequestered seat,
In notes, by distance made more sweet,
Poured through the mellow horn her pensive soul,
And, dashing soft from rocks around,
Bubbling runnels joined the sound;
Through glades and glooms, the mingled measure stole,
Or o'er some haunted stream, with fond delay,
Round a holy calm diffusing,
Love of peace, and lonely musing,
In hollow murmurs died away.
But, oh, how altered was its sprightlier tone!
When Cheerfulness, a nymph of healthiest hue,
Her bow across her shoulder flung,
Her buskins gemmed with morning dew,
Blew an inspiring air, that dale and thicket rung,
The hunter's call, to Faun and Dryad known.
The oak-crowned Sisters, and the chaste-eyed Queen,
Satyrs and sylvan Boys were seen,
Peeping from forth their alleys green;
Brown Exercise rejoiced to hear;
And Sport leaped up and seized his beechen spear.

First to the lively pipe his hand addressed—
But soon he saw the brisk awakening viol;
Whose sweet entrancing voice he loved the best.
85 They would have thought who heard the strain
They saw in Tempe's vale, her native maids,
Amidst the festal-sounding shades,
To some unwearied minstrel dancing:
While, as his flying fingers kissed the strings,
Love framed with Mirth a gay fantastic round,

O Music, sphere-descended maid,
Friend of Pleasure, Wisdom's aid,
Why, goddess, why, to us denied,
Layest thou thy ancient lyre aside?
As in that loved Athenian bower
You learned in all-commanding power,
Thy mimic soul, O nymph endeared,
Can well recall what then it heard.
Where is thy native simple heart,
Devote to Virtue, Fancy, Art?
Arise, as in the elder time,
Warm, energic, chaste, sublime!
Thy wonders, in that godlike age
Fill thy recording sister's page-
"Tis said, and I believe the tale,
Thy humblest reed could more prevail,
Had more of strength, diviner rage,
Than all which charms this laggard age,
Even all at once together found,
Cecilia's mingled world of sound-
Oh, bid our vain endeavors cease,
Revive the just designs of Greece;
Return in all thy simple state;
Confirm the tales her sons relate!
Collins.

SECTION VII.
OF CADENCE.
In treating of the Melodies of the Voice, it was remarked,
that the falling tritone, when it occurs at the close of a
sentence, constitutes the Cadence, and is called the Triad
of the Cadence; though we may now remark, that except
in a single case the fall is confined wholly to the last two
constituents. This suggests the peculiarity which charac-
terizes the close of sentences, indicating to the ear that the
sense is finished; which is, a fall from the radical point of
the syllable which precedes the Cadence through three
tones, and terminating with a downward vanish. This is
all that is essential to the full Cadence. The only practical
questions which here arise for discussion are,-Where
should the Cadence be given? has it different forms? and
if so, what are they? and by what principle is a preference
given to the one or the other, in practice?
The Cadence always accompanies the period or full
close, except when overruled by the emphasis of the
rising intervals or of the inverted waves; and often ac-
companies the Exclamation, the Indirect question, and the
shorter rests usually marked by the dash, the colon, or
even the semicolon.
The form of the Cadence varies with the structure of the
sentence, and with the sentiment; and particularly with
the quantity of the syllables of which it is constituted, and
the degree of emphasis given to them. The Cadence may
consist of three constituents, but more frequently has but two,
or only one. For the sake of distinction, these are called
the Triad, the Duad, and the Monad forms; and under
these divisions, are found variations, which, though they

possess different degrees of perfection, yet add much to the
harmony and variety of spoken language. The following
schedule, it is believed, presents even to the eye all the
different forms of the Cadence authorized by the best
usage; and it will be found most convenient, in general, to
refer to them as first, second, third, fourth, &c., in the order
in which they are here enumerated. In the following dia-
grams, the bar separates from the rest of the line the con-
stituents which form the Cadence.
I. THE TRIAD.
1. The first form, or falling triad, has three constitu-
ents, with each the downward vanish. This produces the
most perfect repose of the voice, next to the Prepared
Cadence.

NOTE. When three or even four of the last syllables of a period
are unaccented, this fall; which commences with the accented
syllable, may be extended to all that follow it; as, Thus did Job

the falling.

ward vanish on the second.

False Cadence.

The first three forms are the only ones adapted to sylla-
bles of short quantity, though they may be employed on
others. The choice between these forms depends in part
on the sentiment-whether it inclines to the rising or the
falling movements; but more frequently on the place of the
accent. The fourth form requires the penultimate to be
long; and the fifth and sixth require long quantity in the
final syllable. The seventh or false cadence is never given
but when the last two syllables are so short as neither of
them to admit of being prolonged through two tones;
nor then, unless, through the unskillfulness of the
reader, the penultimate syllable has been prevented
from dropping into its natural position, as presented in
the third form.
The Prepared Cadence, which for the sake of uniformity
may be designated the eighth form, is that which in good
delivery is often heard at the close of a subject-whether
of a paragraph, of a chapter, or a volume; and it is un-
doubtedly important, that such a close should be marked
by some peculiar inflection which is readily cognizable by
the ear.
This is effected by a discrete fall of a third on
some syllable preceding the close, and near enough to it
to be naturally connected with it, by its effect upon the

6. The vestal flame of piety, lighted up by heaven in the
breast of woman, diffuses its light and warmth over the world;—
and dark would be the world if it should ever be extinguished
and lost.
The only new element in this Prepared Cadence is the
discrete fall of a third before described; and this may be
united with any of the first six forms of cadence enume-
rated in this section, and thus may be used at the close of
every paragraph.-It is also useful in giving notice of the
close of a succession of particulars, as in the following

4. We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed; perplexed,
but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but

The principal defects observed in readers and speakers
in regard to the Cadence, are-its entire omission; an
irregular fall near the close of the sentence, extending
through more than three syllables; so great a descent be-
low the line of current melody, as to render the last con-
stituent of the cadence inaudible; the monotony which
arises from using but one form; and the more common
and perhaps less exceptionable error, of excluding quantity
from the cadence altogether, and using only the first three
forms. The careful study of this section, combined with
suitable practice, cannot but correct all these defects where-
ever they exist; and attention to the cadence is the more
important since it always occurs at the close of the sen-
tence, when the mind of the hearer is most at liberty and
most inclined to dwell on any defects that may be apparent
in the speaker. The following examples will show the
manner of applying in practice, the principles of this sec-
tion-the numerals marking the form of cadence which

I. INFLUENCE OF THE DEAD ON THE LIVING.
The relations between man and man cease not with life.5 The
dead leave behind them their memory, their example, and the
effects of their actions.2 Their influence still abides with us.2
Their names and characters dwell in our thoughts and hearts.5
5 We live and commune with them in their writings. We enjoy
the benefit of their labors. Our institutions have been founded
by them. We are surrounded by the works of the dead. Our
knowledge and our arts are the fruit of their toil. Our minds
have been formed by their instructions. We are most intimately
10 connected with them by a thousand dependencies.¹ Those
whom we have loved in life, are still objects of our deepest and
holiest affections. Their power over us remains. They are
with us in our solitary walks; and their voices speak to our
hearts in the silence of midnight.2
Their image is impressed upon our dearest recollections, and
our most sacred hopes. They form an essential part of our
treasure laid in heaven.2 Far above all, we are separated from
them but for a little time. We are soon to be united with
them. If we follow in the path of those whom we have loved,
20 we too shall soon join the innumerable company of the spirits
of just men made perfect. Our affections and our hopes are
not buried in the dust, to which we commit the poor remains of
mortality.¹ The blessed retain their remembrance and their
love for us in heaven; and we will cherish our remembrance and
25 our love for them while on earth.5
15
Creatures of imitation and sympathy as we are, we look
around us for support and countenance even our virtues. We
recur for them most securely to the examples of the dead."
*NOTE TO THE TEACHER.-It is believed that the learner will
derive essential advantage from a careful review, at this point, of
the subject of the Diatonic Slides, p. 63; and, after having marked
the emphatic words in some selections of plain narrative, then let
him apply the rules and principles there developed, to the other por
tions, at the same time with the principles of this section.

There is a degree of insecurity and uncertainty, about living
30 worth. The stamp has not yet been put upon it, which pre-
cludes all change, and seals it as a just object of admiration for
future times. There is no service which a man of commanding
intellect can render to his fellow-creatures, better than that of
leaving behind him an unspotted example.2
If he do not confer upon them this benefit; if he leave a
character dark with vices in the sight of God, but dazzling with
shining qualities to the view of men; it may be that all his
other services had better been forborne, and he had passed inac-
tive and unnoticed through life. It is a dictate of wisdom,
40 therefore, as well as feeling, when a man, eminent for his virtues
and talents, has been taken away, to collect the riches of his
goodness, and add them to the treasury of human improvement.¹
The true Christian liveth not for himself, and dieth not for him-
self; and it is thus, in one res-pect, that he dieth not for him-
45 self.8

It must be so-Plato, thou reasonest well !5
Else, whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,
This longing after immortality?2
Or, whence this secret dread, and inward horror,
Of falling into nought? Why shrinks the soul
Back on herself, and startles at destruction ?2
'Tis the Divinity that stirs within us;
'Tis Heaven itself that points out-an hereafter,
And intimates-eternity to man.3
Eternity!-thou pleasing-dreadful thought!5
Through what variety of untried being,
Through what new scenes and changes must we pass !3
The wide, the unbounded prospect, lies before me;
But shadows, clouds, and darkness, rest upon
it.2
Here will I hold. If there's a power above us-
And that there is, all nature cries aloud
Through all her works-He must delight in virtue;
And that which he delights in must be happy.2
But when? or where? This world-was made for Cæsar.4

At the drawn dagger, and defies its point.-

Grow dim with age, and nature sink in years;
But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth,
Unhurt amid the war of elements,
The wreck of mat-ter, and the crush of worlds.

CHAPTER III.
GENERAL PRECEPTS.
SECTION I.
OF THE MEASURE OF SPEECH.
Ir belongs rather to the physiologist than the elocutionist
to explain the mechanism of the voice, and the causes
which limit or regulate the exercise of its powers. It
entirely falls in with our purpose however, to state the prin-
ciples deduced from this mechanism, so far as it is under-
stood, and the rules, by which a conformity to the laws of
the voice is secured. Nor is this a matter of mere specu-
lative interest, in as much as a conformity to these laws is
absolutely essential to ease in the use of the vocal organs ;
and on it are often suspended the health and even the life
of the speaker.
In the proper places, the principles of Time and of Ac-
cent have been developed. It has long been conceived,
that by the aid of these, poetic numbers are capable of
being subjected to measure. But by the light which mo-
dern elocutionists have thrown on this subject, it appears
that even the harmonious arrangements of verse are capable
of a rhythmus in their vocal execution, which is not at
all recognised by the principles of Prosody.
The following lines are divided into prosodical feet, and
each syllable is marked as long or short* according to the
usual notation.
The terms long and short are here employed, as used by Eng-
lish prosodists, with reference to accent and emphasis rather than
quantity.

By examining these measures, it will be seen, that they
vary in length from the hurried pyrrhic, consisting of two
short syllables, to the long drawn spondee, heard on the
words "men's blood." On the contrary, the measures
into which the good reader or speaker divides his periods
are, at least in theory, equal as to the time of their utter-
ance; and that, whether he is pronouncing verse or prose.
The following divisions of the same passage will admit of
being read by the vibrations of a pendulum, observing
the rests indicated by the new symbol, here introduced.
The poetic notation of heavy and light syllables is re-
tained for convenience of future reference.

1. These measures may consist of from one to four sylla-
bles. The number may be extended to five, as in the
third measure of the following line:- In the second |

in poetry; and in deliberate reading, such measures would

2. Each measure contains one, and only one, heavy
or accented syllable; or else a rest to occupy the time de-
voted to it. This will be seen by comparing the two
notations.
3. A single syllable of indefinite quantity may fill out a
measure; while accented syllables of shorter quantity
standing alone should be followed by a short pause.
-
4. The heavy syllable opens the measure, and thus the
movement is in all cases from the heavy to the light sylla-
bles; and this movement should be distinctly marked by
the voice, a measure requiring but a single pulsative
effort of the voice.

f
5. The measure, when consisting of a syllable of inde-
finite quantity, or of one accented and one or more unac-
cented syllables, is called a Perfect Measure; that which
contains a rest is called an Imperfect, or Defective Measure.
The principles of accent, as has been before said, de-
pend on usage. Thus no rules can be laid down here,
which would be of service to the learner. We may repeat
however, that such is the law of our language that every
word of more than one syllable has its accented syllable;
and it may be added, that among monosyllables, the pri-
mary parts of speech are usually pronounced with the
accentual stress, while the particles, except when made
emphatic, fill the light portions of the measures.
In all smooth and flowing verse, except the anapæstic,
the measure of two syllables will prevail; and in the ana-
pæstic the trisyllabic measure will predominate. The
measure of Milton's and Shakspeare's verse will however
be found remarkably unconstrained and varied. The mea-
sures of common prose differ not from those of poetry, ex-
cept that they exhibit a greater variety without any regular
succession of similar measures; and he whose ear has
been thoroughly attuned to the rhythmus of speech, as ex-
hibited in the principles and exercises of this section, at
the same time cannot but have improved his taste for the
beauties of composition.
These principles will now be illustrated by a few ex-
amples; and, in the absence of all accentual marks, we
may repeat, that the principles laid down require in the
perfect measure as also in the measure defective in
the last constituent, that the first syllable be accented; in
measures defective in the first constituent, there is no ac-
cented or heavy syllable. By carefully observing these

rules, the following exercises may be read by the learner,
but at first with great deliberation; afterwards more rapidly,
and, when perfectly familiar with the notation, with entire
freedom. The movement of the voice from the heavy to
the light syllables, so as to utter each measure by a single
pulsative effort of the voice, and the attention to the rests,
are considered more important than the perfect equality of
the time of the measures.

For further training on the principles of this section it
is recommended to the learner to score his own exercises
and then read them. Let him commence by marking the
heavy syllables in pieces selected for that purpose, both
prose and poetry. When he has acquired a facility in

doing this, then let him in these same pieces determine the
places for the rests, which, it is important to add, will be of
more frequent recurrence in dignified than in sprightly style.
And when he has done this, he will be prepared to com-
mence dividing the matter into measures, and to test the
correctness of the division by attempts to read the pieces
thus scored.
This exercise will be of special service to those readers
who have fallen into the habit of giving an improper stress
to unimportant words, or of reading with a measured,
scanning movement of the voice. This error is more
common in the reading of poetry than of prose, and is
often acquired in childhood, while learning to read under
bad instruction. But in the training of the public speaker
it will perform a much more important part, as it will not
only adapt his delivery to the principles of good taste, but
to that regular action of the heart and lungs which is so
essential to the healthful exercise of the functions of life,
but which is always interrupted just so far as the principles
of this section are violated in 'speech. Persons of easy
and graceful delivery speak according to these principles,
though they may never have studied them; and in view
of the consequences of their violation, we can scarcely
avoid wishing that the movements of the voice were as
little influenced by neglect, or subject to derangement by
bad habits, as are the movements of the heart. Then would
they always act in harmony, and health would at least
generally be promoted rather than injured by the exercise
of speaking.

SECTION II.
OF PAUSES.
RESTS in speech are to sentences, what the division into
syllables is to words; their object being to separate the
language by which thought is expressed, into portions cor-
responding with the sense; for the purpose of presenting
to the ear an idea of the connection of the thought, as more
or less intimate and close. The clearness, and especially
the dignity of style depend materially on the minute ob-
servance of all the requisite rests.
That the learner may
know what these are, the following enumeration is made.
The pauses marked by the comma, semicolon, colon,
period, and other points which divide discourse into sen-
tences, are for this reason called Sentential or Grammatical
pauses. Of these, important as they are in a grammatical
point of view, nothing need here be said, but that in the
language of emotion, they give no intimation as to tone or
inflection, nor even indicate with any definiteness the length
of the pause. The comma, for example, sometimes, when
it marks only the grammatical relation of words, indicating
no rest of the voice, as in "Yes, Sir," "No, Sir;" and
at others, being used to mark a rest altogether beyond its
ordinary length.
In the last section another set of pauses was developed,
which depend entirely on the mechanism of the voice, and
are independent of the usual marks of punctuation. Con-
necting themselves necessarily with the natural measured
movement of the voice, they may be called by way of dis-
tinction Rhythmic pauses. Nothing need here be added
concerning these, except the remark, that these two classes
of pauses are from their very nature so interspersed in all

correct delivery, as to furnish every necessary facility for
taking breath even in the most hurried utterance. It is
only from their disregard, that injury or even inconvenience
can arise to the speaker from too great an expenditure of
air from the lungs.
There is another pause connected solely with rhetorical
delivery, for the purpose of adding force to the expression
of the emotions, and which may be called the Rhetorical or
Emphatic pause. This pause, made immediately before or
after the utterance of some striking thought, commands the
special attention of the hearer, at the same time that it
gives him time to fix the thought more deeply in his me-
mory. It also indicates feeling on the part of the speaker.
It is a means of enforcing sentiment, which requires to be
used with caution, but which in the hands of a master is
an element of great power. Its effect is well understood
in music.
In the following examples this pause is marked by a
dash.
1. Alexander wept: the great and invincible Alexander-wept at
the fate of Darius.
2. Industry-is the guardian of innocence.
3. Mirth-I consider as an act, cheerfulness-as a habit of the
mind. Mirth-is like a flash of lightning, that glitters for a mo-
ment; cheerfulness-keeps up a kind of day-light in the mind.
4. Men will wrangle for religion; write for it; fight for it; die
for it; any thing but live for it.
5. Vice-is a monster of so frightful mien,
As to be hated, needs but to be seen;
Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,
We first endure, then-pity, then-embrace.
6. America-is full of youthful promise; Europe-is rich in the

accumulated treasures of age; her very ruins-tell the history of
times gone by, and every mouldering stone-is a chronicle.
7. Let not a monument-give you or me hopes,
Since-not a pinch of dust remains of Cheops.
8. Contemporaries-appreciate the man, rather than the merit;
but posterity-will regard the merit, rather than the man.
9. On whatever side we contemplate Homer, what principally
strikes us, is-his wonderful invention.
10. It is an honor to a man to cease from strife; but every fool
-will be intermeddling.
11. Some place the bliss in actions, some-in ease;
Those-call it pleasure, and contentment-these.
The Pause which marks the Transition from one para-
graph or division of discourse to another is too important
to be overlooked. This may be called the Paragraphic
pause. As a mere pause, it is sufficient to remark that it
is longer than that which marks the division of periods,
which are more closely related to each other. It is how-
ever accompanied with several other agencies.—1. It is
preceded by the Prepared Cadence. 2. It is followed by
a change in Pitch and usually by some change in the
Phrases of Melody. 3. It is the place where the Transi-
tions most frequently occur, which mark the changes of
sentiment in discourse, and which were made the subject
of a section in the last chapter.
In practice this pause will be found to furnish to the
speaker a very convenient occasion to return to a lower
note, a slower utterance, or a freer movement of the voice,
when he finds himself speaking on too high a pitch, too
rapidly, or in a monotonous and constrained manner.
There are two pauses which belong exclusively to verse,
18


## p. 206 (#216) ############################################

206
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
and are hence called Musical Pauses; the cesural pause
which divides the line into two parts, and the final pause
at the end of the line.
1. The cesural pause is not essential to verse, as the
shorter kinds of measure do not recognise it; but in our
heroic and blank verse, consisting of five feet, it can never
be omitted in reading, without destroying its euphony.
This pause may exist in any part of the line, but is most
agreeable when found in the middle; that is, in the
middle of the third foot, as in the first five lines of the
following:-
Can that arm measure. ... with an arm divine?
And canst thou thunder.... with a voice like mine?
Or in the hollow. . . . of thine hand contain
....
....
The bulk of waters, . . . . the wide spreading main,
When, mad with tempests, . . . . all the billows rise
In all their rage,
.. and dash the distant skies?
....
The cesural pause may be found at the end of the first,
second, or third foot, or in the middle of the second or
fourth. The euphony is diminished as the place of this
pause departs from the middle of the line-but is greater
when it occurs before the middle than after it. It is
however for the writer to determine the place of the
cesural pause, and for the reader to observe it, and mark it
with his voice.
2. The other pause peculiar to poetry occurs at the end
of the line, and is hence called the final pause. When
not coincident with the Grammatical pause, it is introduced
by the phrase of the monotone or the rising or falling di-
tone, with no downward slide of the voice. In the reading
of verse, the end of every line should be marked by such
a rest, unless forbidden by the closeness of the gramma-

207
tical connection with the following line. As regards rhyme,
there is no doubt but the end of each line should be made
quite perceptible to the ear; and if the same is not done
in blank verse, it often differs but little from prose. On the
stage, however, where the appearance of speaking in verse
should always be avoided, this resemblance to prose is not
a defect; and the ends of the lines, where the sense does
not require it, need not be marked by a rest.
Great care should be taken by the reader in determining
the proper place of the cesural pause; and the length to
be given to this, as also to the final pause, will furnish a
good exercise for his judgment, as it will afford a good
test of his taste. If made too long, or if accompanied
with any error of intonation, it gives a mechanical stiff-
ness to the movement of the verse, and passes into a de-
cided fault.
SECTION III.
OF THE READING OF POETRY.
THE principles which are laid down in the several
sections of the second chapter of this manual, are as
applicable to the reading of poetry as of prose; but in
their application, there are some slight differences which
need to be noticed.
I. As regards Accent, we have made no difference
between prose and poetry. In either case, the laws are
determined by usage. But,
1. The poet may violate these laws in the expression of
some harsh sentiment, for the purpose of making the sound
to correspond with the sense. Thus Milton,-


## p. 208 (#218) ############################################

208
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
On a sudden open fly,
With impetuous recoil, and jarring sound,
The infernal doors; and on their hinges grate
Harsh thunder.
The reader in such a case should yield to the preference
of the writer, in violation of usage.
2. Where, without any particular reason, the poet has
done violence to the laws of accent, there may in general
be a compromise of the jarring requisitions of the metrical
and the common accent, so as to avoid any considerable
harshness, by accenting both the syllables. Thus-
Our supreme foe, in time may much relent.
Of thrones and mighty seraphim prostrate.
Encamp their legions, or with obscure wing.
3. Where this compromise cannot be effected the cus-
tomary accent is to take precedence.
4. When the rhythm of verse seems to require an accen-
tual stress on unimportant words or syllables which would
have no such stress in prose, it should not be given. Thus
the and of, and the other particles with which our language
abounds, should never (except in rare cases where they are
made emphatic) be considered as long, or accented.
5. In poetry, the Temporal accent should be given on all
syllables of indefinite quantity; and the Radical specially
avoided, except on the most abrupt syllables.
II. The principles of Emphasis, of the Drifts of Melody,
of Expression, and of Transition, are applied, in all re-
spects, the same in poetry as in prose. The learner how-
ever may be informed, that in poetry he will find a more
comprehensive field for their employment. Poetry is the
language of feeling.


## p. 209 (#219) ############################################

READING OF POETRY.
209
III. All the kinds of Pauses used in the reading of prose
are also common to poetry, as well as those described in
the last section as peculiar to verse.
IV. The short syllables which would be pronounced in
the reading of prose, even though apostrophized by the
writer or the printer, should be pronounced also in poetry.
The occurrence of such syllables varies the melody; and
is most common with the best poets.
The dactyl often adds a short syllable in the first foot of
the verse, thus :—
Furious he spoke, the angry chief replied.
Mūrmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.
The tribrach occurs frequently in the third and fourth
feet, thus:-
And rolls impetuous to the subject plain.
And thunders down impetuous to the plain.
And the anapast is of frequent occurrence in any place
in the line, except the first. Witness the following:-
On evěry side with shadowy squadrons deep.
And hosts infuriate shake the shuddering ground.
V. In the reading of RHYME in particular, it may be
remarked, that there should be the same variety in the
Phrases of Melody and the Cadence, as in the reading of
blank verse, or prose. The regular recurrence of similar
sounds, superadded to the measure, exposes the reader to
the danger of too great uniformity in the employment of
the phrases of melody, or of a return to the same note at the
end of the lines.
It will often require great care and attention on the part
of the learner, to rid himself of bad habits of reading poetry,
18*

acquired in early life. In view of the kind of instruction
usually given to children in our schools, and the real
difficulties attending the reading of verse, it is perhaps
not remarkable that so few read it well.-The follow-
ing exercises will introduce the learner to the practice on
the pauses peculiar to poetry, which he may carry to any
extent on examples of his own selection. The dots....
indicate merely a vocal rest, with no expressive intona-
tion; and are hence a fit emblem of the musical pause.

SECTION IV.
OF THE GROUPING OF SPEECH.
THE idea involved in the Grouping of Speech, requires
for its full development a careful analysis of written lan-
guage. Such an analysis shows, that words sustaining a
close grammatical relation to each other are often separated
by intervening words and clauses. To the eye of the
reader the connection may be apparent, and the meaning is
generally obvious; but not so with the hearer. There
must be expedients adopted by the reader or speaker, to
present such sentences to the ear of the hearer as they na-
turally present themselves to the eye of him who reads, or
the sense may often remain obscure; and particularly in
poetry, where the greatest involutions and transpositions of
style occur. Among these expedients may be enumerated:
1. The application of Emphatic force to words having
a close grammatical connection, but separated by other
matter. The following will serve as an example :-
:-
GO PREACH TO THE COWARD, thou death-telling seer !
OR, if gory Culloden so dreadful appear,
DRAW, dotard, around thy old wavering sight!
THIS MANTLE, to cover the phantoms of fright.
2. The same object is secured by an abatement of the
force, and a quickening of the time in reading the matter
which intervenes between the related words or parts of a
sentence. These circumstances of Force and Time, though
perfectly distinct, in such cases coincide, and constitute
what may be called the Flight of the Voice. We shall pre-
sent it to the
eye
thus:-
-:
Thus saying, from her side the fatal key,
Sad instrument of all our wo, she took.


## p. 213 (#223) ############################################

GROUPING OF SPEECH.
213
Let us (since life can little more supply
Than just to look about us and to die)
Expatiate free o'er all this scene of man.
3. The same principle may extend to the shortening of
the pauses which intervene between words closely related
to each other.-This will be illustrated by a slur over the
pause thus shortened :—
Say first, for Heaven hides nothing from thy view,
Nor the deep track of hell.
4. Another expedient is, the employment of the Phrase
of the Monotone, (and sometimes of the Rising Ditone,)
instead of allowing the voice to fall at the pauses which
intervene between the related parts. Example:-
On the other side,
Incensed with indignation, Satan stood
Unterrified, and like a comet burned,
That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge,
In the Arctic sky.
Though these are distinct elements, and each capable of
an independent illustration, no two are opposed to each
other, but any or all of them may be combined to secure
one common object. This the following examples will
sufficiently illustrate :-
--
1. So spake our sire, and by his countenance seemed
Entering on studious thoughts abstruse, which EVE
Perceiving, where she sat retired in sight,
With lowliness majestic from her seat,
And grace that won who saw to wish her stay,
ROSE, and went forth among her fruits and flowers,
To visit how THEY prospered, bud and bloom,
HER NURSERY; they at her coming SPRUNG,
And, touched by her fair tendance, GLADLIER GREW.

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
2. The SUN was sunk, and after him the STAR
Of HESPERUS, whose office is to bring,
Twilight upon the earth, short arbiter
Twixt day and night; and now from end to end
NIGHT'S hemisphere had veiled the horizon round:
WHEN SATAN, who late fled before the threats
Of Gabriel out of Eden, now improved
In meditated fraud and malice, bent
On man's destruction, maugre what might hap
Of heavier on himself, FEARLESS RETURNED.
3. As the VINE, which has long twined its graceful foliage about the oak,
and been lifted by it into sunshine, will, when the hardy plant is rifted by the
thunderbolt, cling round it with its caressing tendrils, and bind its
up
shattered boughs; so is it beautifully ordained by Providence, that
WOMAN, who is the mere dependent and ornament of man in his happier hours,
should be his stay and solace when smitten with sudden calamity;
winding herself into the rugged recesses of his nature, tenderly
supporting the drooping head, and binding up the broken heart.
4. So spake the false dissembler UNPERCEIVED;
For neither MAN nor ANGEL can discern
HYPOCRISY, the only evil that walks
Invisible, except to God alone,
By his permissive will, through heaven and earth.
5. May the LIKE SERENITY in such dreadful circumstances, and a DEATH
EQUALLY GLORIOUS, be the lot of all whom TYRANNY, of whatever deno-
mination or description, SHALL, in any age, or in any country, CALL to expiate
their virtues on the scaffold.
The exercise suggested in this section may well be con-
tinued, for which examples may everywhere be found. It
involves an analysis of written language, which has to be
made mentally by him who understands what he reads,
whether he makes it sensible to the ear of the listener or
not. But to the speaker, or to him who is accustomed to
read aloud to others, it is not less necessary that he should

CLOSING REMARKS.
215
be able to make others understand, than that he should
himself understand, what he speaks or reads.
But this is not the only advantage to be derived from
this kind of exercise. Dr. Barber, when treating of this
subject, takes occasion to speak of the intimate connection
between the arts of composition and delivery. He re-
marks :-" It must be obvious, that such an analysis as is
necessary to present a clear picture of thought in delivery,
cannot fail to reveal the latent beauties as well as defects
of composition. The art of Rhetoric cannot fail to derive
assistance from that of Elocution; since a careful consider-
ation of the nice relations of thought in written language is
constantly necessary to its practice. Every exertion of it
consists in the application of a subtle test, by which com-
position, as a medium of conveying thought and sentiment,
is tried. The arts of Rhetoric and Delivery are therefore
intimately related and assist each other; and we may remind
those who affect great zeal for the one, and contemn the
other, of what Bacon used to say, when he experienced a
temporary difficulty from two passages of Scripture, which
he could not immediately reconcile :- Ye are brethren,
why strive ye?'”
The question was once asked by the Bishop of Cloyne,
in relation to Great Britain, "Whether half the learning of
the kingdom was not lost for want of having a proper de-
livery taught in our schools and colleges?" and a similar
inquiry cannot but force itself on any thoughtful observer,
in regard to our own country. Our systems of education
seem to be based on the supposition, that nothing is essen-
tially necessary to language but words. The graphic art,

as presented in our books-even the text-books furnished
for the use of children, exhibits nothing but words, and
marks indicating the rests of the voice. In regard to the
tones, emphases, quality of the voice, &c., they have no
visible signs. For these we depend entirely on nature, and
on the instructions of the living teacher. But in teaching
a language of words, in the absence of all effective instruc-
tion in regard to this other language, even the suggestions
of nature are countervailed; and in reading what they do
not understand, children first learn to lay aside their natural
tones and inflections-the language which alone can truly
express the feelings. Thus early they acquire reading tones,
widely different from the natural tones of speech; and these
too often, for want of correction, grow with their growth
and strengthen with their strength; from reading are trans-
ferred to the rehearsal upon the stage of what they commit
from books; and thus not unfrequently the professional
man-the public speaker even-engages in the hopeless
task of sustaining the cause of injured innocence, of rous-
ing up an oppressed people to the avenging of their wrongs,
or the still harder task of moving the depraved heart to the
choice of a course of virtuous action,-by the use of a lan-
guage of words.
In view of such a state of things, Sheridan says,-"When
we reflect, that not only every thing which is pleasur-
able, every thing which is forcible and affecting in utterance,
but also the most material point necessary to a full and dis-
tinct comprehension of the sense of what is uttered, depends
upon the proper use of the Elements of Expression; it may
well astonish us to think, that so essential a part of lan-
guage should in a civilized country be wholly neglected.
Nay worse, that our youth should not only be uninstructed

in the true use of these, but in the little art that is used,
they should be early perverted by false rules, utterly repug-
nant to those which nature has clearly pointed out to us.
In consequence of which, all the noble ends which might
be answered in a free state, by a clear, lively, and affecting
public elocution, are in a great measure lost to us. And
how can it be otherwise, when we have given up the vivi-
fying, energetic language, stamped by God himself upon
our nature, for that which is the cold, lifeless work of art,
and invention of man? and bartered that which can pene-
trate the inmost recesses of the heart, for one which dies in
the ear, or fades on the sight." This we have done; and,
strange to tell, have done it in the very face of the uni-
versal admission, that while few can be moved by reason,
all can feel.
Children should never be permitted to read what they
cannot understand; the school-boy should never be per-
mitted to commit a piece for rehearsal upon the stage, till
he has been taught the principles on which it should be
read and spoken: and in our higher institutions of learning,
all that has been neglected in the preparatory training
should be supplied by a patient system of practical instruc-
tion, embracing every point which is essential to an effec-
tive and powerful delivery. But most of those who have
charge of the business of elementary instruction, are them-
selves ignorant of the very simplest elements of elocution;
nor in many of our higher seminaries of learning, is any
but the most feeble attempt made to supply the defect of
early education arising from this source. Even in some of
our colleges, every attempt to set forth this subject will be
met with coldness and neglect. But may it not be hoped,
that the time is near, when a distinction shall be every-

where made between those seminaries and colleges which
send out from their walls those who by a good delivery are
prepared to make effective use of all their other acquisi-
tions, and those whose sons have only their certificates and
diplomas to present to the public as evidence of their edu-
cation. While speech and reason are among the leading
characteristics of man, it is melancholy to reflect on the
enormous waste of reasoning power among the educated
class of society, arising from the neglect to cultivate the
power of speech! Our country abounds in good writers,
while a good speaker is really almost a prodigy. The sole
reason of this is, that Rhetoric and all the elegances of
Composition are taught, while Elocution is left to nature
and to chance.

CHAPTER I.
ELEMENTS OF GESTURE.
SECTION I.
PRELIMINARY REMARKS.
GESTURE is used in this Manual to include the whole of
the action of the orator; and embraces that part of delivery
which addresses itself to the eye, as distinguished from the
Voice or that part which appeals to the ear. Besides,
therefore, what is more commonly understood by gesture, it
embraces the expression of the countenance and attitude,-
every thing indeed by which the painter gives life to his
portrait or the parent communicates with his infant child.
The first thing to be remarked in regard to the action
appropriate to the expression of sentiment, and which con-
sequently falls under our notice in this part of our Manual,
is, that it is natural. As evidence of this, it is, next to the
tones, the earliest language employed and the earliest
learned by the child. The one has been called the speech,
the other, the hand-writing of nature. These constitute
the only language which never deceives; and the only
language which is alike understood by all-the learned
and the unlearned. Though natural, it is to some ex-
tent voluntary. "Thus," in the language of Austin,
anger threatens, affright starts, joy laughs and dances,
but nature does not by any means suggest (except it may
be to some chosen few) the most dignified or graceful ex-
pressions of those various passions; as may be sufficiently
observed in the untutored extravagance and uncouth mo-

tions of the vulgar,—in the gesticulations of mirth in their
dances, and of anger in their quarrels. These, though
they may be perfectly intelligible, and strongly energetic,
degrade the person who uses them from all pretensions to
the character of liberality of mind, or of enlightened elo-
quence; and are more likely to excite in the cultivated
spectator laughter or disgust, than the kindred passion of
the gesticulator."
The first stage of gesture, then, as it may be called, cor-
responds with the natural tones of the voice, and consists
of the involuntary visible symbols of expression which con-
nect themselves with the stronger passions of the mind,
such as the motion of some of the muscles of the face, the
change of the color of the countenance, and certain sudden
gesticulations which sometimes extend to the whole body.
These are the offspring of the natural sympathy which
exists between the action of the mind and the material
frame. But the effects of this sympathy do not stop here.
It prompts to a variety of movements which are much
more under the control of the will than those to which we
have referred. These constitute gesture in its second stage,
and by way of distinction may be called voluntary. Being
to a certain extent under the control of the will, they may
be influenced by the force of example, and may become
awkward by the imitation of some bad model, or by being
put forth under the constraints of natural diffidence, or by
the employment of a manuscript in delivery. From the
same causes, gesture may be altogether suppressed.-Ex-
cess of natural excitement too, may lead to too great rigid-
ity of muscle, and to a total inattention to the gestures;
and this can scarcely fail to result in the entire absence of
every thing like grace in the action of the speaker. Ges-

ture, then, as an art, requires to be studied not less than
Grammar or Logic.
The voluntary gestures may well therefore become the
subject of instruction. The muscles by which they are
made are all voluntary muscles, not less than are those em-
ployed in penmanship, or in playing upon a musical instru-
ment; and thus, by a course of private training similar to
that to which in these other cases they are subjected, they
may be brought perfectly under the control of the will, so
as to produce with all the precision of a natural habit such
action as shall please instead of offending the eye. Such
action, considered merely as a matter of taste, has the same
advantage over the awkward movements of the untutored
speaker, as a neat and elegant dress has over the slovenly
apparel of a clown: it bespeaks the favor and attention
of the hearer. But as the language of sentiment and feel-
ing, it performs the higher office of arousing the mind of
the speaker and inspiring him with feelings suitable to the
subject and the occasion, of giving force and impressive-
ness to the sentiments he utters, and thus of exciting and
keeping alive an interest on the part of his auditory. By
this feeling of interest alone, is the popular mind roused
up to a full appreciation of the importance of the matter in
hand. Yet all this
Yet all this is to be done, not by the employment
any artificial means, but by the use of the cultivated na-
tural powers. No affectation can equal the simple dignity
of nature, which however rarely becomes visible till freed
from the rubbish of artificial defects and polished by art.
of
It may not appear perfectly obvious, that a neglect of the
principles of gesture may affect injuriously the character
even of written composition. Yet who, if wanting in an
effective elocution, would attempt rhetorical expression

or eloquent arrangement, in a sermon or discourse in-
tended to be delivered by himself? So far from this, to
adopt the language of a distinguished writer on this subject,
"If even a figure or brilliant thought should occur to him,
he rejects it as not of a piece, or in the language of Sterne,
as 'intended for another man ;' and if in his researches on
his subject, he meets with any thing beautiful as well as
illustrative, he strips it of its ornaments, and clothes it in
the plain garb of household labor. He blushes to intro-
duce a figure too elegant to be reckoned of his society,
and which he knows not how to present as he ought. To
be able to write with spirit a rhetorical composition which
a man is to pronounce himself, he must also feel his own
ability to deliver it with spirit. And therefore the igno-
rance or neglect of rhetorical delivery must be considered
as one great impediment to the progress even of written
eloquence."
It should be remarked in passing, that feeling cannot be
expressed by words alone, or even by the tones of the
voice: it finds its best, and ofttimes its only expression in
the flash of passion on the cheek, in the speaking eye, the
contracted brow, the compressed lip, the heaving breast,
the trembling frame, in the rigid muscle and the general
bearing of the entire body. And when emotion or passion
thus speaks, its language is often confined to no parti-
cular part of the body, but the living frame as a whole
sympathizes in the action. Still, in treating of this part of
our general subject, to facilitate the imparting of instruction,
as well as to furnish the materials for giving an intelligent
description of the action of a speaker, an analysis of the
elements of gesture, as arising from different parts of the
body, will be first given. Such an analysis,-having a

reference however to the action of the orator rather than
the actor, will be presented in the several sections of this
chapter; while the attention of the learner is successively
called to the Feet and Lower Limbs, the Head and Trunk,
the Eyes and Countenance, the Hand, and the Arm.—Some
of the elements appropriated only to epic or dramatic ac-
tion, will be noticed in the Appendix.
.
This will lead to a somewhat minute detail of particulars,
with all of which however the learner should be made ac-
quainted, that he may have a full knowledge of all the
means which nature and the best usage have placed at his
command, not only for the purpose of enforcing sentiment,
but also for enabling him to give interesting variety to the
action by which this is to be effected. And he may here
be reminded, that oratory is no new art of mere modern
invention; but that the principles which we present are
the same with those which have come down over the lapse
of more than two thousand years; and that the best models
of excellence of our own time are those which approach
nearest to the great masters of antiquity, whose writings
and opinions have fortunately survived the wreck of much
other matter. These principles then come to us with all
the authority which time and experience can impart to
them. Had we competent teachers in this department, and
perfect models for the imitation of the young, the learner
might aim directly at the acquisition of great excellence in
oratory. As it is, his first object should be to free himself
from bad habits, and from all artificial constraints, then to
avoid faults, and thus indirectly by frequent and continued
practice to acquire the beauties and the graces which will
naturally engraff themselves on his delivery. To the ac-
complishment of this end, this Part of our work is directed.

SECTION II.
OF THE FEET AND LOWER LIMBS.
THE propriety of commencing this part of our subject
with a consideration of the Feet and Lower Limbs will
become obvious to the learner as we pass along. To the
orator nothing is unimportant which contributes to the
general impression he makes upon his audience; and this
depends very materially on the dignity and grace of his
movements. And what particularly concerns us to remark
at this point is, that dignity and grace in the standing figure
are known to depend on the positions of the lower limbs,
which should be such as to give to the body both firmness
of support and facility of movement. Mere firmness or
stability can be secured, when combined with every degree
of awkwardness; and rude strength most frequently per-
haps supports the weight of the body equally on both feet.
Firmness and grace however are combined, when the
weight of the body is principally supported on one leg, and
the other so placed as to preserve the balance of the body
and keep it from tottering, at the same time that it is left
free to move at will. Austin has remarked, that this is the
position adopted in the Apollo, the Antinous, and in other
beautiful and well-executed statues. In this position, the
foot which supports the body is to be firmly planted, and
the body so erect that a perpendicular line let fall from
the centre of the neck should pass through the heel of that
foot. Either foot may thus support the body, and may be
more or less advanced than the free foot; thus giving four
positions which are the only ones suited to oratory. The
conditions of all these are, first, that the feet are to be
separated from each other only three or four inches;

THE FEET AND LOWER LIMBS.
227
secondly, that the toes of the foot which supports the body,
as well as of the other, should be turned moderately out-
ward; and thirdly, that the feet should be so placed, that
lines passing lengthwise through the two feet, shall cross
each other under the heel of the foot least advanced.
First Position of the Right Foot.
In this position, the right foot is firmly
planted, and sustains the weight of the
body. The left foot forms nearly a right
angle with the other, and rests only on
the ball of the great toe. In the ground-
plan of this figure, the right foot which
rests firmly on the ground is deeply
shaded; the part of the left which
touches the ground is shaded lightly. (See Fig. 1.)
Second Position of the Right Foot.
In this position also, the right foot is
advanced, while the weight of the body
is on the left.-In the plan therefore,
the left foot is deeply shaded; and the
right, though it rests upon the ground
throughout its whole extent, is shaded
more faintly. In this position, the an-
gle which the feet make with each other
is but about 75 degrees. (See Fig. 2.)

This position likewise is in all respects analogous to the

show.
These are believed to be the most natural and easy posi-
tions which the speaker can assume; and yet when first
attempted they may seem to require an effort. The learner
will soon however find himself perfectly at ease in them,
and familiarity will secure their adoption as a matter of
habit. With this familiarity, all attention to studied preci-
sion or measured exactness should be laid aside. Affecta-
tion and grace can never exist together. Though the
sustaining foot is to be planted firmly, and the knee of that
leg straightened, yet there should be no contraction or
rigidity of muscle; and the other foot and limb must be
kept relaxed.
An observance of the foregoing rules will do much to
guard the learner against a variety of errors; some of the
most common of which we shall here notice.

Errors in the Position of the Feet.

1. The sustaining of
the weight of the body
on both feet equally.
This is objectionable
mainly, as rendering
changes of position in-
convenient. (See Figs.

2. The throwing of
the weight of the body
forward upon the ball
of the foot, instead of having it rest upon the heel.—This
has less of firmness and less of dignity than the erect atti-
tude.

Fig. 8.
3. The placing of the feet too close together.-This di-
minishes the base of support; thus rendering the position
less stable, and of course restricting the free use of the arms
in gesture. (See Fig. 7.)

Fig. 9.

4. The separating of the feet too far from each other.—
If thus placed, and on a line with each other, there is pro-
duced a very awkward and slovenly appearance; and if
the one is placed in advance of the other, a swaggering
theatrical air is presented, entirely inconsistent with the
simplicity of the positions suited to the orator. (See Figs.
8, 9.)
5. The pointing of the toes straight forward, or not
turning them outward to the extent of the angle above de-
scribed. This may be combined with any of the faults
just named, and will greatly heighten the awkwardness of
those positions. By itself, it diminishes the base of sup-
port and thus renders the positions of the body less stable;
and tends to expose the side of the speaker to his audience
instead of the full front.
6. The bending of the leg which should sustain the body,
or the keeping of the free one straight and rigid.-Either
of these errors of position throws the body into an ungrace-
ful attitude. (See Figs. 10, 11, 12.)

remarked that the only changes of position which seem to
be required or admitted in oratory-are advancing and re-
tiring. Either of these movements may be made from
either of the four positions before described; and the di-
rections which follow are designed simply to insure that
these changes shall be made with the utmost simplicity, and
with an entire freedom from display. For this purpose they
must be made under the following conditions:-First, the
speaker must advance or retire, when on the stage, by a
step of only moderate length-something less than the ordi-
nary walking step. Secondly, the change must always
commence with the free foot. Thirdly, the outward direc-
tion of the toes noted in the several positions must be pre-
served during the changes; and fourthly, the changes must
be in the following order:-1st. The advance from the first
position of either foot-is made by passing into the first
position of the opposite foot; and the advance from the
second position, by passing into the first position of the
same foot. 2nd. To retire from the first position of either
foot, it is only necessary to pass into the second position
of the same foot; and to retire from the second position, to
pass into the second position of the opposite foot. It may
assist the learner, to remember that the advance should thus
always bring him into the first position of one of the feet;
while in retiring, he always falls into a second position.
*NOTE TO THE TEACHER.-These positions and changes of po-
sitions, being the most easy and simple, by a little practice become
perfectly natural. An entire class, or section of a class, may advan-
tageously be trained together in this kind of exercise. First, let the
class be required to take the second position of the right foot, (which
for convenience may here be designated by R. 2; and the other po-
sitions in a corresponding manner.) Then let them be required to
advance and retire, according to the following table, which may be
extended and combined, at the pleasure of the teacher.

The observance of these simple rules will render any
changes of position called for in oratory easy and natural,
at the same time that it will afford a guaranty against all
awkwardness or apparent affectation. The following are
among the most common errors in the employment of the
lower limbs.
Errors connected with Changes of Position.
1. The movement to the right or left, as distinguished
from the free movement forward and backward, in the re-
gular process of advancing and retiring. Such sidelong
movements may be proper for the actor, though not called
for in oratory; hence the notice of them is reserved for the
Appendix.
2. The making of the step too long or too short.—The
theatrical stride, and the short shuffling step of hesitating
timidity-are equally inconsistent with the true dignity of
the orator.
3. The attempt to change the position by moving the foot
which supports the body.-To move this foot requires two
successive efforts,-the first being necessary to set the foot
free. This complex movement is always unnecessary, and
consequently awkward.

At first, each of these changes should be made slowly, and the
position may be given which should succeed; but after a very little
practice, the only direction given should be-to advance or retire,
when care must be taken to see that it be done correctly.

4. The advancing with the toes pointing straight forward,
or turned outward by too small an angle. This step, be-
sides appearing less graceful, leaves the body unsupported
on the side from which the toes are diverted.
-
SECTION III.
5. The falling into a wrong position after advancing or
retiring. Any other positions, or modes of changing the
position, than those already pointed out, are wanting both
in simplicity and grace.
THE HEAD AND TRUNK.
THE attitude and general bearing of the whole person
depend on the position of the head and trunk; and the
position of these depends so materially on the management
of the feet and lower limbs, that if the rules of the pre-
ceding section are carefully observed, there is little danger
that in regard to this any thing shall be wrong.
In dramatic action, the head performs a very important
part. Shame, pride, dislike, horror, and many other pas-
sions and feelings do not admit of a full expression but by
the action of the head. Such action however has little to
do with grave delivery, either in declamation or in oratory
-whether in the pulpit, at the bar, or in the senate.
The dignified self-possession suited to oratory preserves the
head erect, permitting it neither to fall forward upon the
breast, to incline to the side, nor to be thrown back in the
attitude of haughtiness or defiance.-The positions of the
body too may be made in the highest degree significant, as
they may vary from the air of pride or disdain, which
throws the body back from the persons addressed,—to the
prostration, which marks the utmost degree of abasement
20*

and humility. Oratory however requires only the erect
position of self-sustained dignity, and allows no marked
deviation from this position.
To be more particular, the body of the speaker should
be well balanced and sustained erect on the supporting
limb; the head likewise should be sustained with manli-
ness and grace; he should front his audience-presenting
himself, as Quintilian expresses it, æquo pectore, and with his
face as well as his breast directed to those whom he ad-
dresses; and the shrugging up of the shoulders should also be
carefully guarded against. This perfectly erect position of
the body and the head should however yield to every gesture
of the arm. That which mainly distinguishes the move-
ments of the living body from those of the machine, is the
sympathy which produces a perfect correspondence in the
action of all the parts. A temporary inclination of the en-
tire body in the direction of the gesture of the arm is not
then opposed to the rules here laid down.

The following are among the common errors which, it will
be perceived, are at variance with the foregoing directions:

in the Position of the Head and Trunk.
1. The rigid square position of the body,
which arises from the constrained position
of the supporting leg.-However such atti-
tudes
may be suited to a military man, they
find no countenance in the rules laid down
for the orator. This is diametrically opposed
to what Cicero calls the virilis flexus late-
rum-the manly inclination of the sides,
which is represented in Fig. 13; where it
appears the supporting limb is not perpen-

dicular, but inclined so as to bring the centre of the body
into the line of the supporting foot. The perpendicular,
rigid position of the supporting leg produces the error we
would here describe; and in this erroneous position of the
body, there will be less sympathy with the movements of
the arms, and consequently less of ease and grace, than in
the position represented in the figure.
2. The elevating and retracting of the head too much.-
This position presents an air of arrogance or at least of in-
difference; and generally arises from the erroneous posi-
tion of the lower limbs represented in Fig. 12, page 230,
which position has a tendency to throw the body also
back too far from the audience.-The error opposed to
this, is the hanging of the head bashfully down.
3. The reclining of the head towards the shoulder, pre-
senting the appearance of languor or indolence.
4. The motion of the head in gesture, unaccompanied with
the arm and hand.-This error is more common with those
who have been accustomed to read from a manuscript,
than with those who have trained themselves properly to
the practice of oratory. Indeed some motion of the head
is allowable in situations where gestures of the hand are
not admitted, as in private conversation, or when one is
reading or lecturing in a sitting posture.
5. The exposing of the side to the audience, instead of the
breast. This generally arises from pointing the toes
straight forward in the movements which lead to changes
of position, instead of keeping them turned outward ac-
cording to the rule.
6. The inclination of the body forward, as when the
sustaining limb is bent at the knee, or the weight of the
body rests on the ball of the foot.

body represented in Fig. 14, which most
commonly originates in too wide a sepa-
ration of the feet.

8. The inclination of the body to one
side. This may arise from a faulty posi-
tion of the feet, or from a habit of inclin-
ing too much in the direction of the arm
which is employed in gesture.

Quintilian condemns; and Demosthenes,
to cure this habit, practiced speaking with a spear hanging
over his shoulder.
SECTION IV.
OF THE EYES AND COUNTENANCE.
THERE is a singular sympathy between the real feelings
of the heart, and the expression of the countenance. Says
Lavater," When any passion is called into action, such
passion is depicted by the motion of the muscles, and these
motions are accompanied by a strong palpitation of the
heart. If the countenance be tranquil, it always denotes
tranquillity in the region of the heart and breast." "Hence
it appears," says the author of the Chironomia, "that the
orator who would move others, must appear to be moved
himself: that is, he must express his emotions in his coun-
tenance and by his manner; otherwise his language will
be contradicted by his looks, and his audience will be more
inclined to believe them, which are the natural and sure
indications of the inward mind, than his words, which

237
may easily be feigned, and may differ much from his real
sentiments."
The power of expression is not possessed equally by all;
but when possessed, "it has," in the language of Sir Charles
Bell, "a great share in human beauty; whether in the
living countenance, or in that which the pencil presents.
How different the tame regularity of a merely placid coun-
tenance, from what strikes the spectator when he beholds
the indications of a great mind in that susceptibility of
emotion and energy, which marks the brow and animates the
eye of the hero even in the calmest scenes of life. How fas-
cinating, when compared with the insipid prettiness and re-
gular features of an inanimate beauty, is that susceptibility
which lightens up the countenance and plays upon the fea-
tures of a woman of sensibility, even while she is unmoved
by any particular affection. The full clear eye, the arched
and movable eyebrow, the smooth and polished forehead,
as indicating this kind of capacity, this susceptibility of emo-
tion and power of expression, are grand features of human
character and beauty."*
-
The eyes, more than any other feature by far, give cha-
racter to the expression of the countenance. Thus children.
early learn to look at the eyes of the parent or nurse
to determine the real meaning of the words they may
have uttered. Even the dog learns to read the human
countenance, and finds in his master's eyes the surest indi-
cations of his will.-Who cannot distinguish between the
honest look of conscious innocence, and the impudent gaze
of hardened guilt; or between the downcast eye of modesty,
and the averted and unsteady look of him whose heart is

the seat of dark designs and purposes? And how different
is the expression of the eye when suffused with tears, and
when flashing forth the expression of mirthfulness and of
joy! The eye-lids, the eyebrows-which are peculiar to
man, and even the cheeks, contribute to the production of
the various expressions of the eye.
The orator, then, should never wear spectacles, but as a
matter of extreme necessity. This, however, may perhaps
be preferable to the habitual squint of the eye, which, with-
out great care, is acquired by near-sighted persons. On the
contrary, the eyes should be uncovered, and always with a
calm and unaffected expression be directed to the audience,
though without being fixed on any individual so as to make
him a special object of address.
The power possessed even by the eye of the brute has
been recognised in all ages. To man alone, however, is
given the expressive forehead, the movable brow, the
blushing cheek, and the lip which can express derision,
-contempt, and pride. In one respect, it is more important
to attend to the lips, than even to the eyes. The mouth in
particular being formed by soft parts, may, by bad habits
or by indulgence in any depraved passion, permanently
lose even its original characteristics of beauty; while
homely features may acquire a beauty and symmetry not
their own, by the exercise of benevolence, candor, and
fidelity, and the habitual practice of self-control. It is not
to be doubted, that the innocent beauty which character-
izes the face of early childhood, in thousands of instances.
has its soft outlines irretrievably marred and defaced by
habits acquired perhaps by imitation, or by excessive in-
dulgence in passion. In later life, habitual sorrow, or
anxiety, or envy, or a sour temper, as well as habits of in-

temperance and voluptuousness, may drive from the coun-
tenance even distinguished beauty, and may impart to it
traits which are not only devoid of all interest, but forbid-
ding and offensive.*
With the power possessed by the countenance of ex-
pressing the stronger emotions and passions, oratory rarely
has to do. But with its characteristics of grace-those
native lineaments which bespeak moral excellence, wis-
dom, integrity, and discretion, it has much to do.-Pliny
has described the mouth of Pompey as a "mouth of pro-
bity"-os probum; and a foreign writer has spoken of the
mouth of our Washington, as presented in the picture by
Stewart, as strongly suggesting the idea of this os probum.
The orator then should not be indifferent to the expression
of the countenance; he should have even the forehead
bare, and should take special care that the mouth and the
lips be in no way distorted during delivery, but remain the
true emblems of a dignified self-possession.
Among the common errors to which these instructions
are opposed, may be mentioned the following:-
Errors relating to the Eyes and Countenance.
1. The closing of the eyes; the staring, the vague wan-
dering or the motionless abstraction of the eyes; the fixing
of the eyes upon any individual of the audience; or the turn-
ing of the eyes away from the audience.-No bad habits
would more certainly attract attention than these, and none
"The parts of the human face the most movable and the most
expressive, are the inner extremities of the eyebrow, and the angle
of the mouth, and these are precisely the parts of the face which in
brutes have least expression; for the brutes have no eyebrows, and
no power of elevating or depressing the angle of the mouth. It is
in these features therefore that we should expect to find the muscles
of expression peculiar to man."—Anatomy of Expression.

would be more universally condemned. In pronouncing
an apostrophe however, or addressing some remote object,
or speaking of some distant scene, the eye may be for a
time withdrawn from the audience.
2. The indulgence in tears, except on occasions worthy of
such excitement.-Demosthenes is said often to have wept,
when engaged in pleading capital causes. A distinguished
Roman writer has said, "It was a common observation in
Greece, that worthy men are easily moved, and prone to
tears." A greater than the worthy men of Greece, our
Lord, wept at the grave of his friend; and again when he
approached Jerusalem—that devoted city, he wept over it,
as he uttered the inimitably beautiful exclamation so worthy
of him "who spake as never man spake." Austin says, in
regard to this subject:-"When manly firmness must be
supposed to give way, under the irremediable loss of what
is most dear; tears are allowed to speak the anguish of the
heart. The warlike Richmond in Shakspeare's Richard
III. is not lowered in the estimation of the audience, by his
effusion of tears on hearing of the murder of his family by
the tyrant. The tear of humanity is also a bright gem in
the eye of the judge who pronounces the awful sentence
of the law upon a criminal, who might have been expected
to fulfil better hopes."-Tears being the strongest symbol
of emotion, should thus be reserved for occasions worthy
of them.
3. The allowing of the forehead or any part of the face
to be covered, in consequence of a long growth of the hair.—
This bears the marks of effeminacy, and consequently de-
rogates from the dignity of the orator.
4. The unmeaning frown, or any occasional working of
the eyebrows. In like manner, the unmeaning smile, or ex-

241
pression of scorn, the retracting of the corners of the mouth,
the protrusion or the compression of the lips, the biting them,
or folding them upon each other, as with a sort of self-com-
placency, should be avoided as at least tending to dis-
tract the mind of the hearer, and as being often positively
offensive.
SECTION V.
OF THE HAND.
THE expressiveness of what is usually called gesture
depends on the hand. Next to the tones of the voice and
the countenance, the hand perhaps has the greatest variety
and power of expression. Says Sheridan:-"Every one
knows that with the hands we can demand, or promise;
call, dismiss; threaten, supplicate; ask, deny; show joy,
sorrow, detestation, fear, confession, penitence, admiration,
respect; and many other things now in common use. But
how much farther their powers might be carried, through
our neglect of using them we little know."
The positions of the hand are described by Austin,* by
referring successively to the four following circumstances:
1. The disposition of the fingers. 2. The manner in which
the palm is presented. 3. The combined disposition of
both hands. 4. The parts of the body on which they are
occasionally placed.
1. The Disposition of the Fingers.
The natural state of the fingers, when the arm is hanging
freely by the side or employed in unimpassioned gesture, is
* Chironomia, chap. xiii.
21

that in which the hand is fully open, with the fore-finger
nearly straight and separated from the middle finger; the
middle finger is more bended, and rests partly on the third
finger, which it gently touches; the little finger is still more
bended, and separated from the third finger; while the
thumb is withdrawn entirely from the palm, and without
constraint turned a little upward and outward. This posi-
tion is represented in Fig. 15. This
arrangement of the fingers is observed
in the Venus de Medicis, and in others
of the most eminent specimens of both statuary and paint-
ing. Even though it may at first seem difficult to some
learners, it will by a little practice become to them as it
indeed is the natural state of the hand.

The clenched state presents the hand closed, and the
thumb lapped over the middle finger. (See Fig. 17.)
The collected state is that in which the ends of all the
fingers are gently inclined towards, or touch the end of the
thumb. (See Fig. 18.) This is the state of the fingers,
when the hand in gesture is brought up near to the oppo-
site shoulder, preparatory to being extended in the contrary
direction.

turned inward, and contracted with a degree of force pro-
portioned to the energy of the speaker. (See Figs. 19,
20, 21.)
Fig. 19.
Fig. 20.
Fig. 21.
2. The manner in which the Palm is presented.
The hand is said to be prone, when the palm is turned
downward.
It is said to be supine, when the palm is turned upward.
It is said to be inward, when the palm is turned toward
the breast, and the thumb erect.
It is said to be outward, when the palm is turned from
the body, and the thumb downward.
It is said to be vertical, when the plane of the palm is
perpendicular to the horizon, the fingers pointing upward.
These positions of the palm, though sufficiently signifi-
cant and expressive, are seldom employed in ordinary de-
clamation, or sober dignified delivery. For future reference
however, they are here noticed.-The position of the hand,
as regards the palm, most suitable to be adopted by the
public speaker, is that which presents an inclination from
the supine position of about 45°, and accompanied with a
slight bend of the wrist downward, in the direction of the
little finger. (See Fig. 22.)-This, possessing the elements
of freedom and grace, and being less
likely to weary any of the muscles of
the hand or wrist, may be designated
the natural position of the palm, and
should not be deviated from without

good cause. In declamation and oratory, the natural posi-
tion of the fingers should be presented with this position of
the palm.
3. The combined Disposition of Both Hands.
As these positions belong to dramatic action, the con-
sideration of them is reserved for the Appendix.
4. The Parts of the Body on which the Hands are occasion-
ally placed.
These will be barely enumerated. The hand may be
placed-
Fig. 23.
On the Breast, in an appeal to conscience,
or in giving expression to any strong internal
emotion. (See Fig. 23.)
On the Eyes, to express shame or grief.
(See Fig. 86.)
On the Lips, as an injunction of silence.-
The fore-finger on the lips expresses the same
thing. (See Fig. 87.)
On the Forehead, to indicate pain or dis-
tress. (See Fig. 88.)-When the hand is
brought up to the forehead or to the eyes, the
head is moved forward to meet it.
On the Chin, in deliberation, or intense thought. (See
Fig. 89.)
These gestures are rare, and are always significant; the
hand upon the breast being the only one ever called for in
ordinary address. This is performed with the arm in an
unaffected position, the hand inward, and the middle of the
second and third fingers directly upon the heart.


## p. 245 (#255) ############################################

THE HAND.
245
Errors connected with the Positions of the Hand.
1. The employment, in ordinary unexcited delivery, of
any other state of the fingers, than that designated as the
natural state; also any faulty mode of presenting the ex-
tended, clenched, collected, or pointing positions.
2. The moving of the fingers about in an indefinite man-
ner, or upon themselves, or the clenching of the hand, when
it is hanging by the side, where it ought to be perfectly at
rest.
3. The too frequent presentation of the prlm in the other
positions which have been described, instead of that which
is called its natural position.
4. The placing of the hand edgewise, equidistant from
prone and supine, as represented in
Fig. 24.
Fig. 24; which has no meaning but
as a childish imitation of the act of
riving or splitting.
5. The hollowing of the palm, by approximating the
fingers and thumb to it. An open palm adds both grace and
energy to delivery.
6. The use of the tremulous motion of the hand, without
any assignable reason.
7. The bringing of the two hands together, as in clasping
them, laying the one in the other, crossing the fingers, &c.
To ordinary delivery, these are not appropriate, whatever
significance some of them may have as the symbols of
excited passion.
8. The bringing of the hand to the face, or the laying of
it on any part of the body, except when the sentiment ex-
pressly demands it.
9. Instead of placing the hand on the heart in the man-

ner prescribed, the touching of the breast with the thumb or
the tips of the fingers, the placing of the hand in the wrong
place, as on the pit of the stomach, too far toward the left
side, or too high up on the breast, also a wrong position of
the arm, as when it is made to hug the body, or when the
elbow is unnaturally thrown out from the body.
10. The employing of the hand in adjusting any part of
the clothing, in brushing up the hair, in flourishing a hand-
kerchief, in moving a book or turning over its pages merely
as a matter of habit, and when no necessity demands it.—
The orator is denied no privilege of using his hand, in
helping himself to a glass of water, or using a handkerchief,
when his convenience demands it; but then this should, as
far as possible, be done during the paragraphic rests, so as
not to obstruct or interfere with the regular current of his
delivery. And even in doing this, all affected, finical po-
sitions of the hand should be avoided, as well as those
which are peculiar and awkward.
SECTION VI.
OF THE ARM.
THE arm performs but a subordinate part in gesture, it
being little more than the agent for moving the hand. The
performance of this office however is sufficient to give it
great importance in the action of the orator. Every natural
expression of feeling is characterized by its simplicity; and
in their simplicity, the movements of the arm find the chief
element of grace. Ornament is not to be sought after, as
a primary excellence; as a secondary excellence however,
it should not be undervalued. Awkward gestures detract
from the force of the sentiments delivered, instead of adding

247
to it, by withdrawing the mind from the matter to the man-
ner-from the subject in hand to the action of the speaker.
These then should be most sedulously avoided; and to aid
the learner in adopting a free and graceful action of the
arm, the following suggestions are made.
First. The action of the arm should always be free and
unconstrained, appearing to proceed rather from the shoul-
der than from the elbow; though care should be taken,
that the elbow be neither straight, nor rigid and stiff.
Second. The arm should be so moved, that the hand
should always describe curved lines, instead of those which
are straight and angular. The curve is the line of beauty;
and grace in the action of the arm depends very materially
on the observance of this principle.
Third. In all ordinary gestures, the motion of the hand
through vertical or horizontal curves is deemed more grace-
ful than that through lines oblique to these. The lines
employed for this purpose are presented in Fig. 25. Let
the line z fR be considered a part of the vertical circle
passing down in front of the speaker's body. Let ze Rez
be another vertical circle crossing this one at z and R, and
passing each side of the speaker. This may be called the
primitive or extended circle. Half way between these two
circles, and cutting them at z and R, let two oblique cir-
cles, z o R b z and z c R b z, be supposed to pass—the dot-
ted part of the circles being back of the primitive circle.
And let the centre of the speaker's breast-the point from
which the movements of the arms may be conceived to
emanate, be supposed in the centre of this imaginary sphere.
These circles will represent the lines in which the vertical
movements of the hands are made,-without however in-
tending to imply, that mathematical precision in this respect

is either practicable or desirable. The right hand may
move easily and gracefully anywhere in the lines z e R, zo
R, Z f R, and occasionally, though with less ease or grace, in
the line Z CR. The left hand moves through the corre-
sponding lines on the other side.
These circles are crossed by three others, the first H H H,
at the elevation of the speaker's breast, and here designated
as horizontal, another D D D, depressed 45° below, and the
other E E E elevated 45° above the first, and both parallel
to it. These latter circles represent the lines in which the

hand without difficulty passing from c on the left back to b
on the right, while the left may pass from o to b. These
movements are reversed and made inward when the hand
is to be placed upon the breast or other part of the body.
Fourth.-A mere swing of the arm, even though it is in
a curved line, and though it is in itself ever so graceful,
does not accomplish the most important objects of gesture.
In general, there should be a point, at which the gesture
of the hand should abruptly terminate. This remark ap-
plies more particularly however to the movement in the
vertical circles. And the points at which the gestures of
the hand should thus terminate are the points at which
these vertical and transverse circles cut each other. Allow-
ing the right hand then occasionally to cross the body to
the circle z C R, and also to be thrown back, as it some-
times is, to the circle z b R, there is presented the following
regular system of gestures, depending on the position of the
arm and hand at the time the gesture terminates, each of
which will be designated by a name for convenience of
future reference, and illustrated by a figure.

With regard to these positions, though thus mathemati-
cally defined, the learner will understand, that an approxi-
mation to the points designated in Fig. 25 is all that is
intended. The gesture should doubtless terminate as near
these points as convenient; though any apparent care in
regard to this is to be avoided; and especially would the
following of the hands by the eye, as if to assist in adjust-
ing the gesture, be a great fault.
To complete this system of positions of the arm, there
should be added its positions in a state of rest, (see Fig.
13, p. 234;) and when pointing to the zenith. (See Fig.
41.)
Fig. 41.
It should be added, that for every position
we have giveħ of the right hand, there is a
corresponding one for the left; and also that
both hands may be brought into these posi-
tions at the same time.-To indicate still
further the variety of gestures of which this
system furnishes the basis, it may be re-
marked that those already noticed have ex-
clusive reference to the relative position of
the hand at the termination of the gesture,
without regard to the extent of the sweep
by which the arm has been brought to this
position, or to the direction or the rapidity
of its movement.—And still further, these gestures have
been designated with reference to the direction of the hand
from the centre of the breast of the speaker, without regard
to the degree to which the arm is extended. In the system
of figures just given, (see Figs. 26-40,) the boldest posi
tions were delineated, suited to excited and stirring elo-
quence; whereas the colloquial elevations of the arm, as

they may be called, are much less strongly marked. For
examples of these moderate positions, see Figs. 42, 43, 44;

of these positions is, that the arm is held nearer to the side,
and the elbow is more bended.*
Errors in the Positions of the Arms.
1. All constrained movements of the arm, proceeding
only from the elbow; with the opposite fault of throwing
the arm out straight and rigid.—These are both opposed to
*NOTE TO THE TEACHER.-The improvement of the learner
here, as elsewhere in many other parts of this Manual, depends
entirely on practice, and on such a familiarity as will make these
movements seem to him more natural than any others, when he
comes to the exercise of speaking. This may be successfully ac-
complished by a course of training something like the following:-
Let a class, or section of a class, take their position in the floor,-
all occupying the second position of the right foot, with the hands
at rest. Then,
*
1. Let them present the natural state of the right hand in several
of these positions of the arm; while the left hand remains at rest.
2. Let the same be done with the left hand,—carefully observing
the position of the fingers, both in the hand which is employed in
gesture and in that which is at rest.-Let these exercises be con-
tinued, till the perfect command of the fingers is acquired in the
various positions of the arm.
3. Direct special attention to the positions of the arms, both right
and left, while the learner passes through the positions regularly,
as laid down in the system.-In Fig. 25, the Roman letters mark
the points to which the right hand may be directed; those which
the left hand alone can reach are marked with Italics; while all the
points o, f, and c, are reached in common by both hands.
4. When these positions taken regularly can all be executed with
sufficient ease and grace, then the learner may be required to pass
from one to another indiscriminately, with reference to making the
transitions gracefully and in curved lines, instead of passing from
the one to the other in a straight line, by the shortest course.
5. The learner may be required to distinguish, in his preliminary
practice, between the colloquial gestures, or those of moderate ex-
tent, and the bolder gestures which bear the same name, suited to
the drama and the more elevated efforts of the orator.
Other exercises will suggest themselves to the teacher. When,
as in this case, habits of action are to be formed, he need not fear
varying or repeating the exercise too much.

255
freedom; and while the former is feeble in its expression,
the latter is mechanical and awkward.
2. All movements of the arm which cause the hand to
describe straight lines or angles, instead of curves. Some
such movements may be sufficiently significant, and as such
may be employed; but they have little of grace or beauty
to recommend them.
3. The employment of any other lines of gesture than those
already pointed out; or the too frequent use of any one or
two of these, either vertical or transverse, to the neglect of
the others. The former is inexpressive; the latter will not
only often be inexpressive, but must also be monotonous
and tiresome.
▬▬▬▬▬▬▬▬
4. The inward sweep of the arm, instead of the outward,
downward, or upward.—When the arm moves in the trans-
verse curves, the movement of the hand should be clearly
outward from the body; and when it moves in the vertical
lines, its movement should be downward or upward, but
not inward. The inward sweep of the arm is called for
only when the hand is to be placed upon some part of the
body; unless perhaps it may incline slightly inward in the
cross gesture.
5. The disregard of the points at which the gesture should
terminate.-Indefinite sweeps of the arm are but unmeaning
flourishes, which more frequently disgust than please.
6. The too frequent use of the cross gestures.—The only
use of this gesture is to call attention to objects on the other
side of the speaker from that of the arm employed, or in the
expression of antithetic ideas; and in neither case should
the arm often rise above the downward cross gesture.
As in the First Part of this Manual, so here, will the
attentive learner be struck with the extent of nature's pro-

vision for the production of variety in the means of adding
to the effect of mere verbal expression. Already must it
be perfectly obvious, that there never can be occasion for
the dull repetition of the same gesture, or of any uniform
succession of gestures. The principles however on which
this variety is secured, will be much more fully developed
in the next chapter.

PRACTICAL APPLICATION.
257
CHAPTER II.
PRACTICAL APPLICATION OF PRINCIPLES.
THE Symbols by the aid of which sentiment and feeling
are enforced, whether they belong to the tones or to the
gestures, can be judiciously applied only by study and
care. Even if it should appear that nature has in any in-
stance made an orator without these, no one ought in his
own case to make this an occasion of relying solely on the
uninstructed and unaided impulses of nature.
All are not
equally gifted. Few who have attained any considerable
degree of excellence, but have had to cultivate their natural.
powers by diligent application and persevering effort; nor
will he who has any just estimate of the value of the prize
to be secured, complain of the price by which alone it can
be bought.
The chief object of these instructions is to train the orator,
and not the actor. Hence we place at the foundation of
all effective action-real feeling. To this we attach so
much importance, as to allow that it will compensate many
of the smaller blemishes of delivery, and many departures
from the rules of strict propriety in action. But the learner
should understand, that there is no incongruity between
feeling and the highest grace in action. To secure the
latter however, when the feelings are enlisted in the thought
and the occasion, habits of graceful gesture must have been
previously formed; and these must be formed by private
practice. In this way also, personal defects may often be
concealed, by a judicious selection from among the various
positions and gestures allowed.
For the purpose of aiding the learner in his preliminary
practice, I shall show in the several sections of this chapter
22*

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
how the elements of gesture already described can be best-
applied to practice, so as to conform to the decisions of
good taste, and to the usage of our best speakers.
SECTION I.
INTRODUCTORY MOVEMENTS.
THE importance of the introductory movements of the
public speaker will appear from two brief considerations.
First, it is from these the audience receive their first im-
pressions of the speaker. If he is a stranger, they have
nothing else from which to judge of the man. Secondly,
their minds are then perfectly free to criticise his manner,
since they are not supposed to be occupied by any thing
else. These movements then demand special attention.
He should omit no proper mode of expressing respect for
those before him, and of bespeaking their favor. Affecta-
tion or display are peculiarly inappropriate at this time,
when the air of modesty alone can please.
In general terms, so far as movement and gesture are
concerned, the orator should present himself to the audience
modestly, and without any show of self-confidence; at the
same time that he avoids obsequiousness, and every thing
opposed to true dignity and self-respect. His countenance
should be composed, and he should look at those before
him without any approach to a stare; nor hasten to com-
mence his speech, which should seem to be dictated by a
consciousness of its importance.
First, then, with suitable deliberation, and with a step of
but moderate length, he should take his position; and if,
from his first appearance, his face is not directed to the
audience, he should bring himself into his position by a

gentle sweep, rather than turn abruptly on his heel or by a
swing of the body.
Secondly, the bow, which is the most marked and ap-
propriate symbol of respect, should be made while the
speaker advances to the first position of the right foot. This
is specially important in the case of the opening bow: the
final bow, before leaving the stage, may be made with the
left foot advanced, if such is his position on closing his
speech.
Thirdly. In the graceful bow, (1) there
should be a gentle bend of the whole
body; (2) the equilibrium of the body
should be so adjusted as not to throw the
weight of the body forward upon the ball
of the foot; (3) the eyes should not be per-
mitted to fall below those of the persons ad-
dressed; and (4) the arms should slightly
incline forward and inward, as they naturally
do when the body is bent, but without any
apparent voluntary effort.-This position is
represented in Fig. 45.
Fourthly, in the act of returning to the erect position,
from the introductory bow, the speaker should fall back
into the second position of the advanced foot. In this posi-
tion, without any delay, he commences speaking. Indeed
the address Mr. President," or "Mr. Speaker," when
it occurs, may be pronounced while in the act of falling
back into this the speaking attitude.*

*NOTE TO THE TEACHER. In the training of the pupil, the bow
may at this stage of his progress be combined with the exercise on
the changes of the positions of the feet. As he advances from any
of the positions, let him occasionally be directed-to advance with
the bow and then fall immediately back into the speaking attitude.
In case of a class, this may be done by sections, till a good degree

SECTION II.
OF MOTION AND REST.
WHILE engaged in the act of speaking, there is no such
thing as a rest of the entire person. The motion however
is not indiscriminate; hence we here bring together some
general remarks on the principles by which the action of
the speaker is to be regulated. The outline we here draw
will be left to be filled up by the taste and good sense of
the speaker.
As regards the Feet, there are two opposite errors,-that
of keeping them too fixed and immovable, and that of too
great restlessness. The only movements, as we have seen,
allowed in ordinary declamation, are advancing and retir-
ing. The speaker should advance in the more earnest
parts of the declamation, while he retires only in the less
animated parts, and at the close of the paragraphs. The
point at which the speaker advances, should be when the
hand is brought into one of the front positions, on some
emphatic word; and the paragraphic rest should always be
made with the feet in the second position, either of the right
or the left foot.
Of the Head and Trunk, it may be remarked, that they
have but a slight motion, except merely in sympathy with
of correctness is acquired; then let them, one by one, in presence of
the class, enter upon the stage, present themselves to the audience,
fall back into the speaking attitude, retire, advance, &c., under the
direction of the teacher. This makes the learner familiar with the
stage, and gives him a power of self-possession, which can, it is
believed, in no other way be so readily acquired. This may be fol-
lowed by the rehearsal of very short pieces-mere paragraphs, for
the purpose of training him to the introductory movements, and to
entering upon and leaving the stage with ease and grace.-The
study of the next two sections will prepare him for practice on
longer pieces, after he shall be fully exercised in these more ele-
mentary lessons.

the arms and lower limbs. Embarrassment sometimes
keeps the body fixed like a post, and makes the head mo-
tionless. These are faults; and so also are all writhings
of the body, shrugging of the shoulders, and sudden turn-
ing and jerking of the head, as well as all gestures of the
head for the enforcing of sentiment, when not accompanied
with the hand.
The Eyes and Countenance of the speaker are always to
be employed. It is by these that an audience conceives
itself able to read the real feelings of the speaker, and to
judge of his sincerity. While in the act of speaking, the
eye of the speaker should search out the eye of every hearer,
to give to his address the character of a personal appeal;
but without being fixed on any one so as to call the atten-
tion of others to him as the subject of remark. This cau-
tion is particularly necessary, when employing the language
of invective or public censure, lest individuals should be
offended with the idea of being publicly held up as exam-
ples of the vices condemned. Even during the rests of the
voice, and particularly during the emphatic pauses, the eye
and countenance of the orator are full of expression. That
which is uttered after such pause receives a part of its im-
pressiveness from the idea that it comes forth warm from
the heart, the very operations of which have been seen in
the countenance and the gesture.
Of the movements of the Hands and Arms I shall speak
more at length; and for this purpose shall devote to them
the next section. Here however it may be remarked, that
the arms and hands of the speaker, when not employed in
gesture, should hang freely by the side, without the action
of a muscle. When entering upon the stage then, and till
they are called into requisition for gesture, the young de-
claimer is simply "to let them alone." If he can succeed
-

in doing this, the idea of awkwardness, so far as they are
concerned, will occur only to himself. At the close of the
last gesture, likewise, prior to the termination of a piece or
paragraph, the hands should fall to rest by the side. Thus
it appears that the rest of the hand, after it has once been
raised in gesture, has a meaning, not less than any other
action.

OF THE MOVEMENTS OF THE HANDS AND ARMS.
1. Of the hand to be employed.-A full development of
this subject will involve a brief reference to a variety of
circumstances connected with delivery. When the speaker
is reading the sentiments of another from the page of a
book, the book should be held in the left hand, directly in
front of the breast, and some six inches from the body; and
should be so far depressed as not to conceal from the audi-

Fig. 47. ence the face of the reader.
Any gesture made by the
reader thus embarrassed, must
be made with the right hand;
and even this hand, when not
needed for purposes of ges-
ture, may gently touch the
margin or corner of the book,
to assist in turning over the
leaves. (See Fig. 46.) In
reading an original compo-
sition, more gesture is ex-
pected, but yet it must be confined to the right hand.
(See Fig. 47.) In either case the eyes should be taken
from the book as often as possible without producing

embarrassment; and this should be done particularly at the
close of the periods.—Any paper which the orator may
choose to hold should be held in the left hand; and except
in cases of marked energy, this hand thus employed should
not be used in gesture; and then, never except in connec-
tion with the other.-In reading from a manuscript, as in
the pulpit, the left hand should rarely be used.
Even in ordinary delivery, when both hands are free,
the right hand takes the decided precedence in gesture. It
will be sufficient, therefore, to enumerate some of the occa-
sions on which the left hand may be employed. The mat-
ter of the oration may furnish occasion for the use of the
left hand. When, in narrative or descriptive pieces, dif-
ferent persons or things are represented as variously dis-
posed, or as occupying different positions, the hands may
be alternately employed; also when there is antithesis in
the sentiment, or even in the structure of the sentences.
On introducing a new argument, or on presenting some
new point of discussion, after one in which the right hand
has been for considerable time employed, the left hand may
even take the principal gesture. Such alternation of the
hands, however, should not be frequent; nor should the
gestures of the left hand be long continued.
The situation of the speaker may also lead to the employ-
ment of the left hand,—as when the persons addressed are
on his left side. This may occur on the stage; and will
often occur both at the bar and in halls of legislation, where
the judges and the jury, in the one case, and the chair and
the house, in the other,-are to be addressed. The one or
the other of these will often be at the speaker's left hand.
So with the preacher, who wishes to address himself par-
ticularly to that portion of his hearers who are on his left.-
Variety may occasionally though rarely lead to the use of

the left hand; as may also the attitude of the speaker.
Thus, when in earnest gesture, the left foot is projected
forward, as it must be, if in such case it is found to be the
free foot; or when, in starting back, the right foot has left
the other far in advance, it would be improper to use the
right hand for the principal gesture
Fig. 48.
Fig. 49.
Fig. 50.
Both hands may be employed at the same time, in earnest
appeal, in expressing the ideas of extent or vastness, and
often in animated poetic recitation. In such cases, if the
persons addressed are precisely in front of the speaker, the
gestures of the two hands will correspond, and will be ex-
actly similar, (see Figs. 48, 49;) but if the body of the
speaker is presented a little obliquely, which is deemed
more graceful, then the right hand is usually more elevated
or more advanced than the left, (see Figs. 34, 50,)—that
of the one being called the principal, that of the other the
subordinate gesture.
2. Of Gesture as Principal and Subordinate.-When
both hands are employed in gesture, as just intimated, the
one is usually more advanced or more elevated than the

than
other. Either hand may take the precedence, though this
honor is more generally conferred upon the right hand.
The hand which performs the principal gesture is called the
advanced, and the other the retired hand. The subordinate
gesture frequently imitates that of the other hand, and is
always in the same direction with it; but is more moderate
and reserved. The employment of both hands thus is
peculiarly graceful, and is more forcible and expressive
than the use of either hand alone. From the part which
this subordinate gesture performs, it is not inaptly compared,
by Austin, to the accompaniment in music.
3. Of the Accompaniments of Gesture.-The subordi-
nate gesture is one of the accompaniments of the principal.
But there are other accompaniments to be attended to.
The movements of the lower limbs, of the body, and of the
head must all join in harmony with the principal gesture
of the hand; otherwise the movement will be but a mere
imitation of nature. And even though the body and limbs
should move in perfect concert, while the countenance
should remain unmoved and unexcited, the entire action
would be but that of a well-contrived automaton. With
all of these at perfect command, and employed in harmony
with the diversified melodies of the voice, nothing
can be wanting for the enforcement of either thought or
feeling.
4. Of Gesture as Preparatory and Terminating.-Every
act of gesture consists of two parts-the preparatory and
the terminating movement. The last is that for which the
gesture is made; and the former is but the preliminary
movement, which of necessity precedes it. The collected
state of the hand, for example, belongs exclusively to the
preparatory part of gesture. Again, the hand cannot be
brought downward in emphatic expression, till it has been
23

266
MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
elevated. The elevation of the arm and hand, then, is the
preparatory part of such a gesture. Though, in one sense,
this is entirely a subordinate part of gesture, yet on it de-
pend essentially the force as well as the grace of its termi-
nation. It must be executed, neither too early, so as to
leave the arm too long suspended; nor too late, so as to
make the gesture short and hurried. It should appear easy
and natural, be made in curved rather than in straight lines,
and should seem to be prompted, as indeed it ought to be,
by the rising thought.-The terminating part of most ges-
tures furnishes an example of what is called the stroke of
the gesture.
5. Of the Emphatic Stroke and Time of Gesture.-When
speaking of the voice in the first part of this work, Em-
phasis was defined,-The expressive but occasional dis-
tinction of syllables, and consequently of the words of
which they form a part. It is perfectly obvious, that every
mode of giving emphasis by the voice should be suscepti-
ble of being accompanied by gesture. Such is the case;
but not every form of emphasis can receive enforcement by
the same gesture. For example, in those forms of emphasis
of which quantity is the chief element, the hand moves in
the horizontal curves, or rises towards the zenith; whereas
in all the forms in which short quantity prevails, the move-
ment is downward, and in the vertical circles. Even in
those forms of emphasis which require long quantity, the
accompanying movement varies with the point at which the
stress is laid. In the Median emphasis, the gesture may
have no abrupt termination; while in the Vanishing em-
phasis, the gesture terminates abruptly, though with a full
extension of the arm outward or upward; and not, as in the
Radical emphasis, with a descent to one of the points de-
signated.


## p. 267 (#277) ############################################

GESTURES-THE HAND AND ARM. 267
It is to gestures which have an abrupt termination, and
particularly to such as accompany the radical stress, that
the remarks under this head are devoted. The instrument
with which gesture is made is compound-consisting of the
upper arm, the fore arm, and the hand; and each of these
has an independent motion. When the arm is brought
down in gesture, it does not, therefore, fall as though it had
only an articulation at the shoulder; but the upper arm
first falls into its position, then the fore arm, and then the
hand and fingers. This finishes the gesture, and marks its
complete termination; and this action of the hand is called
the stroke of the gesture. This is susceptible of every de-
gree of force, according to the velocity with which the
hand has moved, and the extent through which it has
passed; and should correspond, both as to time and energy,
with the vocal emphasis, so that the emphatic distinction.
given to any syllable by gesture may fall upon the eye at
the same point of time with the greatest stress of the voice,
and, as regards energy of expression, harmonize with it.
This requires care, as to the preparatory gesture, that it
be not commenced too soon, nor deferred too late; yet such
is the sympathy between the feeling, the vocal expression,
and the action, that when once the command of all the
elements of expression has been acquired, and freedom of
feeling and action has been secured by well-directed prac-
tice, there will rarely be any jarring between them: the feel-
ing will find a ready and adequate expression, both in the
voice and in the accordant gesture.
6. Of Gesture as Significant and not Significant.—The
pointing of the index finger, the placing of the finger on the
eye, the laying of the hand on the head or on the breast,
would be examples of significant gestures. Gestures may
be significant by nature, or may become so by convention.


## p. 268 (#278) ############################################

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
The other class of gestures though less imposing are
more important. Of these, Austin says,-"They differ
from the others, because they may be used in any part of
an oration, and belong to every character of style and
speaking, and are as it were the elements and roots of
ges-
ture, which by their combinations produce its whole power
of language and expression. These constitute the compo-
nent parts of every style of delivery, whether tame or vehe-
ment, argumentative or diffuse, ardent or indifferent, cold
or pathetic." To this class belong the gestures of which
we are chiefly speaking in this section,—all indeed which
are recognised in Fig. 25, and still further represented by
Figs. 26-40.—More will be said of the significant ges-
tures in the Appendix.
7. Transition of Gesture.-When the hand has once
been brought into action in gesture, instead of dropping to
the side, and then being brought up again for a similar
purpose, it should generally remain in its position till re-
lieved by the other hand, or till it passes into a state of pre-
paration for a succeeding gesture. The term transition
may be applied to the passing thus from any one gesture to
another—whether from one principal gesture to another of
the same hand, or from the gesture of one hand to that of
the other. The rules for such transitions have been given.
The term is however used in a sense more analogous with
the same term as applied to the voice, when it is made to
refer to such changes as arise from transitions in the senti-
ment, whether they are sudden and abrupt; or more
gradual, like those which take place in the regular progress
of a discourse. At this point, it need only be remarked,
that these last-named transitions of gesture should never be
made, except when dictated by such transitions of thought
and sentiment as call for corresponding changes in the

269
vocal expression. Transitions, then, in the management
of the voice, and in gesture, are regulated by the same
principles.*
SECTION IV.
OF THE QUALITIES OF GESTURE.t
FROM what has been said, it is obvious, that we may
with propriety speak of different styles of gesture, suited to
different objects and occasions. The better to understand
the characteristic difference of these styles, we proceed to
enumerate the Qualities on which such difference depends.
Those qualities in which the excellence of gesture consists
are, Magnificence, Boldness, Energy, Variety, Simplicity,
Grace, Propriety, and Precision. These will be briefly
noticed, with an allusion to the imperfections to which they
are opposed.
1. Magnificence of Gesture—is secured by perfect free-
dom of movement. The arm moves from the shoulder,
and the hand is carried through an ample space. The head
moves freely, the body is erect, and the step is free and
* At this point, the attentive learner is prepared successfully to
prosecute privately, to any extent, the preparation for his public
declamations. First, he should apply the principles of expression
to the reading of the selected piece,—at the same time employing
with care the suitable emphases and forms of cadence. Secondly,
he should study the gestures best suited to all its different parts.
Thirdly, when well committed, he should rehearse it by himself-
in his study, in the woods, or, like Demosthenes, by the sea-shore;
nor need he stop till his execution equals his ideas of excellence,
though he may repeat it a thousand times over. Such practice
on a single piece well chosen, will benefit the learner more than
the mere repetition upon the stage of volumes of the most eloquent
matter ever issued from the press.
Little more is attempted in this section, than to condense the
views of Austin, as set forth in Chap. xx. of the Chironomia.

firm. Opposed to this are contracted gestures, constrained
motions, short steps, and doubtful and timid movements.
2. Boldness of Gesture—is exhibited in striking but un-
expected positions, movements, and transitions. It is the
offspring of a daring self-confidence, which ventures to
hazard any action which it is conceived may either illus-
trate or enforce. The courage thus to execute is only
valuable, when under the guidance of good taste.—The
opposite of this is tameness, which hazards nothing, is
distrustful of its powers, and produces no great effect.
3. Energy of Gesture-consists in the firmness and deci-
sion of the whole action; and these depend very materially
on the precision with which the stroke of the gesture is
made to support the voice in marking the emphasis. Let
bad habits be overcome, and a ready command of all the
elements of gesture be acquired, then will energy of ges-
ture be the necessary result of a clear head and a warm
heart.--Its opposites are feebleness and indecision.
4. Variety of Gesture-consists in the adapting of ges-
ture to the condition and ever-varying sentiment of the
speaker; so as to avoid a too frequent recurrence of the
same gesture, or the same set of gestures.-It is opposed
both to sameness of gesture, and to mechanical variety.
5. Simplicity of Gesture-is perfectly free and unaffected,
and appears to be the natural result of the situation and
sentiments of the speaker,-presenting evidence neither of
studied variety nor of reserve.--Its opposite is affectation.
6. Grace of Gesture-is the result of all other perfec-
tions; arising from a dignified self-possession of mind, and
the power of personal exertion practiced into facility after
the best models, and according to the truest taste. This
usually therefore depends more on art than on nature; and
has more to do with pleasing the fancy than with producing

QUALITIES OF GESTURE.
271
conviction. It suggests not a single movement, but sim-
ply preserves the gestures employed for other purposes from
all awkwardness.-The opposites of this are awkwardness,
vulgarity, or rusticity.
7. Propriety of Gesture-always indicates some obvious
connection between the sentiment and the action. It im-
plies the use of such gestures as are best suited to illustrate
or to express the sentiment; and thus often calls into use
the significant gestures.-The opposite of this is solecism in
gesture, implying the recurrence of false, contradictory, or
unsuitable gestures.
8. Precision of Gesture-arises from the just preparation,
the due force, and the correct timing of the action. The
stroke of the gesture must not only fall on the emphatic
syllable, but its force must exactly suit the character of the
sentiment and the speaker. This gives the same effect to
action, that neatness of articulation does to speech.—The
opposites are--gestures which distract the attention, while
they neither enforce nor illustrate the sentiment. Such are
most of those which consist in a mere swing of the arm,
while the stroke of the gesture is wanting.
The Styles of gesture, for all practical purposes, may be
reduced to three; the Epic, the Rhetorical, and the Collo-
quial.
The Epic Style is suited to the delivery of tragedy, epic
poetry, and sublime description; and calls into requisition
all the qualities of gesture just enumerated. Boldness is
peculiar to this style of gesture, and magnificence is rarely
admissible elsewhere; hence these qualities are seldom ex-
hibited but in the theatre.
The Rhetorical Style requires energy, variety, simplicity,
and precision; and cannot be exhibited in its highest per-

fection, without grace of action. This is the style of oratory
-whether in the pulpit, in the senate, or at the bar.
The Colloquial Style is the opposite of the Epic. The
gestures of the hand, when employed, proceed mainly from
the elbow, and exhibit only the qualities of simplicity and
grace, except so far as precision will follow as a matter of
course. The emphasis however is more frequently marked
by a moderate nod of the head, than by the movements of
the hand. This style is employed in the intercourse of
polite society, and by persons who deliver lectures in the
sitting posture. The principal dependence, in such cases,
for the effect required, is on the countenance, the direction
of the eye, and the intonation of the voice.

CHAPTER III.
GENERAL PRECEPTS.
SECTION I.
OF THE FREQUENCY, MODERATION, AND INTERMISSION OF GESTURE.
GESTURE is valuable, only as it illustrates or enforces
sentiment. It requires then to be managed with great dis-
cretion, lest it seem to take the lead of sentiment, or con-
flict with its expression. The absence of gesture is to be
preferred to either of these; and this, it is presumed, is the
cause why so little gesture is used among speakers who
have not studied the art sufficiently to acquire a confidence
in their skill in its employment. The speaking without
gesture, or the uttering of exciting sentiments with only the
gestures which belong to the colloquial style, is an unna-
tural phenomenon-a violent sundering of what nature's
earliest and strongest dictates have joined together. The
cause of such unnatural disruption, if carefully sought for,
will probably be found in the almost total neglect of this
branch of elocution in our schools, connected with the idea
which most young speakers have, that it is better to use
little or no gesture, than to attempt the employment of an
agent whose power they have never learned to wield. To
avoid the practical errors, then, of speaking without action,
or of using too feeble a style of action, the young speaker
needs nothing but first to have the full command of the
elements of gesture, and then to have his mind strongly
imbued with the principles by which he should be guided
in their employment. It is to the further development of
these principles, that this chapter is devoted.

:-
One may be in possession of all the elements of the most
effective and graceful system of gesture, and yet fail in ap-
plying them to practice. The gesture may be varied, grace-
ful, and appropriate; and yet fail of its legitimate effect,
from being too frequent or too violent. An important gene-
ral precept may be given in regard to both these errors,
viz. that the orator should never for a moment seem to
lose his self-possession, or to forget the respect due to the
audience whom he is endeavoring to instruct or persuade.
Constant action of such a character as to attract any atten-
tion, is not required even on the stage. Dr. Gregory says
of Garrick, He used less action than any performer I
"" The orator then may well put himself on his
guard against all excess both as to frequency and violence.
By so doing, he will preserve his own dignity and secure
the respect of his audience, at the same time that he will
be able to keep the command of himself. With only mo-
derate gestures, accompanied with moderate tones of the
voice, the passions of the speaker can never get beyond his
control.
ever saw.
1. To be more particular, gesture should be in accord-
ance with the character of the speaker.-With the actor, the
character may be assumed; and the action may thus vary
as the assumed character varies. The orator, except when
for a moment he would personate another, always appears
in his own his true character; and he should use caution
never to transcend the standard of manly decorum which
he deems suitable to himself. This standard however
should be fixed with reference to the age of the speaker,
and to his position in society;-more vivacity and variety
being allowed in the young speaker than with one who is
aged, or in the pleader at the bar than with the judge on
the bench. Within this outermost limit of propriety fixed
氯

275
by the speaker's idea of decorum, there are many stages.
The gesture of the same speaker may then vary with his
feelings, never transcending them, even though he sup-
poses them below the interest of his subject. The voice
also, as the best index of the feelings, should do much to
regulate the action. If it be languid and dull, it will be
in vain to attempt any thing like energy or brilliancy in the
action. So also the sentiment and the style of the language
employed may determine the frequency and energy of the
action, within the limits prescribed.
2. The orator should adapt his style of gesture to the
character of his audience.-This is so obvious as scarcely to
need illustration. An address to a popular assembly admits
a boldness of action, which would be considered entirely
out of place in one delivered to a prince, or in an argument
before a bench of judges. The animated popular harangue
admits a style of gesture bordering on the very extreme
limit to which decorum allows the speaker to proceed.
3. The orator should vary his style of gesture, with the
objects of his address.-Abstract reasoning and demonstra-
tion have nothing to do with oratory; and just so far as the
speaker makes his address to the understanding alone, so
far may he discard all the aids of rhetorical action. The
syllogisms of the logician, mere naked evidences of facts,
and law arguments, would be examples of appeal to the
understanding alone; and any considerable action would
in these cases be entirely out of place. Facts, statistics,
the details of calculation and finance, evidence, law, and
logical deductions, occupy a prominent place at the bar
and in the business of legislation; and just so far as these
exclude appeals to the feelings, and to the heart, gesture is
unimportant. Only that of the most limited kind is called
into requisition. Of the same character also are those ser-

mons or portions of sermons in which the doctrinal points
of Christianity are discussed and explained, where fidelity
and precision are chiefly requisite.-But if persuasion be
the object, as in most appeals from the pulpit, as on
many occasions which arise in the senate, and as is gene-
rally the case, when the advocate wishes to influence the
opinions of a jury, then will the orator use more graceful,
more flowing, and more various gesture. Feeling and
imagination constitute the only basis of gesture. In the
absence of these, it follows, then, that action should be
wholly intermitted. This may occur with a transition in
the sentiment, in the very midst of a discourse, and after
the hands may have been fully employed in action. Such
intermission of gesture is usually preceded by a para-
graphic rest. All action of the hands and arms may like-
wise be intermitted during a burst of rapid utterance, or in
the expression of deep and overwhelming emotion, as in
despair and inconsolable grief. In the one case, the ges-
ture cannot be effectually applied, for want of time for the
preparatory movements; and in the other, the soul seems,
in giving expression to its wo, to disdain all art, relying
solely on the tones of the voice and the expression of the
countenance, sometimes even refusing the aid of words.
Action would be as inappropriate at such times, as its ab-
sence would be in giving utterance to the active passions.
A more particular application of some of these principles
to the different parts of a discourse will be presented in the
next section.

SECTION II.
OF GESTURE AS CONNECTED WITH THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF A
DISCOURSE.
ALL discourses are not alike in their structure and ar-
rangement; hence no technical rules can be laid down-
such as can be applied by the speaker in any instance with-
out thought and reflection. But yet, all discourses have a
beginning and an end, and consist mainly of an introduction,
of narrative or explanation, of argumentation, of appeals to
the feelings, and of a conclusion. These are not all found
in all discourses; nor do they always occur in the same
order. In orations, sermons, lectures, and even popular
harangues,—indeed almost everywhere except in delibera-
tive bodies where the speaker is well known, and may
have previously addressed his fellow members on the
subject in hand, there will be with rare exceptions
something like an introduction, more deliberate and unim-
passioned than that which follows; and a conclusion, dif-
fering somewhat from that part which has preceded. If
the discourse has been mainly argumentative, then the
conclusion or peroration may, and generally will, be the
most impressive part. If, on the contrary, it has consisted
mainly of an exciting appeal, the conclusion may partake
rather of the nature of an address to the judgment, lest the
audience should too suddenly forget why they had been
moved.
In no speech, or discourse, does the orator change his
own character, in the sense in which an actor may do it.
Yet in a practical and very important sense he may change
his character. As a reasoner, engaged in the more deli-
berate parts of his discourse, he sustains a relation to his
audience quite different from that which he bears, as the
24

exciter of their passions and the mover of their hearts.
Consistency of character does not then demand a perfect uni-
formity in the gestures of the orator. Neither does the real
character of an audience change in any very literal sense,
during the delivery of a discourse; and yet practically
there is a change. Two distinct assemblies can scarcely
differ more, than the same audience when curiously
listening for the first time to the opening accents of a
speaker's voice, and when again they sit absorbed in
thought, their judgments convinced by his reasonings, and
their feelings swayed and moved in perfect sympathy with
his own.
If we refer to the objects of the address, it is the
same. Almost every discourse has, or should have, some
leading object in view; and yet this is perfectly consistent
with a series of subordinate objects-extending from the
first effort to conciliate the feelings of those whom the
speaker addresses, onward to the last impression which he
would leave on the minds of his audience.-No one of the
principles, then, developed in the last section, requires that
the gestures be uniform throughout a discourse.
Of the matter of the introduction to a discourse, it is
not my purpose to speak. But, obviously, the introduction
should have for its object to conciliate the audience, to be-
speak their favor, to secure their attention, or to prepare
them to receive the impression the speaker wishes to make.
In an introduction, these objects may all be united; nor can
any of them be better secured than by an air of simple
modesty on the part of the speaker. No mark of respect
should be overlooked. The low pitch and the small
volume of voice heretofore recommended are indicative of
such respect; and his entire action should accord with this
feeling. The eye should rather be downcast, than staring;
the countenance should be composed; and as to gesture,

279
there should be none or but very little, nor should that
transcend the colloquial style.
That part of a discourse devoted to narration, as in
pleadings at the bar; or to explication, as in most sermons,
has more of action, as it has more of earnestness; and more
freedom of gesture, as the feeling of modesty on the part
of the speaker becomes absorbed in the interest of his sub-
ject. In this, therefore, as also in the argumentative parts
of a discourse, the colloquial style of gesture will often
yield to the rhetorical; and the interest of the speaker, as
he approaches the conclusion of an argument, or the climax
of his successive trains of thought, will exhibit itself in a
freer movement of the arm, and a louder tone of voice.
The force and chief ornaments of gesture will be reserved
by the judicious speaker for those parts of his discourse
for which he reserves the brilliancy of language and of
thought; that is, for those parts which are intended to ap-
peal to the feelings of his audience. On these parts alone
can the orator's powers be fully exhibited; nor should any
attempt be made to protract the pathetic or exciting parts
of a discourse to any great length. Just so long, however,
as the voice and the language are in consonance with these
warm emotions, should the gesture remain free and uncon-
strained; and till we find the place from which boldness
and magnificence of language are excluded, there will be
no occasion to exclude even the epic style of gesture. The
proper occasions for its employment, however, are rare, and
from the nature of the case must be of short continuance.
In passing, it may be remarked, that every part of an
oration or other discourse may have its digressions; and
these, it is obvious, are to be pronounced with a voice and
gesture suited to their spirit, even though gesture be wholly
suspended by their recurrence. These, then, should but

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
rarely, perhaps never, occur in those parts which are ad-
dressed to the passions. These interruptions turn aside the
current of feeling, and give the subject of the emotion time
to rally his powers of resistance.
Of the conclusion, it may be sufficient to say, that the
gestures should correspond with its spirit-its matter, and
the feeling with which it is pronounced. It may, or may
not, be accompanied with gesture; and when it is, the ges-
ture may be more or less bold and free.-The final adjust-
ment of the hands to rest, at the close either of a paragraph
or a discourse, is most graceful, when immediately preceded
by a gesture of the right hand alone; and that, some other
than a cross gesture. The gesture of both hands, or even
the cross gesture of the right, should then be avoided as a
concluding gesture.

APPENDIX.
CHAPTER IV.
HINTS ON THE ELOCUTION ADAPTED TO THE PULPIT.
He who supposes that Elocution is to be studied for the
express purpose of producing a variety in the vocal move-
ments, and an amount of action in speaking, proportioned
to the profusion with which nature has furnished the ele-
ments of expression, has mistaken its object. The study
of Elocution has for its object to improve the taste and
correct the judgment as regards the extent to which into-
nation and gesture shall be carried, and also as to the kind
to be employed, as well as to furnish the materials from
which to make the selection. The principles of Elocution
are as necessary to teach one when to abstain from the
vocal expression of excited feeling and from action,
when to use them; and as necessary to direct him who
uses the least of oratorical expression, as him who uses the
most. "This art," says some one, speaking particularly
of gesture, "may serve the same excellent purpose to
the awkward gesticulator, for which the father sent his
clownish son to the dancing school, that he might learn to
stand still."
as
The just elocution of the pulpit, however, is as far re-
moved from a state of perfect inaction, as from the pas-
sionate and diversified action of the theatre. The latter, all
unite in condemning as unsuited to the true dignity of the
pulpit; while the former also is equally condemned by all

sensible men. Addison deemed it a just cause of com-
plaint, that the preachers of his time "stood stock still in
the pulpit, and would not so much as move a finger to set
off the best sermon in the world ;" at the same time that he
remarks on the "smooth continued stream" in which their
words flowed, and the "insipid serenity" of countenance
of their orators generally. Sheridan repeats the same
charge against the pulpit in particular; and says that on
this account, the greater part of the members of the
English church are either banished from their places of
worship through disgust, or reluctantly attend the service.
as a disagreeable duty." There must be an Elocution,
then, which is adapted to the pulpit,-which so harmonizes
with the place and with the subjects usually treated there,
as to please and gratify the eye, at the same time that the
ear is delighted with the melody of a well-trained voice.
To adopt the language of an old English divine,-" I ima-
gine, that through the regulations of taste, the improvements
of experience, the corrections of friendship, the feelings of
piety, and the gradual mellowings of time,-such an elocu-
tion may be acquired as is above delineated; and such as
when acquired will make its way to the hearts of the
hearers, through their ears and eyes, with a delight to both
that is seldom felt; whilst, contrary to what is commonly
practiced, it will appear to the former the very language of
nature, and present to the latter the lively image of the
preacher's soul." And with this same writer I will add,
"Were a taste for this kind of elocution to take place, it is
difficult to say how much the preaching art would gain
by it."
The PULPIT furnishes the best field for a powerful oratory,
that the world has ever seen. The themes it presents for
discussion are sufficiently various, and all of them involving

283
interests of the very highest moment-the interests not of
small portions of the audiences addressed, but "the uni-
versal and most important interests of mankind! far beyond
those for which the thunder of Demosthenes rolled in
Athens-far beyond those for which Cicero shook the
senate-house in Rome." The pulpit orator also enjoys a
freedom of selecting and adapting his subjects to the case
in hand, and to his own taste and powers, which is
scarcely found elsewhere; and these are such as to raise
him above the charge either of weakness or affectation,
however warm and ardent may be his appeals. Every one
knows that for him not to feel-would of itself prove him
unfit for the place he occupies. In proof of the inspiration
connected with the pulpit, many of the sermons which have
been preserved, in Latin, in English, and in French, are
enriched with all the taste of classic elegance; and as
specimens of written eloquence, have scarcely been sur-
passed or even equaled. It is fortunate for the church and
the world, as well as for the cause we advocate, that there
have also been in the church those who were masters of all
the arts of oral eloquence, from the Patriarch of Constanti-
nople,* who was himself the pupil of the most celebrated
rhetorician of his time, down through every age of pros-
perity in the church, even to the present day. The perfect
union of the chaste style of many of the English divines
with an action which shall give to him who effects it a dis-
anction equaled only by his usefulness, is an object which
well excite the emulation of some of the many young
may
men of our country, who, called by God to the sacred

office, are preparing themselves for the responsibilities of
their high calling.
But what are the peculiar elements that belong to the
Elocution of the Pulpit?-As regards the voice, very little
remains to be said here. The principles of vocal expres-
sion have been pretty fully discussed; and nothing can be
more obvious, than that the preacher should have the per-
fect command of every pitch of his voice, of every degree
of force, and of all the elements of expression. Still the
elements of dignity and energy should greatly predominate
in most of the exercises of the pulpit. Portions of almost
every sermon, however, should be pronounced with the
natural voice, and in the diatonic melody; while there
are occasions of frequent occurrence, on which the success
of the preacher's appeal depends entirely on the employ-
ment of the elements of Plaintiveness. Without these, he
can neither make others feel, nor make them believe that
he has feeling himself.-With only some further incidental
allusions to the voice, we shall devote the section to an
enumeration of a few of the principles by which the action
of the pulpit should be regulated.
In general it may be remarked, as regards the sermon
merely, that just as far as it partakes of the character of an
oration, or ordinary discourse, so far are all the suggestions
of the last chapter applicable to it. I choose, however, for
the purpose of making this subject strictly practical, to
extend my remarks so as to cover all the action of the
Christian minister, while in the house of God; and shall
reduce all I deem it important here to say, to a very few
general principles.
First. The preacher should studiously avoid every
thing in his manner, which can have a tendency to divert
the attention of his hearers either from the sacredness of the
-

285
occasion, or the matter of the subjects discussed.-The
most objectionable manner which he can assume, is that by
which he seems to make an effort to show off himself to
advantage. Thus if he enters the church, or ascends the
pulpit, or rises in it to address the assembly, with the air
of a fine gentleman, "as if he were practicing the lessons
of an assembly-room," his audience cannot but perceive the
incongruity, and lose their confidence in him as a divinely
inspired teacher.* For the same reason, any attempt to
adjust the hair or any part of the clothing is particularly
objectionable in the Christian minister. It suggests the
idea, that his thoughts are concerned about his personal
appearance. Nearly the same objection lies to the reading
of the hymn, or the performing of any of the other prelimi-
nary or closing exercises in a rhetorical manner, or with
any gesticulation; or to the employment, at any time, in the
pulpit, of theatrical action, such as folding the arms, and
the like. This appears like an attempt to display his ora-
torical powers; and is entirely at variance with the air of
modest dignity which should chiefly characterize these
exercises.†
* What!—will a man play tricks-will he indulge
A silly fond conceit of his fair form,
And just proportion, fashionable mien,
And pretty face, in presence of his God?
Or will he seek to dazzle me with tropes,
As with the diamond on his lily hand,
And play his brilliant parts before my eyes,
When I am hungry for the bread of life?
He mocks his Maker, prostitutes and shames
His noble office, and, instead of truth,
Displaying his own beauty, starves his flock.
-How a body so fantastic, trim,
And quaint, in its deportment and attire,
Can lodge a heavenly mind-demands a doubt.
Fenelon says,-"Sometime ago, I happened to fall asleep at a
sermon; and when I awaked, the preacher was in a very violent
Task.

MANUAL OF ELOCUTION.
There are a thousand other ways in which the preacher
may, by carelessness, or by habit, divert the attention of his
audience from the matter in hand. Dr. Porter says,—“ In
minor points, what constitutes decorum depends not on
philosophy nor accident, but on custom. From real or
affected carelessness on such points, the preacher may fix
on some trivial circumstance, that attention of his hearers,
which should be devoted to greater things. He may do
this, for example, by standing much too high, or too low in
the pulpit; by rising, as in the act of commencing his ser-
mon, before the singing is closed; or delaying for so long
an interval as to excite apprehension that something has
befallen him; by an awkward holding his Psalm-book, or
especially his Bible, with one side hanging down or doubled
backwards; by drawing his hands behind him, or thrusting
them into his clothes."-He will as certainly accomplish
this object, by adopting awkward and false attitudes, by
any unusual contortions of the features of the face, by fin-
gering the leaves of the Bible, by handling his handker-
chief too frequently, or by any other misuse of his hands.
For a specification of particulars under these heads, see
lists of errors appended to Sections III, IV, and V, of
Chap. I, Part II.
The voice of the speaker also may be instrumental in
turning aside the attention of the hearer. The commencing
on too low or too high a note; with too full or too feeble a
voice; the employment of a drawling manner, or of any
peculiar tones or quality of the voice; any unusual mode
of announcing the text, or the hymn, these are but a
agitation, so that I fancied, at first, he was pressing some important
point of morality. But he was only giving notice, that on the
Sunday following, he would preach on repentance.-I was ex-
tremely surprised to hear so indifferent a thing uttered with so
much vehemence."

few examples of the various ways in which the teacher
of divine truth may himself contribute to destroy the effect
of his own instructions.—Of the same character is the mis-
applied use of the Vocule,* as when heard at the close of
sentences in prayer, and sometimes in the delivery of ser-
mons from the pulpit, to the entire destruction of devotional
feeling in the heart of every one whose ear is not equally
insensible to all the beauties as well as the defects of
delivery.
Second. The preacher's manner should be characterized
by reverence and modesty. He should feel reverence for
the place, as the sanctuary of the Most High; and modesty,
as being what he is, only by grace. In view of the first
of these principles, "Gesture," in the language of Dr.
Porter, "is felt to be unseasonable in personating God,
and in addresses made to him. When we introduce him as
speaking to man, or when we speak of his adorable per-
fections, or to him in prayer, the sentiments inspired demand
composure and reverence of manner. Good taste then can
never approve the stretching upward of the hands at full
length, in the manner of Whitefield, at the commencement
of prayer; nor the frowning aspect and the repelling move-
ment of the hand, with which many utter the sentence of
the final judge, Depart, ye cursed,' &c." Good taste,
on the same general principle, also cannot fail to condemn
any thing like a low anecdote, or a jest, in the pulpit.
"Tis pitiful
To court a grin, when you should woo a soul:
To break a jest, when pity would inspire
* I have recently seen this characterized, in some one of our reli-
gious newspapers, as the "pious grunt." By whatever name
called, it cannot but be in a high degree offensive to any but the
most perverted taste.

Pathetic exhortation; and to address
The skittish fancy with facetious tales,
When sent with God's commission to the heart!
So did not Paul.
In regard to the last of these principles, Austin, himself
a clergyman, remarks:-" If, on ordinary occasions, and in
the common business of life, modesty of countenance and
manner be a commendable grace in a public speaker; such
modesty is much more to be desired, or is rather indispen-
sable, in the sacred orator. When he pours out the public
prayers to God, when he reads and expounds his laws; he
cannot fail to recollect, that he is himself equally obnoxious
to their sanctions, and equally in need of mercy as his con-
gregation; and that he kneels only as one among the sup-
plicants, and that he stands up only as one among the
guilty before his unerring judge. Vanity and presumption
in such a situation would be more than indecorous. Hu-
mility is the proper characteristic of a Christian minister."
"But this humility," it is very properly added, “is not
incompatible with earnestness of manner, nor with the just
confidence which every public speaker should appear to
have in the truth of what he delivers."
It is on this general principle, that the use of the free
Diatonic Melody, or of the strongly marked Downward
Slides, would be improper in the language of prayer, or in
reading or repeating the words in which God has chosen
to address mankind. It is thus that all personal invective,
whether by word or action, and every tone and look ex-
pressive of indignation, are excluded. It is on this ac-
count likewise, that all the artifices of the stage-
All attitude and stare
And start theatric, practiced at the glass,
are excluded from the sacred desk.
Cicero censures the-

289
atrical action even at the bar; how much less appropriate
is it to the pulpit! Even the orator's art is employed here,
only to give expression to real feeling. Every species of
cant or affectation is then excluded from the pulpit; and
why should it not be, when a firm belief in the truth of
the principles to be inculcated, and a serious feeling of
their importance, remove all necessity of any affectation,
either of voice or manner? Such belief and such feeling,
on the part of the preacher, says Dr. Blair, "will always
give an earnestness and strength, a fervor of piety to his
exhortations, superior in its effects to all the arts of studied
eloquence; and, without it, the assistance of art will seldom
be able to conceal the mere declaimer."
. Without the Christian sensibility here referred to, and
that expansion and elevation of soul which can arise only
from a just feeling of religious truth, it is admitted that all
the arts of elocution are vain to constitute a Christian
minister. These are presupposed, as at the very basis of
Christian oratory; since, without them, preaching, with
every attraction that can be thrown about it, will be but
"as sounding brass or a tinkling cymbal." It is, however,
perfectly consistent with this admission, that the religious
teacher should do all in his power to improve his taste and
judgment, as to the most effective means of giving expres-
sion to his feelings; and that he should train his voice to
the execution of all that a taste thus improved can direct.
And this can scarcely be done, but by the study of elocu-
tion according to some good system. Without such study,
Christian sensibility often expresses itself in an almost un-
broken Monotone, rendered perhaps still more offensive
by the constant employment of the Chromatic Melody, or
of the Tremor,-elements of great power when properly
employed, but never intended to be desecrated by constant

use.
Indeed the pulpit is very specially exposed to mo-
notony, while the dialogue of the stage almost effectually
excludes it; and even in the senate and at the bar, a free
colloquial style of delivery is much more naturally and
universally adopted.
Third. The preacher should never seem, by any pecu-
liarity of manner, to lose the command of himself.—In ad-
dition, then, to improving the taste and cultivating the voice
by study, the Christian orator should discipline his will to
a perfect self-possession. Calmness and collectedness of
manner alone seem accordant with the solemn grandeur of
his work. To such self-possession, a perfect command of
the gestures greatly contributes, because by restraining the
action when it is in danger of becoming excessive, a more
perfect control is preserved over the mental excitement; and
even aside from this, such restraint may conceal the strong
workings of passions, which though the speaker may feel,
it may not be expedient for him fully to express.
The action of the pulpit differs from that of the stage
only in degree. It is performed by the same beings, by the
use of the same instruments, and for the same general pur-
poses. It cannot, then, be expected to differ, in all respects,
from the action of the theatre; but only so far as it is put
forth under different conditions. One of these conditions,
and the one to which our attention is here chiefly directed,
is that the preacher is not at liberty to indulge in any
public expressions of excitement, which can properly be
construed into a violation of the principles of self-respect,
or of true dignity of character. Such, I conceive to be all
bawling and vociferation in the pulpit-a vice of pulpit
oratory always condemned, yet practiced by too many, re-
gardless alike of its destructive effects on themselves, and
of its unfitness for their purposes. Such also is the smiting

291
of the pulpit or the Bible with the hands, or stamping with
the feet; or, except under very special circumstances, weep-
ing so as to distort the countenance, or interrupt the regular
flow of delivery.-How different the effect of such exhibi-
tions, from that produced by the earnest but graceful action
of him who stands up in the true dignity of an ambassador
for Christ; and, while perhaps the manly tears may dim
his eye or fall in rapid succession over his cheek, yet with
firm and unfaltering voice, prays his fellow men in Christ's
stead to be reconciled to God!
I shall close these suggestions with a few words in re-
gard to the proper structure of pulpits. From time imme-
morial, both in England and in this country, the local
situation of the preacher has been any thing but favorable
for either the graces or energies of delivery. The state of
things in this respect is improving; and just as soon as the
principles of delivery are properly understood by those who
occupy our pulpits, will there be a universal change.—The
platform upon which the preacher stands, should be raised
only about as high as the breasts of the congregation; and
for extemporaneous delivery, all that is required farther is
a chair or sofa, and a table not sufficiently high to embarrass
the action of the speaker. The lights also should be mov-
able; and, if possible, should be so arranged as not to in-
terfere with the free action of the arms, even when in the
horizontal oblique or extended positions. Till our churches
shall be generally arranged according to some such plan,
our pulpit orators will have to modify their action to con-
form to the various situations in which they may be placed,
and sometimes almost wholly to refrain from gesture; or else
become themselves the subjects of unpleasant criticisms,
which, however, properly belong not to them, but to the
place in which they officiate.

CHAPTER V.
OF THE ACTION ADAPTED TO DRAMATIC REPRESEN-
TATION.
SECTION I.
OF THE ELEMENTS OF DRAMATIC ACTION.
Or the vocal expression adapted to the Drama, nothing
remains to be said. The vocal elements have been so
fully presented, and so many hints have been given in re-
gard to their employment for purposes of expression, that it
is believed nothing but practice on proper examples is re-
quisite, to give to the learner all the vocal capabilities pos-
sessed by the most distinguished orators or actors. As
however this Manual has in view mainly to assist in form-
ing the orator, most of the examples given have been
selected with reference to this.-Even the elements how-
ever of Dramatic action have not all been presented. This
section is intended to supply this defect.
It would not perhaps be entirely easy to point out the
precise difference between the action suited to oratory, and
that of the stage. The principle, however, on which this
difference depends has been before hinted at the actor
appears in an assumed character, while the orator appears
in his own. It is the part of the actor, then, to represent
and sustain the character which he has assumed; and this
may be entirely at variance with the dignity of oratory.
The actor personates every passion and feeling which makes
up the human character,-from the nobler passions and
manners of the hero, down through those of common life,
even to the vulgarity of the buffoon; hence the different

293
grades of actors, from the tragedian down to the performer
of low comedy. He may imitate nature; while imitative
action is denied to the orator. He may be affected, he may
be extravagant, or exhibit the weakness of ungovernable
emotion; while, as regards the orator, affectation defeats
his objects, extravagance disgusts his audience and renders
him ridiculous, and weakness gives him over to contempt.
We here find a sufficient reason, why the action of the
theatre can never be taken as a model for the orator. Yet
as in the theatre all the qualities of perfect gesture are re-
quired, the action of the stage may furnish many useful
hints to the discriminating orator. It has been well said,-
"He may learn from the theatre energy, variety and preci-
sion of action. The simplicity of action he must derive
from his own unaffected sincerity; and grace from habit
and taste. And as to the other qualities, he must know how
to use them discreetly, or to retrench them altogether. But
he must carefully guard against attempting to introduce the
full license of theatrical action into rhetorical delivery of
any kind. If he be a mere imitator, and cannot discrimi-
nate, his gesture will be the subject of just reprehension.”
Dramatic action, as distinguished from oratorical, consists,
then, primarily, in the exhibitions of other passions, or of
the same passions in a higher degree of excitement. The
tendency of this excitement is to render the muscles rigid,
to lengthen the step, and to give rapidity to all the move-
ments of the body. A secondary element of difference may
now be presented, which is found in the fact, that the actor
has for his object to please rather than instruct. Hence, if
he can better accomplish his object thereby, his action may
take the lead of his sentiment, and become itself as it not
unfrequently does upon the stage, the chief object of attrac-
tion. To render it thus, he not only uses all the varied

action allowed to the orator, but uses it more freely than
oratory allows; and superadds to this, as we have just
suggested, other elements of gesture still, by the employ-
ment of which Boldness and Magnificence of gesture are
produced, which constitute the chief characteristics of the
Epic style. The principal of these new elements we shall
now enumerate.
THE FEET AND LOWER LIMBS.-Under the influence of
strong excitement, as when one advances with boldness
or retires in alarm, the positions of the feet before described
may be exhibited in what may properly be called an ex-
tended state, which consists simply in a wider separation of
the feet. The moderate step, which is most graceful in ora-
tory, in the theatre may often become a stride; and while the
orator is limited to the simple movement of advancing and
retiring, and that by a single step, the actor may traverse
the whole stage, as he is moved by passion or by the cir-
cumstances of the scene. Instead of moving on the stage
only backwards and forwards, in dramatic action and in all
dialogue the movement may be lateral. If it is in the
direction of the free foot, the person is said to traverse, and
he falls into the same position as when he advances. If
the movement is in the contrary direction from the free foot,
he crosses ;-if from the second position, carrying the free
foot forward of the other, and falling into the first position
of that foot; if from the first, carrying it behind the other
and falling into the second position of the advanced foot.--
It is by the aid of the lower limbs also, that the actor kneels,
or starts, or stamps.
THE TRUNK.-The erect posture has been presented as
the only one suited to the dignity of the orator. Indeed the
manly attitude of the body, which neither inclines nor
stoops, with the head in an erect and natural position, as

exhibited in the painting of Washington by Trumbull,*
may be presented as the very symbol of dignity. Grief
depresses the body, and the person under its influence is
said to be cast down; while pride may throw the body back
too far. The expression of the passions however depends
more upon the head than upon the trunk, which rarely gives
any expression but in sympathy with the lower limbs, as in
kneeling or prostration, or with the head, or the arms and
hands.
THE HEAD AND EYES.-When the head is hung down,
it expresses humility; when turned upwards, arrogance;
and when inclined to one side, languor or indifference. Be-
side these, and, says Quintilian, "beside those motions,
which by a nod signify assent, or rejection, or approbation;
there are other motions of the head known and common to
all, which express modesty, doubt, admiration, and indig-
nation." These are expressions which oratory has little
occasion to exhibit: hence a reference to them has been
reserved for this place.-The positions of the head, which
have been distinctly designated, and most of which are used
only in theatrical expression, are as follows:--
The Head alone.
Inclined.
Erect.
Assenting.
Denying.
Shaking.
Tossing.
Aside.
The Head considered with reference
to the direction of the Eyes.
Forward.
Averted.
Downward.
Upward.
Around.
Vacuity, or Vacancy.

countenance is an index of the mind, having expression
corresponding with each emotion of the soul. Other ani-
mals have no 'expression but that which arises by mere
accident, the concomitant of the motions necessary to the
accomplishment of the object of the passions."*
The ex-
pression of pride, of shame, of despair, of anger, of con-
tempt, of terror, or of any vehemence of passion, finds no
place in oratory. There is no passion however, or degree
of excitement, but may be exhibited on the stage. These
passions find a partial expression in words and in the tones
of the voice; but unaccompanied with the appropriate
expression of the countenance, the symbols of feeling would
make but a faint impression.
THE HAND.—The positions of the hand have been pre-
sented to the learner as depending on four circumstances.
As regards the first-the disposition of the fingers, besides
the natural state, and the others which were described as
having an occasional place in oratory, others still may be
enumerated for purposes of significant expression.
The hand is said to be Hollow, when the palm is held
nearly supine, and the fingers turned inwards without touch-
ing. (See Fig. 51.)
Fig. 51.
Fig. 52.
Fig. 53.
In the Holding position, the finger and thumb are pressed
together, either the fore or middle finger, or both; while
the other fingers are contracted more or less, according to
the degree of energy required by the sentiment. (See Figs.
52, 53, 54, 55.)

The Thumb expresses the position of the hand, in which
the thumb is extended downward or upward, while the
fingers are clasped down. (See Figs. 56, 57.)
Fig. 56.
Fig. 57.
Fig. 58.
The Grasping position represents the fingers and thumb
as seizing the garments, or tearing the hair. (See Fig. 58.)
As regards the manner in which the palm is presented, no
new elements need to be introduced. Dramatic action
employs all the positions of the hand described on p. 243,
except the natural position, much more frequently than
they are used in oratory. This position is equally adapted
to both.
The positions of the hands which arise from—the com-
bined disposition of both hands, find little place in oratory;
hence they are reserved for consideration here. Among
these it may be sufficient to enumerate the following.-The
hands are said to be-
Applied, when the palms are pressed together, and the
fingers and thumbs of each are laid against those of the
other. (See Fig. 59.)

Clasped, when all the fingers are inserted between each
other, the hands pressed closely together, and one thumb
lapped over the other. (See Figs. 60, 96.)

other is laid over it crosswise. (See Figs. 61, 85, 94.)

each hand are brought lightly into contact. (See Fig. 64.)

Enumerating, when the index of the right hand is laid
successively upon the index and the different fingers of the
left. (See Fig. 66.)
The fourth class of positions of the hand arising from
the part of the body on which it is laid, enumerated on p.
244, are much more frequently employed on the stage than
in ordinary delivery.
THE ARM.-Beside the systematic gestures of the arms
described as belonging to oratory, there are others peculiar
to dialogue, or to dramatic action.
The arms are said to be folded or encumbered, when
they are crossed and enclose each other, the fingers of the
left hand holding the right arm, and the right hand passing
under the left arm. (See Fig. 67.)
They are a-kimbo, when one or both hands rest on the
hips, and the elbows are stuck out on either or both sides.
(See Figs. 68, 89.)
They are reposed, when the elbows are nearly resting on
the hips, and one hand holds the wrist of the other. This
is a female position. (See Fig. 69.)

THE ARM AND HAND COMBINED. -To designate the
manner of the motion of the arm and hand, a variety of
technical terms have been employed, which scarcely re-
quire to be explained merely for the purpose of assisting in
the acquisition of the plain dignity of the orator; though
some of them may properly be exhibited in oratory. The
following, noted by Austin, will suffice, though others
might be given.-Gesture, then, may be considered as-
Noting, when the hand, in whatever position, is first
drawn back and raised, and then advanced and with a
gentle stroke depressed. (See Fig. 70.)
Projecting, when the arm is first retracted, and then
thrust forward in the direction in which the hand points.
(See Fig. 71.)
-
Retracting, when the arm is withdrawn preparatory to
projecting, as in the dotted hand and arm of Fig. 71, or in
the right arm of Fig. 75;—or in order to avoid an object
either hateful or horrible, as in Fig. 77.
Waving, when the fingers are first pointed downward,

and then, by a smart motion of the elbow and wrist, the
hand is flung upward in a vertical direction. (See Fig. 72.)
The flourish, when the hand describes a circular move-
ment, above the head. (See Fig. 73.)
Fig. 73.
Fig. 74.
The sweep, when the hand makes a curved movement
descending from the opposite shoulder, and rising with
velocity to the utmost extent of the arm, or the reverse;

changing its position from supine to vertical in the first
case, and from vertical to supine in the latter. The sweep
is sometimes doubled by returning the arm back again
through the same arch. (See Fig. 74.)
Beckoning, when with the fore-finger, or the whole hand,
the palm being turned inward, a motion is made in the
direction of the breast.
Repressing, when the fore-finger, or the whole hand, the
palm being turned outward, makes a motion in opposition
to the person addressed. This is the reverse of the pre-
ceding gesture; and the motions in both these gestures are
often repeated.
Advancing, when the hand, being first moved downward
and backward, in order to obtain greater space for action,
is then moved regularly forward, and raised as high as the
horizontal position, a step being at the same time made in
advance, to aid the action.
Springing, when the hand having nearly arrived at the
intended limit of the gesture, flies suddenly up to it by a
quick motion of the wrist; like the blade of a pocket-knife
when it suddenly snaps into its proper situation by the re-
coil of the spring.
Striking, when the arm and hand descend with rapidity
and force, like a stroke arrested by having struck what it
was aimed against.
Bending, when the arm is brought into a position prepa-
ratory to striking.
Recoiling, when after a stroke, as in the former gesture,
the arm and hand return back to the position whence they
proceeded.
Throwing, when the arm by the force of the gesture is
flung as it were in the direction of the person ad-
dressed.

Clinching, when the hand is suddenly clinched, and the
arm raised in a posture of threatening or contempt.
Collecting, when the arm, from an extended posture
sweeps inward.
Shaking, when a tremulous motion is made by the arm
and hand.
Pressing, when, the hand being already laid on some
part, the effort of pressing is marked by raising the elbow,
and contracting the fingers.
Rejecting, when the hand, in the vertical position is
pushed towards the object, the head being at the same
time averted.
Whoever has observed the general system of action em-
ployed in the schools for the instruction of the deaf and
dumb, has some idea of the ancient pantomime, in which
the action to a great extent was imitative. The elements
of imitative action embrace all the movements which the
human body can perform; and would scarcely be reduci-
ble to a system. But with these, oratory or dignified tra-
gedy has nothing to do. Leaving this kind of gesture
with the actor of low comedy, we may remark, that the
Abbé du Bos has drawn the proper distinction between this
kind of action and that suited to oratory:-"Nothing can
be more vicious in an orator, than to employ in his decla-
mation imitative gestures. The action of an orator ought
to be altogether different from that of a pantomime. An
orator ought to suit his gesture to the general sentiment
which he expresses, and not to the particular signification
of the word which he pronounces."
Because we have introduced, under the head of Dramatic
action, several elements of significant gesture, it is not
hence to be inferred, that all or even a great part of the

304

action of the theatre is of this character. "The significant
gestures," says Austin, however numerous and correct,
which a great actor makes in the representation of an
entire dramatic character, bear no proportion to the
greater number of his gestures, which are not significant,
and which are no less necessary, though not so splendid
nor imposing. The painter is struck by the boldest and
finest of the significant gestures which are called attitudes,
and he records them; they are the proper objects of his
art; they are striking and less evanescent than the other
gestures, which pass unnoticed by him, although they make
up by far the greater and more important part of the ges-
tures requisite for illustrating the sentiments. These less
prominent gestures give to the declamation its precision and
force. A slight movement of the head, a look of the eye,
a turn of the hand, a judicious pause or interruption of
gesture, or a change of position in the feet, often illuminates
the meaning of a passage, and sends it full of light and
warmth into the understanding. And the perfection of
gesture in a tragedian will be found to consist more in the
skilful management of the less showy action than in the
exhibition of the finest attitudes. Attitudes are dangerous
to hazard; the whole powers of the man must be wrought
up to their highest energy, or they become forced and frigid.
Every one will recollect, that excellent players have been
seen, who have never ventured an attitude; but none de-
serving the name of excellence have ever appeared, whose
declamation has been deficient in precision or propriety.
Where all the solid foundation of just and appropriate action
has been laid, attitude, when regulated with taste and discre-
tion, may
be added to ornament the superstructure; but in-
troduced unseasonably or overcharged, it is an evidence of
deficiency of understanding as well as depravity of taste."

SECTION II.
OF SIGNIFICANT GESTURES AND ATTItudes.
SIGNIFICANT gestures and attitudes, according to the sen-
timents of the last section, are to be considered but as the
mere "ornaments" of a system, of which the action suited
to the orator is the "superstructure." Yet with theatrical
action, whose chief object is to please, the ornament is very
important. With oratory, on the contrary, whose principal
design is to instruct and persuade, the sentiment is the prin-
cipal thing, and gesture is employed only to enforce that;
and this is done by the aid of a class of gestures which
rarely have any distinct signification when used without
words. They are not imitative,--they are not, in any pro-
per sense of the term, conventional, but are produced by
the promptings of nature, requiring only to be chastened
and polished by study and art; while much of the action
of the stage, especially as it departs from the more digni-
fied exhibition of tragedy and epic poetry, is imitative and
artificial. With this additional suggestion as to the distinc-
tion between dramatic and oratorical action, we proceed to
some particulars touching the import of the significant ges-
tures of which we have been treating, when simple, and
also the mode of combining them for the production of
rhetorical effect.
EXAMPLES OF SIMPLE SIGNIFICANT GESTURES.
The Head and Face.
The hanging down of the head denotes shame or grief.
The holding of it up, pride or courage.
To nod forward implies assent.

They weep in sorrow.

They are downcast or averted in anger.
They are cast on vacancy in thought.
They are thrown in different directions in doubt and
anxiety.
The Arms.
The arm is projected forward in authority.
Both arms are spread extended in admiration.
They are both held forward in imploring help.
They both fall suddenly in disappointment.
The Hands.
The hand on the head indicates pain or distress.
On the eyes, shame.
On the lips, injunction of silence.
On the breast, it appeals to conscience, or intimates
strong emotion of some kind.
The hand waves or flourishes in joy or contempt.
Both hands are held supine, applied or clasped in prayer.
Both descend prone in blessing.
They are clasped or wrung in affliction.
The Body.
The body, held erect, indicates steadiness and courage.
Thrown back, pride.
Stooping forward, condescension or compassion.


## p. 307 (#317) ############################################

DRAMATIC ACTION.
307
Bending, reverence or respect.
Prostration, the utmost humility or abasement.
The Lower Limbs.
Their firm position signifies courage or obstinacy.
Bended knees, timidity or weakness.
Frequent change, disturbed thoughts.
They advance in desire or courage.
Retire in aversion or fear.
Start in terror.
Stamp in authority or anger.
Kneel in submission and prayer.
These examples might be multipled; but the object is
simp to furnish a sufficient number for illustration, with-
out attempting to make a complete list.
EXAMPLES OF COMPLEX SIGNIFICANT GESTURES, OR
ATTITUDES.
A few examples of the more complex significant gestures
will now be presented. The figures referred to will show
the precise attitude intended; while the description will
furnish the principles on which, by the application of a little
skill, the list can be extended so as to embrace the visible
expression of any and every passion or feeling, which
agitates the human breast.
Terror excites the person who suffers under it, to avoid
or to escape from the dreaded object. If it be supposed
to be some dangerous reptile on the ground, and very near,
the expression will be represented by the figure starting
back, and looking downward. If the danger threaten from
a distance, the terror arising will be expressed by the figure
looking forward, and not starting back, but merely in the

retired position. But if the dread of impending death from
the hand of an enemy awakens this passion, the coward
flies. This passion needs no figure for its illustration.
Aversion is expressed by two gestures; first the hand
held vertical is retracted towards the face, the eyes and
head are for a moment directed eagerly towards the object,
and the feet advance. (See Fig. 75.) Then suddenly the
eyes are withdrawn, the head is averted, the feet retire, and
the arms are projected out extended against the object, the
hands vertical. (See Fig. 76.)
Fig. 75.
Fig. 76.
Fig. 77.
Horror, which is aversion or astonishment mingled with
terror, is seldom capable of retreating, but remains petrified
in one attitude, with the eyes riveted on its object, and the
arm held forward to guard the person, the hands vertical,
and the whole frame trembling. (See Fig. 77.) The feel-
ing of Horror may exist when no object is present. This
is beautifully illustrated in one of Mr. Engel's figures.
Alluding to the "disposition of the mind to refer intellec-
tual ideas to external objects," he says:-"When King
Lear recollects the barbarous treatment of his daughters,
who in the midst of a stormy night had exposed his hoary

hairs to the inclemency of the weather, and when he im-
mediately exclaims,—
'O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;
No more of that,'-
-
there is not in reality any external object from which this
unhappy prince should avert his eyes with horror, and yet
he turns his head away to the side opposite that to which
it was directed before; endeavoring, as it were, with his
hand reversed, to banish that cruel and afflicting recollec-
tion." (See Fig. 78.)
Fig. 78.

Listening, in order to obtain the surest and most various
information, first presents the quick and comprehensive
glance of the eye towards the apparent direction of the
sounds; if nothing is seen, the ear presents itself towards
the point of expectation, and the eye is bent on vacancy:
but all this passes in a moment. The hand and arm are
held vertical extended. If the sound proceeds from different
quarters at the same time, both arms are held up, and the
head alternately changes from one side to the other, with a
rapidity governed by the nature of the sound; if it is
alarming, with trepidation; if pleasing, with gentle emo
tion. Fig. 79 represents listening fear.

Admiration, if of surrounding natural objects of a pleas-

together, throws back the head, sinking it between the
shoulders, and looks earnestly up to the person implored.
(See Fig. 82.)
In appealing to heaven, the right hand is first laid on the
breast, then the left is projected supine upward; the eyes
first directed forward, and then upward. (See Fig. 83.)
In the appeal to conscience, the right hand is laid on the
breast, the left drops unmoved, the eyes are fixed upon the
person addressed. (See Fig. 23.)-Sometimes both hands
press the breast.
Shame, in the extreme, sinks on the knee and covers the
eyes with both hands: this is a feminine expression of it.

Mild resignation falls on the knee, crosses the arms.

Deliberation on ordinary subjects holds the chin, and sets
the arm a-kimbo. (See Fig. 89.)
Self-sufficiency presents the body erect, the lower limbs.

Pride throws back the body, holds the head high, and pre-
sents the elbow a-kimbo, and thrown forward as in Fig. 68.
When the thoughts flow without difficulty or opposition,
the movement of the limbs is free and direct. But when
difficulties occur or obstacles are discovered, a man either
arrests his action entirely, or changes it to something alto-
gether different. The direction of his eyes and the action
of his head, are also, under such circumstances, quite
altered. The eyes, instead of moving freely from object
to object, become fixed, and the head is thrown back, if
before hanging down on the breast. As an example of
these effects, M. Engel refers to a scene in a play of Les-
sing, in which an old gentleman is very much puzzled how
to manage, under a situation of great difficulty and deli-
cacy. In the commencement of his deliberations he is
represented as in Fig. 90, and in the next period of them,
as in Fig. 91.

Melancholy is a feeble and passive affection; it is at-
tended by a total relaxation of the nerves, with a mute and
tranquil resignation, unaccompanied by opposition either to
the cause or the sensibility of the evil. The character ex-
ternally is languor without motion; the head hanging at
the side next the heart;" the eyes turned upon its object,
if that is absent, fixed on the ground; the hands hang-
ing down by their own weight without effort, and joined
loosely together. (See Fig. 92.)

Anxiety is of a different character; it is restless and ac-
tive, and manifest by the extension of the muscles; the eye
is filled with fire, the breathing is quick, the motion is hur-
ried, the head is thrown back, and the whole body is
extended. The sufferer is like a sick man who tosses in-
cessantly, and finds himself uneasy in every situation. (See
Fig. 93.)
I shall close this part of the subject and the work, by
presenting the learner with some of the attitudes of Mrs.
