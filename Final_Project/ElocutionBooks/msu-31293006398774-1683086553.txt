INTRODUCTION TO FIRST
EDITION
THE author of this little Handbook of Elocu-
tion has asked me to write a few lines to
commend it to the attention of those who
are unaware of his claims to be listened to
when he speaks upon the subject of this
valuable and too much neglected art. I
gladly comply with his request. They are
lines of personal introduction rather than
comment upon the treatise which he now
gives to the public.
As President of the City of London
College, an office which I have only lately
resigned, I had the pleasure of knowing Mr.
Minshall and of observing his diligent and
successful teaching of the art of which he is
himself an accomplished exponent; and I
am sure I am doing public service in help-
ing to secure for the instruction, which his
capacity and experience enable him to give,
a wider influence than can be obtained in
the college class-rooms.
It is always to me a matter of wonder
that students should not be more anxious

than they generally are to study elocution.
There is no one in any situation in life who
would not be greatly profited by doing so;
while the neglect of the art is the cause of
many failures in the pulpit and at the Bar
and in public life. I speak from experience,
and I have often said in print that short-
hand and elocution were the most valuable
of my boyhood's acquirements. In the
hope that others will be wise enough to
follow my example, I now introduce them
to a competent teacher of elocution.

FOREWORD TO NEW AND
ENLARGED EDITION
THE call for a second edition of this Hand-
book has afforded me the opportunity of
adding new matter to the body of the book,
doubling the number of Things Worth Re-
membering, and increasing the number of
words in the Glossary fourfold. In other
respects the format of the second edition
corresponds with the first.
It is hoped that in its present enlarged
form the book will not only be of general
service to teachers and pupils and indepen-
dent students, but that candidates for
Diploma Examinations will find the in-
formation here collected in précis form a
material help to them in pursuing their
preparatory studies.

DISTINCTNESS.
The only complete method of teaching an
art is by practical example, but the printed
page will do a great deal for the earnest
student by preparing him for viva voce
instruction.
The two essentials of good delivery are
Distinctness and Expression.
Distinctness depends upon audibility and
the firm enunciation of the consonants, the
latter being much more important than the
former; for in practice it will be found that
a very small voice, helped by a clear and
firm articulation of the consonants, will
achieve the speaker's purpose, where strong
vocality and weak enunciation fail. Indeed,
a loud speaker, with even a good articula-
tion, will sometimes be indistinct, the reason
being that the consonants are smothered
in the sound. The first aim should be the
acquirement of a perfect production of the
consonants, for they are the moulds in
which vocal sound is shaped into words.
It has been computed that in ninety-five

cases out of a hundred those born deaf are
not born dumb, and no stronger proof of
the paramount value of perfect articulation
can be required than the fact that the so-
called deaf and dumb can be taught to speak
and converse (although inaudible to them-
selves) merely by seeing what is said.
EXPRESSION.
Expression, in its logical sense, depends
upon correct emphasis on particular words,
and the proper use of the suspensive and
conclusive tones of the voice. In its emo-
tional sense it is determined by the intensity
of the feeling or emotion inherent in the
words, and the emotional and expressive
power of the speaker. The former appeals
to the brain, the latter to the heart.
Language is made expressive by Inflec-
tion, Modulation, Pause, Rate of Delivery,
Emphasis, Gesture and Attitude, Facial
Expression, and a compelling earnestness of
manner.
Vocal and bodily expression, which may
be convincing within conversational range,
would often lose its effectiveness on the
platform. We must never forget that exag-
geration, by itself, can only provoke
tragical mirth.” but artistic exaggeration

is a prime necessity if we would preserve,
unimpaired by distance, the expressive
virility apparent in proximity. Rightly
understood, we must realize that the discre-
tionary use of artistic exaggeration is not an
attempt to paint the lily, but it is rather the
adjustment of perspective, with a view to
naturalness. The principle is the same as
that in the work of the scenic artist. Dis-
tance (and, in the open, atmosphere and light)
has the effect of diminishing size and colour,
and the artist artistically exaggerates his
work in order to counteract this effect.
BREATHING AND VOICE PRODUCTION.
Experience has convinced me that much
that is spoken and written on these subjects
is irrelevant and fallacious, and most of
the books disagree. Let the student gain
complete control of his breathing and the
variable cavity of the mouth, and then
the less he thinks about his larynx the better.
In a recently published work Mr. Aikin
says: “The vocal cords themselves I should
advise musicians to leave alone, for the
direct investigation of such an unconscious
mechanism is practically beyond their
reach.”* The vocal cords require no direc-
* “The Voice," by W. A. Aikin, M.D.

tive will-power to start them into action,
while breathing itself is an automatic opera-
tion which takes place through the nasal
passages. It is only when vocalizing that
this voluntary process gives place to an
exercised control, the object then being to
inhale quickly and imperceptibly, and to
exhale slowly, allowing no breath to escape
without paying toll in vocality. Immedi-
ately before speaking, the chest should be
expanded, and the air allowed to flow into
the lungs until they are comfortably, but
not unduly, inflated, though one should be
conscious that the air has extended to the
base of the lungs. Vocality once started,
the speaker should take care to replenish
his lungs at frequent, not necessarily regular,
intervals, and this should be done without
"gasping “sniffing." Sometimes it
can be done leisurely through the nasal
passages, but sometimes it is necessary to
catch the air up more quickly through the
mouth. One of the secrets of easy speaking
is the contracted habit of supplying the
lungs with air at every opportunity afforded
- by the momentary rhetorical pauses, as
well as at those of longer duration at the
close of a sentence.
Voices of the same type vary in quality,
but by correct management of the variable

cavity of the mouth, and the effective use
of the articulative organs, individual quality
may be improved. The voice is part of
one's personality, and is indicative of char-
acter and education. The voice types we
recognize under the names of bass, bari-
tone, tenor, etc., are determined by the
length and thickness of the vocal cords.
The normal range for speaking, as for sing-
ing, is two octaves, though the speaker is
seldom called upon to use the highest or
lowest notes. To strengthen the voice,
daily practice in audible reading or reciting
is necessary, there being no short road to
full voice development.
Discrimination
should be used in adopting cut-and-dried
methods of breathing and vocal exercises,
arranged for all and sundry--some would
seem to be more appropriately used if
devoted to the training of gymnasts. - A
mode of exercise suitable to one may be
positively harmful to another, and a too
slavish adherence to methods is apt to result
in peculiarities at the cost of naturalness.
The voice is sensitive to the general health,
and to keep in good voice one must keep
fit; but violent physical exercise should be
avoided, especially so just before vocalizing.
A great deal may be learned by observing
the methods of good speakers and singers,

but the verbal instruction and practical
example of a competent teacher is indis-
pensable.
It is unwise to pin one's faith to a particu-
lar system, as the vocal equipment and
resonating chambers vary in each indi-
vidual, and, therefore, methods must be
correspondingly adapted to particular needs.
On the other hand, the principles of breath
control are common to all.
What is required is the greatest result
with the least consumption of force. The
secret lies in throat resistance in opposition
to chest pressure, thereby governing and
augmenting sound, on the principle exempli-
fied in a simple pop-gun.
THE VOCAL SPEECH MECHANISM.
This comprises the lungs, the windpipe,
the larynx (containing the vocal cords), the
variable cavity of the mouth, and the organs
of articulation. When we speak, the vocal
cords come into position and obstruct the
passage of the windpipe, and the air from
the lungs, pressing through them,
their edges to vibrate, and sound is produced.
Control of the mouth cavity, by the tongue
and soft palate, qualifies the tone and deter-
mines the vowel sounds, and the articulative
organs form the words.
causes

HANDBOOK OF ELOCUTION

A deep inspiration causes the cords to
fall widely apart. In expiration they partly
approximate. In making sounds, they come
together. In whispering, they only partly
approximate.
The pitch is brought about by tightening,
or relaxation, of the cords, further influenced
by air-pressure from the lungs. So that for
a high note the cords are tightly stretched
together, the air-pressure increased, and
the vibrations multiplied. For a still higher,
or falsetto note, only part of the vibrating
length of the cords vibrates.
PHONETICS (ARTICULATION).
The elements of language are Vowels and
Consonants, and the perfect production of
both is essential to a good delivery.
Vowel sounds are produced by varying
the shape of the cavity of the mouth; the
principle of the process is recognizable at
once by pronouncing the sounds aw and ee.
For eleven of the vowel sounds the cavity
remains fixed during utterance. The excep-
tions are the diphthongal, or compound,
vowels, in which the cavity is “in action
during utterance. For example, the sound
of i begins with an open mouth, and finishes
with the mouth almost closed.

## p. 8 (#24) ###############################################

HANDBOOK OF ELOCUTION
Consonants are produced by partial or
complete contact of the articulative organs;
these organs are the tongue, lips, and soft
palate (movable), and the gums, teeth, and
hard palate.
The perfect enunciation of these elemen-
tary sounds and consonant formations can
be acquired only by practical illustration
from a teacher. Persistent daily practice
is necessary to attain strength and fluency.
A system of teaching spoken language is
now in use in many Training Colleges for
Teachers, under the Board of Education.
A particular symbol is assigned to represent
each vowel sound and consonant. At the
present moment, the advocates of the
system are not unanimous in their choice of
signs. The principle can be extended and
applied to sounds other than English, and
this standardization of sounds by use of
specific signs, ought conceivably to facilitate
the acquisition of accuracy of sounds to
which the student is a stranger. It is prob-
able, however, that the system will serve
its best purpose in the teaching of foreign
languages. The disadvantage of the system
as applied to the teaching of English, to
English students, lies in the fact that the
student has to familiarize himself with new
symbols, in place of the already familiar

letters of his own language. It is true that,
by the use of phonetic symbols, the difficul-
ties presented by the redundance and defi-
cience of the English alphabet are obviated,
but in avoiding these difficulties the system
unfortunately necessitates the substitution
of difficulties of its own, which are suffi-
ciently onerous to prejudice their voluntary
acceptance by the English student seeking
to perfect his English speech. Text printed
in Phonetic Notation has the formidable
appearance of a new language, the reading of
which requires considerable practice. Read-
ing aloud from such notation, after familiarity
has been acquired with the symbols and
their signification, should eventually result
in the ability to produce the sounds in their
purity, but the notation itself, as in the
case of shorthand, must necessarily prove
a hindrance to the quick interpretation of
sense and expression.
In the teaching of English sounds, viva
voce instruction and example are indispens-
able and identical, whether the system em-
ployed be phonetic symbols or the English
alphabet; and in the teaching of English
pupils there can be no practical advantage
in replacing the representative signs of
sounds, as exemplified in simple familiar
words, by unfamiliar symbols. The fact that

in English several letters are used to repre-
sent the same sound, and that several sounds
are often represented by the same letter,
is one of the difficulties of English pronuncia-
tion, and must be recognized and mastered
by the speaker of English, whether he has
acquired the sounds by the aid of phonetic
symbols or otherwise. A universal phonetic
language would solve the difficulty, but its
advent is very far off. In other words, the
phonetic symbolist, when reading English,
must resume the

" attitude,
and return to the recognition of English
sounds as they are inconsistently represented
in the mother-tongue.
Whatever may be said in favour of pho-
netics as a means of teaching foreign lan-
guages—and much may be said for it-it
would seem obvious that in spite of the
representative inconsistencies in the letters
and their sounds in English, it is simpler
and more practicably desirable, for the pur-
poses of instruction to average English
students of English speech, to use, as stan-
dard sounds, simple English words, such as
are tabulated elsewhere in this handbook.

INFLECTION: SIMPLE.
Inflection is the name by which we recog-
nize the continual movement or slide of the
voice, upward or downward, while speaking.
The singer makes distinct leaps from one
note to another; the speaker glides. The
movement, in its simple form, may be recog-
nized by asking the question, Up or down?
The first movement is called a Simple Rising
Inflection, the second a Simple Falling one.
Inflection is the antithesis of monotone, or
monotony. The rising inflection is used
when the meaning is incomplete, and for pure
questions. The movement of the voice
takes place upon the important word in the
sentence—not necessarily the last word,
though the suspensive tone extends to the
end of the sentence.
Thus, rising inflections, in this sentence,
should be strongly marked, where indicated,
until the close. When the principle is
mastered, the sentence should be phrased
into three oratorical words, or groups of
words, uttered continuously without break,
excepting after the words sentence" and
“indicated.” Will you go? is a pure ques-
tion. Will you go ? is a pseudo, or false
question-really a command.


## p. 12 (#28) ##############################################

12
HANDBOOK OF ELOCUTION
The Simple Falling Inflection indicates
the completion of the sense, and occurs at,
or near, the end of a period.
Generally speaking, rising or suspensive
inflections are appropriate to clauses and
sentences which leave the meaning incom-
plete, or are of a negative, conditional,
or interrogative nature. Clauses in series
may be inflected suspensively, or conclu-
sively, according to their importance, the
conclusive downward inflections being the
more impressive, but each method needs
a contrary inflection to prepare for the close.
Thus: “His disinterestedness, his candour,
his kindness and forbearance, are remark-
able.” Or:.
Or: "His disinterestedness, his
candour, his kindness and forbearance, are
remarkable.” Again, speaking generally,
falling, or conclusive, inflections are appro-
priate to round off the completion of the
meaning of a sentence, for solemn affirma-
tion, and for command.
INFLECTION: COMPOUND.
A Compound Inflection is the union of an
upward and a downward, or a downward
and an upward, movement of the voice,


## p. 13 (#29) ##############################################

HANDBOOK OF ELOCUTION
13
and sometimes continued by further move-
ments. Whenever the meaning or feeling
to be conveyed is different or stronger than
the actual word or words suggest, compound
inflections supply the insufficiency. The
number of movements may vary with the
strength of the feeling to be conveyed, and
with the speaker's emotional powers of
expression. Seems, madam ? Nay, it is."
The downward and upward movement on
seems suggests Hamlet's surprise that
his mother should use that word. To render
it with an upward and downward would
suggest irony or scorn. The upward and
downward on "is” marks the strong anti-
thesis to seems.” Emphasis necessarily
goes hand in hand with inflection. It is
perhaps not easy for the untrained ear to
catch the compound movement on short
vowels, such as represented in “is,” but
it is obvious in long vowels such as in
seems.' When Iago says, “ Drown thy-
self ?” he uses emphasis and compound
inflection to jockey Roderigo out of his
expressed resolve, and thereby distinctly
implies by their use his questioning incredu-
lity. The movement is shown in reverse
when Shylock says, “ You say so !” thereby
indicating as plainly as though the words

14
HANDBOOK OF ELOCUTION
were there that he means, “ You (of all
people) say so !” Indeed, one of the most
frequent applications of compound inflec-
tion is found in suggested antithesis, as
again, “He says he speaks the truth,”
which leaves you to assume that the speaker
has his doubts. On the other hand, “He
says he speaks the truth" indicates that
the speaker is rebuking you for doubting.
Compound inflections are not limited to a
double movement, and three, or even more,
movements are recognizable when strong
emotion calls for them, and may be especially
noticeable in the expression of irony and
The most familiar example is the
play upon the word “honourable,” as used
by Mark Antony in Julius Cæsar: “They
sarcasm.
that have done this deed are honourable.
They are wise and honourable. . . " The
inflections on the words marked are much
more complex than those used on the same
words earlier in the speech, and, as spoken
by Antony, they not only suggest the oppo-
site of what he says, but do so with an added
bitterness. Inflection begins on the accented
syllable of the emphatic word. The higher
pitch or tone reached at the end of a rising

HANDBOOK OF ELOCUTION
15
inflection should be continued over the re-
maining words in the sentence; thus:
Simple rising, “It is not a book I want."
If the sentence were affirmative, it would
have a conclusive ending; thus: “It is a
book I want.” The lower pitch or tone
reached at the end of a falling inflection
should be continued to the end of the sen-
tence; thus:
Simple falling—“He defended himself.”
Compound rising—“Hath a dog money?"
Compound falling—“ You say so !”
The failure to observe this principle,
especially in blank verse, where words do
not always follow the sequence customary
in prose, renders the meaning obscure and
sometimes false. Thus many fail to find the
correct inflection of the well-known passage
in Julius Cæsar, “ I'll use you for my mirth,
yea, for my laughter, when you are waspish.”
The voice in this case takes a turn upward
on the accented syllable of the last word.
In other words, the last clause in this
passage should be read with the inflection
due to it were it placed at the beginning
instead of the end.
The ear will the more readily recognize


## p. 16 (#32) ##############################################

16 HANDBOOK OF ELOCUTION
the movements of the voice if, after speak-
ing a sentence, we repeat the exact tones,
but using, in place of the words, the Italian
sound of la, repeating it as many times
as the sentence contains syllables. Thus,
"Who dotes, yet doubts,” would become
“ La-lá, la-lá," the second pair of syllables
being then very noticeably lower in tone.
MODULATION.
The effective speaker does not use the
same key or pitch of voice to deliver pas-
sages of varying construction or contrasted
emotion, but will seek to adapt the key to
the subject-matter. Thus grave or solemn
utterances are more appropriately spoken
in the lower ranges of the voice, while cheer-
ful and joyous passages find expression in
higher keys. It is the skilful adaptation of
these various keys to the requirement of the
moment which gives charm to the delivery,
and compares with the lights and shades
of a picture. High and loud, and low and
soft, are not necessarily connected: a high
tone may need to be soft, and a low tone
loud. Some idea of the variations of pitch
at the speaker's command may be gathered
from the following lines from Byron, in re-
peating which the student should endeavour

2.
to speak each succeeding line on a slightly
higher plane, beginning on the lowest note
upon which he can make himself audible:
I. “Hark to the trump and the drum,
And the mournful sound of the barbarous
horn,
3. And the flap of the banners that flit as
they're borne,
4.
And the neigh of the steed and the multi-
tude's hum,
5. And the clash and the shout, ‘They come !
They come !'
The middle key may be regarded as that
in which we usually speak or narrate.
The student should use this key as a start-
ing-point, and repeat the same sentence as
much higher, and as much lower, as he can,
until he has familiarized his ear to the various
ranges, and can practically assume them at
will. Line 3 above will serve for practice.
The pitch should be changed appropri-
ately for questions and answers, a new sub-
ject or division of subject, for different
characters, various emotions, parentheses
and explanatory clauses, asides, etc.
PAUSE, OR RHETORICAL PUNCTUATION.
Pauses may vary in duration. The
shortest we call a Breath pause and the
longest a Dramatic pause. The place is


## p. 18 (#34) ##############################################

18 HANDBOOK OF ELOCUTION
determined by the logical sequence of the
language uttered; but the place for dramatic
or emotional pauses is often arbitrarily
dictated by the feelings, irrespective of
grammatical construction. Pauses help,
with inflection and emphasis, to elucidate
and strengthen the meaning. They are
necessary to the speaker for the replenish-
ment of his lungs, and to the hearer for the
relief of his ear from the weariness induced
by continuous sound, and to give time for
his mind to assimilate the sense. Exact
measurement of pauses cannot be gauged
and listed, for they are influenced by indi-
vidual judgment and feeling, and are as
variable as inflections. The art is to pause
frequently without prejudicing continuity.
When reading aloud, the intelligent reader
soon learns to regard the printer's marks
as merely guides to grammatical arrange-
ment, valuable enough in themselves, but
their best purpose is served in helping the
reader to discriminate, quickly and un-
erringly, the shades of meaning and senti-
ment, that he may readily adjust his in-
flections, pauses, and emphasis to the best
expressive effect.
Pauses are frequently
necessary in other and additional places to
those indicated by the punctuation. Gener-
ally, pauses are necessary between sentences,

RATE.
Language should at all times be delivered
deliberately, the variations in rate being
determined by the subject-matter. De-
liberation means complete control, not slow-
ness. Sadness and solemnity are expressed
slowly; unimpassioned narration alertly;
while joy and fierce passion go rapidly.
A speech, sermon, recitation, or play may
fail for no other fault than that of being too
slowly, or too rapidly, delivered. It is bad
to be consistently slow, it is worse to be uni-
formly fast. Good speaking is slower than
it seems. Uniformity, of any rate, is un-
interesting. Rapid passages require extra
care in enunciation, failing which, language
becomes meaningless gabble. Habitually
fast speakers discount the value of what
they say by half.
EMPHASIS.
Emphasis is the extra vocal strength placed
upon a particular word, or words, in a sen-
tence, sometimes further accentuated by
the use of pause. Its principal use is to
define the meaning. Correct emphasis is
the direct result of the perfect understand-
ing of the words spoken. Outside the ver-

nacular of slang, a person never misplaces
emphasis when uttering his own thoughts.
The turn of inflection accompanies emphasis.
Examples of Emphasis.
It defines the meaning—“Shall you ride
home to-day ?” In this sentence there are
as many meanings as words, which at once
become apparent by repeating the sentence
five times, stressing and risingly inflecting
each word in sequence. Further yet, the
question can be made to suggest a cautionary
contingence by emphasizing “shall” with a
downward, instead of an upward, inflection.

GESTURE.
Graceful attitudes, and expressive move-
ments of the limbs and body, cannot be
acquired by reading about them. The
student should study attitudes in sculpture
and picture galleries, and, in the absence of
a teacher's practical example, watch the
movements of good actors, especially in
classical drama. Endeavour, by practice,
to habituate the body to attitudes and move-
ments which shall be strong, easy, and grace-
ful. Gesture, as a means of expression,
wonderfully significant as it is, has its limits
of application, but so far as its use is legiti-
mate, its appeal is universal. Gesture and
facial expression are intelligible, and conclu-
sive, when interpreting ordinary recogniz-
able feelings and emotions, provided those
feelings are not of a complex nature. Fear
can be expressed definitely and satisfactorily,
but jealousy is made up of many emotions,
and no fixed attitude or facial expression
can be assumed which will convincingly
express it.
Attitudes intended to express one emo-
tion may be mistaken in some cases for
another.
The limitations of gesture are manifestly
apparent in wordless plays, where the specta-

tor has to guess at much of the meaning-
indeed, the need of verbal explanation is
often recognized by the provision of printed
particulars. The principal use of gesture
is to add force and further meaning to the
words. On the other hand, gestures, though
not actually accompanied with words, may
be indebted for part of their strength to
words previously uttered. Thus, in the exit
made by the late Sir Henry Irving at the
close of the Trial Scene in The Merchant of
Venice, we had a fine display of gesture and
facial expression, which was practically the
crystallization of the cumulative effect of the
trial upon Shylock, whose every look and
movement now was followed with intelli-
gence and sympathy, because, having seen
and heard all that had previously transpired,
the spectator was able accurately to gauge
and interpret the significance of the actor's
movements. But without the help of the
words already spoken, the gestures would
have failed in definiteness.
Gesture should be used sparingly, and
not at all unless you feel that you want to
express more than the words convey.
Learn the value of standing still, the head
erect, the principal weight of the body on
one or the other leg, one foot being a little
in advance of the other, and the hands hang-

ing easily at the sides. Generally speaking,
the arms should be worked from the shoul-
ders, and for purposes of the platform, apart
from the stage, nearly all gesture, and especi-
ally the indicative, or referential, should
be kept well inside an imaginary half-circle
in front of the speaker, of which his own
person should mark the centre.
Emphatic gestures are used to strike
particular words, and necessitate making
ready for the exact moment of their use,
after which the hands should return to rest,
without fuss.
Referential or Descriptive gestures fulfil
what their names imply—that is, they indi-
cate what is present, or supposed to be
present, or the direction in which something
has happened, or supposed to have happened,
or they illustrate how something is done.
Impassioned gesture is the outward sign
of inward feeling, and is dominated by per-
sonal temperament. The same passion is
not necessarily expressed in the same way
by different persons, though in some of the
passions the methods of manifestation are
limited, and in these approximate similarity
of expression would result. The great thing
is that the gesture should be natural to the
person using it—any arbitrary or imitated
gesture would betray itself, for a gesture

used with grace and force by one may be
out of harmony in another. Gesture, if
natural and spontaneous, will be more
convincing than a calculated gesture, un-
prompted by true feeling.
Imitative gesture is used in comic narra-
tion and character impersonation-seldom
in serious work.
The Hands play the most important part
in gesture, and can be made to signify a
great deal—indeed, the just claim is made
that they have a language of their own;
many of their movements are as expressive
as words, and make their appeal indepen-
dently of race or language. Some people
use their hands in a flat and rigid manner,
and as though the fingers were glued to-
gether; others keep them clenched, and so on.
These expressionless habits should be cured
by observation and practice.
All gesture, bodily and facial, is the out-
ward sign of thought and feeling, and in the
true artist voice, speech, and gesture are
each the complement of the other, working
in harmony to an expression common to
them all.
In strong emotion, silent expression not
only accompanies but precedes words.
The purpose of gesture, used with words,
is to add force, and widen the scope of ex-

pression; it fails if it draws attention to
itself.
It is seldom necessary for a particular
gesture to be sustained for any length of
time. The preparation should be simple
and direct, and when the culminating stroke
is delivered, the limbs should as simply and
directly find rest.
It is a delicate operation to seek oppor-
tunities for gesticular display. The safer
and more natural course is to await the inner
prompting which urges you to express more
than you say. This will not only determine
when the gesture should be used, but will
also indicate its nature. Gesture without
meaning is grotesque.
There may be more than one manner of
expressing the same thing, in which case
it is best to choose the manner that makes
the strongest personal appeal to your own
ideas of expression; the result will thereby
be more convincing, and more in keeping
with your own personality. Choice of ges-
ture should be influenced by relative effec-
tiveness. The use of a handkerchief on the
stage will suggest weeping, when real tears
would probably escape observation.
Gesture should be natural to the indi-
viduality of the person using it. A certain
movement may be common to the expression

of a certain emotion, but it requires the
temperamental touch, peculiar to the person
using it, to make it wholly convincing.
HAND GESTURES.
Of these there are a great many, and
although the principal positions are few,
they admit of a great variety of expression
by modification and movement. The princi-
pal positions are those in which the hand is
extended with the palm upward, downward,
or vertical; or the hand may be clenched.
Some hand gestures are entirely self-explana-
tory, others need supplementing by facial
or bodily expression, or the accompaniment
of words, in order to make the meaning
definite and complete. The vertical posi-
tion enjoins silence; the palm downward with
extended forefinger, indicates and directs;
the same with a movement added, em-
phasizes; the palm upward with an inward
movement of the forefinger, invites; the
forefinger on the lips suggests guarded
silence, or secrecy; held upward, it gives
warning, and if shaken, it is minatory.
The dumb are enabled to converse freely by
hand movements and digital dexterity.
From the following positions, the hands,
used singly, or together, may be made to

represent the feelings enumerated below,
though the list must not be regarded as
exhausting the possibilities:
Palms upward-Supplication, assertion, demand,
forcible appeal.
Palms downward-Disapproval, dismissal, sym-
pathy, finality, blindness.
Palms vertical-Fear, repression, silence, sub-
mission, shocked surprise.
Palms clenched-Anger, emphasis, resolution,
determination.
Hands used together-Joy, prayer, grief, con-
templation, resignation.
FACIAL EXPRESSION.
The power of expressing thought and feel-
ing, through the features, is too obvious to
need elaboration of statement. It is a mode
of expression common to all mankind, but it
should be the special concern of the speaker
to make full and legitimate use of it. In
the words of Lady Macbeth, " Your face
is as a book.” It is not necessary to discuss
whether the eyes are more expressive than
the mouth, and so forth; it is enough to know
that all the features play their respective
parts in the silent interpretation of thought,
Facial expression is a reflection of the
mind; if it is not this, it is grimace.

PRONUNCIATION.
The foundation of good pronunciation is
good articulation, which means purity of
vowel sounds and perfect enunciation of
consonants. Accentuation of the correct
syllable, or syllables, is of the utmost im-
portance. The best of speakers are often at
fault in this respect. English pronunciation
is a never-ending study, and the diligent use
of a pronouncing dictionary is an auxiliary
necessity. The fact that so many words
are pronounced arbitrarily makes a retentive
memory as valuable to the speaker as to the
speller. Many words, too, have alternative
pronunciations, which add to the difficulty of
getting uniformity of usage. There are many
rules for our guidance, but there are also
many exceptions, and the deficiency and re-
dundancy of the alphabet in representing the
sounds and consonants of the language make
the strict observance of rules impossible.
The vowel signs a, e, i, o, and u, repre-
sent, singly and in combination, twenty-three
distinct sounds, while the sound of a, as
in ale, is, on the other hand, expressed by
nine different signs. It is similarly so with
consonants.* We soon, therefore, recognize
the necessity of distinguishing between the
* See pp. 45-48.

HANDBOOK OF ELOCUTION
spelling, and the sound, of a word. Some
people wilfully mispronounce words, defend-
ing themselves by derivation. This is mere
pedantry, and reacts upon the offender,
for the effect of unusual pronunciation is
to deflect the hearer's attention from the
meaning of the word to its method of pro-
nunciation.
Vowels become modified in compound
words, as vineyard, from vine yard; and in
extended words, as natural, from nature;
also in long words, as profanation, from
profane. The word profanation may serve
as an example of primary and secondary
accent; in this case the primary, or principal,
accent occurs on the third syllable, and the
secondary on the first.
In the unaccented terminations el, il, and
in, care should be taken to preserve their
true sounds, as angel, pencil (excepting evil
and devil, in which the i is suppressed), matin
(excepting raisin and cousin, in which the
i is suppressed). On the other hand, the
final vowel should be suppressed in en and on,
thus, gard'n, bac'n (with the exceptions of
kitchen, chicken, etc.).
A common fault is to substitute other than
the correct sounds for unaccented vowels
when they stand alone, as e in society and

the first syllable of believe, and o in agony;
but though vowels thus placed should retain
their own sounds, they should not be exag-
gerated or dwelt upon.
All vowels in final unaccented syllables,
ending in r, are neutral in sound; thus,
nectar, remember, nadir, actor, sulphur,
labour.
The aspirate should precede the win
words beginning with wh, excepting who,
whole, etc., where the w has no power.
The principal guide to pronunciation is the
custom of educated society. When custom
varies, we may get help from analogy, by
comparing disputed words with words of
similar construction. Derivation will some-
times help to a decision, and euphony
and ease in utterance should receive con-
sideration.

READING ALOUD.
Reading aloud at sight is by far the most
difficult of all forms of speaking, and com-
paratively few accomplish it with complete
It is, of course, an immeasurable
advantage to take a preliminary through-
glance at the subject-matter, a course the
most skilful readers never fail to adopt
when opportunity allows. The extempore

beforehand, has the advantage of uttering
his own thoughts, and therefore has a fore-
knowledge of what is coming; the reciter,
or actor, has memorized his matter, thereby
making it his own, and has considered and
prepared its method of delivery; the reader
at sight has to make good his lack of such
advantages, practically on the spur of the
moment.
The ideal reader of ordinary prose is he
whose reading is so like speaking that a
listener, within hearing, but out of sight,
could not discriminate between them.
Classical literature and poetry need an
appropriate style and dignity, which should
be neither stilted nor colloquial. Poetical
drama is the reader's severest test,for beyond
the accomplishments which go to make up
the good reader, he becomes practically an
actor of many parts, unaided by movement,
gesture, and scenic surroundings, and can
be said to be completely successful only
when his manner of delivery is self-evident
indication of the characters.
One of the secrets of good reading is the
habit of keeping the eye in advance of the
tongue, thereby securing a momentary
advantage in which to probe and assimilate
the meaning and sentiment of the words to
be delivered. To achieve this one needs

33
a nimble and logical mind, responsive feel-
ings, and flexibility of voice.
The best proof that a reader understands
what he reads, and the only sure means of
giving the listener the full benefit of that
understanding, lies in his discrimination and
foresight in giving prominence, by emphasis
and inflection, to those words which mark
new thoughts, or the modification of thoughts
already expressed, and by similar means
directs the listener's attention to the rela-
tion of clauses sometimes widely separated.
Reading can be better done standing than
sitting, thereby facilitating breath control,
and the book should be rested, or held,
at a focus which permits of an erect and easy
attitude. A common and fatal fault is to
bow the head over the book; this obstructs
vocality and deprives the audience of the
reader's facial expression. For badness of
habit there is not much to choose between
the reader who bows his head over the book
and keeps it there, and he who lifts his head
at regular intervals in the manner of a bird
drinking
Reversing the injunction we received at
school, the eyes should be kept off the book
as much as possible, and on the audience,
thus giving it the benefit of unimpeded
vocality and facial expression.

Excellence in the art of reading aloud can
be acquired, like public speaking, only by
persistent practice.
Poetry makes additional claims upon
the reader. It calls for the recognition
of rhythm, rhyme, quantity, and cæsura,
and needs a finely balanced judgment in
keeping the sense clear, without sacrificing
the measures and cadences.
POETIC FEET.
There are three principal measures-
viz.:
Iambus-In sooth Ī know not why I am so sad.
(5 feet.)
Trochee-Who will be a traitor knave. (34 feet
=4 feet.)
Anapæst—May I govern my passion with absolute
sway. (4 feet.)
Some other measures are:
Dactyl-One more unfortunate gone to her rest.
(3) feet=4 feet.)
Spondee-Pure gold.
Amphibrach—Ī sprang to the saddle and Joris
and he. (33 feet=4 feet.)
Choriamb—A four-syllable foot, e.g.,
Ionic-A foot of four syllables consisting of a
spondee and a pyrrhic Ionic
major
Ionic minor
Tribrach-A foot of three short syllables


## p. 35 (#51) ##############################################

HANDBOOK OF ELOCUTION
35
Molossus—A foot of three long syllables -
Amphimacer (or Cretic) --A foot of three syllables
Pyrrhic—A foot of two short syllables
The great bulk of English poetry is com-
posed of the Iambus, Trochee, and Anapæst.
Some of the other measures are often used
as equivalences (or substitutes) in poems
whose prevailing measure may be one of
these three. More often, however, the
Iambus, Trochee, and Anapæst are equi-
valenced by one another.
Lines of 2 feet are called Dimeters;
3, Trimeters; 4, Tetrameters; 5, Penta-
meters; 6, Hexameters; 7, Heptameters;
8, Octameters. The number of feet in a
line is the number of accented syllables,
excepting when the foot is one of those
which has more than one accented syllable.

to an Alexandrine.

the first two short, the third long.

Alternate lines of four and three feet.
The second foot of the first line is the Iambic
equivalence of the Anapæst. The last
syllable of the second and fourth lines are
examples of Redundance, but the redundant
syllable, being light, is therefore not counted
as a foot. (See Trochaic example above.)
The last two feet of the third line are also
substituted equivalents in Iambs. If the
ed in “ discharged " be uttered as a syllable,
there would remain but one lamb, viz.,
“ well shot”-and even that could be con-
verted into an Anapæst by uttering the
“ fare” of “farewell ” as two syllables.
The better method, however, is to treat the
line as scanned above, viz., as two Anapæsts,
and two lambs, slightly prolonging the
Iambs to counterbalance the Anapæsts.
The simplest mode of ascertaining the
measure to which the poetry is written is
to mark off in short and long signs (--)
the first stanza, or first few lines, at the ear's
dictation, when the dominant metre will
reveal itself.
VOWEL SOUNDS.
All the vowel sounds are represented in
the following lists of words, but it must be
remembered that there are several letters


## p. 38 (#54) ##############################################

38
HANDBOOK OF ELOCUTION
which are used to represent the same sound,
and several sounds which are represented
by the same letter. The words selected are
such as, from their familiarity and univers-
ally recognized sounds, leave a minimum of
doubt as to what they represent. For pur-
poses of practice these vowels should be
separated from the consonants, and repeated
ad libitum. By occasionally shifting the pitch
of voice higher, or lower, relief may be found
from the weariness of reiteration, while at the
same time the student will be familiarizing
himself with the various ranges of his voice.
A simple vowel means one in which,
during production, the shape of the cavity
of the mouth remains fixed.
A compound vowel means one in which the
cavity is modified by movement of the articu--
lative organs during utterance.
Simple Vowel Sounds (Eleven).
These sounds should be produced with an
open mouth, the appropriate shape of the
cavity to be made by the tongue, lips, and
soft palate, and kept fixed during utterance.
The head should be erect and the mouth as
widely opened as the production of the re-
spective sounds will admit.

Compound Vowel Sounds (Twelve).
Showing how made up from the simple
sounds, and indicating the component which
is the more prolonged. The cavity is
modified during utterance.
Bale-The first part of this vowel is peculiar to
itself. The mouth should be put almost in
position for the vowel in bat, and the tongue
at once pressed upward for bee. Both sounds
are short, but the first sound should be
attacked smartly.
Bide-Bālm, bit.
Bone - Begins with a sound peculiar to itself.
The lips should be shaped as for the vowel
in box (the tongue not quite so depressed)
and the lips approximated as in boot. Both
sounds short, the first accented.
Bough—Bat, boot, but the first sound accented.
Bute-Bit, boot.
Boil-Bawl, bit.
BearBed, bird.
Beer-Bee, bird.
Boor-Boot, bird.
The compound vowels in bide, bough,
and bute gain an additional short sound of
the vowel in bird when the letter follows
them; thus, hire, sour, pure.
It is impossible to describe these com-
pound vowel sounds accurately on paper,
and the student in doubt should take the
sounds from a reliable speaker.

CONSONANTS (TWENTY-TWO).
Nearly all the consonants are produced
by contact of the articulative organs, which
are the tongue, lips, soft palate, gums,
teeth, and hard palate. The few exceptions
are produced by approximation of the organs.
More than half the consonants may be
classified in pairs, each pair being produced
in the same way, but one of each pair made
heavier by a sub-vocality. This sub-,
strangled-, or smothered-vocality is common
to many of the consonants—a forcible pro-
pulsion of breath is equally forcibly ob-
structed by the articulative organs.
List of Consonants.
P B, TD, F V, K G (hard), S Z, TH (light), TH
(heavy), SH, AH, I, L, M, N, P, W, Y, NG.
WH-Sometimes represents H and W, as in why.
R (smooth)-Needs no special use of the articula-
tive organs, but when it follows certain vowel
sounds, it adds the sound of bird by a slight
dropping of the jaw, as in bear, beer, and boor.
How to form the Consonants.
When repeating the consonants for prac-
tice, care should be taken to form them
vigorously.

P-Join lips firmly and separate explosively
without vocality.
B-Murmur and ditto.
T-Press tip of tongue against the upper gum
and separate explosively without vocality.
D-Murmur and ditto.
F-Press upper teeth on lower lip and push breath
against the obstruction.
V-Murmur and ditto.
K-Press back of tongue against soft palate and
separate explosively without vocality.
G (hard)-Murmur and ditto.
S—The teeth almost touch, and the tip of the
tongue almost touches the back of the teeth.
The breath is forced out with a hiss.
Z-The same, but with a buzz.
TH-Place the tip of the tongue next, and under,
the upper teeth, and press breath between.
TH (heavy)-The same, but substitute a murmur
for the breath.
SH—Similar positions as for S, but the teeth
meet, and the tongue is kept lower and drawn
slightly, back, leaving room for a wider hiss.
Protruding the lips is a common habit, but
unnecessary.
ZH—The same, but buzzing.
H–Merely a forcible expulsion of breath through
a slightly open mouth.
L-The tip of the tongue takes up the same posi-
tion as for T and D, but with less pressure,
and the mouth is freely filled with a smothered
vocality. When practicable, and without
interrupting the fluency of speech, it is desir-
able to produce L by curling the tip of the
tongue upward, resting the under-part on
the front part of the hard palate. This can
often be done, particularly when L is the initial
letter of a sentence, and when it is final.

It is necessary so to produce it when used
in double form, as in wholly, to distinguish
it from holy.
M- Join the lips and hum through the nose.
N—Similar position as for T, and hum through the
nose.
R_Vibrate the tip of the tongue against the upper
gum, making a burring sound something like
the vowel in bird.
W-Shape the lips as in the vowel in boot, then
forcibly release them.
Y-Assume the position for the vowel in bee, then
give a push with the tongue and a jerky move-
ment to the lower jaw.
NG—The back part of the tongue should be pressed
against the corresponding part of the soft
palate, and a metallic vibratory sound allowed
to pass down the nose.

articulative movement in transition from
one consonant to the other. Repeat the
consonants comprising the difficult combina-
tions separately and consecutively, slowly
at first, then quicker, until facility attained
of uttering the combination in one effort.
Repeated Consonants.
When an identical, or similar, consonant
immediately follows another, either in the
same word or separate words, both should
be recognized. This should be done without
calling undue notice to the effort. Though
difficult at first, it will become easy with
practice. To preserve fluency it will be
found possible to repeat some of the con-
sonants without actually separating the
organs used in forming them. Thus in the
word prime-minister, the second m may be
formed by keeping the lips together, and
using a resilient muscular movement. The
most troublesome are P B, TD, K G (hard).
One can hardly wish a friend "good-day
with a palpable pause between; on the other
hand, one should avoid the slipshod manner
which results in “ good’ay.”

APPENDIX I.
THINGS WORTH REMEMBERING
Acting—Make your first entrance in full realiza-
tion of the character; this is a matter of
the utmost importance; thereafter sus-
tain your part during every moment
you are on the stage, whether speaking
or not.
Your silent interest in the
dialogue, as evidenced by facial ex-
pression, gesture, and attitude, is often
as important to the character, and to
the play, as the words which are being
spoken.
-Be word-perfect in your own part and
practically so in the parts of the actors
with whom you come in dialogue con-
tact, and acquire a thorough knowledge
of the characters and purport of the
play as a whole.
-Some Passports to Success.- Personality,
and a good voice (under control);
powers of concentration, mimicry, im-
personation, emotional expression, and
imagination; education, or brains (or
both); strength, industry, enthusiasm,
courage, and a keen sense of humour.
-Excess of sensibility makes but middling
actors (Talma).
--An actor must have double consciousness
(Henry Irving).
--An interpretative art. Unlike other arts,
it lacks permanence.
-Diderot's theory is to regard the character
objectively, without personally feeling

any of the emotions portrayed. Coque-
lin (aîné) is accepted as the most suc-
cessful exponent of this method. On
the other hand, Madame Duse is said to
feel intensely the emotions of the char-
acters, and suffers the natural exhaus.
tion they produce. Such extremes in
method need unique actors to ensure
success. But every actor recognizes
the need of a dual consciousness.
Acting—Provides children with a unique and en-
joyable means of acquiring knowledge,
and of realizing the world they live in.
The object is not to make them actors,
but to inculcate the value of action.
Heywood, the Elizabethan dramatist, in
his Apology for Actors,” enumer-
ated the advantages which the junior
scholars derived from performing stage
plays during their residence in the
University. He says:
It teacheth audacity to the bashful.
It not only emboldens a scholler to speake,
but instructs him to speake well, and with
judgement; to observe his commas,
colons, and full poynts; his parenthesis,
his breathing spaces and distinctions; to
keep decorum in his countenance,
neither to frowne when he should smile,
nor to make unseemly and disguised
faces in the delivery of his words; not
to stare with his eies, draw awry his
mouth, confound his voice in the hollow
of his throat, or tear his words hastily
betwixt his teeth; neither to buffet his
deske like a madman, nor stande in his
place like a lifelesse image, demurely
plodding, and without any smooth and
formal motion. It instructs him to fit
his phrases to his action, and his action
to his phrase, and his pronunciation to
them both.”

Aspirates—When occurring in succession do not
need equal individual force.
-In unimportant words, and often in
personal pronouns if not beginning
sentence, aspirates may quite
rightly be ignored in colloquial
speech, e.g., He hopped from (h)is
hiding place and caught (h)er hand
and told (h)er he (h)ad heard (h)er.
-In the words hour, honest, honour, heir,
and their cognates, the aspirate is
ignored.
-Do not use more breath for them than
is necessary
Breath control—The master-key to easy and effec-
tive speaking
-Never exhaust the lungs of air.
-When inhaling, use the nasal
passages as much as possible.
-In the natural function of breath-
ing, the intake is slower than
the outgo. The secret of con-
trol in speaking lies in the skill
necessary to reverse this pro-
cess. Inspire quickly as op-
portunity permits, and expire
economically, consistent with
vocality required.
-An Exercise. - Inspire slowly
through the nasal passages,
retain, and expire slowly
through the mouth.
-Breathe centrally (naturally) and
avoid the extremes of clavicu-
lar (collar-bone), or abdominal,
methods.
-Inspire sufficiently for the phrase
that follows. Over-prolonged
inspiration results in accelerated
expiration.

52 HANDBOOK OF ELOCUTION
Consonants—Realize the difference between the
name of a consonant and its power.
-May be strengthened by forcible
reading in stage whispers.
-Should be firm and distinct, fluent
and accurate. May be classified:
(1) In accordance with the organs
used to produce them, as: Guttural,
Palatal, Dental, Labial, Lingual,
Sibilant, and Nasal. (2) Whis-
pered and Vocal (3) Explosive
or Sustained.
Coughing audience-A sign that the matter, or
method, of the speaker needs adjustment.
Dialogue-When not speaking, listen intelligently
and sustain the character.
Distinctness—Look after the consonants, and the
vowels will take care of them-
selves.
-One may be vocally audible, and
verbally indistinct.
Dropping the voice at a full-stop-Generally quite
right and natural, but sentences of a negative,
supplicatory, or interrogative nature, require
a suspensive or upward movement, e.g.:-
Lady, you utter madness and not sorrow."
"I do entreat your grace to pardon me.”
What, Michael Cassio, that came awooing
with you ?"
Effectiveness-Feel what you say in spite of
Diderot), and look what you feel.
Elocution—Is of great advantage to the con-
versationalist, and a necessity to
the public speaker.
-Enables persons of moderate abilities
to make themselves pleasing to those
whom they address, whether con-
versationally, or from the platform.
-Of paramount importance in the train-
ing of a singer.

Elocutionist—The actor or elocutionist is seldom
an orator, but an orator, no matter how great
his natural gifts may be, can never hope to
produce lasting effects unless he be a master
of elocution.
Emphasis--Occasionally falls on words which are
usually of relative unimportance, e.g.
" Government of the people, by the people,
for the people.”
Exaggeration - Per se is anathema to all artistic
work, but without artistic exaggeration to
counterbalance the disadvantages of distance,
the speaker's or actor's work becomes anæmic.
Expression-Entertain an idea before utterance.
-Voice, speech, and gesture should work
in harmony, prompted from within.
-Is not imitative, but personal, and
depends upon understanding, tem-
perament, emotional power, and
self-control.
Extempore speaking—The two essentials are
manner (elocution) and matter (thoughts).
The one is useless without the other.
Eyes—In narrative, direct them to the audience;
in description, towards that described; in
dialogue (conducted solus), towards the imagin-
ary party to it; and towards the ceiling or
floor only when necessary.
Facial expression-Should often precede, as well as
accompany speech.
-Without meaning, is grimace.
First words—The polite prefix to a speech, or the
announcement of the title of a
recitation, enables the speaker and
audience to find " themselves :
the former, by adjusting his voice
and manner to surrounding con-
ditions; the latter, by "settling
down,” and attuning its mind to
what is to follow.

en-
First words—Take particular care of the first
sentence the rest will
easier.
-If the matter permit, a gentle com-
mencement rivets attention.
-A steady inhalation through the
nasal passages before commencing
to speak composes the nerves.
GestureGesture that arrests attention to itself,
when used with words, is out of
place.
-Should convey to the eye what cannot
be conveyed to the ear.
When acknowledging applause,
deavour to express gratification, self-
respect, and deference.
Suit the action to the word, but not every
word.
-Without meaning, is grotesque.
-May be developed by acting dramatic
scenes in dumb-show.
-Acquire ambi-dexterity.
-Impassioned gesture should be the out-
ward expression of inward feeling, but
sometimes the assumption of an atti-
tude will stimulate the mental or
emotional condition desired.
Hands—Ignore them till they are wanted.
Imagination-Imagine yourself the character
speaking, and mentally see all you describe.
Imitation-Remember that art begins where imita-
tion ends.
Imitative Modulation-Can sometimes be appropri-
ately used with good effect, e.g., E. A. Poe's
The Bells.
Inaudibility—The final words of a sentence, being
often the lowest in tone, need
especial care in enunciation and
force.

»
Inaudibility-To“ keep the voice up" at the end
of a sentence is to find a re
remedy
worse than the disease.
- It is quite right to "drop the voice"
at the close of a conclusive clause;
the faults lie in diminishing vocal
force and feebler enunciation.
Individuality—Master principles: avoid imitation
and preserve your own personality.
Lip control—The lips are of the utmost import-
ance in enunciation; firstly, because vocal
sound is finally projected from them, and
their shape has much to do with the modify-
ing of sounds; secondly, because they are
the only articulative organs which are com-
pletely visible. The words of a perfect speaker
should be recognizable without seeing him,
but the sight of the correct use of the lips is
so pregnantly indicative of the words, that a
deaf person is thereby enabled to understand,
and if not also dumb (the double affliction is
rare), will be able to converse.
Loudness—The loudest speaker is often the most
indistinct Too much vocality is likely to
drown the consonants. The possessor of a
big voice should be more than ever careful
to adapt his pitch, pace, and intensity to
his auditorium.
Memorizing—First master the sense and sentiment,
then acquire the words.
-Words should be so perfectly memor-
ized that no mental effort should
be necessary to recall them; the
faculties are then free to develop
expression.
Musical accompaniments to spoken words—More
often a distraction from, than a help to, the
true interpretation; especially so when the
music is produced by someone other than the
speaker. At best, it should serve as a back-
ground only; at worst, it develops into a

musical work of its own. A reciter whose
powers are equal to the interpretation of his
author can afford to dispense with music,
costume, make-up, and other adventitious
aids.
Naturalness—Artistic exaggeration is necessary to
counteract the disadvantages of distance-
always with words, and sometimes with
gestures.
Nervousness—A blessing in disguise, for it usually
signifies sensitiveness. It is a valuable ser-
vant, but must be controlled by will and con-
centration, fortified by the certain knowledge
of ability to perform what you have under-
taken to do.
Pitch—Always begin in the middle key, unless,
for special reasons, another is more
suitable.
-To ascend is easy, to descend is hard.
Pitch and Force Adapt the tone to those near, and
use the force necessary to reach those afar
off.
Practice-Speaking (like swimming), to be ac-
quired, must be attempted.
-Exercise in producing the vowels and
consonants should be maintained daily
until strength and accuracy
assured, after which, daily practice
in audible reading or reciting should
be strictly continued.
Preparation-It is said that Dickens rehearsed
his pieces for six months before reciting them
in public.
Pronunciation—Is correct when each vowel is
given its precise sound, each
consonant its due value, and
the syllabic accent is true.
-One of the commonest faults is
the misplaced accent.

Quality (tone or timbre)-Difference in quality is
recognizable the
same pitch or note. In
instruments, it is deter-
mined by the accessory
sounds, and the number
and intensity of the
harmonics, which de-
pend again on the form
and nature of the
sounding box or board,
which, with regard to
the voice, the
pharynx, with the
neighbouring cavities
of the throat and nose.
-Is heard best on AH (the
easiest to produce), and
worst on EE (the most
difficult to produce).
-Is chiefly determined in
the pharynx, and by
the thickness of the
vocal cords.
Range of Voice -Average, say, two octaves, but per-
haps only four or five notes used in conversation;
the range is extended for platform speaking,
and still further extended for dramatic work.
Rate-Be slow, but don't seem slow.
Reading aloud-To the bad reader, all sentences
are alike; to the good reader, all
are different.
--Good reading is the foundation of
good speaking
-Do not read prose as if it were
poetry, nor poetry as if it were
prose.
-To cure monotony, read dramatic
scenes aloud, in a manner appro-
priate to the respective char-
acters.

Reading aloud-Don't always “ drop the voice at
a full-stop.” Plaintive and
negative sentences, and sen-
tences which leave an infer-
ence to be drawn, or which
imply innuendo, should finish
suspensively.
-Keep the eye in advance of the
tongue.
-Keep the eyes off the book as
much as possible.
- Reading may be coldly correct,
yet dismally dull.
-“ Of equal honour with him who
writes a grand poem is he who
reads it grandly” (Longfellow).
-Many who converse with variety
and charm, read monotonously.
-The commonest faults are rapidity
and monotony, which are inci-
dentally the cause of many
others.
-If Art is knowledge applied to
production, good audible read-
ing is undoubtedly an art.
--Choose all kinds of composition
for practice. The expressive
reading of the finest literature
in prose and verse calls the
reader to the same high plane
of thought upon which it was
conceived.
Repose-Learn to stand still—silent strength.
Restlessness—The best artist is he who gets his
effects in the fewest strokes. Redundancy
of gesture and movement should be avoided.
It shows lack of resource to perambulate
about the platform in an endeavour to express
what can be completely accomplished in a
couple of square yards.


## p. 59 (#75) ##############################################

HANDBOOK OF ELOCUTION 59
Rules-Forget rules when at work, and rely upon
the good habits acquired in practice.
Self-consciousness—Is caused by modesty or
conceit.
Self-possession-Can be acquired by the exercise
of will and absorption in one's work.
Shakespeare-Best understood when capably
acted. He wrote for the stage and was a
master of technique. Many passages, seem-
ingly obscure when silently read, become
transparently clear when acted. To read
Shakespeare intelligently in the library, one
should keep a mental eye focussed on the
stage.
Shakespeare's “ Fools”-At the top is Touch-
stone; at the bottom, Trinculo.
Singers and speakers-Singers should give more
attention to consonants
than speakers, owing to
the fact that in song the
frequent prolongation of
vowel sounds makes the
recognition of words less
easy
- The singer has to play his
instrument, but the com-
poser provides him with
tune and time. The
speaker has to play hiş
instrument, and is also
his own composer.
The
true expression of sense
and feeling concerns them
both. The speaker glides,
the singer leaps.
Soft palate Shuts off the nasal passages during
the production of vowels and consonants,
and also when swallowing.
Speaking and singing-In speaking, the voice slides
from one note to another; in singing, it leaps.

Speaking voice—Hullah says it is best formed and
soonest brought under control by the practice
of musical sounds.
Speech-Wonderful as it is, is a physical opera-
tion. The greater wonder is the mind which
directs it.
Speech sounds—Said to be recognizable a mile
away in calm weather on level ice.
Syllabic division-In dividing a word into syllables,
pronunciation is the guide, not etymology.
Teaching—The best teaching is that which aims
at developing the powers of expression
through the pupil's own personality. Pre-
cept and example should go hand in hand,
but any tendency in the pupil to slavish
imitation should be counteracted by the in-
culcation of principles. The test of good
teaching lies in the acquired ability of the
pupil to artistically exploit his innate powers
of expression to their utmost, through the
medium of his own individuality. The pupil
who is able to imitate, with more or less
success, the good, bad, or indifferent tones,
movements, and peculiarities of his teacher,
is a living advertisement of that teacher's
incapacity to teach, and the pupil may, in
time, learn to realize that he who robs him
of his personality has " left him poor indeed.”
The teacher's executive ability should be of a
high order, the higher the better, but super-
excellence in this respect is not an essential
to good teaching. The indispensable attri-
butes of a good teacher lie in a penetrative
understanding of the pupil's mental equip-
ment, temperament, and physical possibilities,
and the skilful and sympathetic adaptation
of his method of instruction in accordance
therewith. In the early days, a pupil should
be guided in his choice of selections for study,
but the sooner he is left to browse in literary
pastures, and choose for himself, the better,


## p. 61 (#77) ##############################################

HANDBOOK OF ELOCUTION 61
for it is natural that the piece which instinc-
tively appeals to the pupil ought to stand
the best chance of a true interpretation. It
follows that the teacher will often find him-
self confronted with a selection with which
he is unfamiliar, the nature and possibilities
of which it is his duty to explore and master,
if the true interests of the pupil are to be
served.
Teeth—Dental gaps are fatal to perfect speech,
notwithstanding the fact that all the speech
sounds can be produced without the aid of
teeth at all.
Textual Accuracy-A certain amount of licence
is allowable, and sometimes necessary, in
adapting modern compositions for special
purposes, either by means of omission, addi-
tion, or substitution of passages; especially
so in lighter or humorous works. But in
dealing with standard or classical authors, the
only liberty permissible is the bodily omis-
sion of certain passages from compositions
too lengthy for particular requirements; an
operation which calls for a very nice judgment.
The famous actress who recently recited
Shelley's ode To a Skylark in a skittish
modern-comedy fashion, did not improve
matters by adding to the end of the poem the
words: Aha! there you are !” pointing the
remark with a poke of her parasol at the sky.
Vocal sound—May be loud or soft (volume);
high or low (pitch): bright or
dull (quality).
-Said to be audible for ten miles
across the Straits of Gibraltar.
-You must think a note before you
can make it.
Voice Voice and speech are more reliable indica-
tions of breeding and character than the
face, and cannot be imitated by the
vulgar.

Voice To "place" the voice, is to make the best
use of the resonant chambers to secure
volume and tone.
-To "fix" the voice, is to control the ex-
piration—that is, to economise air in
the production of sound.
-Disraeli said that the most effective voice
is that which is low, with an underswell
of passion.
-Female voice an octave higher than male:
(1) Because the cords are shorter;
(2) Because the vibrating edges are
thinner.
-Good voice depends on good health.
Word pictures-Descriptions of scenes, etc., should
be placed well forward, and away from the

exact reverse, arsis meaning a light or short
syllable, and thesis a heavy or long one.
Art-The Elocutionary art may be said to consist
of knowledge of the principles practically
applied.
-Mechanical art shows hand dexterity.
-Fine art gives scope to genius.
-Holds the mirror up to nature.
-Ars est celare artem.
-In Painting, the characters seem to think;
in Literature, they disclose their thoughts;
in Acting they live.
--Art shows a true image; artifice a false one.
,, --The foundation of Art is organized preparation.
-The test of Art is not beauty, but truth.

Art—The highest Art is often combined with per-
fect simplicity.
-Science insists on uniformity; Art is variable.
-A technical foundational knowledge of any
art enables one the better to express per-
sonal inspirations.
Artistic temperament—Is imaginative, sensitive,
sympathetic, and concentrative. Sometimes
forgivably eccentric. Does not necess
essarily
include executive ability.
Assonance-A vowel rhyme only-not English.
Atonic-Without accent.
Ballad—A short poem of a narrative kind.
Ballad metre (or common measure) —Alternate
eight- and six-syllable lines. Even lines
rhyme, e.g.
“ He prayeth best who loveth best
All things both great and small:
For the dear God who loveth us,
He made and loveth all."
Ballade (French origin) -A poem of three stanzas
and an envoi, with a refrain at the end of each
stanza.
Blank verse-Unrhymed verse used in epic and
dramatic poetry. The noblest of
verses and the most difficult to
write and read. Lines generally
in five iambic feet. Longfellow's
Hiawatha is unique in its lines
of four trochaic feet.
-The difficulties in delivery lie in
combining dignity, style, and ful-
ness in enunciation and rhythmical
stress, with naturalness, and se-
quence in sense, in spite of cæsura.
Burlesque-A literary or dramatic composition in
wwhich serious things and characters
are parodied and ridiculed. Often
accompanied with music and dancing.

Cadence-An agreeable arrangement of inflec-
tions, used more particularly in reading poetry.
Cæsura—The slight rest of voice at the middle
or end of a line of poetry. It needs much
discretion in its application.

or by one syllable of the full normal measure.
Chant royal—A ballade enlarged and elaborated.
Five stanzas and an envoi.
Chorus (Greek drama)–From Sophocles (405 B.C.)
onward. It consisted of fifteen, arranged in
quadrangular form. It acted as the part
(1) of a dispassionate spectator, and (2) of a
guide to explain events supposed to happen

manners are pleasantly satirised. Not
extravagant.
--The first Greek comedy was in 562, B.C.
-The first English comedy was Ralph
Roister Doister, about 1551.
Common measureSee Ballad metre.
Consonance-In prosody-Agreement of sound.
-Sometimes used to designate full
rhyme of vowel and consonant, as
opposed to
Assonance (vowel
rhyme only).

Consonance In speaking and singing The
modification and augmentation of
sound in the resonating chambers
(chiefly the mouth and partly in
the throat and nose), in sympa-
thetic vibratory response to the
fundamental sound produced by
the vocal cords.
Couplet—Two lines of rhyming verse.
Deliberation—In speech, means, not slowness, but
control.
Diæresis—A sign of two dots over the second of
two vowels to indicate that each has a separate
sound, e.g., aërated, aërial, coöperation =
co-operation.
Diatonic scale-A scale which proceeds in the
ordinary mixture of tones and semi-tones. For
instance, CDEFGABC is a diatonic scale.
Diction-From dictio=a saying.
To make true diction of him, his
semblable is his mirror” (Hamlet).
- Outside elocutionary and musical circles,
the word retains its legitimate and
time-honoured significance, which is
the choice or selection of words in writing
or speech. In recent years the word
has been freely appropriated to signify
consonantal distinctness and vowel
purity. Strictly speaking, diction
bears the same relation to written
words (and extempore speech) as elocu-
tion bears to delivery. The one aims
at perfection in the choice of words,
the other at perfection of utterance.
A person who produces his vowels and
consonants, as they occur in syllables
and words, with fluent ease, distinct-
ness, and vowel purity, may be said
to speak with perfect enunciation.
Delivery, or enunciation, may be good or
bad, clear or indistinct, smooth or hard,

easy or laboured, polished or rugged,
and so forth, and the style or manner
of a person's delivery or enunciation
may be definitely indicated by the use
of these and other qualifying terms as
occasion
may require. When all is
said and done, the word “ Elocution,
if used with discretion, should meet
every need, but it should not be used
to describe the ear-torturing perform-
ances of those who rave or mumble and
do everything they ought not to do,
and nothing that they should. The
fatuously incompetent performances
which so frequently have to be endured
under the name of elocution have
associated it in the minds of many
with something unpleasant but
diction” is an unsatisfactory substi-
tute, and the use of it as a synonym for
good speaking is arbitrary and confusing.
If a special word is needed, "speech-
beauty ” would be more definite.
Diction—"Diction means the construction of sen-
tences, not their delivery. The dic-
tion of a speaker may be excellent,
but his articulation and pronunciation
execrable (vide Lancelot in The
Referee, 22nd December, 1918).
Didactic-Technical and instructive.
Digraph-A double letter. The symbol may repre-
sent a vowel or a consonant, e.g., physic and
æsthetic are digraphs.
Diphthong—A compound or double sound. There
are four generally recognized diph-
thongs, represented thus: į or ay
or ai, ou or ow, eu or ew or U,
oi or oy; to which may be added
a as in bale, and o as in bone, and
the three compound sounds
heard in hive, sour, pure.
as

HANDBOOK OF ELOCUTION 69
Diphthong-To describe a diphthong as the
union of two vowels in one sound"
is not strictly correct. If the result
is a single sound, it is a written or
improper diphthong, or, in other
words, a double letter or digraph,
e.g., esthetic.
The letters į and
u are diphthongs although repre-
sented by only one letter. When
three vowel-letters come together
it is called a triphthong, as, beauty;
in this case the sound is double
only, not triple; it is therefore a
diphthong in fact.
Distich—A synonym for “couplet.” There should
be a certain completeness of sense.
DithyrambA poem written in a wild, impetuous
strain.
Doggerel—Slipshod or inferior verse.
Drama-Consists of comedy and tragedy. (Both
originated with the Greeks.) A poetic or
prose composition intended to present a
picture of real life, and to be represented in
character, on the stage. It is built up on the
interaction of interesting individualities, and
their relation to the circumstances in which
they are placed.
Eclogue-A pastoral poem.
Elegy-Mournful or dirge-like poetry.
Elision-Syncope. The cutting out of a vowel
for the sake of rhythm, as, Distraction in's
aspect.”
Ellipsis—The omission of one or more words which
the hearer or reader can supply. In printing,
indicated thus: km-g, or * * *, or .
Elocution-Literally, to speak out; but the word
is now used to signify, not only the effective
use of the voice, but also those invaluable
aids to expression-gesture and facial play.
The ideal to be aimed at is a delivery in which

the vowel sounds are pure, the enunciation
of the consonants distinct, and the expres-
sion such as will display all the eloquence,
force, and beauty of which the words are
capable.
Eloquence Depends not so much upon choice of
words as the power to evoke sympathy and
stir the feelings.
Emphasis-The prominence given to certain words
or clauses, usually by vocal stress.
End-stopped-A term applied more particularly
to blank verse to indicate that the line is self-
contained. Shakespeare frequently runs the
sense on into the next line.
Enjambment-The overlapping, in sense, of one
line on another.
Enunciation—The utterance of vowels and con-
sonants as they occur in syllables and words.
Perfect enunciation must be distinct, pure,
and fluent. (See Diction.)
Epic-A long poem, grand in style, and mainly
narrative in form, which deals with heroic
legends and historical, or fictitiously historical,
events, e.g., Homer's Iliad, Milton's Paradise
Lost.
Epiglottis—The lid of the voice-box, which closes
during the act of swallowing. It opens and
shuts facing towards the back of the neck-
that is to say, the “ hinge" is in the front part
of the windpipe.
Epigram-An apparent contradiction, as, Con-
spicuous by its absence ” (Disraeli).
-A short poem of a pointed, neat, or
antithetical character.
Epilogue -A poem or speech at the end of a
play.
Equivalence (substitution)-The substitution of
one poetic foot for another. Most prevalently
found in poetry written in iambic measure,

the substitution usually being an anapæst,
e.g., iambic measure with the first foot
equivalenced
' And her eyes were wild ” (Keats).
This particular equivalencing is frequent in
Shakespeare.
Etymology_That part of philology which deals
with the origin of words.
Euphemism-Favourable speech of persons or
things, who or which, ordinarily, are not
pleasing. The substitution of a delicate word
for one which is offensive.
Euphony-Pleasing sounds.
Euphuism-Fastidious elegance and delicacy of
language.
Eye-rhymes-E.g., Love-grove.
Arm-warm.
These are not rhymes. The test of rhyme is
pronunciation, not spelling.
Facial expression-The language of the counten-
ance.
False vocal cords (or ventricular bands)—Two mem-
branes situated above the true cords. They
help, with the epiglottis, to protect the
larynx during swallowing, and ease any muscu-
lar shock caused by coughing, etc.
FarceExtravagant drama. Its object is merri-
ment. Characters and situations are exag-
gerated, and truth and nature travestied.
Female rhyme-On the last two syllables. Double
rhyme.
Feminine rhyme or ending—A term applied to the
use of words with a final e, which made
another syllable—now mute.
Foot-A syllabic measure in poetry. Usually of
two or three syllables, of which, generally one
only is long (or heavy), the other, or others,
short (or light). (See Poetic Feet.)
Force-Air-pressure from the lungs on the vocal
cords.

Fourteener-A line of seven iambic feet.
Fricative-A term applied to those consonants
which admit of prolongation, such as f, v, s,
2, sh, xh.
Gesture —A bodily movement prompted by the
desire to express more than the words con-
vey. It usually accompanies words, but may
be effectively used without them.
Glottis—The slit, or chink, between the vocal
cords, running from front to back of the wind-
pipe.
Grammar-A system of rules for speaking and
writing a language; as affecting words, it is
accidence; as affecting sentences, it is syntax.
Harmonics—The secondary, or accessory sounds,
recognizable in consonance with a funda-
mental note from an instrument, or from the
vocal cords, the quality of which is deter-
mined by the nature and capacity of the re-
sonating chambers.
Head-rhyme -A term sometimes applied to
alliteration.
Hendecasyllable-An eleven-syllabled line.
Heroic couplets-Lines of five iambic feet rhyming
in pairs. Used in translating epic or heroic
poetry.
Hiatus—The juxtaposition of vowels either in the
same word, or at the end of one word and the
beginning of the next, e.g., hollaing, China
asters, the ear. The temptation is to bridge
it with a consonant, e.g., The idea(r) of
it.”
Hudibrastic-Bombastic in style, and loose and
irregular in metre.
Hyperbole-Exaggeration in language. Her
eyes outshine the stars."
Idyll—A tale in prose or verse of rustic life; but
Tennyson's Idylls of the King are any-
thing but rustic.

Inflection—The upward or downward glide of the
voice, usually at, or near, the end of a clause
or sentence.
Innuendo-Insinuation.
Inversion—" Hold you the watch to-night ?"
Irony and Sarcasm-In Irony the opposite is said
to what is meant. In Sarcasm a man says
what he means, but implies contempt.
Language--Strictly speaking, is the living utter-
The germs of spoken language are to
be found wherever a meaning is intended.
Spoken language is the means by which
an idea is conveyed from one to another.
Gesture and facial expression are silent univer-
sal languages, with clearly defined limita-
tions. If the basis of writing was the imita-
tive drawing of natural objects, it is feasible
to suppose that language originated by the
imitation of sounds. Written or printed lan-
guage preserves the thought, but the reader
has to interpret it for himself.
Larynx-The voice-box. Consists of five principal
cartilages: (1) Cricoid, or the Ring
(Foundation); (2) Thyroid, or the
Shields (Sides); (3) Epiglottis, or Lid;
(4) Arytenoid, the Pyramids
(Muscles attached to the cords);
(5) the Cords.
-The larynx rises during high notes, and
descends in low ones, but the move-
ment does not affect the pitch; it is
caused by the muscular exertion at the
base of the tongue.
Liquids—The name given to the consonants
L, M, N, and R, because of their easy organic
contact and combination with other letters.

-A synonymous term for feet, as,
iambic measure. Also used to
distinguish a group of lines made
up of particular feet, as,
' long
measure, etc. Sometimes the word
is used to denote the number of feet
in a line, as, monometer, dimeter.
(See Poetic Feet-ante.)
Melodrama—Originally was vocally and instru-
mentally, accompanied; it now consists of
highly-spiced domestic scenes. All that is left
of the music is the agitated strings, known as

called “ feet.” The poem need not
necessarily consist throughout of the
same kind of foot, but may be partially

the addition of certain seven inter-
mediate sounds makes the diatonic
scale.
Octosyllabic-Lines consisting of eight syllables.
Ode—A dignified poem or song of a lyrical nature.

Phrasing-The oratorical grouping of words.
Vocal punctuation. It does for the ear what
the printer's marks do for the eye, only better.
Breath control must be so exercised that
groups of words may be uttered in un-
broken sequence in a manner calculated
to produce the best effect vocally, logically,
or emotionally. The primary object is ex-
pression; the secondary, breath control.
Pitch—The key (or in singing terms, the register),
appropriate to particular passages. Narration
would be best suited with a middle pitch, and
so on.
Play-A dramatic composition, usually not so
light as a comedy, nor so heavy as a tragedy.
Pleonasm-Redundant or superfluous words, e.g.,
The entire monopoly. A new discovery.
Poetic stress-There are three co-existent stresses,
viz., Rhythmical, Rhetorical, and Grammati-
cal; or, Syllabic, Emphatic, and Accentual.
Poetry—A fine art which has for its object the
creation of intellectual pleasure, by the
use of imaginative and passionate lan-
guage. Generally written in regular
measure or metre. Some classical prose
is poetical; and some poetry, perfect in
metre, is prosaic in matter and lan-
guage. Poetry is distinguished by re-
finement of style and purity of diction;
intensity and pregnancy of thought;
the occasional retention of old words,
and the omission of small ones.
Its
subjects may be historical, biographical,
descriptive, reflective, or dramatic.

Poetry—Among the various kinds of poetry are
the following: Epic, Lyric, Dramatic,
Idyllic or Pastoral, Elegaic, Ballad,
Romantic, Satirical, Didactic, Sonnet,
Blank Verse, Epigram, Ode, and
Humorous. (See GLOSSARY for descrip-
tions.)
Poise The alternation of heavy and light
syllables.
Poulter's measure-Lines in alternate alexandrines
and fourteeners, i.e., six and seven iambic
feet.
Prologue-A poem or speech recited before the
representation of a play.
Pronunciation Standard English pronunciation
may be said to be that used by the well-bred
and well-educated classes in London, among
whom, however, may be found a few black
sheep, who twist and distort the language, and
who may be classified as pedantic, affected,
careless, and peculiar.
Prosody—That part of grammar which treats of
quantity, accent, and the laws of versification.
Pun—The same word used in a different sense.
Quality—Voices are by nature clear, mellow, or
sonorous, muffled, nasal, or guttural.
Quantity-Syllables are long or short in quantity.
Long, if prolongable, as, foe; short, if shut
in by an explosive consonant, as, rat.
Quatrain (or Quartet)—A group of four lines usually
united in themselves and separated from
others by rhyme.
Quintet—Similar to quatrain, but consisting of five
lines.
Rate—The pace or time in delivery, which is
determined by the subject-matter. It is of
the utmost importance to adapt rate of speak-
ing appropriately to the matter. Speeches,
recitations, plays, etc., may be quite ruined
by failing to do so.

'mixed,"
RedundanceAn extra syllable at the end of a line.
Refrain (or Burden)-An identical or similar re-
curring line.
Registers-To speak of "chest," medium,
throat, falsetto,” and “ head
registers, is to create confusion. A register is
a series of tones produced by the same method,
viz., the vibration of the vocal cords. These
tones may be divided into three groups: the
lowest, the middle, and the highest. During
the lowest, the cords vibrate in their entirety;
during the middle tones the edges only vibrate;
and during the highest only a small part vi-
brates.
Repetition-Used to give greater intensity, e.g.,
Arm! Arm! It is! It is! the cannon's
opening roar !"
Resonance-May be said to result from a well-
opened mouth, and the directing
of the vocalized breath as far for-
ward in the mouth as possible,
thereby converting the cavity and
roof of the mouth into a sounding-
board, taking care that no
escapes without paying toll in
sound.
-Resonance varies according to the
elasticity and dimensions of the
pharynx, and modifies the quality,
but not the pitch, of the primary
sound.
Resonance is a somewhat elusive
quality; many possess it, but
hardly know how they produce it.
It is not loudness. A railway-arch
is a good resonator, and amplifies
the principle.
-The resonating chambers augment
sound by the responsive vibra-
tion, over their whole surface, of
that set up by the fundamental
air

note. The principle is exemplified
by plucking a violin string, first
detached from, then attached to, a
violin body. The string vibrating
alone, establishes contact with a
thin column of air only, but when
attached to the body of the violin,
the vibrations are communicated
to the surface of the resonating
chambers, which in turn agitate
the adjacent air.
Resonance Chambers—The cavities of the mouth,
throat, and nose.
Rhetoric_The theory of oratory.
Rhyme-A correspondence of sound in the final
syllable or syllables of two or more words.
The three essentials to a perfect rhyme are:
(1) Identity of vowel sound (and final con-
sonant, if any), as try and cry, sight and light.
(2) Difference in the consonant preceding the
vowel, as way and lay. (3) Similarity of
accent, as sing and fling; singing and fling
are bad rhymes. The following are single,
double, and triple rhymes: band and hand,
trying and crying, scrutiny and mutiny.
Rhyme royal-Invented by Chaucer. A seven-
lined stanza of five iambic feet, rhyming
thus: a,b,a,b,b,c,c. (See The Rape of Lucrece.)
Rhythm-An orderly succession of heavy and light
syllables, not necessarily metrically perfect.
Prose may be rhythmical if the language is
smooth and well balanced.
Romantic poetry-Poems of heroes and adventures,
legendary or real.
Rondeau (or Rondel) -—A form of poetry in which
lines are repeated at intervals.
Sapphic-A classical metre consisting of three lines
of eleven syllables, and one of five. Seldom
used in English. Swinburne affords the best
examples.

Sonnet—The best-known form is that immortalized
by Shakespeare, viz., fourteen lines of five
iambic feet, the first twelve rhyming
alternately, and
the last two rhyming
together
Sound-Produced by vibration of a solid body or
the undulations of a fluid.
Speech-Is vocal sound, modified in the cavity of
the mouth into vowels, and moulded into
words by the articulating organs in forming
consonants. It is also the calculated method
by which an idea is conveyed from one intelli-
gence to another. Probably the beginnings
of language were imitated sounds.
Spontaneity — Generally the result of infinite
pains in preparation. To yield to sudden
impulse while at work is dangerous, though
every artist is conscious of the stimulating
effect of a sympathetic audience, enabling
one to vivify and intensify meaning and
emotions.

Staccato-A disjointed, abrupt method of speak-
ing sometimes used when every word calls
for emphatic force, as “Iman itching-
palm !" Julius Cæsar).
Stage whisper-A quality of voice suitable for
dying speeches, confidential
asides, etc. Th reduction of
vocality to a minimum necessi-
tates very forcible enunciation,
in order to remain distinct and
intelligible.
—“ The windy suspiration of forced
breath (Hamlet).
Stammering—Generally a hesitation in uttering the
vowel sounds. (The stutterer's difficulty lies
in attempting to unite the consonants with
the vowels.) In both cases there may be
organic defects, and probably there is an
abnormal irritability of the nervous system.
Careful breathing, articulation exercises, and
a determination to overcome, by public and
conversational speaking, the nervous reserve
which such troubles provoke, will often prove
beneficial.
Stance—The position of the feet. For general
purposes standing should combine strength
with an easy grace, one foot a little in advance
of the other, and the main weight of the body
on one leg. Some people stand with the ele-
gance and strength of a kitchen chair.
Standard English-See Pronunciation.
-Colloquial, and platform Eng-
lish are much the same, ex-
cepting that the platform
calls for more forcible
utterance. But the frequent
abbreviations,
such
don't," and shouldn't,"
I'm," and I've,” etc.,
go to make up that ease
and fluency in speech which

is as desirable on the plat-
form as in conversation. It
is only in the delivery of the
finest literature, and in the
highest flights of oratory,
that more care and precision
is appropriate.
Stanza -A group of lines—always rhyming.
-A Spenserian stanza has nine lines; eight
of five iambic feet, and the last an
alexandrine (i.e., six iambic feet), and
was invented by Spenser.
Stress-An added force of voice laid on a syllable
or syllables. As affecting syllables in words,
it is accent; as affecting poetry, it is rhythm.
As affecting whole words, it is emphasis.
StropheThe first stanza or division of a Greek
Choral Ode. The second division is called
Antistrophe, and the third Epode. The number
of lines in a division vary; the rhymes are
irregular; the lines are of differing lengths,
and the feet equivalenced. Gray's Bard
furnishes an example of its English form.
Syllable -A single vowel or collection of letters con-
taining only one vowel sound; but a com-
pound vowel may be used as one syllable.
Syncope---In Elocution-Elision. In Music-A
certain accent in the division of a note.
Synepy-The interjunction of words. A clause, to
a speaker, is one oratorical word.
Synonym --A word having the same or similar
meaning as another-just-equitable.
Syntax-See Grammar.
Synthesis—A putting together.
Tautology-The use of superfluous words, e.g.,
To rail aloud.
TechniqueOf the voice-Its mechanism and
management. Its healthy production, em-
ployment, and development. Of the platform

and the stage-Deportment, movement, and
gesture, appropriate to the verbal matter, the
character, and the exigencies of the stage.
Terza rima-A three-lined verse. The first and
third lines rhyme together, while the middle
line rhymes with the first and third lines of the
next verse, and so on. (See Shelley's Ode to
the West Wind.)
Tragedy-See Drama.
--A dramatic poem, representing an im-
portant event or series of events, in
the life of some person, or persons,
in which the diction is elevated, and
which has generally a tragic or fatal
catastrophe.
-“ Tragedy is always the clash of two
powers, necessity without, freedom
within; outsi a great rigid, arbi-
trary law of fate; inside, the un-
defeated, individual will, which can
win its spiritual triumph, even when
all its material surroundings and en-
vironment have crumbled into hope-
less ruin (W. L. Courtney, The Idea of
Tragedy.)
-In Greek tragedy, Fate and Destiny
surround a man; in Shakespearean
tragedy, the man's destiny is within
himself. The fault, dear Brutus, is
not in our stars, but in ourselves, that
we are underlings" (Julius Cæsar).
—Thespis first introduced dialogue into
the Greek Chorus (535 B.c.). Xschylus
added scenery, increased the number
of actors, and reduced the chorus.
-The first English tragedy
Gorboduc, performed in 1562.
-The principal difference between the
construction of Greek and Modern
tragedy is that the Greek has few
was

characters and a chorus, while the
Modern has no chorus and many more
characters and incidents.
Triolet-A short French form of the rondeau, in
which the first of eight lines is repeated in the
fourth and seventh, the second being also re-
peated in the eighth, so that there are only
five lines of independent sense.
Verse-Poetry as opposed to prose.
-A batch of lines of poetry.
-Sometimes used to indicate a single line of
poetry.
Verse-paragraph-A batch of blank verse lines
knit together by a close connection of sense,
and requiring careful suspensory treatment in
delivery, to preserve the sequence till the close.
Versification-Prosody. Every principle of English
versification may be found exemplified in the
works of Shakespeare.
Vocal cords—Two ledges of delicate elastic-like
and pearly-white membrane, stretched hori-
zontally across the voice-box, at the top of
the windpipe, and resembling, when approxi-
mating to one another in the act of speech, a
split drum-head. Average length, half an inch.
Vocal sound Sound is vibration. Musical sound
is a regulated succession of vibra-
tions. Voice is sound originated
in the larynx by the action of the
breath upon the edges of the cords.
-It is possible to produce 240 inter-
vals of sound, i.e., ten between
each semitone. This is effected
by the minute variation (in ten-
sion and relaxation) of the cords,
of Tuboth of an inch.
-The modifying effect of varying the
shape of the cavity of the mouth
is exemplified in the successive
production of EE, A, AH, 0, 00,

the progression being from the
back of the mouth to the front.
A similar result is obtained by
extending a vibrating reed.
Volume Is determined in the pharynx.
Vowel-music—The pleasure given to the ear by
the euphonious utterance of vov sounds,
especially in poetry of choice diction, where
the sound is made to suit the sense.
Weak-ending-A term used for a line of poetry
with a redundant syllable, though the line
is often the stronger for it.
