The beauty of thy voice.”

Logic differeth from Rhetoric, not only as the fist from the palm,
the one close, the other at large; but much more in this, that
logic handleth reason exact and in truth, and rhetoric handleth it
as it is planted in popular opinions and manners."
“And even things without life giving sound, whether pipe or harp,
except they give a distinction in the sounds, how shall it be known
what is piped or harped ? For if the trumpet give an uncertain
sound, who shall prepare himself to the battle? So likewise ye,
except ye utter by the tongue words easy to be understood, how
shall it be known what is spoken ? For ye shall speak into the air.
There are, it may be, so many kinds of voices in the world, and
none of them is without signification. Therefore, if I know not
the meaning of the voice, I shall be unto him that speaketh a
barbarian, and he that speaketh shall be a barbarian unto me."

ART OF
ELOCUTION.
RHETORIC—like Music, Painting, Sculpture-is a great
department of the universal Art of Expression. It concerns
the clothing of a thought in the most appropriate and
effective language; the statement of fact, the construction of
argument, the selection and use of imagery, the play of
sentiment, and the appeal to passion.
Elocution is a department of Rhetoric, and yet is a special
Art complete in itself, being governed by special rules to
produce a given result. It concerns the management of the
voice in reading and speaking correctly and expressively.
The practical importance of this branch of education is
becoming more generally recognised. It seems strange that
it should have been so long neglected by those whose
principal duty it is to read and speak in public. The
immediate effect of speaking depends quite as much upon
voice and manner as upon matter. Unless manner (includ-
ing, of course, voice) is effective, the thought is not readily
apprehended in its fulness, but is obscure,
dis-
torted, or otherwise imperfect. In church, good and
expressive reading is not inconsistent with true devotional

.
feeling. To read a Scripture lesson in monotone, or in a
dull unimpressive style, is burlesque and not reverence.
Burlesque is simply incongruity between thought or senti-
ment and its expression. A Scripture lesson contains force
and music of language, dramatic incidents, poetic imagery,
philosophic and doctrinal statement, pathetic appeal and
terrible warning. To deal with these, without variety of
expression and change of voice, as if they were all of exactly
the same value and intended to produce but one impression,
is to miss their meaning and effect. The voice and expres-
sion should therefore be varied, but within certain limits
consistent with the general tone of a church service, and the
devotional character of the exercise. A Scripture lesson can
be read effectively without being turned into a Recitation
or a Reading, consciously intended for dramatic effect. But
the benefits of elocutionary training are of universal appli-
cation. The dreary discursive monologues at the bar are
even a greater infliction than the jokes of the judges. Our
representative institutions have made us a debating people;
and a man's influence greatly depends upon his capability of
expressing his thoughts with clearness, precision, and effect.
Elevated thought and earnest sentiment are comparatively
useless, unless there is also the command of the machinery
of Expression.
It has been objected that an artificial system places the
speaker under a certain restraint by preventing the free play
of his natural qualities; but where these natural qualities are
bad, improvement by means of any system is a desirable
thing. There is, however, no ground for the objection, which
might just as well be brought against the systematic. study of
music or painting. A thorough training in the Art of Elocution

is calculated to render practically available each good quality
which the student naturally possesses, whilst it enables
him to discover and get rid of those defects of which he
is thus, probably for the first time, made sensible. Of course
a slavish adherence to every rule of detail is not recommended;
but the fact that a speaker has undergone previous training
in Elocution will be displayed not so much by his attention
to technicalities as by the general improvement of his style.
His speaking becomes more confident, his voice has a wider
range, and he finds that it has become as easy and natural
to speak correctly and expressively as it was before to speak
incorrectly and without effect.
PRODUCTION OF VOICE.
>
Mr. Hullah, in his “ Cultivation of the Speaking Voice,"
quotes the following from Professor Willis.—“ The vocal
mechanism may be considered as consisting of lungs or
bellows, capable of transmitting by means of the connecting
windpipe a current of air through an apparatus contained in
the upper part of the windpipe which is termed the larynx.
This apparatus is capable of producing various musical (and
other) sounds which are heard after passing through a variable
cavity consisting of the pharynx (the cavity behind the tongue),
mouth, and nose.” The force of the voice-that is, the extent
of the vibrations in the air-depends upon the healthy state of
the lungs, the capacity of which may be increased by practice in
uttering the open vowel sounds, frequently taking breath.
The larynx is described as "a cartilaginous box, the encom-
passing parts or walls of which (susceptible of very various
though not very extensive motion) regulate the tension of cer-
tain ligaments called the vocal cords, which under the influence

of the breath are the immediate causes of the voice.” The
vowels, or pure elementary vocal sounds, therefore are
produced by or in the larynx ; these are modified by the
pharnyx, mouth, and nose, such modification being dis-
tributed into the great variety of consonants. This then,
shortly, is the speaking apparatus: the wind power in the
lungs, the larynx acting upon the vocal cords for the
production of the elementary voice, the consonant system
transforming that voice into words by the modifications
of it rendered possible by the pharynx, the mouth, and the
nose.
It has been said that, as the Art-student is bound to study
anatomy for the purpose of technical accuracy, so it is useful
for the speaker to have some knowledge of vocal physiology.
In both cases, however, the true artistic effect would consist,
not in the application of such technical knowledge only
(pictures are not simply drawings from an anatomical museum),
but in the individuality, power and general truthfulness of
expression shown by the artist. Granted that physiological
knowledge may be essential to the figure painter, it does
not follow that eloquence of speech is dependent upon the
special knowledge that could only be acquired by a Throat-
Doctor. It may be that this is only a plea for ignorance, but
a knowledge of causes (highly useful in many conceivable
cases) is not always productive of the best results. The voice
is a "result” with which everybody is familiar, and it is rather
the government of the voice, the possible extent and power of
which the speaker is himself able to estimate, that demands
the immediate attention of the practical elocutionist.
At the same the labours of well-known throat specialists
have been of immense benefit to those who have to use their

voices frequently, such as clergymen, barristers, actors, and
actresses, singers, and other men and women whose living
depends upon the effective manner in which they produce
words which are intended to be either “said or sung.” Some
valuable information, for instance, is given by Dr. Lennox
Browne and his learned German coadjutor in the book
entitled “Voice, Song, and Speech," although these gentlemen
appear to attach as much importance to diet and regimen of
health, as to any of the more abstruse scientific details relating
to the production of the voice.
The vocal apparatus has already been generally described.
The following is a clear description, for which we have to
thank the authors above mentioned. The human voice
considered as a musical instrument consists of four parts ;
(1) The Chest or Thorax and the Lungs containing the air,
which is the motor element; (2) The windpipe or Trachea,
in which the air is carried up and down; (3) The voice box or
Larynx, in which are situated the vocal ligaments forming the
vibrating element; (4) The upper part of the throat or Pharynx,
the mouth and nasal passages, forming the resonator.
The
small or thin vocal ligaments produce the high or soprano and
tenor voice, and the large or thick the deeper or contralto and
bass.
A knowledge of the way in which to pitch the voice suitably
for a particular room or audience is, of course necessary.
The inexperienced speaker will perhaps shout at the top of
his voice, and it is only practice under experienced advice
which will make him conscious of the necessity of proportion
in command and use of voice to produce the best effects.
One great error, no doubt a natural one, especially in women
speakers, is to raise the pitch of voice when making the

exertion to speak loudly, and the voice gets out of range and
practically unmanageable. Too much force in speaking is to
be as much deprecated as too little. The voice should be
strengthened as the first object of the student; then its range
or compass should be varied and improved, so as to make it
equally adapted for declamatory or pathetic speaking, and then
all the delicate inflections which add so much point to words
and continuity to clauses and sentences might be studied.
Vocal sound results from vibration, and the pitch of voice
largely depends upon the rapidity with which these vibrations,
coming in contact with the outer air, are produced. These
vibrations come in contact with the means of hearing, the
communicating medium being the air, and a reciprocal series
of vibrations is caused. Loudness is the result of a large
vibration, and a great deal depends upon the state of the
atmosphere in which the voice is used. Pitch is dependent
upon the rapidity of the vibrations, an enormous number of
which, perhaps inappreciable to the speaker, are unconsciously
used. The voice is not simply a number of explosive sounds,
but sounds regulated and modulated. Loudness and pitch
are accounted for by the vibrations. Quality depends largely
upon the actual power of the individual voice, and is, in fact,
what is usually called modulation, i.e., the differences of tone
which can be produced by a particular voice-no voice being
exactly alike in its purely natural tone and range. The con-
nection of tone with loudness has been often discussed. But
while loudness, relatively, has been said to be the basis of
tone (in one sense this is a truism), it can hardly be said to
be a sure guide, because loudness in men often results in
growling, and in women of screeching, and both these
extremes are outside the natural limits of the speaking voice.

ARTICULATION.
The first, and perhaps the most important, department of
Elocution, is that which concerns Articulation. This may be
taken, for present purposes, to mean the clear and exact ren-
dering by the voice of the sounds indicated by the collection
of signs contained in a word. A word is a collection of
sounds which, if properly expressed, conveys a distinct mean-
ing. The object of speech is the conveyance of thought; the
first thing to be desired, therefore, is that the speaker should
be understood, that the sound of his voice should be recognized
as words. An audience must clearly hear his words and per-
ceive his meaning before their feelings can be moved by his
expressive delivery; consequently, all the various sounds
which are combined in a word must be properly articu-
lated in order that the word may be recognized. A word
contains a number of sounds blended into one
characteristic sounds. Articulation concerns two things-
first, audibility; second, distinctness. Audibility consists in
the force with which the vowel sounds uttered ;
distinctness, in the clearness and accuracy of the consonant
sounds and influences, for consonants often have no sound.
The test of audibility is the distance at which the voice can
be heard; that of distinctness, the distance at which the
words can be recognized.
A word is a collection of letters. To each letter, or sign, a
certain sound is attached, which is modified with great
variety when letters are placed in combination with each
other and form words. A practical knowledge of these
elementary sounds, or an ability to produce them (perfection
in which is often rather acquired than natural), is the basis of
or more

Elocution. The alphabet is divided into vowels and
consonants. A vowel is a pure vocal sound- an exertion of
the voice proper.
A consonant is dependent upon a vowel, and cannot be
named or described without its aid. A consonant does not
so much represent a distinct sound itself, but its function
consists in influencing the pronunciation of vowels. Thus in
the word bar the consonants govern the pronunciation,
although taken separately they have no articulate sound.
Consonants stand as signs for some particular formation of
the lips, teeth, tongue, &c.-in some cases for a simple
aspiration of the breath. Vowels may be considered the raw
material of speaking, consonants the means of moulding that
material into an infinite variety of form.
Each syllable in a word, and of course each word in a
sentence, however unimportant or unemphatic, must be
distinctly and clearly pronounced. The common habit of
slurring unaccented syllables must be avoided.
If a word begins with the same consonant as that with
which the previous word closes, the two distinct sounds must
be given-the first word must be fully pronounced before the
second is begun : as, for instance, found drowned instead of
foun-drowned. If there is any difficulty in preventing these
two sounds from being merged into one, a slight pause
must be made between them. This pause, if properly
made, need not cause the speaking to appear either formal
or disjointed.
The following are some of the principal sounds in accented
and unaccented syllables; the difference between long
vowels, as in bate, and short, as in bat, will be noticed :-

Practice in the above representative sounds with a full
inspiration of the breath before each, will strengthen the voice
and enable the student to discover whether he has at command
the elements of spoken English.
CONSONANTS.
The title of this element of speech coming from a Latin
word meaning “to sound together," suggests the dependence
of consonants upon vowels. A clear rendering of the con-
sonants is absolutely essential to good speech. They are the
means by which mere tones are made into words. They are
like the stops and keys of an organ, which distribute the
elementary tones and give variety, character, recognizability
to them. The success of speaking does not depend upon
the mere force of the vowel sounds, but upon an union between
this force and a perfect rendering of consonants. A man may

a
speak very loudly and yet his words remain unrecognized at a
certain distance; but with a much less force and volume of
voice, and a better rendering of the consonants, his words may
be understood at a greater distance. The preachers under
the dome of St. Paul's strain their voices with painful exertion,
and yet their words do not travel. When occasionally they
drop their voices, or rather restrict the volume of their vowel
sounds, the consonants have a better chance of showing their
influence, and the words are heard and recognized. Singers
are apt to allow their vocal sounds to overpower the con-
sonants altogether; hence the words sung are not recognized,
and the meaning of the singer is unintelligible.
No one
requires a careful training in consonants more than the singer;
and the strength and volume of the speaker's voice can only be
properly utilized for an intelligent expression of ideas by the
strictest and most careful rendering of the consonants. There
is no pure vocality in consonants; some are altogether silent,
others partly vocal, or rather possess sound not from the
exertion of the voice, but (like the hissing consonants) from
peculiarities imparted to the breath in passing through the
mouth, and by the movement of the lips, teeth, tongue, and
other parts of the speaking machine. Anyone who trusts only
to his vocal sounds in speaking, without any regard to the
consonants, produces the roar of an animal and not the
intelligent and intelligible utterance of a man.
Consonants therefore have no “individual phonetic exist-
ence." They are initiatory in giving a character to the opening
vowel in a word, as the d in dark; they are distributory in
parcelling out vocal sounds into syllables, as in dominant; and
connected with this latter function is their interruptory power
in quickly closing a vowel sound, as in the word bad, or bat.
1

Consonants are divided into labial, produced by the lips,
such as p, b, f, and v; dental (or in some cases more properly
lingual—that is, sound influenced by the particular position of
the teeth or tongue as the breath passes through), as t, d, th,
dh, s, %, sh, zh; gutturals (formed in the throat), as k, g, ch,
gh; nasal, as m, n, l, r, y.
But it is difficult in all cases to
localize particular sounds, the various parts of the speaking
machine being more or less combined to produce given
results.
.
Consonants pronounced or indicated by themselves seem
insignificant, but an idea of their importance and function
in the composition of a word may be obtained by sounding
any word without its initial or final consonant. Omit the
breath sound at the beginning of the word peer, or at
the end of the word nip, and the means of recognizing the
word is lost. The following exercises show the function
of a particular consonant in different parts of the
word :
a
Þ (abruptly taking the lips apart with 'a forcible emission of
the breath)-peer, leap, pay, ape, palm, pole, hope, pool,
loop, nip, pet, step, spoil, speculate, popular.
b is produced in exactly the same way as the previous con-
sonant, with the addition of a certain half-vocal sound, a sort
of hum terminating abruptly by a quick separation of the
lips :—beat, bait, babe, bowl, boot, bin, crib, tub, boy, tube,
bound, barbarous, blue.
f(a pure breath sound with lips closed)—fane, far, fanciful,
self, suffice, soft, rough, enough.
v (the same, with a half-vocal sound-voice, veer, nerve,
revolve, varnish, vacuity, vinegar.

When the d stands as the final consonant in a word,
inaccurate speakers very
often substitute a t sound. In some
words this is correct, when the ed is not given as a separate
syllable, as in burnt, danced, laughed, &c., but otherwise the d
sound must be distinctly pronounced. It is a frequent fault
to slur the final consonant in a word, or omit it altogether.

its use is a great element of beauty in spoken language,

great number of words, and also because of its frequent mis-
pronounciation, in respect of which it is particularly
unfortunate, some people ignoring its existence altogether,
and others honouring it with too much observance.
little practice with such words as the following will soon
enable the student to acquire the habit of giving the aspirate
correctly :-

hypocrite. The air played upon the hair of the heir. How high
her highness holds her haughty head. His aunt haunted him.
Up a high hill he heaved a huge round stone.
The number of words in which it is improper to give the
aspirate is gradually becoming smaller, and is
generally confined to the following, and of course the
words immediately derived from them :-heir, honour, hour,
honest. The word humour is now given with the aspirate.
In some words, especially certain French words, such as
hotel, hospital, the aspirate-without, perhaps, being quite
absent-has less importance, and an is used before them, as,
indeed, an is used, in our older literature, in accordance with
recognized rule, before both strong and weak aspirates.
In wh the aspirate must be distinctly heard before the vowel
sound, as in whole, while, where, which; who in Saxon was hwa.
The proper command of this aspirate, and an idea of its effect
in altering the character of a word, may be obtained by the
practice of such sentences as the following :-The whaler
wailed; the Whig with a wig; where did you wear it? while
he wiled away the time.

The sounds given above are the principal of those generally
used in the formation of syllables, and if the pupil can speak
them with perfect accuracy it is a fair inference that he will
not find any difficulty in pronouncing the great majority of
words in the language. But if he has any difficulty, or
stammers, it would be as well to practice the consonant
sounds in all their variety from a detailed table of them-such
as may be found in Hullah's “Speaking Voice," and other
special publications. It is in the rendering of consonants
that difficulties, as a rule, arise.
The general rule of articulation is that each word be so
distinctly pronounced that it should carry its own meaning
--shine by its own light, as it were,-and not be dependent
upon the context for recognition. A common habit is to slur
the unaccented syllables in a word or sentence, and depend
upon its most prominent or characteristic sounds for its

recognition. An audience should be helped by the speaker to
recognize the words, not left to their own exertions to discover
his meaning, and this help can be best afforded by his speaking
each word clearly and fully, with all its characteristic sounds,
so that his meaning may be understood as the words are
spoken, not merely inferred at the close of a sentence.
The following lines may be practised as an exercise in
articulation, especially in the production of open vowel sounds,
the words being spoken with the full force of the voice, and
generally a pause being made and breath taken at the middle
and end of a line, the rhythm being strongly marked :-
“Oh! the orator's voice is a mighty power
As it echoes from shore to shore,
And the fearless Pen has more sway o'er men
Than the murderous cannon's roar.
What bursts the chain far o'er the main,
And brightens the captive's den ?
'Tis the fearless Voice and the Pen of power-
Hurrah for the Voice and Pen !
The tyrant knaves who deny our rights,
And the cowards who blanch with fear,
Exclaim with glee, ‘No arms have ye-
Nor cannon, nor sword, nor spear !
Your hills are ours; with our forts and towers
We are masters of mount and glen.'
Tyrants, beware! for the arms we bear
Are the Voice and the fearless Pen !
Though your horsemen stand with their bridles in hand,
And your sentinels walk around-
Though your matches flare in the midnight air,
And your brazen trumpets sound;
Oh! the orator's tongue shall be heard among
These listening warrior men ;
And they'll quickly say, 'Why should we slay
Our friends of the Voice and Pen?'

When the Lord created the earth and sea,
The stars and the glorious sun,
The Godhead spoke, and the universe woke-
And the mighty work was done !
Let a word be flung from the orator's tongue
Or a drop from the fearless Pen,
And the chains accursed asunder burst,
That fettered the minds of men !
Oh! these are the swords with which we fight,
The arms in which we trust;
Which no tyrant hand will dare to brand,
Which time cannot dim or rust!
When these we bore, we triumphed before,
With these we'll triumph again-
And the world will say, “No power can stay
The Voice and the fearless Pen!'"
McCarthy.

The following selections may also be practised for strong
and full vocality—that is, forcible production of the open
vowel sounds :-
HORATIUS.
* They gave him of the corn-land,
That was of public right,
As much as two strong oxen
Could plough from morn till night :
And they made a molten image,
And set it up on high,
And there it stands unto this day,
To witness if I lie.
It stands in the Comitium,
Plain for all folk to see;
Horatius in his harness,
Halting upon one knee:

And underneath is written,
In letters all of gold,
How valiantly he kept the bridge
In the brave days of old.
And still his name sounds stirring,
Unto the men of Rome,
As the trumpet-blast that cries to them
To charge the Volscian home :
And wives still pray to Juno
For boys with hearts as bold
As his who kept the bridge so well
In the brave days of old.
And in the nights of winter,
When the cold north-winds blow,
And the long howling of the wolves
Is heard amidst the snow ;
When round the lonely cottage
Roars loud the tempest's din,
And the good logs of Algidus
Roar louder yet within ;
When the oldest cask is open’d,
And the largest lamp is lit,
When the chestnuts glow in the embers,
And the kid turns on the spit ;
When young and old in circle
Around the firebrands close
When the girls are weaving baskets,
And the lads are shaping bows;
When the goodman mends his armour,
And trims his helmet's plume;
When the goodwife's shuttle merrily
Goes flashing through the loom ;
With weeping and with laughter
Still is the story told,
How well Horatius kept the bridge
In the brave days of old.”
Macaulay.

THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.
“UNDER a spreading chestnut tree
The village smithy stands;
The smith, a mighty man is he,
With large and sinewy hands;
And the muscles of his brawny arms
Are strong as iron bands.
His hair is crisp, and black, and long;
His face is like the tan;
His brow is wet with honest sweat;
He earns whate'er he can,
And looks the whole world in the face,
For he owes not any man.
Week in, week out, from morn till night,
You can hear his bellows blow;
You can hear him swing his heavy sledge,
With measured beat and slow,
Like a sexton ringing the village bell
When the evening sun is low.
And children coming home from school
Look in at the open door;
They love to see the flaming forge,
And hear the bellows roar,
And catch the burning sparks that fly
Like chaff from a threshing-floor.
He goes on Sunday to the church,
And sits among his boys;
He hears the parson pray and preach;
He hears his daughter's voice
Singing in the village choir,
And it makes his heart rejoice:
It sounds to him like her mother's voice,
Singing in Paradise !
He needs must think of her once more,

How in the grave she lies ;
And with his hard, rough hand he wipes
A tear out of his eyes.
Toiling-rejoicing-sorrowing,
Onward through life he goes ;
Each morning sees some task begun,
Each evening sees its close;
Something attempted, something done,
Has earned a night's repose.
Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,
For the lesson thou hast taught !
Thus at the flaming forge of life
Our fortunes must be wrought !
Thus on its sounding anvil shaped
Each burning deed and thought !”
Longfellou
The following extracts may be read with especial attention
to the consonants. Tennyson's selection and use of con-
sonants is regarded as one of the great technical excellences
of his poetry : the very sound of the consonants being in
accordance with the meaning or the picture intended. See
the effect of the words with s and z in concluding lines.
ENOCH ARDEN'S ISLAND.
“No want was there of human sustenance,
Soft fruitage, mighty nuts, and nourishing roots,
Nor save for pity was it hard to take
The helpless life so wild that it was tame.
There in a seaward-gazing mountain-gorge
They built, and thatched with leaves of palm, a hut
Half hut, half native cavern. So the three
Set in this Eden of all plenteousness,
Dwelt with eternal summer, ill-content.
The mountain wooded to the peak, the lawns
And winding glades high up like ways to heaven,
The slender coco's drooping crown of plumes,

The lightning flash of insect and of bird,
The lustre of the long convolvuluses
That coiled around the stately stems and ran
E’en to the limit of the land, the glows
And glories of the broad belt of the world,
All these he saw; but what he fain had seen
He could not see, the kindly huinan face
Nor ever hear a kindly voice, but heard
The myriad shriek of wheeling ocean-fowl,
The league-long roller thundering on the reef,
The moving whisper of huge trees that branch'd
And blossom'd in the zenith, or the sweep
Of some precipitous rivulet to the wave,
As down the shore he ranged, or all day long
Sat often in the seaward-gazing gorge,
A shipwrecked sailor waiting for a sail :
No sail from day to day, but every day
The sunrise broken into scarlet shafts
Among the palms and ferns and precipices;
The blaze upon the waters to the east;
The blaze upon his island overhead;
The blaze upon the waters to the west ;
Then the great stars that globed themselves in Heaven,
The hollower bellowing ocean, and again
The scarlet shafts of sunrise, but no sail.”
Tennyson.
PLEASURES OF HOPE
“At summer's eve, when Heav'n's aerial bow
Spans, with bright arch, the glitt'ring hills below,
Why to yon mountain turns the musing eye,
Whose sun-bright summit mingles with the sky ?
Why do those hills of shadowy tint appear
More sweet than all the landscape smiling near ?
'Tis distance lends enchantment to the view,
And robes the mountains with its azure hue.
Thus, with delight, we linger to survey
The promis'd joys of life's unmeasur'd way;
Thus, from afar, each dim-discover'd scene

More pleasing seems than all the past hath been;
And ev'ry form that fancy can repair
From dark oblivion, glows divinely there.
What potent spirit guides the raptur'd eye
To pierce the shades of dim futurity ?
Can Wisdon lend, with all her boasted power,
The pledge of joy's anticipated hour ?
Ah no! she darkly sees the fate of man,
Her dim horizon bounded to a span;
Or if she holds an image to the view,
'Tis nature pictur'd too severely true.
With thee sweet Hope, resides the heav'nly light,
That pours remotest rapture on the sight :
Thine is the charm of life's bewilder'd way,
That calls each slumbering passion into play.
Eternal Hope! when yonder spheres sublime
Peal'd their first notes to sound the march of time,
Thy joyous youth began-but not to fade;
When all the sister planets have decay'd,
When wrapt in fire the realms of ether glow,
And Heav'n's last thunder shakes the world below,
Thou, undismay'd, shall o'er the ruins smile,
And light thy torch at Nature's funeral pile.”
Campbell.
THE CATARACT OF LODORE.
“From its sources which well in the Tarn on the fell ;
From it fountains in the mountains,
Its rills and its gills; through moss and through brake,
It runs and it creeps for awhile till it sleeps
In its own little lake. And thence at departing,
Awakening and starting, it runs through the reeds
And away it proceeds, through mountain and glade,
In sun and in shade, and through the wood-shelter,
Among crags in its flurry, helter-skelter,
Hurry-scurry. Here it comes sparkling,
And there it lies darkling ; now smoking and frothing
Its tumult and wrath in, till in this rapid race
On which it is bent, it reaches the place

Of its steep descent. And glittering and frittering,
And gathering and feathering, and whitening and brightening
And quivering and shivering, and hurrying and scurrying,
And thundering and floundering;
Dividing and gliding and sliding
And falling and brawling and sprawling,
And diving and riving and striving,
And sprinkling and twinkling and wrinkling,
And sounding and bounding and rounding,
And bubbling and troubling and doubling,
And grumbling and rumbling and tumbling,
And clattering and battering and shattering;
Retreating and beating and meeting and sheeting,
Delaying and straying and playing and spraying,
Advancing and prancing and glancing and dancing,
Recoiling, turmoiling, and toiling and boiling,
And gleaming and streaming and steaming and beaming,
And rushing and flushing and brushing and gushing,
And flapping and rapping and clapping and slapping,
And curling and whirling and purling and twirling,
And thumping and plumping and bumping and jumping,
And dashing and flashing and splashing and clashing;
And so never ending, but always descending,
Sounds and motions for ever and ever are blending,
All at once and all o'er, with a mighty uproar,
And this way the water comes down at Lodore.”
Southey.
The effect produced by a skilful use of consonants in the
mere sound of descriptive epithets is also noticed upon
trying the following extract with the voice :-
THE LOTOS-EATERS.
“Courage!” he said, and pointed toward the land,
“This mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon.''
In the afternoon they came unto a land,
In which it seemed always afternoon.
All round the coast the languid air did swoon,
Breathing like one that hath a weary dream.

Full-faced above the valley stood the moon;
And like a downward smoke, the slender stream
Along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem-
A land of streams! some like a downward smoke,
Slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn, did go;
And some thro' wavering lights and shadows broke,
Rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below.
They saw the gleaming river seaward flow
From the inner land : far off, three mountain tops,
Three silent pinnacles of aged snow,
Stood sunset-flush'd: and, dew'd with showery drops,
Up-clomb the shadowy pine above the woven copse.
The charmed sunset linger'd low adown
In the red West: thro' mountain clefts the dale
Was seen far inland, and the yellow down
Border'd with palm, and many a winding vale
And meadow, set with slender galingale ;
A land where all things always seem'd the same!
And round about the keel with faces pale,
Dark faces pale against that rosy flame,
The mild-eyed melancholy Lotos-eaters came.
Branches they bore of that enchanted stem,
Laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave
To each, but whoso did receive of them,
And taste, to him the gushing of the wave
Far, far away did seem to mourn and rave
On alien shores; and if his fellow spake,
His voice was thin, as voices from the grave;
And deep-asleep he seem'd, yet all awake,
And music in his ears his beating 'heart did make.
Tennyson.
PITCH AND MODULATION.
In developing the tones of the voice the pupil would take
as a basis the tone in which he naturally, or at least generally
speaks. He must then see how much lower he can go, and
how much higher. He must not confound, as is commonly

done, a mere increase of loudness with a higher level or tone.
A word may be softly or loudly spoken, but the actual tone
employed may be the same. Pitch, intensity, and duration
are all distinct, and should not be confused. A high tone is
not necessarily a loud one. Level speaking, in the sense of
being sustained, deliberate, properly sequential and finished,
without any inequalities arising from weakness or bad manage-
ment of voice, is thoroughly artistic and excellent. But one
continued level of voice is distressing to the speaker, and
inconsistent with good oratory. The rules of modulation
govern the change of the voice from a lower to a higher
tone, or otherwise, and regulate its movement-slower or
faster, or fast to slower, as the case may be. The tones
and movement of the voice are determined by the relative
importance of the clauses or sentences to be spoken.
The voice is a musical instrument capable of exquisite
variety of tone, and of being adapted to the expression of
every peculiarity of thought, every kind of reasoning, every
shade of strong passion, and every delicate refinement of
pathos.
The speaking voice is more flexible and varied than the
singing voice, and is not confined to arbitrary distances or
subject to breaks between tones. No notation that could be
devised would enable a number of speakers to speak at the
same time exactly with the same modulation and in exact
unison of tone, as if only one were speaking. For practice,
however, there is a register of the voice in speaking as in
singing, a proper attention to which is necessary. Variety of
tone is not only demanded by the sense of the words, but is
also conducive to the ease of the speaker and the pleasure of
the listener. The voice must be made as flexible and

sympathetic as possible, and all its tones producible at
command. For this purpose a scale has been constructed
and applied to the following lines. No. I represents the
lowest, and No. 6 the highest pitch of which the voice is
capable.
Medium The night is past, and shines the sun
Tone, or As if that morn were a jocund one;
Lightly and brightly breaks away
in The morning from her mantle grey,
Scale. And the noon will look on a sultry day.
(1) Hark to the trump and the drum,
(2) And the mournful sound of the barbarous horn,
(3) And the flap of the banners that flit as they're borne,
(4) And the neigh of the steed and the multitude's hum,
(5) And the clash and the shout, They come! (6) THEY COME!
Byron.
The above is an exercise in a regularly ascending scale.
The difference of tone, or, in other words, the distance
between No. I and No. 6, will represent the capacity of
voice for expressive speaking.
The following are exercises not only in variety of tone or
pitch, but also in movement, some lines being fuller, slower,
and louder than others. The pupil must obtain a command
over his voice, so as to be able to speak slowly or rapidly,
loudly or softly, as required. The words sufficiently indicate
the mode in which they should be given :-
“Descend, ye Nine, descend and sing !
The breathing instruments inspire,
Wake into voice the silent string,
And sweep the sounding lyre.
In a sadly pleasing strain,
Let the warbling lute complain,
Let the loud trumpets sound

Till the rocks all around
The shrill echoes rebound,
While in more lengthened notes and slow
The deep, majestic, solemn organs blow.
Hark! the numbers soft and clear
Gently steal upon the ear,
Now louder and yet louder rise,
And fill with spreading sounds the skies,
Exulting in triumph now swell the bold notes,
In broken air trembling the wild music floats,
Till by degrees remote and small
The strains decay and melt away
In a dying, dying fall.”
Pope.
“Now strike the golden lyre again ;
A louder yet, and yet a louder strain ;
Break his bands of sleep asunder,
And rouse him like a rattling peal of thunder.
Hark, hark, the horrid sound
Has raised up his head,
As awaked from the dead,
And amazed he stares round.
Revenge, revenge, Timotheus cries,
See the furies arise ;
See the snakes that they rear,
How they hiss in their hair,
And the sparkles that flash from their eyes,
Behold a ghastly band,
Each a torch in his hand.
Those are Grecian ghosts, that in battle were slain,
And unburied remain
Inglorious on the plain ;
Give the
vengeance
due
To the valiant crew :
Behold how they toss their torches on high,
How they point to the Persian abodes,
And glitt'ring temples of their hostile gods !
The Princes applaud, with a furious joy ;
And the king seized a flambeau, with zeal to destroy.

Thäis led the way,
To light him to his prey,
And like another Helen, fired another Troy.
Thus long ago,
Ere heaving bellows learn’d to blow,
While organs yet were mute;
Timotheus to his breathing flute
And sounding lyre,
Could swell the soul to rage, or kindle soft desire.
At last divine Cecilia came,
Inventress of the vocal frame;
The sweet enthusiast, from her sacred store,
Enlarged the former narrow bounds,
And added length to solemn sounds,
With Nature's mother-wit, and arts unknown before.
Let old Timotheus yield the prize,
Or both divide the crown ;
He raised a mortal to the skies;
She drew an angel down."
Dryden.
The following is also a good exercise in all the qualities
that are meant by the word“ Modulation,” viz : difference in
tone or pitch, in intensity or loudness, in duration or volume,
and in pace or rate of movement. The words are sufficiently
indicative of the style of reading and the eye should travel a
little faster than the voice, so that the clauses may be
properly connected, and so that at the beginning of a
sentence the speaker should know what tones of voice will be
required for its appropriate expression, and regulate their
production accordingly.
“ True ease in writing comes from art, not chance,
As those move easiest who have rned to dance ;
'Tis not enough no harshness give offence,
The sound must seem an echo to the sense.
Soft is the strain when zephyr gently blows,
And the smooth stream in smoother numbers flows;

But when loud surges lash the sounding shore,
The hoarse, rough verse should like the torrent roar.
When Ajax strives some rock's vast weight to throw,
The line, too, labours, and the words move slow;
Not so when swift Camilla scours the plain,
Flies o’er the unbending corn and skims along the main,
Pope.
The next point in practice is, to take some pieces to be
read respectively in a low or deep, medium, and high tone or
pitch of voice. Specimens are given of each. The extract
from Milton requires strength, deliberation in movement, and
great weight, depth, and fulness of voice.
The following to be read for practice in a full, deep, and
slow voice :-
SAUL.
". Thou whose spell can raise the dead,
Bid the prophet's form appear.”—
Samuel, raise thy buried head !
King, behold the phantom seer!'
Earth yawned; he stood, the centre of a cloud ;
Light changed its hue, retiring from his shroud.
Death stood all glassy in his fixed eye;
His hand was withered, and his veins were dry ;
His foot in bony whiteness glittered there,
Shrunken and sinewless, and ghastly bare.
From lips that moved not, and unbreathing frame,
Like caverned winds the hollow accents came.
Saul saw, and fell to earth, -as falls the oak
At once, when blasted by the thunder-stroke !
Why is my sleep disquieted ?
Who is he that calls the dead ?
Is it thou, O king? Behold,
Bloodless are these limbs, and cold ;
Such are mine; and such shall be
Thine to morrow, when with me:
Ere the coming day be done,
Such shalt thou be, such thy son !

Fare thee well, but for a day!
Then we mix our mouldering clay ;
Then thy race lie pale and low,
Pierced by shafts from many a bow;
And the falchion by thy side
To thy heart thy hand shall guide ;
Crownless, breathless, headless, fall
Son and sire,—the house of Saul !”
Byron.
SATAN.
“He above the rest
In shape and gesture proudly eminent
Stood like a tower; his form had not yet lost
All her original brightness, nor appear'd
Less than archangel ruin'd, and the excess
Of glory obscur'd: as when the sun, new risen,
Looks through the horizontal misty air
Shorn of his beams; or, from behind the moon,
In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds
On half the nations, and with fear of change
Perplexes monarchs; darken'd so, yet shone
Above them all the archangel. But his face
Deep scars of thunder had intrench'd, and care
Sat on his faded cheek, but under brows
Of dauntless courage, and considerate pride
Waiting revenge: cruel his eye, but cast
Signs of remorse and passion to behold
The fellows of his crime, the followers rather
(Far other once beheld in bliss)-condemn'd
For ever now to have their lot in pain,
Millions of spirits for his fault amerc'd
Of heaven, and from eternal splendours flung
For his revolt; yet faithful how they stood
Their glory wither'd !--as when heaven's fire
Hath scath'd the forest oaks or mountain pines,
With singed top their stately growth, though bare,
Stands on the blasted heath."

The following prose selections to be read in the ordinary,
natural, or medium tones of the voice, avoiding the extreme
tones, but showing variety within a certain range of voice.
It is an exercise in the best kind of “level” speaking in the
reader's customary voice, but expanded from merely conver-
sational to rhetorical strength, and with due emphasis.
INTRODUCTION TO THE HISTORY OF ENGLAND.
"I purpose to write the History of England from the accession
of King James II. down to a time which is within the memory of
men still living. I shall recount the errors which, in a few months,
alienated a loyal gentry and priesthood from the House of Stuart.
I shall trace the course of that Revolution which terminated the
long struggle between our Sovereigns and their Parliaments, and
bound up together the rights of the people and the title of the
reigning dynasty. I shall relate how the new settlement was,
during many troubled years, successfully defended against foreign
and domestic enemies; how, under that settlement, the authority
of law and the security of property were found to be compatible
with a liberty of discussion and of individual action never before
known; how, from the auspicious union of order and freedom,
sprang a prosperity of which the annals of human affairs had
furnished no example ; how our country, from a state of igno-
minious vassalage, rapidly rose to the place of umpire among
European powers; how her opulence and her martial glory grew
together; how, by wise and resolute good faith, was gradually
established a public credit, fruitful of marvels, which to the
statesmen of any former age would have seemed incredible; how
a gigantic commerce gave birth to a maritime power, compared
with which every other maritime power, ancient or modern, sinks
into insignificance; how Scotland, after ages of enmity, was at
length united to England, not merely by legal bonds, but by
indissoluble ties of interest and affection ; how, in America, the
British Colonies rapidly became far mightier and wealthier than
the realms which Cortes and Pizarro had added to the dominions of
Charles V.; how, in Asia, British adventurers founded an Empire
not less splendid and more durable than that of Alexander. Nor

will it be less my duty faithfully to record disasters mingled with
triumphs, with great national crimes and follies far more
humiliating than any disaster. It will be seen that what we justly
account our chief blessings are not without alloy. It will be seen
that the system which effectually secured our liberties against the
encroachments of kingly power gave birth to a new class of
abuses from which absolute monarchies are exempt. It will be
seen that in consequence partly of unwise interference, and partly
of unwise neglect, the increase of wealth and the extension of
trade produced, together with immense good, some evils from
which poor and rude societies are free. It will be seen how, in
two important dependencies of the Crown, wrong was followed by
just retribution ; how imprudence and obstinacy broke the ties
which bound the North American Colonies to the parent State;
how Ireland, cursed by the domination of race over race, and of
religion over religion, remained indeed a member of the Empire,
but a withered and distorted member, adding no strength to the
body politic, and reproachfully pointed at by all who feared or
envied the greatness of England. Yet, unless I greatly deceive
myself, the general effect of this chequered narrative will be to
excite thankfulness in all religious minds and hope in the breasts
of all patriots; for the history of our country during the last
hundred and sixty years is eminently the history of physical, of
moral, and of intellectual improvement. Those who compare the
age in which their lot has fallen with a golden age which exists
only in their imagination, may talk of degeneracy and decay, but
no man who is correctly informed as to the past will be disposed
to take a morose or desponding view of the present. I should
very imperfectly execute the task which I have undertaken if I
were merely to treat of battles and sieges, of the rise and fall of
administrations, of intrigues in the palace, and of debates in the
parliament. It will be my endeavour to relate the history of the
people, as well as the history of the government; to trace the
progress of useful and ornamental arts; to describe the rise of
religious sects, and the changes of literary tastes: to portray the
the manners of successive generations; and not to pass by with
neglect even the revolutions which have taken place in dress,
furniture, repasts, and public entertainments. I shall cheerfully
bear the reproach of having descended below the dignity of

EVENING.
· Every object a little while ago glared with light; but now all
appears with softened lustre. The animals harmonize with the
insensible creation: and what was gay in those, as well as glittering
in this, gives place to a universal gravity. Should I, at such a season,
be vain and trifling, the heavens and the earth would rebuke my
unseasonable levity. Therefore, be this movement devoted to
thoughts solemn as the close of day, sedate as the face of
things. However my social hours are enlivened with innocent
pleasantry, let the evening in her sober habit, toll the bell to
serious consideration. Every meddling and intrusive avocation is
excluded. Silence holds the door against the strife of tongues and
all the impertinences of idle conversation. The busy swarm of
vain images and cajoling temptations which beset us, with a
buzzing importunity, amid the gaieties of life, are chased by these
thickening shades. Here I may, without disturbance, commune
with my own heart, and learn that best of sciences, to know
myself."-Hervey.
LATITUDINARIANISM.
That the spiritual rulers of Europe should have allowed a man
like Erasmus to use language such as this to them, is a fact of
supreme importance. It explains the feeling of Goethe, that the
world would have gone on better had there been no Luther, and
that the revival of theological fanaticism did more harm than good.
But the question of questions is, what all this latitudinarian
philosophizing, this cultivated epicurean gracefulness, would have
come to, if left to itself; or rather, what was the effect which it
was inevitably producing ? If you wish to remove an old building
without bringing it in ruins about your ears, you must begin at the
top, remove the stones gradually downwards, and touch the
foundation last.
But latitudinarianism loosens the elementary principles of
theology. It destroys the premises on which the dogmatic system
rests. It would beg the question to say that this would in itself

have been undesirable; but the practical effect of it, as the world
then stood, would have been only to make the educated into infidels,
and to leave the multitude to a convenient but debasing supersti-
tion.-Froude.
NECESSITY OF WORK.
Every station of life has duties which are proper to it. Those
who are determined by choice to any particular kind of business
are indeed more happy than those who are determined by necessity;
but both are under an equal obligation of fixing on employments
which may be either useful to themselves or beneficial to others;
no one of the sons of Adam ought to think himself exempt from
that labour and industry which were denounced to our first parent,
and in him to all his posterity. Those to whom birth or fortune
may seem to make such an application unnecessary, ought to find
out some calling or profession for themselves, that they may not
lie as a burden on the species, and be the only useless parts of
the creation.-Addison.
REVOLUTION AND LITERATURE.
Times of revolution are favourable to the progress of human
intellect; and it is therefore not surprising that the latter half of
the seventeenth century produced some of our greatest writers in
every branch of learning and literature. It was the age of Milton
and Dryden, the greatest of our poets, great masters also of prose,
though the pre-eminence of their poetical genius has almost
buried their other works in oblivion, and of Butler, the author of
Hudibras, a work not only delightful for its original and ceaseless
wit, but especially valuable as affording one of the truest pictures
of the feelings of his age. It was the age of Jeremy Taylor, of
Barrow, of Stillingfleet, and of Tillotson, preachers who have no
superiors, and scarcely any equals, and of Bunyan, who still
preaches to the existing generation, not indeed in argumentative
sermons or learned expositions, but in the exquisite allegory of
the Pilgrim's Progress, which, though long undervalued, has won
its way to universal admiration, and has now an honoured place
equally in the nursery of the child and in the library of the
maturer scholar.---Yonge.

GENIUS AND CONDUCT.
If an author's life is more agitated and more painful than that
of others, it may also be made more spirit-stirring and exalted ;
fortune may render him unhappy, it is only himself that can make
him despicable. The history of genius has, in fact, its bright
side as well as its dark. And if it is distressing to survey the
misery, and what is worse, the debasement, of so many gifted men,
it is doubly cheering, on the other hand, to reflect on the few who,
amid the temptations and sorrows to which life in all its provinces,
and most in theirs, is liable, have travelled through it in calm
and virtuous majesty, and are now hallowed in our memories not
less for their conduct than their writings. Such men are the flower
of this lower world: to such alone can the epithet of great be
applied with its true emphasis. There is a congruity in their
proceedings which one loves to contemplate: he who would write
heroic poems, should make his whole life a heroic poem.
Carlyle.
In the higher tones of voice and with more rapid move-
ment, the following may be taken as appropriate exercises :-
THE EXILE OF ERIN.
“ There came to the beach a poor exile of Erin,
The dew on his thin robe was heavy and chill;
For his country he sighed, when at twilight repairing
To wander alone by the wind-beaten hill :
But the day-star attracted his eye's sad devotion ;
For it rose o'er his own native isle of the ocean,
Where once, in the fervour of youth's warm emotion,
He sang the bold anthem of Erin go bragh !
Sad is my fate !--said the heart-broken stranger-
The wild deer and wolf to a covert can flee;
But I have no refuge from famine and danger ;
A home and a country remain not to me !
Never again, in the green sunny bowers
Where
my forefathers lived, shall I spend the sweet hours;
Or cover my harp with the wild-woven flowers,
And strike to the numbers of Erin go bragh !

Erin ! my country! though sad and forsaken,
!
In dreams I revisit th' sea-beaten shore !
But, alas ! in a far foreign land I awaken,
And sigh for the friends who can meet me no more.
Oh, cruel Fate! wilt thou never replace me
In a mansion of peace, where no perils can chase me ?
Never again shall my brothers embrace me?
They died to defend me !-or live to deplore !
Where is my cabin-door, fast by the wild wood ?
Sisters and sire, did ye weep for its fall ?
Where is the mother that looked on my childhood ?
And where is the bosom friend, dearer than all ?
Oh !
my sad heart, longed abandoned by pleasure,
Why did it dote on a fast-fading treasure ?
Tears, like the rain-drop, may fall without measure,
But rapture and beauty they cannot recall !
Yet-all its sad recollections suppressing,
One dying wish my lone bosom can draw :-
Erin ! an exile bequeaths thee-his blessing!
Land of my
forefathers !- Erin
go bragh!
Buried and cold, when my heart stills her motion,
Green be thy fields, sweetest isle of the ocean !
And thy harp-striking bards sing aloud with devotion,
Erin Mavournin! Erin go bragh!'”
Campbell
THE SANDS OF DEE.
“Oh ! Mary, go and call the cattle home,
And call the cattle home,
And call the cattle home,
Across the sands of Dee.
The western wind was wild and dank with foam,
And all alone went she.
The western tide came up along the sand,
And o'er and o'er the sand,
And round and round the sand,

As far as eye could see;
The rolling mist came down and hid the land,
And never home came she.
Oh! is it weed, or fish, or floating hair,
A tress of golden hair,
A drowned maiden's hair,
Among the nets at sea;
Was never salmon yet that shone so fair
Among the stakes on Dee.
They rowed her in across the rolling foam,
The cruel, crawling foam,
The cruel, hungry foam,
To her grave beside the sea.
But still the boatmen hear her call the cattle home
Across the sands of Dee.
Kingsley.
ARETHUSA.
Under the bowers
Where the ocean powers
Sit on their pearlèd thrones;
Through the coral woods
Of the weltering floods;
Over heaps of unvalued stones;
Through the dim beams
Which amid the streams
Weave a network of coloured light:
And under the caves
Where the shadowy waves
Are as green as the forest's night :-
Outspeeding the shark,
And the sword-fish dark,
Under the ocean foam,
And up through the rifts
Of the mountain clifts
They passed to their Dorian home.
Shelley.

THE SKYLARK.
“ Bird of the wilderness,
Blithesome and cumberless,
Sweet be thy matin o'er woodland and lea!
Emblem of happiness,
Blest is thy dwelling-place-
Oh to abide in the desert with thee!
Wild is thy lay and loud,
Far in the downy cloud ;
Love gives it energy, love gave it birth.
Where, on thy dewy wing,
Where art thou journeying ?
Thy lay is in heaven, thy love is on earth.
O'er fell and fountain sheen,
O’er moor and mountain green,
O'er the red streamer that heralds the day;
Over the cloudlet dim,
Over the rainbow's rim,
Musical cherub, soar, singing, away!
Then, when the gloaming comes,
Low in the heather blooms
Sweet will thy welcome and bed of love be!
Emblem of happiness,
Blest is thy dwelling-place-
Oh to abide in the desert with thee !"
Hogg
A careful use of the above selections will develop a capacity
of expression which the pupil, perhaps, did not dream of
before as within the range of his own voice; and having
learned to distinguish between the various sounds, the next
thing is to apply this knowledge practically by changing the
tones of the voice at each modification of sense.
A sentence generally contains a complete idea ("something.
is said about something”) or a series of ideas independent in

te?
themselves, yet connected by the general sense. An idea, as
it is gradually unfolded in a series of words, is subject to the
usual law of development-continual modification ; that is to
say, the sense of the sentence in the opening clause is
enlarged or modified by what follows, until the full idea is
expressed. The least important part of the sentence will be
marked by a light and rapid modulation, and the most
important by a full, emphatic, and slower tone. A sentence
should be commenced upon a medium, not high-pitched,
voice to allow of upward inflexion to sustain the meaning and
connect the clauses. But a sentence in a series of sentences
must not be read as if it stood by itself. The reader must use
his judgment and power of discrimination, and first discover
the relative value of the sentence (or clause) as it stands in its
context, and by his manner of reading it convey to his hearers
the value he attaches to it as being more or less important
than others to the proper elucidation of the author's meaning.
Take, for example, the opening sentence of the following
extract. The most important clause is undoubtedly the last,
printed in italics, and this should be spoken with greater force
and emphasis than those which precede it, because it contains
the idea which dominates, as it were, the series of which it is
the end. The same plan will be pursued in reading the whole
extract. The parenthetical clauses will, of course, be marked
by different modulation from the rest, because a parenthesis
is something interpolated in the middle of a sentence to
explain or illustrate its precise meaning, and does not belong
to the sentence by ordinary grammatical construction.
The following extract is full of pictures, and the voice
should be modulated to give each detail of a picture so as to .
express its intrinsic value and its relative importance, and to

give the sentiment arising out of or associated with a picture
in the fullest tone and most deliberate movement of voice.
Deliberation implies command over the voice, and is, there-
fore a strength in itself, and it is undoubted that the most
deliberate style of speaking is the most effective. Delibera-
tion does not necessarily mean slow speaking, for speaking may
be rapid without being weak and hurried. It means the opposite
of mere haste and carelessness. As a rule the speaker should
be neither too fast nor too slow. He should steer a middle
course, avoiding the Scylla of Drawl and the Charybdis
of Gabble. One source of a speaker's strength is the
impression upon his audience that he has full command
over his resources.
JERUSALEM
“ The fall of our illustrious and happy city was supernatural: the
destruction of the conquered was against the first principles of the
Roman policy; and, to the last hour of our national existence,
Rome held out offers of peace, and lamented our frantic dis-
position to be undone : but the decree was gone forth from a
mightier throne. During the latter days of the siege, a hostility,
to which that of man was as a grain of sand to the tempest that
drives it on, overpowered our strength and senses; fearful shapes
and voices in the air-visions starting us from our short and
troublesome sleep-lunacy in its hideous forms—sudden death in
the midst of vigour—the fury of the elements let loose upon our
heads. We had every terror and evil that could beset human
nature but pestilence-the most probable of all, in a city crowded
with the famishing, the diseased, the wounded, and the dead.
Yet, though the streets were covered with unburied, though every
well and trench was teeming, though six hundred thousand
corpses were flung over the ramparts and lay naked to the sun,
pestilence came not ;—for if it had come, the enemy would have
been scared away.
But the abomination of desolation,' the
pagan standard was fixed where it was to remain until the plough
had passed over the ruins of Jerusalem.

« On this fatal night no man laid his head upon the pillow.
Heaven and earth were in conflict. Meteors burned over us—the
ground shook under our feet—the volcanoes blazed—the wind
burst forth in irresistible blasts, and swept the living and the
dead in whirlwinds far into the desert. We heard the bellowing
of the distant Mediterranean, as if its waters were at our sides,
swelled by the deluge. The lakes and rivers roared and
inundated the land. The fiery sword shot out tenfold firem
showers of blood fell—thunder pealed from every quarter of the
heavens—lightning, in immense sheets, of an intensity and
duration that turned the darkness into more than day, withering
eye and soul, burned from the zenith to the ground, and marked
its track by forests of flame, and shattered the summits of the
hills. Defence was unthought of, for the mortal enemy had
passed from the mind. Our hearts quaked for fear; but it was to
see the powers of heaven shaken. All cast away the shield and
spear and crouched before the descending judgment.
“Now came the last and most wonderful sign that marked the
fate of rejected Israel. While I lay helpless, I heard the whirlwind
roar through the cloudy hill, and vapours began to revolve. A pale
light, like that of the rising moon, quivered on the edges of the
horizon; and the clouds rose rapidly, shaping themselves into the
forms of battlements and towers. The sound of voices was heard
within, low and distinct, yet strangely sweet. Still the lustre
brightened; and the airy building rose, tower on tower and
battlement on battlement, in awe that held us mute. We knelt
and gazed on this more than mortal architecture, that continued
rising and spreading, and glowing with a seréner light, still soft
and silvery, yet to which the broadest moonlight was dim. At
last it stood forth to earth and heaven, the colossal image of the
first Temple-of the building raised by the „isest of men, and
consecrated by the Visible Glory.
" All Jerusalem saw the image ; and the shout that, in the
midst of their despair, ascended from the thousands and tens of
thousands, told that proud remembrances were there. But a
hymn was heard that might have hushed the world beside.
Never fell on my ears, never on the human sense, a sound so
majestic, yet so subduing--so full of melancholy, yet of grandeur

and command. The vast portal opened, and from it marched a
host, such as man had never seen before, such as man shall never
see but once again-the guardian angels of the city of David.
They came forth gloriously, but woe in all their steps the stars
upon their helmets dim—their robes stained-tears flowing down
their celestial beauty. . Let us go hence !' was their song of

Each of the following verses contains a different picture
requiring its appropriate modulation. The concluding or
chorus word, as embodying the sentiment of the whole verse,
and as glowing with the colour of the picture the details of
which it binds together into completeness, to be spoken most
impressively and characteristically.
EXCELSIOR.

“The shades of night were falling fast,
As through an Alpine village passed
A youth who bore, ’mid snow and ice,
A banner with a strange device,-- Excelsior!'

“His brow was sad, his eye beneath
Flashed like a falchion from its sheath
And like a silver clarion rung
The accents of that unknown tongue,-“Excelsior!'
(Contrast--Happiness and Regret.)
'In happy homes he saw the light
Of household fires gleam warm and bright;
Above, the spectral glaciers shone,
And from his lips escaped a groan,-'Excelsior!'

The pious monks of St. Bernard
Uttered the oft-repeated prayer,
A voice cried through the startled air,-- Excelsior!'

Half-buried in the snow was found,
Still grasping in his hand of ice

at the two contrasted ideas, “lifeless” but beautiful”:-

And from the sky serene and far
A voice fell like a falling star,—'Excelsior!'"

The following piece may be read for its lovely picture in
the second verse, which should be brought out by appropriate
modulation,
OLD AGE.
The seas are quiet when the winds give o'er ;
So calm are we when passions are no more ;
For then we know how vain it was to boast
Of fleeting things too certain to be lost.
Clouds of affection from our younger eyes
Conceal that emptiness which age descries.
The soul's dark cottage, batter'd and decay'd,
Lets in new light through chinks that time has made:
Stronger by weakness wiser men become
As they draw near to their eternal home :
Leaving the old, both worlds at once they view
That stand upon the threshold of the new.
Waller.
MODULATION AS APPLIED TO PARENTHESIS.
The parentheses in following sentences to be read in a
deeper tone; when finished, the previous tone to be resumed
after a slight pause. Important parentheses should be read
in a deeper and slower tone—those of an unimportant or
merely incidental character in higher and quicker and less
emphatic tone than that used in reading the general sentence.
The man who does not know how to methodize his thoughts has
always (to borrow a phrase from the Dispensary) a barren super-
fluity of words.
Pride in some particular disguise or other (often a secret to the
proud man himself) is the most ordinary spring of action.
“If there's a power above us
(And that there is all nature cries aloud
Through all her works), He must delight in virtue.
Addison.

They anon
With hundreds and with thousands trooping came
Attended; all access was throng'd; the gates
And porches wide, but chief the spacious hall,
(Though like a covered field where champions bold
Wont ride in arm'd, and at the Soldan's chair
Defied the best of Paynim chivalry
To mortal combat or career with lance),
Thick swarm’d, both on the ground, and in the air
Brush'd with the hiss of rustling wings.”
Milton.
Oh! many are the poets that are sown
By Nature; men endowed with highest gifts
The vision and the faculty divine;
Yet wanting the accomplishment of verse
(Which in the docile season of their youth
It was denied them to acquire, through lack
Of culture and the inspiring aid of books,
Or haply by a temper too severe,
Or a nice backwardness afraid of shame),
Nor having e'er, as life advanced, been led
By circumstance to take unto the height
The measure of themselves, these favoured beings,
All but a scattered few, live out their time,
Husbanding that which they possess within,
And go to the grave, unthought of. Strongest minds
Are often those of whom the noisy world
Hears least; else surely this man had not left
His graces unrevealed and unproclaimed ;
But, as the mind was filled with inward light,
So not without distinction had he lived.
Wordsworth.
MODULATION APPLIED TO ILLUSTRATIVE PASSAGES.
Imagery is interwoven in language. It is the golden thread
which runs through all Literature. Religion itself, in one
sense, is a system of images, through which we try to appre-
ciate that which is otherwise inappreciable. The merit and

effect of poetry depend upon imagery ; we judge a poet by the
class of images he uses, and the effect of his sentiment is
proportioned to the readiness with which we apprehend his
meaning through the picture-phrases he employs, or the an-
alogies between things known and unknown that he draws.
The
prose of literature and the talk of common life are largely
made up of conscious and unconscious illustration. Many
words are used to express abstractions, which are really pic-
tures of actual things, offering to our mind, if we did but know
it, “the visual image that forms their primary meaning.”
Tribulation, for instance, calls up the threshing-machine of
the Romans; caprice, the unaccountable springs and leaps of
the goat.
The literary student will, of course, notice the kind of
images used by the great writers. Bacon's illustrations are
for the most part drawn from literary sources, and are quo-
tations from the classic authors, with here and there a
reference to a familiar fact in human life. Milton's are
Biblical, literary or classical (in the “Paradise Lost”) with
occasional references to familiar pictures, such as the famous
“Vallam brosa ” reference, the description of the shield of
Satan like “the moon, whose orb through optic glass the
Tuscan artist views, &c.” The spear “to equal which the
tallest pine hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast of some
great ammiral, were but a wand," and other magnificent images,
enlarging (as all imagery should do) the ideå or sentiment
intended to be conveyed, and making even the Satanic world
understandable through the agency of familiar things dealt
with in a broad poetic spirit. Wordsworth had a theory that
poetry should reflect absolutely the manners, feelings, and ways
of thought of ordinary life. But he would not have been a
a

49
poet had he not forgotten his theory. Poetry must be true to
the great features and passions of human life, but it must
enlarge them and idealize them. Shakespeare's characters
are in themselves, historically and individually, ordinary per-
sonages, but through his scenes they move like gods, and yet
preserve their touch with human nature. They are individ-
ualities upon a broad platform, but still exhibiting sympathies
that the narrowest mind can appreciate.
In reading illustrative words or clauses, the modulation
must be adapted to their importance, and generally they are
the most important in a sentence, or a series of sentences.
An author uses illustration to make his reasoning more clear,
his sentiments more impressive, his description more forcible.
The illustration, therefore, bears the weight of the meaning,
and should be brought into prominence by appropriate
changes of voice.
The principal forms of illustration are hyperbole, person-
ification, simile, and metaphor. It might be said, however,
speaking generally, that the word “metaphorical” embraces
all classes of illustration.
Hyperbole is exaggeration or diminution, raising or
depressing things beyond or beneath their true proportions,
in order to make them more striking and fix attention upon
them:-
Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.”
“He was so gaunt, the case of a flageolet was a mansion for him.”
Simile, introduced by the word as or like, is the common
mode of illustration. It is a comparison of things unknown
with things known, an explanation of abstractions by their
analogy to something more familiar and appreciable :

His ready smile a parent's warmth expressed,
Their welfare pleased him, and their cares distressed ;
To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given,
But all his serious thoughts had rest in heaven;
As some tall cliff, that lifts its awful form,
Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm ;
Though round its breast the rolling clouds are spread
Eternal sunshine settles on its head.”-Goldsmith.

The following piece may be studied for its exquisite variety
of illustrations, and in reading it each simile, as bearing the
weight of the meaning, must be brought into prominence by
an appropriate change of modulation.
THE SKYLARK.
The true form of the verse is described later on.
“Hail to thee, blithe spirit, bird thou never wert ;
That from heaven, or near it, pourest thy full heart
In profuse strains of unpremeditated art.
Higher still and higher from the earth thou springest,
Like a cloud of fire; the blue deep thou wingest,
And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
In the golden lightening of the sunken sun,
O’er which clouds are brightening, thou dost float and run,
Like an unbodied joy whose race has just begun.
The pale purple Even melts around thy flight,
Like a star of heaven in the broad daylight
Thou art unseen, and yet I hear thy shrill delight.
Keen as are the arrows of that silver sphere,
Whose intense lamp narrows in the white dawn clear,
Until we hardly see, we feel that it is there.
All the earth and air with thy voice is loud,
As, when night is bare, from one lonely cloud
The moon rains out her beams, and heaven is overflowed.
What thou art we know not;—what is most like thee-
From rainbow-clouds there flow not drops so bright to see
As from thy presence showers a rain of melody!-
Like a poet hidden in the light of thought,
Singing hymns unbidden, till the world is wrought
To sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not.
Like a high-born maiden in a palace tower
Soothing her love-laden soul in secret hour,
With music sweet as love, which overflows her bower.
Like a glow-worm golden in a dell of dew,
Scattering unbeholden its aerial hue

Among the flowers and grass which screen it from the view,
Like a rose embowered in its own green leaves,
By warm winds deflowered till the scent it gives
Makes faint with too much sweet these heavy-winged thieves.
Sound of vernal showers on the twinkling grass,
Rain-awakened flowers, all that ever was
Joyous, and clear, and fresh, thy music doth surpass !
Teach us, sprite or bird, what sweet thoughts are thine :
I have never heard praise of love or wine
That panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.
Chorus hymeneal, or triumphal chant
Matched with thine would be all but an empty vaunt-
A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.
What objects are the fountains of thy happy strain ?
What fields, or waves, or mountains ? what shapes of sky or
plain ?
What love of thine own kind ? what ignorance of pain;
With thy clear keen joyance langour cannot be :
Shadow of annoyance never came near thee :
Thou lovest: but ne'er knew love's sad satiety.
Waking or asleep, thou of death must deem
Things more true and deep than we mortals dream;
Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?
We look before and after, and pine for what is not;
Our sincerest laughter with some pain is fraught;
Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
Yet, if we could scorn hate, and pride, and fear;
If we were things born not to shed a tear;
I know not how thy joy we ever should come near.
Better than all measures of delightful sound,
Better than all treasures that in books are found,
Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!
Teach me half the gladness that thy brain must know;
Such harmonious madness from my lips would flow,
The world should listen then, as I am listening now.”-Shelley.

moon rains out her beams; and as in Tennyson's image

“Hyder Ali resolved, in the gloomy recesses of a mind capacious
of such things, to leave the whole Carnatic an everlasting monu-
ment of vengeance, and to put perpetual desolation as a barrier
between him and those against whom the faith which holds the
moral elements of the world together was no protection. He
became at length so confident of his force, so collected in his
might, that he made no secret whatever of his dreadful resolution.
Having terminated his disputes with every enemy and every rival,
who buried their mutual animosities in their common detestation
against the creditors of the Nabob of Arcot, he drew from every
quarter whatever a savage ferocity could add to his new rudiments
in the art of destruction, and compounding all the materials of
fury, havoc, and desolation into one black cloud, he hung for a
while on the declivities of the mountains. Whilst the authors of
all these evils were idly and stupidly gazing on this menacing
meteor, which blackened all their horizon, it suddenly burst, and
poured down the whole of its contents upon the plains of the
Carnatic. Then ensued a scene of woe, the like of which no eye
had seen, no heart conceived, and which no tongue can adequately
tell. All the horrors of war before known or heard of were mercy
to that new havoc. A storm of universal fire blasted every field,
consumed every house, destroyed every temple. The miserable
inhabitants, flying from their flaming villages, in part were
slaughtered; others without regard to sex, to age, to the respect
of rank, to sacredness of function, fathers torn from children,
husbands from wives, enveloped in a whirlwind of cavalry, and
amidst the goading spears of drivers, and the trampling of
pursuing horses, were swept into captivity in an unknown and
hostile land. Those who were able to evade this tempest fled
to the walled cities. But escaping from fire, sword, and exile,
they fell into the jaws of famine.”—Burke.

Personification, the clothing of abstractions or things with
the attributes of a person, or their embodiment in character-
istic forms and actions, is one of the most striking means of
metaphorical or illustrative expression. The modulation of
the voice must be adapted to render prominent the words
which mainly suggest the personification. Collins' “Passions"
may be read as an example.
“But hail, thou Goddess sage and holy,
Hail divinest melancholy.
Come, pensive nun, devout and pure,
Sober, steadfast, and demure,
All in a robe of darkest grain.
Flowing with majestic train.”—Milton.
Procrastination is the thief of time;
Year after year it steals, till all are fled,
And to the mercies of a moment leaves
The vast concerns of an eternal scene.”— Young.
“When Learning's triumph o'er her barbarous foes,
First reared the stage, immortal Shakespeare rose;
Each change of many-coloured life he drew
Exhausted worlds, and then imagined new;
Existence saw him spurn her bounded reign
And panting time toiled after him in vain."-Johnson.
“The gentleness of heaven is on the sea;
Listen! the mighty Being is awake,
And doth with his eternal motion make
A sound like thunder-everlastingly.”—Wordsworth.
"When up some woodland dale we catch
The many twinkling smile of ocean,
And with pleased ear bewildered watch
His chime of restless motion,
Still as the surging waves retire,
They seem to gasp with strong desire;
Such signs of love old Ocean gives,
We cannot choose but think he lives.”—Keble.

“The Sundays of man's life,
Threaded together on Time's string,
Make bracelets to adorn the wife
Of the eternal glorious King.
On Sunday heaven's gate stands ope;
Blessings are plentiful and rife,
More plentiful than hope.”—Herbert.
INFLECTION.
Inflection is that turn or movement of the voice by which
the relation of one clause to another in a sentence is shown.
By its aid clauses become pointed, and the connection of
clauses is rendered clear and intelligible to an audience.
Thus, if the voice is sustained at the end of a clause, it shows
to the audience that the expression of the sense is still
incomplete, even if a long pause be made. The slide or turn
of the voice is upon the accented syllable of the emphatic
word, the remaining unemphatic words in the clause, if any,
being given on the same level of voice as is reached by the
inflection: thus, “Did he say presents of his friends or
presence of his friends ? ” with the upward on presents and
the downward on presence.
An ordinary sentence is generally composed of two or
more clauses. When certain of these clauses are in imperfect
sense, that is, not containing in themselves a sensible idea,
but dependent for their meaning upon the other parts of the
sentence, they must be read with the upward inflection.
During the reading of a sentence the voice must not be
allowed to fall until the final clause, unless the various
clauses in themselves are independent of the context for their
meaning. The upward inflection is indicative of incomplete-
ness-indecision-of something more to follow; the down-
ward, of complete sense and emphatic decision.

Conditional clauses should be read with 'sustained and
suspensive voice, so as to carry on the conditions to their
fulfilment or completion in the final clause. Sometimes
conditional clauses are independent of each other and only
connected with the final clause ; in this case the difference
between each condition may be marked by a falling inflection,
but the last of the conditional clauses must be given with a
strong upward inflection to connect itself and preceding
clauses with the conclusion of the sentence.
Falling inflection at end of each clause in following lines:
(the clauses are marked by the semicolons), but a very strong
upward on the accented syllable of sicken to connect the
whole series with the conclusion. But it may, perhaps, be
quite as well, if not better read, by an upward suspensive
inflection all through, until the final clause.
* Though you untie the winds and let them fight
Against the Churches; though the yesty waves
Confound and swallow navigation up;
Though bladed corn be lodg’d and trees blown down ;
Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
Though palaces and pyramids do slope
Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
Of nature's germins tumble altogether
E'en till destruction sicken: answer me
To what I ask you."
Shakespeare.
The following should be read with a sustained voice—that
is, the use of a moderate upward inflection at the end of each
line, varied occasionally with a slight downward turn, but not
sufficiently decisive to close the meaning, say on "night,"
"tower," “ die,” "rave.” A very strong upward on “grave,”
to prepare for the completion of the conditional phrases by
the closing lines

“If thou would'st view fair Melrose aright,
Go visit it by the pale moonlight;
For the gay beams of lightsome day
Gild but to flout the ruins grey.
When the broken arches are black in night,
And each shaftéd oriel glimmers white,
When the cold light's uncertain shower
Streams on the ruined central tower;
When buttress and buttress, alternately,
Seem framed of ebon and ivory;
When silver edges the imagery,
And the scrolls that teach thee to live and die ;
When distant Tweed is heard to rave,
And the owlet to hoot o'er the dead man's grave,
Then go-but go alone the while-
Then view St. David's ruined pile;
And, home returning, soothly swear,
Was never scene so sad and fair."
Scott.
The following sentences may be read effectively either by
giving the upward inflection at the end of all the clauses
except the last, or a slightly downward turn of the voice
might be given at the end of each conditional clause; except
the last clause of this character, which should be given with a
very strongly marked upward movement on the word "relief”
to connect the series with the conclusion which covers all.
But perhaps the best way is to keep the idea of the incom-
pleteness of the clauses before the audience by the upward
inflection throughout, so that the conclusion will be naturally
expected and waited for.

celestial spheres should forget their wonted motions, and by
irregular volubility turn themselves any way, as it might happen;
if the prince of the lights of heaven, which now as a giant doth
run his unwearied course, should, as it were, through a
languishing faintness, begin to stand and to rest himself; if the
moon should wander from her beaten way, the times and seasons
of the year blend themselves by disordered and confused mixture,
the winds breathe out their last gasp, the clouds yield no rain,
the earth be defeated of heavenly influence, the fruits of the
earth pine away as children at the withered breasts of their
mother no longer able to yield them relief ;-what would become
of man himself whom these things now do all serve ? See we not
plainly that obedience of creatures unto the law of nature is the
stay of the whole world ?”—Hooker.
The conditional, imperfect, and negative clauses in the
following extract may be read with the upward inflection ;
words expressing distinction or comparison between ideas
or qualities with upward, followed by downward inflections,
and complete clauses and ends of sentences with downward
turns of the voice.
PITT.
“ The secretary stood alone. Modern degeneracy had not
reached him. Original and unaccommodating, the features of his
character had the hardihood of antiquity. His august mind over-
awed majesty, and one of his sovereigns thought royalty so
impaired in his presence, that he conspired to remove him, in
order to be relieved from his superiority. No state chicanery, no
narrow system of vicious politics, sunk him to the vulgar level of
the great; but, overbearing, persuasive, and impracticable, his
object was England, his ambition was fame. Without dividing
he destroyed party ; without corrupting, he made a venal age
unanimous. France sank beneath him. With one hand he
smote the house of Bourbon, and wielded in the other the demo-
cracy of England. The sight of his mind was infinite ; and his
schemes were to affect, not England, not the present age only, but
Europe and posterity. Wonderful were the means by which these
schemes were accomplished; always seasonable, always adequate;

the suggestions of an understanding animated by ardour and
enlightened by prophecy.
“A character so exalted, so strenuous, so various, so authorita-
tive, astonished a corrupt age, and the Treasury trembled at the
name of Pitt through all classes of venality. Corruption imagined,
indeed, that she had found defects in this statesman, and talked
much of the inconsistency of his glory, and the ruin of his
victories; but the history of his country, and the calamities of the
enemy, answered and refuted her. Nor were his political abilities
his only talents: his eloquence was an era in the senate, peculiar
and spontaneous, familiarly expressing gigantic sentiments and
instinctive wisdom; not like the torrent of Demosthenes, or the
splendid conflagration of Tully; it resembled sometimes the
thunder, and sometimes the music of the spheres. He did not
conduct the understanding through the painful subtlety of argu-
mentation, nor was he for ever on the rack of exertion ; but rather
lightened upon the subject, and reached the point by the flashings
of the mind, which, like those of his eye, were felt, but could not
be followed. Upon the whole, there was in this man something
that could create, subvert, or reform ; an understanding, a spirit,
and an eloquence, to summon mankind to society, or to break the
bonds of slavery asunder, and to rule the wildness of free minds
with unbounded authority ; something that could establish or
overwhelm empire, and strike a blow in the world that should
resound through the universe.”—Grattan.
INFLECTION APPLIED TO INTERROGATIVE SENTENCES.
Interrogatories are of two kinds--the determinate and
indeterminate. The former must be read with the down-
ward, and the latter with the upward inflection. Determinate
questions are those which contain within themselves the
solution of the point involved-which do not require an
answer; or to which, it is assumed, only one answer can
be given. These interrogatories are used principally for
rhetorical effect, as being a more pointed and emphatic way
of saying that which would be less effectively said in a
plain affirmative or negative statement. The following

selection contains a number of these rhetorical questions:
the opening sentence will have a strong downward turn
force.” The next two questions can be given with the
upward, because they are incomplete without the speaker's
answer, “No !” The conditional clauses, “ If we wish to be
free," etc., to be read with the upward—then a downward
turn on “fight"; and the phrase being repeated, the
emphasis is altered, and "must" is inflected strongly
downward. The extraordinary force given to the questions,
“Why stand we here idle ? What is it that gentlemen
wish? What would they have ?” by the downward inflection
will be obvious. The succeeding question can be given with
the rising inflection, because the speaker immediately supplies

an answer.
“I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its
purpose be not to force us to submission ? Can gentlemen assign
any other possible motive for it ? Has Great Britain any enemy
in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of
navies and armies ? No, sir, she has none. They are meant for
us; they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind
and to rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have
been so long forging. And what have we to oppose to them?
Shall we try argument ? Sir, we have been trying that for the last
ten years. Have we anything new to offer upon the subject ?
Nothing. We have held the subject up in every light of which it
is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to
entreaty and humble supplication ? What terms shall we find
which have not been already exhausted ? Let us not, I beseech
you, sir, deceive ourselves longer. Sir, we have done everything
that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on.
We have petitioned, we have remonstrated, we have supplicated,
we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored
its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and
parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances
have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications

have been disregarded : and we have been spurned with contempt
from the foot of the throne. In vain, after these things, may we
indulge the fond hope of peace and reconciliation. There is no
longer any room for hope. If we wish to be free--if we mean to
preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have
been so long contending—if we mean not basely to abandon the
noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and
which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the
glorious object of our contest shall be obtained,,we must fight;
I repeat it, sir,—we must fight! An appeal to arms, and to the
God of hosts, is all that is left us!
They tell us, sir, that we are weak—'unable to cope with so
formidable an adversary!' But when shall we be stronger ? Will
it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are
totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in
Shall we gather strength by irresolution and
inaction ? Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by
lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive phantom of
hope, until our enemies have bound us hand and foot ? Sir, we
are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the
God of nature hath placed in our power. Three millions of people
armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that
which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy
can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles
alone. There is a just Power who presides over the destinies of
nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us.
The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone ; it is to the vigilant, the
active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have no election. If we were
base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the
contest. There is no retreat but in submission and slavery. Our
chains are forged. Their clanking may be heard on the plains of
Boston. The war is inevitable, and let it come! I repeat it, sir,
let it come! It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentle-
men may cry, ' Peace, peace !' but there is no peace. The war
is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will
bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are
already in the field! Why stand we here idle ? What is it that
gentlemen wish? What would they have ? Is life so dear, or
peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and

slavery ? Forbid it, almighty Powers! I know not what course
others may take; but as for me, give me liberty, or give me
death!”-Patrick Henry.
Indeterminate questions are those which ask for informa-
tion, which leave the point at issue open-which determine
nothing in themselves, but depend for their completeness
upon the answer to be given. These should be read with the
upward inflection upon the accented syllable of the emphatic
word. Examples of both classes of interrogative sentences
will be seen in the following selections. Questions express-
ing surprise are read with the upward inflection ; ejaculations
of indignation with the downward movement :-
“Wherefore rejoice ? What conquest brings he home ?
What tributaries follow him to Rome,
To grace in captive bonds his chariot wheels ?
You blocks ! you stones ! you worse than senseless things!
Oh, you hard hearts ! you cruel men of Rome!
Knew you not Pompey ? Many a time and oft
Have you
climbed up to walls and battlements,
To towers and windows, yea, to chimney tops,
Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
The live-long day, with patient expectation
To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome.
And when you saw his chariot but appear,
Have you not made a universal shout,
That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
To hear the replication of your sounds
Made in her concave shores ?
And do you now put on your best attire ?
And do you now cull out a holiday,
And do you now strew flowers in his way
That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood ?
Begone!
Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
Pray to the Gods to intermit the plague
That needs must light on this ingratitude.”—Shakespeare.

The following suspensive or inconclusive clauses are to
be read with the upward, or continuative inflection; the
determinate questions, with the downward inflection; the
indeterminate questions, answerable by “yes” or “no," with
the upward inflection :-
Though the earth were to be burnt up; though the trumpet
of its dissolution were sounded; though yon sky were to pass
away as a scroll, and every visible glory which the finger of the
Divinity has inscribed on it were extinguished for ever—an event,
so awful to us, and to every world in our vicinity, by which so
many suns would be extinguished, and so many varied scenes of
life and population would rush into forgetfulness,-what is it in
the high scale of the Almighty's workmanship ? A mere shred,
which, though scattered into nothing, would leave the univers
one entire scene of greatness and of majesty. Though the earth
and the heavens were to disappear, there are other worlds which
roll afar; the light of other suns shines upon them, and the sky
which mantles them is garnished with other stars. Is it pre-
sumption to say that the moral world extends to these distant and
unknown regions ? that they are occupied with people ? that the
charities of home and of neighbourhood flourish there ? that the
praises of God are there lifted up, and His goodness rejoiced in ?
that there piety has its temples and its offerings; and the rich-
ness of the divine attributes is there felt and admired by
intelligent worshippers ?"--Chalmers.
The first of the following questions to be inflected upward
on “performed”—the other two downward what,”
seen,” and “heard”: the answer to be sustained unti the
end:
“ Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere :
* Hast thou performed my mission which I gave ?
What is it thou hast seen, or what hast heard ?'
And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere,
• I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,
And the wild water lapping on the crag.'

The above lines are also good practice for an easy change
of position in indicating two characters. The first three
lines, with left foot slightly advanced, and turning face about
half way to right; the second three, with right foot advanced,
and face turned half way to left, still keeping the body
fronting the audience, without turning to either side except
slightly.
INFLECTION APPLIED TO ANTITHETICAL SENTENCES.
Antithesis, the opposition of two ideas, or two sides-50
to speak-of an idea, the relation between two opposite
sentiments, both of them springing from the same root, or,
in other words, connected with the same line of thought, is
an effective, though in inferior literature a highly artificial,
mode of expression. We not only understand a thing by
what it is, but also by its opposite. An effective antithesis
combines the qualities of condensation, rapid contrast,
energy. It should be short, striking, perspicuous, and
decisive. It bespeaks preparation, care, and polish. It is
not consistent with loose or straggling sentences.
It is
concise contrast. Truth is opposed to error as light is to
darkness, but when they are brought into direct contrast, the
truth becomes more clear, the light more intense. Contrast
brings out into greater prominence the peculiar properties of
each; and contrast, upon a larger scale than mere verbal
antithesis, is the principal means of producing dramatic
effect. The play or contrast of character and passion is the
essence of dramatic effect.
Whately gives the following sentence as an instance of
the combined effect of antithesis and metaphor in producing
increased energy:—“Words are the counters of wise men
.

65
and the money of fools.” He also gives the following speci-
mens of antithesis :—“ Party is the madness of many for the
gain of a few.” “A proverb is the wisdom of many and the
wit of one.” A true antithesis consists in the opposition not
of mere sounds in words, but of ideas. Many specimens of
pedantic, fanciful, and often purely verbal antitheses could
be extracted from Lyly's “Euphues” (a book which gave
rise to the term “Euphuism"); many instances of true,
material opposition of ideas are to be found in Bacon's
Essays. See how Bacon explains what truth is by what it
is not.
The poems of Pope are full of antitheses. Take the well-
known line, "To err is human, to forgive divine." The
general rule is that opposition of sense should be rendered
by opposition of inflection in the tones of the voice,
and accordingly the above line would be read with the down-
ward slide of the voice upon “err," the upward on the first
syllable of “human,” the upward also upon the second
syllable in “forgive," and the downward bringing the
sentence to an emphatic close upon the last of " divine." In
this way all the opposition in the sense will be brought out
clearly by the voice.
Take also Rochester's lines :-
“Here lies our sovereign lord the king,
Whose word no man relies on;
Who never said a foolish thing,
Nor ever did a wise one."
In the above, said (down) is in opposition to did (up), and
foolish (up) to wise (down), and the inflection must be so
placed that the last part of the antithesis should be marked by
the downward turn of the voice.
E

Outlines of the Art of Elocution.
Sometimes the first part of an antithesis is of so much more
importance, and requires greater emphasis, than the latter
part, that the downward inflection is used first, as in the
following verse by Kingsley. The positive "do” takes the
downward, and the negative "dream" the upward. “Good”
and “clever” may be contrasted in the same way.
“ Be good, sweet child, and let who will be clever;
Do noble things, not dream them all day long;
And so make life, death, and that vast forever
One grand sweet song.”
Take also an extract from one of Brougham's speeches :-
“ It was the boast of Augustus-it formed part of the glare in
which the perfidies of his earlier years were lost—that he found
Rome of brick, and left it of marble ; but how much nobler will
be our sovereign's boast when he shall have it to say that he
found law dear, and left it cheap; found it a sealed book, left
it an open letter; found it the patrimony of the rich, left it the
inheritance of the poor; found it the two-edged sword of craft
and oppression-left it the staff of honesty, and the shield of
innocence !"
If found be read with the downward inflection-left with
the upward, brick with the upward, and marble with the down-
ward, a sufficient idea will be obtained of the proper mode of
reading the whole of the sentence.
There is a double wealth of meaning in sentences that are
properly spoken, because the manner of reading implies more
than that which is actually said. The actual statement which
is made becomes more emphatic, because of the silent but
still real meaning which marches alongside of it, and which
is alone made intellectually visible, so to speak, by the inflec-
tion which is given upon a particular word. “They that are
•
whole need not a physician.”. A circumflex inflection on
• whole,” first down and then up, suggests the implication

that the sick do need one. “The quality of mercy is not
strained,” with the same inflection on “strained,” implies
“ ” '
that it is gracious and voluntary; “How beautiful is nature
in her wildest scenes !” with a circumflex on “wild,” first up
and then down, implies what must be her beauty in softer,
gentler scenes. In the following further extract from
Brougham's speech, a circumflex (down and up) on done'
implies that the work is not done but going on. Again, the
proper order of the inflections in the “grapes” sentence is to
use the falling on “grapes," rising on “thorns," rising on
'
"figs,” and falling on “thistles,” in accordance with the usual
rule that the falling inflection should come last in an anti-
thetical sentence. (See also two following chapters on
Implied Meaning and Implication as an oratorical force.)
LAW REFORM.
“After a long interval of various fortune, and filled with vast
events, we are again called to the grand labour of surveying and
amending our laws. For this task it well becomes us to begird
ourselves, as the honest representatives of the people. Despatch
and vigour are imperiously demanded; but that deliberation, too,
must not be lost sight of, which so mighty an enterprise requires.
When we shall have done the work, we may fairly challenge the
utmost approval of our constituents; for in none other have they
so deep a stake.
“In pursuing the course which I now, invite you to enter upon,
I avow that I look for the co-operation of the King's government;
and on what are my hopes founded ? Men gather not grapes from
thorns, nor figs from thistles; but that the vine should no longer
yield its wonted fruit—that the fig tree should refuse its natural
increase—required a miracle to strike it with barrenness. But
whether I have the support of the Ministers or no, to the House
I look, with confident expectation that it will control them, and
assist me; if I go too far, checking my progress; if I go too fast,
abating my speed; but heartily and honestly helping me, in the

You have the power of sending your name down through

import than ever were done within these walls. You saw the
greatest warrior of the age-conqueror of Italy-humbler of
Germany—terror of the North-you saw him account all his match-
less victories poor, compared with the triumph which you are now
in a condition to win!--saw him contemn the fickleness of Fortune,

'I shall go down to posterity with my code in my hand!' You

which false courtiers feigned for our Edwards and Harrys—the

good, to that monarch under whose sway so mighty an undertaking
shall be accomplished. Of a truth, sceptres are chiefly to be
envied for that they bestow the power of thus conquering and
ruling. To me, much reflecting on these things, it has always
seemed a worthier honour to be the instrument of making you
bestir yourselves in this high matter, than to enjoy all that office
can bestow-office of which the patronage would be irksome
incumbrance, the emoluments superfluous to one content, with
the rest of his industrious fellow-citizens, that his own hands
minister to his wants; and as for the power supposed to follow it,
I have lived nearly half a century, and I have learned that power
and place may be severed. But one power I do prizem-that of
being the advocate of my countrymen here, and their fellow-
labourer elsewhere, in those things which concern the best inte-
rests of mankind. That power, I know full well, no government
can give-no change take away!"-Brougham,
The following is a specimen of Pope's balanced phrase
harmonizing with the contrasted idea. See the fourth line,
with the upward inflection on "good" and the downward on
“ill," and in the sixth line the same holds good in regard to
“takes” and “ gives.”

Where only merit constant pay receive's,
Is bless'd in what it takes and what it gives;
The joy unequalled, if its end it gain;
And, if it lose, attended with no pain;
Without satiety, though e'er so bless'd,
And but more relish'd as the more distress'd;
The broadest mirth unfeeling folly wears,
Less pleasing far than virtue's very tears;
Good, from each object, from each place, acquir'd;
For ever exercis'd, yet never tir'd;
Never elated while one man's oppress'd ;
Never dejected, while another's bless'd;
And where no wants, no wishes, can remain,
Since but to wish more virtue, is to gain.
See the sole bliss Heaven could on all bestow,
Which who but feels can taste, but thinks can know;
Yet, poor with fortune, and with learning blind,
The bad must miss, the good untaught will find ;
Slave to no sect, who takes no private road,
But looks through nature up to nature's God;
Pursues that chain which links the immense design,
Joins heaven and earth, and mortal and divine;
Sees that no being any bliss can know,
But touches some above and some below;
Learns, from this union of the rising whole,
The first, last purpose of the human soul ;
And knows where faith, law, morals, all began,
All end,-in love of God and love of man.”—Pope.
The following are specimens of pointed or antithetical
writing in the description of character, the contrasted cha-
racteristics being clearly rendered by opposing inflections of
the voice :--

NAPOLEON.
· Flung into life in the midst of a revolution that quickened
every energy of a people who acknowledged no superior,
Napoleon commenced his course a stranger by birth and a
scholar by charity. With no friend but his sword, and no fortune
but his talents, he rushed into the lists where rank and genius
had arrayed themselves ; and competition fled from him as from
the glance of destiny. He knew no motive but interest—he
acknowledged no criterion but success—he worshipped no God
but ambition; and with an Eastern devotion he knelt at the altar
of his idolatry. Subsidiary to this, there was no creed that he
did not profess, there was no opinion that he did not promulgate;
in the hope of a dynasty, he upheld the Crescent; for the sake of
a divorce he bowed before the Cross; the orphan of St. Louis, he
became the adopted child of the republic; and with a parricidal
ingratitude, on the ruins both of the crown and the tribune, he
reared the throne of his despotism. A professed Catholic, he
imprisoned the Pope ; a pretended patriot he impoverished the
country; and, under the name of Brutus, he grasped without
remorse, and wore without shame, the diadem of the Cæsars !
* Through this pantomime of his policy, fortune played the
clown to his caprices. At his touch crowns crumbled, beggars
reigned, systems vanished, the wildest theories took the colour of
his whims; and all that was venerable, and all that was novel,
changed places with the rapidity of a drama. Even apparent
defeat assumed the appearance of victory-his flight from Egypt
confirmed his destiny-ruin itself only elevated him to empire.
But if his fortune was great, his genius was transcendent;
decision flashed upon his counsels; and it was the same to
decide and to perform. To inferior intellects, his combinations
appeared perfectly impossible, his plans perfectly impracticable;
but in his hands, simplicity marked their development, and
success vindicated their adoption. His person partook of the
character of his mind; if the one never yielded in the Cabinet, the
other never bent in the field. Nature had no obstacles that he
did not surmount, space no opposition that he did not spurn; and
whether amid Alpine rocks, Arabian sands, or polar snows, he
seemed proof against peril and empowered with ubiquity. The

whole continent of Europe trembled at beholding the audacity of
his designs and the miracle of their execution.
Kings may learn from him that their safest study, as well as
their noblest, is the interest of the people; the people are taught
by him that there is no despotism, however stupendous, against
which they have not a resource; and to those who would rise
upon the ruins of both, he is a living lesson, that if ambition can
raise them from the lowest station, it can also prostrate them
from the highest."--Phillips.
BURKE.
“ Here lies our good Edmund, whose genius was such,
We scarcely can praise it, or blame it too much ;
Who, born for the universe, narrow'd his mind,
And to party gave up what was meant for mankind.
Tho' fraught with all learning, yet straining his throat,
To persuade Tommy Townshend to lend him a vote;
Who, too deep for his hearers, still went on refining,
And thought of convincing, while they thought of dining ;
Tho' equal to all things, for all things unfit,
Too nice for a statesman, too proud for a wit ;
For a patriot too cool ; for a drudge, disobedient ;
And too fond of the right to pursue the expedient.
In short 'twas his fate, unemploy’d, or in place, sir,
To eat mutton cold, and cut blocks with a razor.”—Goldsmith.
JAMES THE FIRST.
“But such inconsistency in dress and appointments were mere
outward types of those which existed in the royal character;
rendering it a subject of doubt amongst his contemporaries, and
bequeathing it as a problem to future historians. He was deeply
learned, without possessing useful knowledge; sagacious in
many individual cases, without having real wisdom; fond of his
power, and desirous to maintain and augment it, yet willing to
resign the direction of that, and of himself, to the most unworthy
favourites; a big and bold assertor of his rights in words, yet one
who tamely saw them trampled on in deeds; a lover of negotia-
tions, in which he was always outwitted ; and one who feared war
where conquest might have been easy. He was fond of his
dignity; while he was perpetually degrading it by undue famil-

iarity; capable of much public labour, yet often neglecting it for
the meanest amusement; a wit, though a pedant; and a scholar,
though fond of the conversation of the ignorant and uneducated.
Even his timidity of temper was not uniform ; and there were
moments of his life, and those critical, in which he showed the
spirit of his ancestors. He was laborious in trifles, and a trifler
where serious labour was required; devout in his sentiments, and
yet too often profane in his language; just and beneficient by
nature, he yet gave way to the iniquities and oppression of others.
He was penurious respecting money when he had to give from his
own hand, yet inconsiderately and unboundedly profuse of that
which he did not see. In a word, those good qualities which
displayed themselves in particular cases and occasions, were not
of a nature sufficiently firm and comprehensive to regulate his
general conduct; and, showing themselves as they occasionally
did, only entitled James to the character bestowed on him by
Sully,—that he was the wisest fool in Christendom.”—Sir Walter
Scott.

Cæsar, this is my answer :-not that I loved Cæsar less, but that
I loved Rome more. Had you rather Cæsar were living, and die

IMPLIED MEANING.
Implied, referential, or indirect meaning depends, of course,
upon the circumstances in which it is spoken, and derives its
point and power from the expressive tones of the voice. Irony
is assuming something to be correct for the purpose of
demonstrating its inaccuracy. When we assume as true the
premises we design to disprove, it is evident we are speaking
ironically.” To the two works mentioned by Whately as
specimens of irony (his own “Historic Doubts" and Burke's
“Defence of Natural Society") may perhaps be added Defoe's
"The Shortest Way with the Dissenters.” Ironical sentences
are those which say one thing and mean another, and they
depend for their point in speaking upon the circumflex inflec-
tions of voice, that is, a combination of the upward and
downward movements. In the opening sentence of the
following speech the speaker does not mean what he says,
that it is an atrocious crime to be a young man, but he speaks
the words atrocious, crime, young, spirit, and decency, in such a
way (by the long circumflex inflection) as to suggest the very
opposite of the grammatical meaning of the sentence, and to
display more forcibly the absurdity of his opponent's attack.
The speech contains several implied meanings. There is a
special sting in the whoever of the last sentence.
“The atrocious crime of being a young man, which the honour-
able gentleman has, with such spirit and decency, charged upon
me, I shall neither attempt to palliate nor deny; but content
myself with wishing that I may be one of those whose follies may
cease with their youth, and not one of those who continue ignorant
in spite of age and experience.
“Whether youth can be attributed to any man as a reproach,
I will not, sir, assume the province of determining; but surely age
may justly become contemptible, if the opportunities which it

a
brings have passed away without improvement, and vice appear
to prevail when the passions have subsided. The wretch who,
after having seen the consequences of a thousand erroès, continues
still to blunder, and in whom age has only added obstinacy to
stupidity, is surely the object either of abhorrence or contempt,
and deserves not that his grey head should secure him from
insults! Much more, sir, is he to be abhorred who, as he has
advanced in age, has receded from virtue, and become more
wicked with less temptation ; who prostitutes himself for money
which he cannot enjoy, and spends the remains of his life in the
ruin of his country.
“But youth, sir, is not my only crime; I have been accused of
acting a theatrical part. A theatrical part may either imply
some peculiarities of gesture, or a dissimulation of my real senti-
ments, and the adoption of the opinions and language of another
man.
“ In the first sense, sir, the charge is too trifling to be confuted,
and deserves to be mentioned only that it may be despised. I am
at liberty, like every other man, to use my own language; and
though I may, perhaps, have some ambition to please this gentle-
man, I shall not lay myself under any restraint, nor very solicitously
copy his diction or his mien, however matured by age, or modelled
by experience.
“But with regard to those whom I have offended, I am of opinion
that if I had acted a borrowed part, I should have avoided their
censure—the heat which offended them is the ardour of conviction
and that zeal for the service of my country which neither hope nor
fear shall influence me to suppress. I will not sit unconcerned
while my liberty is invaded, nor look in silence npon public
robbery; I will exert my endeavours, at whatever hazard, to repel
the aggressor and drag the thief to justice, whoever may protect
him in his villainý, and whoever may partake of his plunder.”-
Attributed to Pitt.
The emphatic words in the following sarcastic passage
should be read with the circumflex inflection. Sarcasm may
be defined as irony made broad and strong with feeling : but
with feeling controlled, so as not to become mere denunciation.

“Satan beheld their plight,
And to his mates thus in derision call's :
O friends, why come not on those victors proud ?
Ere while they fierce were coming and when we,
To entertain them fair with

front
And breast (what could we more ?), propounded terms
Of composition, straight they changed their minds,
Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,
As they would dance: yet for a dance they seem'd
Somewhat extravagant and wild, perhaps
For joy of offer'd peace; but I suppose,
If our proposals once again were heard,
We should compel them to a quick result.”—Milton.
IMPLICATION AS AN ORATORICAL FORCE.
Oratory is effective as much in what is implied as in what is
actually said. Mark Antony's oration is magnificent in the
breadth and force of its implied meanings. The continued
reference to Brutus as an honourable man, side by side with
a growing but silent suggestion to the contrary, until the
audience are ready for the open denunciation of Brutus and
his friends as traitors—the suggestion to mutiny and rage
made more forcible by seeming deprecation-the searching
reference to the “private griefs” of Brutus and his friends,
and the “ reasons
with which they “no doubt” will answer-
the extraordinary significance of the closing sentences,
especially that which would be developed by a long circumflex
inflection
the word stones all these points must be
obvious to the student. Mark Antony's oration is a model of
form, besides containing all the elements of oratorical force.
In form it begins with an exordium, in which the subject of
the speech or the object of the speaker is broadly stated. It
then goes into detailed argumentation, and draws inferences
from facts. Something is stated as a fact, or something
upon

77
assumed upon which both sides would be agreed, the
argument consisting in the inferences drawn from the fact or
the assumption. The facts are : Cæsar was faithful and just
as a friend ; he put the captives' ransoms into the general
coffers, not into his own pocket; he refused the kingly crown,
and so on; and the inference drawn from each fact was that
he could not be ambitious, and that Brutus and his friends
had no ground for their charge of ambition against him.
When the argumentation had done its work, the speaker
gathered himself together for the peroration, in which he
broadly stated his whole argument, pointed out the action to
which his words would lead, and brought to bear all the
resources of passionate declamation to confirm the impression
he had made, to make sure of the action or the result that he
desired. This is the form of the speech, the model upon
which all speeches should be framed-exordium, argumenta-
tion, peroration. Modern speaking is mostly slovenly, without
plan or arrangement; ideas, facts, arguments, sentiments, are
all poured out like potatoes from a sack. Whereas arrange-
ment conduces to clearness of both speaker and audience, and
is one great essential in producing effect. The words of a
speech need not be learned, but the plan and argument
should be determined beforehand.
Mark Antony's oration, besides showing the general con-
structive form, contains all the elements or constituents of
oratory : simple statement, words exactly adapted to meaning,
clear deduction of inference from fact, personal appeal,
pathos, irony, sarcasm, forcible ejaculation, appeal to broad
abstract principles, occasional imagery, vivid description, and
passionate declamation. With great simplicity of diction it
is full of movement and energy. As an elocutionary exercise

the speech may be read with especial attention to the long
combined inflections as bringing out the implied meanings.
The people had been under the spell of Brutus's speech, and
at first Antony speaks as if he meant what he says in calling
Brutus honourable; but as the speech goes on, and the speaker
becomes more sure of his audience, the epithet becomes
more sarcastic, and is spoken in such a way as to imply its
opposite, until the speaker is able to give full play to his
passion in declamation. Mark also the increasing emphasis
was” before “ambitious," and the breadth of implied
meaning in mutiny, an idea that the speaker suggests while
at the same time he disclaims it (it is a case of “ Don't put
him under the pump"); also in stones, because if even the
stones are moved, how much more should the warm hearts of
the men of Rome be affected !
Friends, Romans, countrymen ! lend me your ears :
I come to bury Cæsar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their bones :
So let it be with Cæsar! The noble Brutus
Hath told you, Cæsar was ambitious-
If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
And grievously hath Cæsar answered it!
Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest-
For Brutus is an honourable mán,
So are they all, all honourable men-
Come I speak in Cæsar's funeral.
He was my friend, faithful and just to me,
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill :
Did this in Cæsar seem ambitious ?
When that the poor have cried, Cæsar hath wept.
Ambition should be made of sterner stuff-

Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal,
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition ?
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And sure he is an honourable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke ;
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once-not without cause !
What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him ?
O Judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason ? Bear with me :
My heart is in the coffin there with Cæsar;
And I must pause till it come back to me !-
But yesterday the word of Cæsar might
Have stood against the world—now lies he there,
And none so poor to do him reverence !
O masters ! if I were disposed to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong and Cassius wrong,
Who, you all know, are honourable men!
I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself, and you,
Than I will wrong such honourable men !
But here's a parchment with the seal of Cæsar-
I found it in his closet-'tis his will !
Let but the Commons hear this testament-
Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read, -
And they would go and kiss dead Cæsar's wounds,
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood ;
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing it, as a rich legacy,
Unto their issue !-
Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
It is not meet you know how Cæsar loved you;
You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
And being men, hearing the will of Cæsar,

It will inflame you, it will make you mad;
'Tis good, you know not that you are his heirs,
For if you should, oh, what would come of it !
Will you be patient, will you stay awhile ?
I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it;
I fear I wrong the honourable men,
Whose daggers have stabbed Cæsar; I do fear it.
You will compel me then to read the will ?
Then make a ring about the corse of Cæsar
And let me show you him that made the will.
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this mantle : I remember,
The first time ever Cæsar put it on,
'Twas on a summer's evening in his tent,
That day he overcame the Nervii-
Look! in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
See what a rent the envious Casca made:
Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb’d;
And as he plucked his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Cæsar followed it,
As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no :
For Brutus, as you know, was Cæsar's angel ;
Judge, O ye gods ! how dearly Cæsar loved him !
This was the most unkindest cut of all ;
For when the noble Cæsar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitor's arms,
Quite vanquish'd him ; then burst his mighty heart;
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
Which all the while ran blood, great Cæsar fell.
Oh, what a fall was there, my countrymen !
Then I and you, and all of us fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
Oh, now you weep, and I perceive you feel
The dint of pity; these are gracious drops,
Kind souls; what! weep you when you but behold
Our Cæsar's vesture wounded ? look you here !
Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.

Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
They that have done this deed are honourable.
What private griefs they have, alas ! I know not,
That made them do it; they are wise and honourable ;
And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts;
I am no orator, as Brutus is ;
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
That loved my friend : and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him ;
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action nor uttrance, nor the power of speech
To stir men's blood; I only speak right on;
I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
Show you sweet Cæsar's wounds, poor, poor dumb mouths,
And bid them speak for me; but were I Brutus
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
In every wound of Cæsar that should move
The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny."
Shakespeare.
CLIMAX.
In Climax is combined the most forcible application of the
rules relating to modulation, inflection, emphasis, and expres ·
sion.
-a
In oratory there is a definite object to be gained a certain
impression to be produced. The gradations of an argument
lead to an irresistible conclusion—the details of a picture
grow into a striking story or a grand effect-and as the
speaker approaches that conclusion, the breadth, passion,
force of manner, should correspond with the expansion and
importance of his meaning: there should be a louder, more
emphatic tone of voice, amore earnest expression of countenance

and more vigorous gesture. A level and monotonous manner
does not suit with the progression there must always be in the
expression of meaning. The interest shown by the speaker
should rise with the increasing interest of his speech. It is a
common fault to allow the voice to decrease in emphasis and
energy as the close of a sentence or a series is reached, when
the words are really more important in themselves, and also
because of the meaning accumulated by the previous words.
In speeches intended to move the feelings of an audience
by passionate declamation, it is a great mistake for the speaker
to exhaust himself at the outset, thus rendering that which
ought to be the climax of his speech its least effective portion.
Besides, a great display of passion, with its accompaniment
of extreme gesture, is highly ridiculous unless the sympathies
of the audience are proportionately excited.
A skilful artist, in painting a picture, arranges his subor-
dinate effects in such a manner as to bring into greater
prominence, and exhibit in a more intense light, the central
point of interest. The reciter should remember this, and not
give each petty detail in violent monotony. He must mix his
colours, throw in light and shade, and arrange each subor-
dinate part in such a way as to bring into bolder relief those
passages which contain the climax of his meaning, the central
group of his picture—the heart of his passion. For instance,
in Macaulay's rendering of the “Legend of Horatius,” the
description of the Tuscan army, and of the three Roman
warriors, is quite subordinate in interest, and should be given
so as to lead up to the fight which follows. Again, the inte-
rest of hewing down the bridge culminates in the verse
relating to the river :-

concen-
"And burst the curb and bounded,
Rejoicing to be free,
And whirling down in fierce career
Battlement and plank and pier,
Rushed headlong to the sea.”
And later in the poem the interest is, in like manner,
trated in the swimming of the Tiber by Horatius, whilst the
jubilatory sentences at the end should be spoken with vehe-
ment emphasis, as expressing in general terms, like the chorus
of a song, or the peroration of a speech, the sentiment of the
production.
The following sentences will illustrate declamatory climax.
It will be noticed how the sense broadens until it can go no
further, or, in other words, how it rises to a certain point,
“ Universal Emancipation,” higher than which it cannot go.
Each recurrence of this phrase (in itself a great rhetorical
effect, because it keeps the main idea of the speech before
the audience in a striking manner) is therefore a climax.
But the last is the most important one, because it is not only
broader in meaning than the sentences which precede it, but
is weighted with all the passion and significance of those
sentences as well as its own. See also the rising importance
of each no matter."
UNIVERSAL EMANCIPATION.
:
“I put it to your oaths :-do you think that a blessing of that
kind—that a victory obtained by justice over bigotry and oppres-
sion should have a stigma cast upon it, by an ignominious
sentence upon men bold and honest enough to propose that
measure ?—to propose the reclaiming of three millions of men
from bondage, and giving liberty to all who had a right to
demand it ?--giving, I say, in the so much censured words of this
paper, giving Universal Emancipation !' I speak in the spirit of

the British law, which makes liberty commensurate with and
inseparable from British soil ;—which proclaims, even to the
stranger and sojourner, the moment he sets his foot upon British
earth, that the ground upon which he treads is holy, and conse-
crated by the genius of Universal Emancipation. No matter in
what language his doom may have been pronounced; no matter
what complexion, incompatible with freedom, an Indian or
African sun may have burnt upon him; no matter in what
disastrous battle his liberty may have been cloven down; no
matter with what solemnities he may have been devoted upon the
altar of slavery ;-the first moment he touches the sacred soil of
Britain, the altar and the god sink together into the dust; his
soul walks abroad in her own majesty ; his body swells beyond
the measure of the chains that burst from around him; and
he stands-redeemed, regenerated, and disenthralled, by the
irresistible genius of Universal Emancipation.'"--Curran.
The following is a series of sentences, each containing a
description or picture, at the close of which, -as its climax-
rises a grand rhetorical question. The first sentence ends at
"blenched," and the second at foe.” The way in which
the single idea of union-in the last section-is presented
under varied forms, produces a very beautiful rhetorical
effect.

own glorfous isle, precipitated herself upon the foe? The blood of
England, of Scotland, and of Ireland, flowed in the same stream
-on the same field. When the still morning dawned, their dead
lay cold and stark together-in the same deep pit their bodies
were deposited ;—the green corn of spring is now breaking from
their commingled dust—the dew falls from heaven upon their
union in the grave. Partakers in every peril—in the glory shall
we not be permitted to participate ? and shall we be told as a
requital, that we are estranged from the noble country for whose
salvation our life-blood was poured out ? ”-Shiel.

Were with his heart, and that was far away :
He recked not of the llfe he lost or prize,
But where his rude hut by the Danube lay;
There were his young barbarians all at play-
There was their Dacian mother !-he, their sire,
Butchered to make a Roman holiday !-
All this rushed with his blood. Shall he expire,
And unavenged ?-Arise, ye Goths, and glut your ire !”

The following are specimens of declamatory climax, leading

noblest English,
Whose blood is fetched from fathers of war-proof;
Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
Have, in these parts, from morn till even fought
And sheathed their swords for lack of argument !
I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
Straining upon the start. The game's afoot;
Follow your spirit; and upon this charge,
Cry, God for Harry, England, and St. George !"
Shakespeare.

“Princes, Potentates,
Warriors, the flower of heaven! once yours, now lost -
If such astonishment as this can seize
Eternal spirits; or have ye chosen this place,
After the toil of battle to repose
Your wearied virtue for the ease you fiņd
To slumber here, as in the vales of Heaven?
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn
To adore the Conqueror ? Who now beholds
Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood
With scattered arms and ensigns; till anon
His swift pursuers from Heaven's gates discern
The advantage, and, descending, tread us down
Thus drooping, or with linked thunderbolts
Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf.
Awake! arise ! or be for ever fallen!”—Milton.
The following rises into a climax of earnest and elevated
sentiment:-
“ Thou too, hoar mount ! with thy sky-pointing peaks,
Oft from whose feet the avalanche, unheard,
Shoots downward, glittering through the pure serene
Into the depth of clouds, that veil thy breast-
Thou too again, stupendous mountain ! thou
That as I raise my head, awhile bowed low
In adoration, upward from thy base
Slow travelling with dim eyes suffused with tears,
Solemnly seemest, like a vapoury cloud,
To rise before me-Rise, oh, ever rise,
Rise like a cloud of incense from the Earth !
Thou kingly Spirit throned among the hills,
Thou dread ambassador from Earth to Heaven,
Great hierarch! tell thou the silent sky,
And tell the stars, and tell yon rising sun,
Earth with her thousand voices, praises God.”
Another beautiful climax is as follows:-
Break not, O woman's heart, but still endure;
Break not, for thou art royal, but endure,

Remembering all the beauty of that star
Which shone so close beside thee that ye made
One light together, but has past and leaves
The crown a lonely splendour.
May all love,
His love, unseen but felt, o'ershadow thee,
The love of all thy sons encompass thee,
The love of all thy daughters cherish thee,
The love of all thy people comfort thee,
Till God's love set thee at his side again.
Tennyson.
a
A soliloquy is a series of reflections in natural order, leading
to a decision. The thoughts are not arranged rhetorically,
that is, for making an impression on an audience, but they
are spontaneous, and in their expression should be without
self-consciousness. The speaker abandons himself to a train
of thought, and voluntarily presents a picture of what is
passing in his mind. A natural soliloquy, showing the
speaker's mind, influencing to resolution and action, and
preserving a proper relation with the circumstances in which
he is represented to be, is the greatest triumph of the drama-
tist--and its true expression rises to the highest level of
oratory or of acting. The soliloquies of Hamlet (the tragedy
of thought) are perhaps the most perfect of their kind-those
of Macbeth (the tragedy of action) are terrible in their in-
tensity and expression of character, and are more directly
allied to circumstance and action. The following may be
read with advantage as requiring increasing force and
emphasis of expression, although it is too rhetorical (or self-
conscious) for a true soliloquy—the order of the thoughts
being too formal :-

CATO'S SOLILOQUY.
It must be so Plato, thou reason’st well-
Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,
This longing after immortality!
Or whence this secret dread, and inward horror,
Of falling into nought ? Why shrinks the soul
Back on herself, and startles at destruction ?
'Tis the Divinity that stirs within us ;
'Tis Heav'n itself that points out an hereafter,
And intimates eternity to man.
Eternity! thou pleasing, dreadful thought !
Through what variety of untried being,
Through what new scenes and changes must we pass !
The wide, the unbounded prospect lies before me;
But shadows, clouds, and darkness rest upon it.
Here will I hold. If there's a pow'r above
(And that there is, all Nature cries aloud
Through all her works), He must delight in virtue ;
And that which He delights in must be happy.
But when, or where? This world was made for Cæsar.
I'm weary of conjectures—this must end them.
Thus am I doubly arm’d-my death and life,
My bane and antidote, are both before me.
This in a moment brings me to an end ;
But this informs me I shall never die.
The soul, secured in her existence, smiles
At the drawn dagger, and defies its point ;
The stars shall fade away, the sun himself
Grow dim with age, and nature sink in years.
But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth,
Unhurt amidst the war of elements,
The wreck of matter, and the crush of worlds."
Addison.

HENRY IV.'s SOLILOQUY ON SLEEP.
How many thousands of my poorest subjects
Are at this hour asleep! O gentle sleep,
Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee
That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down,
And steep my senses in forgetfulness !
Why rather, Sleep, li'st thou in smoky cribs,
Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,
And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,
Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,
Under the canopies of costly state,
And lulld with sounds of sweetest melody?
O thou dull god, why li'st thou with the vile
In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch,
A watch-case to a common ’larum-bell ?
Wilt thou, upon the high and giddy mast,
Seal up the ship-boy's eyes and rock his brains
In cradle of the rude imperious surge ;
And in the visitation of the winds,
Who take the ruffian billows by the top,
Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them
With deafʼning clamours in the slipp’ry shrouds,
That, with the hurly, Death itself awakes ?
Canst thou, O partial Sleep! give thy repose
To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude ;
And, in the calmest and the stillest night,
With all appliances and means to boot,
Deny it to a king ? Then, happy lowly clown !
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.”—Shakespeare.
The following are further specimens of climax, to be read
with increased intensity and force. It must not, however, be
assumed that climax is always given with increasing loudness
of voice. The tones of the voice are often more suppressed
as intensity increases. Climax may be given as readily in a
whisper as in the loudest declamatory tones. In Pope's Ode
the voice may almost die away from the tone in which

the reading of it is begun, but the interest increases all the
same, and is indeed best conveyed by the diminished tone
and volume, accompanied by increase of intensity and
expression. The concluding lines should of course be
given with rapturous exaltation. In all oratory there must
be progression to a certain end. There is no such thing
as anti-climax in art.
“Vital spark of heavenly flame,
Quit, oh ! quit this mortal frame.
Trembling, hoping, lingering, flying ;
Oh! the pain, the bliss of dying !
Cease, fond nature, cease thy strife,
And let me'languish into life.

Hark! they whisper : angels say,
Sister spirit, come away.'
What is this absorbs me quite,
Steals my senses, shuts my sight,
Drowns my spirit, draws my breath ?
Tell me, my soul, can this be death ?
The world recedes : it disappears.
Heaven opens on my eyes : my ears
With sounds seraphic ring.
Lend, lend your wings ! I mount ! I fly!
O grave! where is thy victory ?
O death! where is thy sting ?”—Pope.
Say—would you seek instruction ? would
you
seek
What ye should do ? Ask ye yon conscious walls
Which saw his poisoned brother, saw foul crimes
Committed there, and they will cry, Revenge !
Ask yon deserted street, where Tullia drove
O'er her dead father's corse, 'twill cry, Revenge !
Ask yonder senate-house, whose stones are purple
With human blood, and it will cry, Revenge !
Go to the tomb where lie his murdered wife,

And the poor queen who loved him as her son-
Their unappeased ghosts will shriek, Revenge!
The temples of the gods, the all-viewing heaven-
The gods themselves-shall justify the cry,
And swell the general sound-Revenge! Revenge!-Payne.
The following is an exercise in decreased volume but
increased impressiveness and power.
“What must the king do now? Must he submit ?
The king shall do it: Must he be deposed ?
The king shall be contented : Must he lose
The name of king ?--Why, let it go.
I'll give my jewels, for a set of beads;
My gorgeous palace, for a hermitage ;
My gay apparel, for an almsman's gown;
My figured goblets, for a dish of wood;
My sceptre, for a palmer's walking staff;
My subjects, for a pair of carved saints;
And my large kingdom, for a little grave-
A little, little grave-an obscure grave!”? —Shakespeare.
“When we have practised good actions awhile, they become
easy, and when they are easy we begin to take pleasure in them;

The following might be read with increasing rapidity (with,
of course, perfect clearness of consonants) broadening in the
last eight lines to a slower, deeper, and most emphatic tone.
“Fast, fast with heels wild spurning,
The dark-grey charger fled ;

He sprang o'er heaps of dead.

His flanks all blood and foam,
He sought the southern mountains,
The mountains of his home.

The wolves they howled and whined;
But he ran like a whirlwind up the pass,
And he left the wolves behind.
Through many a startled hamlet
Thundered his flying feet;
He rushed through the gate of Tusculum,
He rushed up the long white street;
He rushed by tower and temple,
And paused not from his race
Till he stood before his master's door
In the stately market place,
And straightway round him gathered
A pale and trembling crowd,
And when they knew him, cries of rage
Brake forth, and wailing loud ;
And women rent their tresses
For their great prince's fall ;
And old men girt on their old swords
And went to man the wall.”—Macaulay.
The rising of a series of connected thoughts in a sonnet
into an emphatic and dominant reflection, sentiment, or
statement, should be marked by a corresponding increase
of emphasis by the voice.
" It is not to be thought of that the flood
Of British freedom, which, to the open sea
Of the world's praise, from dark antiquity
Hath flowed, 'with pomp of waters, unwithstood,'
Roused though it be full often to a mood
Which spurns the check of salutary bands,
That this most famous stream in bogs and sands
Should perish ! and to evil and to good
Be lost for ever. In our halls is hung
Armoury of the invincible knights of old ;
We must be free or die who speak the tongue
That Shakespeare spake; the faith and morals hold
Which Milton held.-In everything we are sprung
Of Earth's first blood, have titles manifold.-Wordsworth.

Earth has not anything to show more fair ;
Dull would he be of soul who could pass by
A sight so touching in its majesty :
This City now doth, like a garment, wear
The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,
Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie
Open unto the fields and to the sky,
All bright and glittering in the smokeless air.
Never did sun more beautifully steep
In his first splendour, valley, rock or hill ;
Ne'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!
The river glideth at his own sweet will :
Dear God! The very houses seem asleep,
And all that mighty heart is lying still !
Wordsworth.
The following extract from an after dinner speech, so full
of literary energy, may be read as an oratorical climax:-
And thus I am brought back to the point from which I started.
I have been requested to invite you to fill your glasses to the
Literature of Britain ; to that literature, the brightest, the purest,
the most durable of all the glories of our country; to that
literature so rich in precious truth and precious fiction; to that
literature which boasts of the prince of all poets and of the prince
of all philosophers; to that literature which has exercised an
influence wider than that of our commerce, and mightier than that
of our arms; to that literature which has taught France the
principles of liberty, and has furnished Germany with models of
art; to that literature which forms a tie closer than the tie of
consanguinity between us and the commonwealths of the valley of
the Mississippi ;' to that literature before the light of which impious
and cruel superstitions are fast taking flight on the banks of the
Ganges; to that literature which will, in future ages, instruct and
delight the unborn millions who will have turned the Australian and
Caffrarian deserts into cities and gardens. To the literature of
Britain, then! And, wherever British literature spreads, may it
be attended by British virtue and by British freedom !-Macaulay.

ACCENT.
Accent is the stress which is laid upon a syllable, or upon
syllables, in a word. The elements of this stress of accent
are the same as those of the stress of emphasis, viz.: pitch,
loudness, quality, duration. Formerly, accent was exten-
sively connected with the pitch, the higher tones being called
the acute, and the lower the grave accent. At present, in
English pronunciation it refers mainly to stress. Accent is a
very important part of the system of orthoepy, which deals
with euphony and pronunciation. The accented syllable, or
syllables, give the word its character, and should be spoken
with greater force, as the most important sound in the word-
the principal sound, indeed, by which the word is recognised.
The English language is composed of such a variety of
materials, and is drawn from such numerous sources, that it
is impossible to lay down any arbitrary rules founded upon
analogy and etymology so long as pronunciation is determined
to a great extent by popular custom. Public convenience
scorns theoretical perfection. We are not guided by any
abstract considerations of the source from whence a word may
be derived, but rather by the ease and convenience with which
it may be spoken, and by the peculiarities of our habits of
speech, which
may
arise from climate or other causes. Gram-
marians speak of accent as primary or tonic, and as secondary
or euphonic; thus, the accent on the word sandpit is tonic,
that on the fourth syllable of the word delineation is tonic, and
that on its second syllable is euphonic. The euphonic is
always a secondary or inferior accent, in the same word as the
tonic accent, and subservient to it.
But the above system
of accents is practically nonsense, and even the accepted
dictionaries are not good guides.

95
Accents may be divided into two classes, primary and
secondary: that is, there is always one syllable in a word,
however long the word may be, on which the voice falls with
the greatest force and fulness, and in a word of many syllables
there must be a secondary emphasis. While convenience of
speech, or, to put it more ponderously, the adaptability of
English vocal organs to a particular succession of sounds or
rhythm, is the great arbiter of pronunciation, there is a
tendency to accentuate the radical, as distinguished from the
accidental part of a word, to bring into prominence the root
instead of prefix or suffix. But if this tendency may be formu-
lated into a rule, there are many important exceptions to it.
While English pronunciation depends upon custom and
authority, and its knowledge can only be acquired by practice,
various rules have from time to time been laid down. Ben
Jonson remarked that all dissyllabic nouns, if they be simple,
are accented on the first. Hence “edict” and “outrage"
would generally be accented on the first, but when two
syllabled nouns were regarded as derived from verbs they
would be accented on the second. This, of course, is only
partly correct.
It
may be laid down as a general rule that in accordance
with the genius of the language, nouns and adjectives of two
or three syllables should be accented on the first, and that if
any doubt as to the proper accentuation of a word arises, it
would be the safer plan to give the stress as early as possible
in the word, this being the favourite accent of the language.
With regard to the mode in which the accentuation of words
is rendered by the voice. In speaking the accented syllables
with proper force, care must be taken to avoid the prevalent
mistake of omitting to sound the unaccented syllables at all,

or slurring them. It is true that the accent falls in many cases
upon the most characteristic part of the word, but it cannot
be too strongly insisted upon that the complete articulation of
every sound and syllable of a word is essential to its being
recognised and its meaning understood by those to whom it
is addressed.

While the general tendency of the English language is to
throw the weight of the voice upon the earlier syllables of a
word, that of the French is to bring out in many words more
than is done in English the latter syllables. Marsh says :-
"The vocabulary of the French is derived, to a great extent,
from Latin words deprived of their terminal inflections. The
French adjectives 'mortal' and 'fatal’ are formed from the
Latin "mortalis' and 'fatalis' by dropping the inflected
syllable; the French nouns nation' and 'condition' from
*natione' and conditione' by rejecting the 'e' final.” For a
long time after French began to be incorporated into English,
French words retained their own system of accentuation. But
in the end they came to be pronounced in the English style.
In Chaucer's time this change was going on. But perhaps
the majority of the French words he uses are to be pronounced
with the accent on the latter syllables, as attention to the
italics in the following lines will show :-
“Whan that Aprille with its schowres swoote
The drought of Marche hath perced to the roote,
And bathud every veyne in swich licour,
Of which virtue engendered is the flour ;
So priketh hem nature in here corages;
Than longen folk to gon on pilgrimages.
Me thinketh it accordant to resoun
To telle you alle the condicioun
Of eche of them.

Professor Whitney says :-“It is the prevailing English
“
custom to accent a noun of two syllables on its first syllable ;
many nouns of French origin have had their native accent
altered, in order to conform them to this practice. Such
changes have been going on at every period in the history of
our tongue : in Pope, in Milton, in Shakespeare, in Chaucer,
you will find examples of their action, in ever-increasing
numbers as you go backward from the present time.”
Dr. Morris gives a list of words as examples of retention of
French accentuation : nouns in 'ade,” as in
“ cascade ” ;
“ier," as in “cavalier," "chandelier"; "ee," as in “legatee,"
"payee." He also gives “cadet,” cravat,” “ brunette,”
“gazette.” Some adjectives; as "august,” “ benign,"
lesque.” And some verbs; as “baptise," "cajole," "caress.”
Dr. Abbot refers to the continual strife over every noun
derived from the Latin, "the English language claiming the
“
new-comer as her naturalized subject, bound by English laws;
the Latin, on the other hand, asserting a partial jurisdiction
over her emigrants." Hence the different styles of accenting-
access, precept, instinct, relapse, commerce, obdurate, sepul-
chre, contrary, persever (persevere), confessor. Some scientific
words retain their Latin accentuation, the stress in the following
words being upon the second, whereas according to the
English custom they would take it on the first, or first and
third in the case of more than three syllables: aurora, corona,
colossus, idea, hypothesis, cæsura, diæresis, diploma.
Words of two or three syllables are accented then, as a rule,
on the first, words of four syllables on the first and third.
Smart says, words of four syllables, with the following ter-
minations, are accented on the antepenultimate, that is, the

third from the end : strophe-catastrophe ; logy-apology;
graphy-geography; meter-barometer; vorous-carnivorous;
gonal-diagonal; fluent-mellifluent; cracy-aristocracy ;
gony—cosmogony; machy—logomachy; pathy-antipathy;
—
—;
phony-symphony ; tomy—anatomy; rious-notorious.
Different accents often distinguish between the same word
being used as substantive or verb. The following are some of
the words, for instance, that when used as substantives or
adjectives are accented on the first, and as verbs on the
second syllable :-present, absent, accent, attribute, concert,
consort, contest, converse, essay, object, produce, rebel. In
the same way August the month is distinguished from the
adjective “august ;” and “conjure,” to practice magic, from
“conjure,” to entreat.
In those compound words where the prefix expressly dis-
tinguishes the meaning of the word from its opposite, the
prefix must be strongly accented. “Neither justice nor in-
justice (the prefix in accented) has anything to do with the
present question.” His riches must increase or decrease.”
The following words will be useful for practice :-hurt,
unhurt; mortal, immortal (as in the following verse); rule,
misrule; noble, ignoble ; pious, impious. In some words,
as “implacable,” the prefix is not so strongly accented. (See
also chapter on Metre).
“All worldly shapes shall melt in gloom,
The sun himself must die,
Before this mortal shall assume
Its immortality."
The following three extracts are examples of the use of
English words in the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries respec-
tively. It will be seen that the majority of words of two or

three syllables are accented on the first, and of four syllables
on the first and third. The exceptions, however, to this rule
will not fail to be noticed. The varied accentuation of words
of five syllables will also be observed. The greatest care will
be taken to give the accented syllables due prominence, and
also to give the unaccented clearly.
RHETORIC AND LOGIC.
Notwithstanding, to stir the earth a little about the roots of
this science, as we have done of the rest; the duty and office of
rhetoric is to apply reason to imagination for the better moving of
the will. For we see reason is disturbed in the administration
thereof by three means : by illaqueation or sophism, which per-
tains to logic; by imagination or impression, which pertains to
rhetoric; and by passion or affection, which pertains to morality.
And as in negotiation with others, men are wrought by cunning,
by importunity, and by vehemency; so in this negotiation within
· ourselves, men are undermined by inconsequences, solicited and
importuned by impressions or observations, and transported by
passions. Neither is the nature of man so unfortunately built, as
that those powers and arts should have force to disturb reason,
and not to establish and advance it. For the end of logic is to
teach a form of argument to secure reason, and not to entrap it.
The end of morality is to procure the affections to obey reason,
and not to invade it. The end of rhetoric is to fill the imagina-
tion to second reason, and not to oppress it.
" And therefore it was great injustice in Plato, though springing
out of a just hatred to the rhetoricians of his time, to esteem of
rhetoric but as a voluptuary art, resembling it to cookery, that did
mar wholesome meats, and help unwholesome by a variety of
sauces to the pleasure of the taste. For we see that speech is
much more conversant in adorning that which is good, than in
colouring that which is evil : for there is no man but speaketh
more honestly than he can do or think.
16 We conclude therefore that rhetoric can be no more charged
with the colouring of the worse part, than logic with sophistry, or
morality with vice. For we know the doctrines of contraries are

the same though the use be opposite. It appeareth also that
logic differeth from rhetoric, not only as the fist from the palm,
the one close, the other at large; but much more in this, that
lógic handleth reason exact and in truth, and rhetoric handleth it
as it is planted in popular opinions and manners.”— Bacon.
MAN'S POSITION AND QUALITIES.
Presumptuous Man! the reason wouldst thou find
Why formed so weak, so little, and so blind ?
First, if thou canst, the harder reason guess,
Why formed no weaker, blinder, and no less ?
Ask of thy mother Earth, why oaks are made
Taller and stronger than the weeds they shade ;
Or ask of yonder argent fields above
Why Jove's satellitès are less than Jove ?
Of systems possible, if 'tis confessed
That Wisdom infinite must form the best ;
Where all must fall or not coherent be,
And all that rises, rise in due degree ;
Then, in the scale of reasoning life, 'tis plain
There must be, somewhere, such a rank as Man:
And all the question (wrangle e'er so long)
Is only this—if God has placed him wrong?
Respecting Man, whatever wrong we call,
May, must be right, as relative to all.
In human works, though laboured on with pain,
A thousand movements scarce one purpose gain ;
In God's, one single can its end produce;
Yet serves to second too some other use.
So Man, who here seems principal alone,
Perhaps acts second to some sphere unknown,
Touches some wheel, or verges to some goal:
'Tis but a part we see, and not the whole.
When the proud steed shall know why Man restrains
His fiery course, or drives him o'er the plains ;
When the dull ox, why now he breaks the clod,
Is now a victim, and now Egypt's god;
Then shall Man's pride and dulness comprehend
His actions', passions', being's use and end;

Why doing, suffering; checked, impelled; and why
This hour a slave, the next a deity.

A TROPICAL SCENE.
"For what a nest it was which they had found! The air was
heavy with the scent of flowers, and quivering with the murmur of
the stream, the humming of the colibris and insects, the cheerful
song of birds, the gentle cooing of a hundred doves; while now and
then, from far away, the musical wail of the sloth, or the deep toll
of the bell-bird, came softly to the ear. What was there not which
eye or ear could need ? And what which palate could need either?
For on the rock above, some strange tree, leaning forward, dropped
every now and then a luscious apple upon the grass below, and
huge wild plaintains bent beneath their load of fruit. There, on
the stream bank, lay the two renegades from civilized life. They
had cast away their clothes, and painted themselves, like the
Indians, with arnotta and indigo. One lay lazily picking up the
fruit which fell close to his side; the other sat, his back against

“To make the past present, to bring the distant near, to place
us in the society of a great man or on the eminence which over-
looks the field of a mighty battle, to invest with the reality of
human flesh and blood beings whom we are too much inclined to
consider as personified qualities in an allegory, to call up our
ancestors before us with all their peculiarities of language, manners,
and garb, to show us over their houses, to seat us at their tables,
to rummage their old-fashioned wardrobes, to explain the uses of
their ponderous furniture, these parts of the duty which properly
belongs to the historian have been appropriated by the historical
novelist. On the other hand, to extract the philosophy of history,

to direct our judgment of events and men, to trace the connection
of causes and effects, and to draw from the occurrences of former
times general lessons of moral and political wisdoin, has become
the business of a distinct class of writers.”—Macaulay.
“ As the world goes on you must expect this tendency to increase.
You must expect mechanical force to become more varied, and
more powerful and more cheap, and the competition with human
arms and limbs to become more hopeless. But there is one region
where the machine can never follow the human being, and that is
in the exercise of thought. In skill, in cultivated mind, in the
power to adapt the processes of thought to the laws of nature, in
all that we call'skilled labour' of the highest kind, in that man
must always have a monopoly, and need fear no encroachment
from the competition of the steam engine. It is to the develop-
ment of his powers in that respect that the increase in the means
of subsistence and the opening of new paths of self-support must
be found. On all of us, in whatever position we are, is pressing
as one of the most anxious subjects of public care, the discovery
of methods by which the teeming millions of this country shall be
able to maintain themselves in a prosperous, decent, and comfort-
able condition. We cannot find in their unskilled labour a satis-
faction of that want. The difficulties are enhanced by the fact
that our neighbours in other countries have been sensible of the
superiority which skilled education can confer, and have not been
slow to take advantage of it. If we will not be left behind in the
race, if we desire to find any satisfactory solution for the deepest
and the most inscrutable problem of our time, if we wish our com-
plex community and high civilization to be maintained secure from
all the dangers which the presence of unfed, unprosperous, untaught
millions must bring upon them, we must do our utmost to give a
healthy and a rapid development to the secondary education of
the working classes.”—Lord Salisbury.
EMPHASIS.
While accent is the stress laid upon a syllable in a word,
and is governed by a fixed or mechanical law of pronunciation,
emphasis is the stress laid upon a word in a sentence, or a
clause in a series of clauses, or a sentence in a series of sen-

103
tences. Emphasis is governed by purely rhetorical considera-
tions—that is, the general sense of the sentence itself. Of
course the emphasis is most strongly heard upon the accented
syllable of the word, but, in proportion, all the syllables of
the word are forcibly spoken. The object of emphasis is to
bring into prominence and draw particular attention to the
most important words in a sentence, or the most important
sentence in a series of sentences. Words are made emphatic
by a change in the tone of the voice—by being spoken with
greater deliberation, or with greater effort, and by a slight
pause before and sometimes after. Leading terms should
always be emphasized. For instance-a sentence is divided
into two parts, (1) its subject, and (2) that which is said about
its subject
Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability.”
The word “studies” expresses the subject of the foregoing
sentence—it is the basis on which it is founded ; it
may
there-
fore be considered the leading term, and strongly emphasized.
The qualifying words which follow should also be brought
into prominence. In some sentences the qualifying words
(adjectives and adverbs) are most important, and should be
emphasized accordingly, as the judgment of the reader may
direct. For instance-in praising a woman for her singing,
we say emphatically what she does, but most emphatically
how she does it; we lay the greater stress upon the adverb,
and say she sings SWEETLY.
The proper placing of emphasis is essential to good and
intelligent reading. The object of reading is to bring out
clearly the sense of the author, and by the manner of reading
to express or imply a command and due appreciation of that

meaning. Improper emphasis not only obscures, but very
often completely distorts the meaning of a sentence. An
idea of the importance of emphasis in determining the exact
meaning of a sentence may be obtained by speaking the words
my book is torn" with an alteration of emphasis each time.
If my is made emphatic, you mean that it is your book, and
not the book of anybody else. A stress on book will single
out that particular article as being damaged. If anybody
disputes the fact, you reiterate with emphasis, my book is torn.
And if you wish to bring out clearly what particular damage
is done, you emphasize torn—that is, the book has not been
burnt, or destroyed in any other way, but it has been TORN.
And by thus altering the emphasis, four distinct and important
modifications of the meaning are effected.
Besides the above rule as to subjects and objects of sen-
tences, it may be laid down as a general rule, all words
expressive of comparison or antithesis—all words implying or
expressing a distinction between different things or qualities,
should be made emphatic. Also words that give a technical
character to
a sentence, such as words (“why,” “is,"
' what,” &c.) that make it interrogatory—or (“ if," "should,”
“So,”
suppose,” such," &c.) that make it conditional.
Also exclamations or ejaculations. When a phrase is repeated
for rhetorical effect, the emphasis should be altered, with, of
course, due regard to rhythm.

The full significance of the following sentences from
Bacon's “Essay of Study" can only be rendered by a careful
attention to the above rules. The distinction, for instance,
between “ expert” and “learned," "crafty," "simple," and
“wise,” must be brought out clearly by the voice. The
illustrative phrases, the words introducing new ideas, or
opening a new subject, must also be spoken emphatically, so
as to direct the attention of the audience to that part of the
sentence which bears the weight of the meaning.
“Studies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their
chief use for delight, is in privateness and retiring ; for ornament,
is in discourse; and for ability, is in the judgment and disposition
of business. For expert men can execute, and perhaps judge of
particulars, one by one; but the general councils, and the plots,
and marshalling of affairs, come best from those that are learned.
To spend too much time in studies is sloth; to use them too
much for ornament is affectation; to make judgment wholly by
their rules is the humour of a scholar. They perfect nature, and
are perfected by experience; for natural abilities are like natural
plants, that need pruning by study: and studies themselves do
give forth directions too much at large, except they be bounded in
by experience. Crafty men contemn studies, simple men admire
them, and wise men use them; for they teach not their own use,
--but that is a wisdom without them, and above them, won by
observation. Read, -not to contradict and confute, not to believe
and take for granted, nor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh
and consider. Some books are to be tasted, others to be
swallowed, and some few to be chewed and digested : that is,
some books are to be read only in parts; others to be read-but
not curiously; and some few, to be read wholly, and with
diligence and attention. Some books also may be read by
deputy, and extracts of them made by others; but that should be
only in the less important arguments, and the meaner sort of
books; else distilled books are like common distilled waters,-
flashy things. Reading maketh a full man; conference, a ready
man; and writing, an exact man. And therefore, if a man write

little, he had need have a great memory; if he confer little, he
had need have a present wit; and if he read little, he had need
have much cunning to seem to know that he doth not.”—Bacon.
In the following extract, strong emphasis must be placed
upon the word ("suppose") which determines the suppositive
or conditional character of the sentences, so as to maintain
the thread of the argument unbroken. It may be left to the
reader to distinguish the most important words on which the
argument depends. In the closing sentences the importance
of "is it improbable," and the two similar constructions, is
manifest.
Suppose, then, the world we live in to have had a Creator;
suppose it to appear from the predominant aim and tendency of
the provisions and contrivances observable in the universe, that
the Deity, when he formed it, consulted for the happiness of His
sensitive creation ; suppose the disposition which dictated this
counsel to continue; suppose a part of the creation to have received
faculties from their Maker, by which they are capable of rendering
a moral obedience to His will, and of voluntarily pursuing any end
for which He has designed them ; suppose the Creator to intend
for these, His rational and accountable agents, a second state of
existence, in which their situation will be regulated by their
behaviour in the first state, by which supposition (and by no
other) the objection to the Divine government in not putting a
difference between the good and the bad, and the inconsistency
of this confusion with the care and benevolence discoverable in
the works of the Deity, are done away. Suppose it to be of the
utmost importance to the subjects of this dispensation to know
what is intended for them; that is, suppose the knowledge of it
to be highly conducive to the happiness of the species—a purpose
which so many provisions of nature are calculated to promote.
Suppose, nevertheless, almost the whole race, either by the imper-
fection of their faculties, the misfortune of their situation, or by
the loss of some prior revelation, to want this knowledge, and not
to be likely, without the aid of a new revelation, to attain it: under
these circumstances, is it improbable that a revelation should be

it unlikely that He should acquaint them with it?"---Paley.
The following lines may be read for their general weight of
emphasis :-
SATAN'S SOLILOQUY.
“Me miserable! Which way shall I fly
Infinite wrath and infinite despair?
Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell
And in the lowest deep a lower deep
Still threatening to devour me, opens wide,
To which the Hell I suffer, seems a Heaven.
Oh, then, at last relent; is there no place
Left for repentance, none for pardon left ?
None left but by submission, and that word
Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame
Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduced
With other promises and other vaunts
Than to submit, boasting I could subdue
Th’ Omnipotent. Ah me! they little know
How dearly I abide that boast so vain,
Under what torments inwardly I groan,
While they adore me on the throne of Hell.
With diadem and sceptre high advanced
The lower still I fall, only supreme
In misery; such joy ambition finds.
But say I could repent and could obtain
By act of grace my former state ; how soon
Would height recall high thoughts, how soon unsay
What feigned submission swore! Ease would recant
Vows made in pain as violent and void.
For never can true reconcilement grow
Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep;
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse
And heavier fall. So should I purchase dear
Short intermission bought with double smart.
This knows my Punisher; therefore as far

All hope excluded thus, behold instead
Of us, outcast, exiled, His new delight,
Mankind created, and for him this world.
So farewell hope, and with hope farewell fear.
Farewell remorse : all good to me is lost ;
Evil be thou my good; by thee at least
Divided empire with Heaven's King I hold,
By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign ;
As man ere long and this new world shall know.”—Milton.
In the following lines, "why,” making sentence interroga-
tive, as well as pointing the raillery, should be emphasized.
The "why” questions inflected downward, and those begin-
ning "will" upward :-
Why so pale and wan, fond lover ?
Prithee, why so pale ?
Will, when looking well can't move her,
Looking ill prevail ?
Prithee, why so pale ;
Why so dull and mute, young sinner?
Prithee, why so mute ?
Will, when speaking well can't win her
Saying nothing do't ?

will be easily recognized in the following selection.
Lady Macbeth-Nought's had, all's spent,
Where our desire is got without content :
'Tis safer to be that which we destroy,
Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
How now, my lord ! why do you keep alone,
Of sorriest fancies your companions making ;
Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
With them they think on? Things without all remedy
Should be without regard : what's done is done.

Macbeth-We have scotched the snake, not killed it :
She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
Remains in danger of her former tooth.
But let the frame of things disjoint, both the worlds
suffer,
Ere we will eat our meals in fear, and sleep
In the affliction of these terrible dreams
That shake us nightly ; better be with the dead,
Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
Than on the torture of the mind to lie
In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
After life's fitful fever he sleeps well ;
Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing
Can touch him further.
Lady Macbeth-Come on;
Gently my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks ;
Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.

For the following extract are required a deep voice, slow
utterance, general significance of look and speech, special
weight of voice upon the words near the end implying and

emphasis on the repeated “Hubert," the awful stress given
to the meaning by the pauses, will also be noticed.

And with advantage means to pay thy love :

To say what good respect I have of thee.

K. John.-Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet ;
But thou shalt have : and creep time ne'er so slow
Yet it shall come for me to do thee good.
I had a thing to say,-but let it go:
The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,
Attended with the pleasures of the world,
Is all too wanton and too full of gawds,
To give me audience :—If the midnight bell
Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
Sound on into the drowsy race of night;
If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs;
Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
Had bak'd thy blood, and made it heavy, thick,
(Which, else, runs tickling up and down the veins,
Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes,
And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
A passion hateful to my purpose ;)
Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
Without eyes, ears, and harmful sound of words;
Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts :
But ah, I will not :-Yet I love thee well,
And, by my troth, I think thou lov'st me well.

Though that my death were adjunct to my act,
By heaven, I would do it.

Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,
He is a very serpent in my way,
And wheresoe'er this foot of mine doth tread,
He lies before me: Dost thou understand me?
Thou art his keeper.

That he shall not offend your majesty.

Remember..
PAUSE, OR RHETORICAL PUNCTUATION.
It is very important to keep the lungs well filled. Pauses
must be made at frequent intervals, and breath taken easily
and quietly, partly through the nostrils. Nasal breathing
warms and filters the air received. The mouth is engaged in
articulation and the formation of consonants. The speaker
wants a more regular and fuller supply of breath than in
ordinary respiration. The voice may be strengthened by
respiratory exercises, or as they have been called, lung gym-
nastics. Frequent reciting (but not long enough to cause
weariness) is recommended, with careful and frequent breath-
taking. The lungs should be inflated at their basis, and the
breathing should be felt in the lower ribs. Experts say that
the test of correct breathing is the inflation of the abdomen,
and that there should not be simply what is called throat
breathing. No belts shonld be used round the waist, and the
manner of standing should be such as to facilitate a good
supply of air, head up, no stooping, and shoulders back.
Inspiration should be easy, full and frequent, and in rhetorical
speaking the whole of the breath issuing from the mouth
should be utilized in the formation of words. Expiration
should be slower than inspiration. Clerical sore throat arises
from strongly exerting the voice without frequent pausing for

breath. This inconvenience is especially felt by clergymen
who read so much in one tone of voice. Nothing is more
exhausting to a speaker, more painful to an audience, and
more detrimental to effective oratory, than speaking until all
the breath is gone, and then stopping to gasp for more.
Pauses must be made more frequently than even the gram-
matical punctuation would allow. The distance between two
commas is often too great for the voice to travel over without
stopping, and it is therefore necessary to adopt some plan of
pausing without obscuring the sense. Besides pausing at
commas, &c., a system of rhetorical punctuation should be
applied. A sentence may be divided into several clusters of
words, the distinction between which may be marked by a
pause, thus allowing an opportunity of taking breath. The
sentence below illustrates this. It will be observed that each
cluster is composed of the substantive and of the verb that
governs or the adjective that qualifies it, together with the
auxiliary words necessary for grammatical completeness. In a
series of adjectives a pause may be made after each, except
the one that immediately precedes the substantive. The rule
that words are often made emphatic by a pause after them
may
also be borne in mind.
“ Reason-guides a
an entire conviction-of the
historical proofs-of the Christian religion.”
It will be evident that if pauses are made differently from
those marked in the foregoing sentence, the sense will be
broken up. This system of pause does not interfere with the
coherence, or break the continuous “run” of the sentence,
but conduces to the clear expression of the meaning, and
adds very much to the ease and pleasure of both speaker and
audience.

The following sentences could only be clearly and effectively
read with frequent pauses. An idea of the way in which they
should be read will be obtained by pausing and taking breath
after the following words in the first persons, sensible,
effect, poetry, feelings, know, refer, causes, thing, clearly, pro-
ceeded, trace, stream, hearts, fountains, gathered, &c. These
pauses are quite consistent with perfect continuity of expres-
sion; while they induce a deliberation which is essential to
effective speaking.
- Many persons are very sensible of the effect of fine poetry upon
their feelings, who do not well know how to refer these feelings to
their causes; and it is always a delightful thing to be made to see
clearly the sources from which our delight has proceeded, and to
trace the mingled stream that has flowed upon our hearts to the
remoter fountains from which it has been gathered; and when
this is done with warmth as well as precision, and embodied in
an eloquent description of the beauty which is explained, it forms
one of the most attractive, and not the least instructive, of literary
exercises. In all works of merit, however, and especially in all
works of original genius, there are a thousand retiring and less
obtrusive graces, which escape hasty and superficial observers,
and only give out their beauties to fond and patient contemplation;
a thousand slight and harmonizing touches, the merit and the
effect of which are equally imperceptible to vulgar eyes; and a
thousand indications of the continual presence of that poetical
spirit which can only be recognized by those who are, in some
measure, under its influence, and have prepared themselves to
receive it by worshipping meekly at the shrine which it inhabits.
"In the exposition of these there is room enough for originality,
and more room than Mr. Hazlitt has yet filled. In many points,
however, he has acquitted himself excellently; particularly in the
development of the principal characters with which Shakespeare
has peopled the fancies of all English readers; but, principally
we think, in the delicate sensibility with which he has traced,
and the natural eloquence with which he has pointed out, that
familiarity with beautiful forms and images—that eternal recur-

rence to what is sweet or majestic, in the simple aspect of nature-
that indestructible love of flowers and odours, and dews and clear
waters, and soft airs and sounds, and bright skies, and woodland
solitudes, and moonlight bowers, which are the material elements of
poetry; and that fine sense of their indefinable relation to mental
emotion, which is its essence and vivifying soul, and which, in
the midst of Shakespeare's most busy and atrocious scenes, falls
like gleams of sunshine on rocks and ruins; contrasting with all
that is rugged and repulsive, and reminding us of the existence
of purer and brighter elements, which he alone has poured out
from the richness of his own mind, without effort or restraint; and
contrived to intermingle with the play of all the passions, and the
vulgar course of this world's affairs, without deserting for an
instant the proper business of the scene, or appearing to pause or
digress from love of ornament or need of repose ;-he alone who,
when the subject requires it, is always keen, and worldly, and
practical; and who yet, without changing his hand or stopping
his course, scatters around him as he goes, all sounds and shapes
of sweetness, and conjures up landscapes of immortal fragrance
and freshness, and peoples them with spirits of glorious aspect
and attractive grace, and is a thousand times more full of imagery
and splendour than those who, for the sake of such qualities, have
shrunk back from the delineation of character or passion, and
declined the discussion of human duties and cares.”—Jeffrey.
Pause, in the following verses, may be made at middle and
end of the first and each alternate line, and generally, but not
always, after the third syllable in the intervening lines, and
at the end of those lines. Thus :showers, flowers, seas,

When rocked to rest on their mother's breast,
As she dances about the sun.
I wield the flail of lashing hail,
And whiten the green plains under;
And then again I dissolve it in rain,
And laugh as I pass in thunder.
I sift the snow on the mountains below,
And their great pines groan aghast;
And all the night 'tis my pillow white,
While I sleep in the arms of the blast.
Sublime on the towers of my skiey bowers,
Lightning my pilot sits;
In a cavern under is fettered the thunder,
It struggles and howls by fits;
Over earth and ocean, with gentle motion,
This pilot is guiding me,
Lured by the love of the genii that move
In the depths of the purple sea :
Over the rills, and the crags, and the hills,
Over the lakes, and the plains,
Wherever he dream, under mountain or stream,
The spirit he loves remains ;-
And I all the while bask in heaven's blue smile,
Whilst he is dissolving in rains.
The sanguine sunrise, with his meteor-eyes,
And his burning plumes outspread,
Leaps on the back of my sailing rack,
When the morning star shines dead.
As on the jag of a mountain-crag,
Which an earthquake rocks and swings,
An eagle alit, one moment may sit
In the light of its golden wings.
And when sunset may breathe, from the lit sea beneath,
Its ardours of rest and of love,
And the crimson pall of eve may fall
From the depth of heaven above ;
With wings folded I rest, on mine airy nest,
As still as a brooding dove."
Shelley.

Pause and breath taken at commas and end of lines :
“Behold her, single in the field,
Yon solitary Highland lass !
Reaping and singing by herself;
Stop here, or gently pass!
Alone she cuts and binds the grain,
And sings a melancholy strain ;
O listen, for the vale profound
Is overflowing with the sound.
Will no one tell me what she sings?
Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow
For old, unhappy, far-off things,
And battles long ago ;
Or is it some more humble lay,
Familiar matter of to-day?
Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,
That has been, and may be again?”
Wordsworth.
METRE.
Metre is the characteristic of poetry as distinguished from
prose. An attention, therefore, to musical cadence is essential
to the proper reading of poetry. Each line is composed of a
certain number of syllables; these are again distributed into
feet, or arranged in such a way as to produce an alternation of
light and heavy sounds. In a well-constructed line the
rhythmical and grammatical accents should agree, that is,
should both occur upon the same syllable. Take the line, “No
useless coffin enclosed his breast”: substitute for enclosed a word,
such as covered, with the accent upon the first syllable, and it
will be seen that the regularity of the line, which is its
distinguishing poetical beauty, is destroyed. A trochaic foot
begins with a heavy and is followed by a light sound, as in
pleasure. The word never is a trochee. The line in "King
Lear” in which this word is repeated five times, is one

technically of five trochaic feet. An iambic foot begins with
.
a light and is followed by a heavy sound, as in content. A
dactylic foot is one of three syllables, the first heavy (or long),
and the two following light (or short), as in general. The
Bridge of Sighs” is in this metre, ONE more unfortunate"
being two dactylic feet. The same may be said of “Cannon
to right of them.” An anapæstic foot is also one of three
syllables, the first two light, and the third heavy, as in intervene.
An illustration of this will be found in Cowper's poem
beginning, “I am monarch of ALL I survey”-a line containing
three anapæstic feet. Amphibrach is the name of a foot of
three syllables, with the accent on the second, as receiving.
But this title is rarely used, as three syllables with an accent in
the middle can be otherwise classified. Another accented
syllable such as now, after receiving, wonld make two iambic
feet. The most popular line, perhaps, in English poetry is
that which is commonly called the heroic, containing five feet
or ten syllables. This is the line in which the greatest body o
English poetry has been written; Cowper, Pope, Dryden,
Milton, and it is used by Shakespeare in his plays. “As they
pass by pluck Casca by the sleeve" is a specimen of the heroic
line of five iambic feet, the stress of the voice being strongly
laid upon the tenth syllable. Sometimes an additional syllable
is to be found, but being unaccented, it does not alter the
character of the line, as “ The games are done, and Cæsar is
returning.” Scott's octo-syllabic verse is also very popular,
as
“ The chief in silence strode before,
And reached that torrent's sounding shore.”

each other. These, however, cannot be spoken without a
pause between them which corresponds to the time that would
be occupied by a light sound in another kind of foot, “ When
Ajax strives some rock's VAST WEIGHT to throw.” There must
always be an unaccented syllable next to the accented, or else
a pause that would occupy the time of such unaccented
syllable.
The first object in reading poetry, as in prose, is, of course,
to make the sense clear by rhetorical emphasis, and this
emphasis must coincide as far as possible with the metrical
arrangement, so that the sense may not only be apparent,
but the manner in which it is expressed musically effective.
There must be three kinds of stress in a line of poetry, all
working harmoniously, viz. : grammatical accent, rhythmical
accent, and rhetorical emphasis. Exclusive attention to
rhythm produces sing-song, and brings into too great promi-
nence small unemphatic words; but correct pronunciation,
rhythmical cadence, and intelligent emphasis combined are
necessary to the effective and beautiful rendering of poetry.
There are thus three kinds of stress or weight of voice that
have to be observed in reading poetry. 1. Grammatical
accent or correct pronunciation, by which words are recog-
nized. 2. Rhythmical accent, giving the pleasure arising
from cadence and harmony. 3. Rhetorical emphasis, by
which the relation of words to each other is shown, and the
meaning effectively rendered. The skill of the reader must
be exercised in cases where the grammatical and poetical
accents disagree. He must pronounce the word in such a
way as to make it recognizable, but he must not break the
rhythm of the line. “Then up and spake an old sailor” is

bald prose
if the second syllable of “sailor” is not accented.
So is “Alike the Armada's pride and. spoils of Trafalgar”
unless the last syllable in the line is accented. Shakespeare
compels the accent on the second syllable of persevere in the
line, “Aye, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks.” In other
Shakespearian words, the accent is placed later, as compared
with present pronunciation of them. In Pope's time the
influence of the French accent was greater than it is now.
Thus the second of music is accented—“Music the fiercest
grief can charm ;” also the second of barrier.
Some technical terms may be explained. Scansion is the
investigation of the measures, accents, or syllables of a line.
The syllables should be counted, the accents marked, the
character of the foot, whether dissyllabic or trisyllabic,
whether iambic, trochaic, &c., should be determined. Prosody
is the science which treats of quantity (that is, whether a
vowel sound is long or short, according to the time taken to
pronounce it), accent, and the laws of harmony both in
metrical and prose composition. Strictly speaking, the term
“foot” is connected with quantity, and “ measure
with
accent. But the long or full vowel occurs in the majority of
cases in the accented syllable, although accent and not
quantity is the foundation of English rhythm. The term
“ foot,” however, is generally used in the same sense as
measure.” Those parts which receive the stress of the
voice are termed arsis (elevation), the remainder form the
thesis (depression). Arsis and thesis therefore constitute a
foot or measure. Dr. Abbott says, “Rhythm is the principle
of proportion introduced into language.” He had in mind
the words, “How sour sweet music is when time is broke and
no proportion kept.”

Of course any poem may be taken for practice in metrical
cadence. The following lines may be useful in educating the
voice to the regularity of accents in reading poetry :-
“ By the streans that ever flow,
By the fragrant winds that blow
O'er the Elysian flowers ;
By those happy souls who dwell
In yellow meads of asphodel,
Or amaranthine bowers ;
By the heroes' armed shades,
Glittering through the gloomy glades;
By the youths that died for love,
Wandering in the myrtle grove;
Restore, restore, Eurydice to life.
Oh! take the husband, or return the wife.''
“ Music the fiercest grief can charm,
And Fate's severest rage disarm.
Music can soften pain to ease,
And make despair and madness please.
Our joys below it can improve,
And antedate the bliss above.
This the divine Cecilia found,
And to her Maker's praise confined the sound.
When the full organ joins the tuneful quire,
The immortal powers incline their ear.
Borne on the swelling notes, our souls aspire,
While solemn airs improve the sacred fire ;
And angels lean from heaven to hear.
Of Orpheus now no more let poets tell.
To bright Cecilia greater power is given.
His numbers rais'd a shade from Hell,
Hers lift the soul to Heaven.”—Pope.

“I priz'd every hour that went by,
Beyond all that had pleas'd me before ;
But now they are passed and I sigh
And I grieve that I priz’d them no more.

From world to luminous world, as far
As the universe spreads its flaming wall :
Take all the pleasures of all the spheres,
And multiply each through endless years, –
One minute of Heaven is worth them all!'”—Moore.
Coleridge had a theory that metrical completeness did not
require any particular number of syllables, but that whatever
the number of syllables, so long as the accents were equal,
the line was complete : for instance, the four syllables in the
third line, as follows, were equal, when accented with the
pause after each, to the numerous syllables of the first and
second lines—each line containing four feet :-
“'Tis the middle of the night by the castle clock,
And the owls have awaken'd the crowing cock;
Tu-whit! Tu-whoo !
And hark again! the crowing cock,
How drowsily it crew."--Coleridge.
Measure, then, is essential to poetry. Not so rhyme and
alliteration, though often adding to its beauty and effect.
When Marlowe first popularised the swing and freedom of
blank verse, he professed to scorn the “jigging veins of
rhyming mother wits.” The rhymed English drama, in imita-
tion of the French, is cramped and artificial compared with
the Shakespearian nobility, strength, and freedom. Bearing
in mind the beautiful effect of rhyme in “L’Allegro” and
“Il Penseroso," Marvel's lines on “Paradise Lost” may be
quoted :-
Thy verse, created like thy theme sublime,
In number, weight, and measure, needs not rhyme.”
Rhyme is the agreement in sound at the end of lines; that
is, the same vowel sound, but different consonants, in the
last accented syllables of lines. The following is a rhyming
couplet from Pope :-

“Look round our world ; behold the chain of love
Combining all below and all above."
Triplets are rarely used, though some good specimens may
be seen in Dryden. Pope, in an imperfect triplet, thus speaks
of Dryden :
“Waller was smooth ; but Dryden taught to join
The varying verse, the full resounding line,
The long majestic march and energy divine.”
Dr. Johnson condemns triplets as unskilful, but the
following from Dryden is energetic in expression and con-
tinuous in sense :
“I am as free as nature first made man,
Ere the base laws of servitude began,
When wild in woods the noble savage ran.”
Verse with alternate rhymes is a very favourite kind.
Stanzas are of different lengths, from Tennyson's four lines in
“In Memoriam,” to Spenser's nine lines in the “Faerie
Queene." The following are specimens of the Spenserian
stanza. It consists of eight lines of five accents and one
of six, the long rolling music of which will be observed,
although Pope thus satirizes, as well as illustrates, the
Alexandrine line ::
“A needless Alexandrine ends the song,
Which like a wound- ed snake | dragsits slowlength | along."

“One day, nigh weary of the irksome way,
From her unhasty beast she did alight;
And on the grass her dainty limbs did lay
In secret shadow, far from all men's sight;
From her fair head her fillet she undight
And laid her stole aside. Her angel's face
As the great eye of heaven, shined bright,
And made a sunshine in a shady place;
Did never mortal eye behold such heavenly grace.

It fortuned, out of the thickest wood
A ramping lion rushed suddenly,
Hunting full greedy after salvage blood.
Soon as the royal virgin he did spy,
With gaping mouth at her ran greedily,
To have at once devoured her tender corse ;
But to the prey when as he drew more nigh
His bloody rage assuaged with remorse,
And with the sight amazed, forgat his furious force.
Instead thereof he kissed her weary feet,
And licked her lily hands with fawning tongue,
As he her wronged innocence did weet.
Oh! how can beauty master the most strong,
And simple truth subdue avenging wrong!
Whose yielded pride and proud submission,
Still dreading death, when she had marked long,
Her heart 'gan melt in great compassion;
And drizzling tears did shed for pure affection.
Redounding tears did choke th' end of her plaint
Which softly echoed from the neighbour wood;
And sad to see her sorrowful constraint,
The kingly beast upon her gazing stood ;
With pity calmed down .fell his angry mood.
At last, in close heart shutting up her pain,
Arose the virgin born of heavenly brood,
And to her snowy palfrey got again
To seek her strayed champion, if she might attain."
Spenser (spelling modernized).
Byron used the same stanza, but less melodiously :-
Stop !--for thy tread is on an Empire's dust!
An Earthquake's spoil is sepulchred below !-
Is the spot marked with no colossal bust,
Or column trophied, for triumphal show?
None; but the moral's truth tells simpler so.
As the ground was before, thus let it be.
How that red rain hath made the harvest grow!
And is this all the world has gained by thee,
Thou first and last of fields ! King-making Victory?

very beautiful.
Last noon beheld them full of lusty life;
Last eve, in Beauty's circle proudly gay ;
The midnight brought the signal sound of strife-
The morn, the marshalling in arms,—the day,
Battle's magnificently stern array !
The thunder-clouds close o'er it: which when rent,
The earth is covered thick with other clay
Which her own clay shall cover-heaped and pent;
Rider and horse,-friend, foe,-in one red burial blent !"
The rhymes of a sonnet make that kind of verse very
difficult to construct; but, when skilfully rhymed, a sonnet is
The following is an example, though its
rhymes are not always perfect in sound :
“ Scorn not the sonnet; critic, you have frowned,
Mindless of its just honours; with this key
Shakespeare unlocked his heart; the melody
Of this small lute gave ease to Petrarch's wound;
A thousand times this pipe did Tasso sound;
With it Camoens soothed an exile's grief;
The sonnet glittered a gay myrtle leaf
Amid the cypress with which Dante crowned
His visionary brow; a glow worm lamp
It cheered mild Spenser, called from faery land
To struggle through dark ways; and when a damp
Fell round the path of Milton, in his hand
The thing became a trumpet, whence he blew
Soul-animating strains-alas ! too few."— Wordsworth.
Milton's sonnet on his blindness is a more exact example
of the technical form, in rhyming, of this class of poem. As
some of the rhymes are distant from each other, they require
a special stress of voice on the rhyming syllable to preserve
the connection, or the ear might lose the effect intended by
the recurrence of a particular sound :-
6. When I consider how my light is spent,
Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,

And that one talent, which is death to hide,
Lodg’d with me useless, though my soul more bent
To serve therewith my Maker, and present
My true account, lest He, returning, chide ;
Doth God exact day-labour, light denied ?
I fondly asked: but Patience, to prevent
That murmur, soon replies, ‘God doth not need
Either man's work, or His own gifts; who best
Bear his mild yoke, they serve Him best: His state
Is kingly; thousands at His bidding speed,
And post o’er land and ocean without rest;
They also serve who only stand and wait.”--Milton.
The elocutionary rule is to lay the stress of voice on the
accented syllables that make the rhyme. There is a difference
of consonants in the accented syllable, which in some of the
following lines is the third from the end. The two unaccented
syllables which close a line are exactly the same as in the
corresponding line, thus :-
" Clattering,
Scattering."
The following lines, with their effective clash of rhyme
(and, indeed, the whole of the poem), may be practised with
advantage. The lines are from the “Pied Piper of Hamelin:-
“There was a rustling, that seemed like a bustling,
Of merry crowds justling at pitching and hustling;
Small feet were pattering, wooden shoes clattering,
Little hands clapping, and little tongues chattering;
And like fowls in a farm-yard when barley is scattering,
Out came the children running !
All the little boys and girls,
With rosy cheeks and flaxen curls,
And sparkling eyes and teeth like pearls,
Tripping and skipping ran merrily after
The wonderful music, with shouting and laughter.”
Browning

The Ingoldsby Legends afford good practice for singling
out particular syllables by the voice to preserve the rhyme.
In Hudibras, too, there are many lines that are so loosely
constructed as to approach doggerel, but the following are
pointed and effective, and the bright rhymes contribute much
to the spirit and effect of the composition :-
“He was in logic a great critic,
Profoundly skill'd in analytic ;
He could distinguish and divide
A hair 'twixt south and south-west side,
On either which, he would dispute,
Confute, change hands, and still confute ;
He'd run in debt by disputation,
And pay with ratiocination :
All this by syllogism, true
In mood and figure, he would do.
For rhetoric he could not ope
His mouth, but out there flew a trope ;
And, when he happen'd to break off
In the middle of his speech, or cough,
He had hard words ready to show why,
And tell what rules he did it by ;
Else, when with greatest art he spoke,
You'd think he talk'd like other folk;
For all a rhetorician's rules
Teach nothing but to name his tools.
But when he pleased to show it, his speech
In loftiness of sound was rich;
A Babylonish dialect
Which learned pedants much affect ;
In mathematics he was greater
Than Tycho Brahe or Erra Pater;
For he, by geometric scale,
Could take the size of pots of ale ;
Resolve by lines and tangents, straight
If bread and butter wanted weight;
And wisely tell what hour of day

The clock doth strike by algebra.
Beside, he was a shrewd philosopher,
And had read every text and gloss over ;
Whate'er the crabbed'st author hath,
He understood by implicit faith ;
Whatever sceptic could inquire for,
For every why, he had a wherefore ;
Knew more than forty of them do,
As far as words and terms could go ;
All which he understood by rote ;
And as occasion serv'd would quote ;
No matter whether right or wrong,
They might be either said or sung ;
His notions fitted things so well,
That which was which he could not tell.”-Butler.
Appended are some more curiosities of rhyming :-
“Here thou, Great Anna, whom three realms obey,
Dost sometimes counsel take, and sometimes tea.”—Pope.
• Dim as the borrowed beams of moon and stars,
To lonely, weary, wandering travellers,
Is reason to the soul.”—Dryden,
“You ask'd me where the rubies grew;
And nothing I did say,
But with my finger pointed to
The lips of Julia."-Herrick.
“Who has not learn’d, fresh sturgeon and ham-pie
Are no rewards for want and infamy?”—Pope.
Alliteration, the repetition of the same consonant, without
being essential to poetry, is a great aid to its effect, and
should not be lost by the voice in reading. It is in itself a
kind of rhythm. Alliteration is as old as English poetry
itself, and at one time was its distinguishing characteristic,
before even rhythm or rhyme was applied to the language.
Specimens might be taken from almost every English poet.
But see the effect of the repeated s in the first line, and of n
in the second :-

“Sun of my soul, Thou Saviour dear,
It is not night if Thou be near.”
The following are further specimens :-
“And the silken, sad, uncertain
Rustling of each purple curtain."
“Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.”
“Roll on! thou deep and dark blue ocean, roll!”
“The lustre of the long convolvuluses.”
To apply pause (cæsura) in poetry without interfering with
the rhythm or the continuous expression of the sense, but to
assist the rhythm and the sense, requires great care.
A verse
of six accents may be equally div but the usual verse of
five accents offers greater variety. The pause must not be
given at the same place in each line, or monotony will be
produced. One of the greatest tests of good reading is the
manner in which pause is varied. Pause in poetry must
depend, like rhetorical punctuation in prose, upon the oppor-
tunities offered by the author's words to group them. In
Pope's line of five accents a pause comes very frequently after
the second foot or fourth syllable, and often in the very
middle of the line. In the following extract a pause after
"scornful” exactly divides the line (although the reader would
be quite justified in pausing after" him” and “hate” as well);
after “wound” and “fault” the pause comes at the close of
the second foot:-
“ View him with scornful yet with jealous eyes,
And hate for arts that caused himself to rise :
Willing to wound and yet afraid to strike,
Just hint a fault, and hesitate dislike.”
To the elocutionist a pauseless line of five accents is incon-
sistent with a proper emphatic rendering. In Dryden the

opportunities for varying the pause are greater than in Pope,
and a successful rendering of the rhythm of Milton's blank
verse is almost entirely dependent upon the manner in which
the pause is varied. The freedom afforded by blank verse
for a long continuous expression of meaning will be noticed.
The voice will be sustained therefore at the end of the lines,
when sense is incomplete, and a pause generally made. In
reading blank verse the accents must be strongly marked, or
it becomes prose, and the pause must be varied to avoid
monotony.
“Of man's first disobedience, and the fruit
Of that forbidden tree, whose mortal taste
Brought death into the world and all our woe,
With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,
Sing, heavenly Muse!”
“ With these that never fade, the spirits elect
Bind their resplendent locks inwreath'd with beams:
Now, in loose garlands thick thrown off, the bright
Pavement, that like a sea of jasper shone,
Impurpled with celestial roses, smil'd.
Then crown'd again, their golden harps they took,
Harps ever tun'd, that glittering by their side
Like quivers hung, and, with preamble sweet
Of charming symphony, they introduce
Their sacred song, and waken raptures high:
No voice exempt; no voice but well could join
Melodious part; such concord is in Heaven."--Milton.
Although Shelley's “Skylark” is printed on a previous page
in long even lines, the following is the true form of the verse :

That from Heaven, or near it,

In profuse strains of unpremeditated art."

The following is a specimen of Tennyson's rhymes. The
stress of voice required to bring out the rhymes of the first
and fourth lines will be noticed.
** Thy voice is on the rolling air;
I hear thee where the waters run ;
Thou standest in the rising sun,
And in the setting thou art fair.
What art thou then? I cannot guess;
But though I seem in star and flower
To feel thee some diffusive power,
I do not therefore love thee less.
My love involves the love before ;
My love is vaster passion now;
Tho' mixed with God and Nature thou,
I seem to love thee more and more.
Far off thou art, but ever nigh;
I have thee still, and I rejoice;
I prosper, circled with thy voice ;
I shall not lose thee tho' I die.”—Tennyson.
SYMPATHETIC ELOCUTION AND GESTURE.
It is desirable to increase the force of the words we speak
by a proper use of gesture, and a sympathetic expression
of face. The whole body, not merely the voice, must
speak. It should be remembered that gesture is strictly
subordinate, and should not be made too prominent. An
audience must go away impressed with the beauty and the
force of the thoughts expressed, not with the idea that the
speaker was a good attitudinizer. The true orator should
convince the reason and touch the heart; and one great
source of his power lies in the earnestness, which, although
not perhaps expressed in words, is more than implied in his
delivery. If we see that a man is apparently in earnest, that

133
he fully understands his subject, and appreciates himself the
force of what he is saying, we naturally attach greater
importance to his speech than if his manner were cold and
mechanical. For oratory to be thoroughly effective, an
electric current of sympathy must vibrate between speaker
and hearers. Without this, the exertion of the speaker is
painful and thankless—with this, the argument gathers
strength and volume as it proceeds, until the climax is
reached and the object of the speaker gained.
The most convenient mode of standing is to keep the left
foot well forward and allow the weight of the body to rest
upon it; the right foot in the rear; the heel very lightly, if at
all, touching the ground. The simple emphatic gesture is
the downward movement of the right arm, or both arms, from
the shoulder, the elbow being slightly bent. The pliability of
the wrist conduces very much to graceful gesture. Too much
action, especially of a purely imitative character in describing
scenes and actions in a recitation, is to be deprecated. It
should be mainly used to emphasize the most important parts
of the speech-the conclusion of the argument. If the
speaker wishes to emphasize a certain word, he should
gradually raise his arm before that word is reached, so as to
be able to give the gesture rapidly and spontaneously. When
the arms are not required, they should be allowed to drop
without any exertion. If the pupil has once mastered the
simple emphatic gesture, the other kinds of gesture-refe-
rential, argumentative, descriptive, and passionate--will be
comparatively easy of acquirement.
Referential gesture may be given with the open hand, but
an object may be particularised with the index finger; the

palm of the hand being downwards, the pointing finger fairly
straight, the others bent slightly downward. In all kinds of
gesture the fingers should be kept close to each other, and
held in a way consistent with the hollow of the hand being
shown. The main lines of gesture may be practised in con-
nection with the following verse. During the first line the
right hand can be gradually raised, so as to be level with the
shoulder; during the second an upward sweep will be made
to indicate “stars” and “sun.” The hand being thus raised,
it is ready for the downward emphatic movement on “spoke.”
The left hand can then join in the gesture, and both hands
being raised high at "woke," the double downward sweep
can be given on "done," the hands not brought down flat,
but cutting the air sideways, and arrested in such a way as to
produce a slight rebound :
" When the Lord created the earth and sea,
The stars and the glorious sun,
The Godhead spoke, and the universe woke,
And the mighty work was done."
Referential gesture, leading to emphatic :-
“ From the tapestry that adorns these walls, the immortal
ancestor of the noble lord frowns with indignation at the disgrace
of his country.”
In the words prior to“walls,” the right hand can be gradually
raised, and, having finished the reference, raised high and
brought down quickly on "frowns," or "indignation," or
disgrace," whichever word the speaker decides is the most
important.
Ascriptive gesture, followed by emphatic :-
“Now glory to the Lord of Hosts, from whom all glories are ;
And glory to our sovereign liege, King Henry of Navarre !
Now, let there be the merry sound of music and of dance

And thou, Rochelle, our own Rochelle, proud city of the waters,
Again let rapture light the eyes of all thy mourning daughters.
As thou wert constant in our ills, be joyous in our joy,
For cold, and stiff, and still, are they who wrought thy walls annoy.
Hurrah! hurrah! a single field hath turned the chance of war,
Hurrah! hurrah! for Ivry and King Henry of Navarre !”
>
The two hands raised high above the head by the curved
or serpentine movement for the first line, and then slightly
moved in preparation for the quick downward movement on
Henry.” For the first “hurrah” the right hand can be
swung out, then raised high for the second ; then brought
down, not too quickly or strongly, on “turned,” and dropped.
For the third and fourth "hurrah” both hands swung out
sideways, then, with a bend of the wrist, upwards, and both
down emphatically on “Navarre.”
In descriptive gesture the dignity and consistency of the
speaker should not be sacrificed by a too close imitation of
descriptive incidents in the course of his speech. Mimicry is
a great power, but most effective when controlled.
Cassius' speech, when describing Cæsar's fever, he does not
put aside his passion and break the thread of his argument by
a close imitation or mimicry of a sick girl's voice in “Give
me some drink, Titinius." It is quite enough, in general
oratory, to indicate without imitating. The essentially
dramatic character of all speech need not therefore be lost.
In the following lines the speaker cannot imitate the horse,
but only indicate within the limit of his own human resources
the action of the animal as metaphorically applied to the
river. The hands can be slowly raised as the first line is
spoken until "fell," when they should sweep downward, in

or
accordance with the rule that gestures should be generally
(not always, of course,) given upon the doing word ; that is,
the word that involves or specially expresses the action, which
in this case is “fell,” not “ crash' “thunder.” In the
emphasis of voice, of course, the manner in which a thing is
done is of equal importance with the thing itself; but in the
emphasis of gesture, it is often best to reserve the movement
for the action itself, as it is impossible to keep moving the
arms at each qualifying word which the speaker may think
important. Many exceptions to this rule might of course be
mentioned. Gesture depends greatly on the judgment of a
speaker. He should not be extravagant, especially if his
audience are not prepared for extreme gestures. Extravagance
is a sign of weakness. Moderation, that is, keeping well
within resources, and producing an impression that all the
powers of speaking are well under command, is strength.
Reverting to the gesture for the lines, the two hands can be
slowly raised, with apparent difficulty and restraint, at

and brought down not too strongly on “down,” opened out

“But with a crash like thunder fell every loosened beam ;
And like a dam the mighty wreck lay right athwart the stream,
And a long shout of triumph rose from the walls of Rome,
As to the highest turret tops was splashed the yellow foam.
And, like a horse unbroken when first he feels the rein,
The furious river struggled hard, and tossed his tawny mane,
And burst the curb and bounded, rejoicing to be free,
And whirling down in fierce career, battlementand plankand pier,
Rushed headlong to the sea."--Macaulay.

While, as above stated, in general oratory or declamation,
gesture should be indicative rather than directly imitative, the
special representation of particular passions requires actual
embodiment. In dramatic representation, the actor must not
only show in outline the man, but for the time being he must
sink his own individuality as much as possible and be the man,
suffering or rejoicing, as the case may be. And yet he must
not altogether lose his own identity, for in himself, in his own
mental and emotional power, lies the force by which he
illuminates and gives life and point to the character he plays.
The actor must be real and not simply expository. He must
rise above mere declamation to the actual realization of
character and passion.
Humour has two main divisions, serious and comic :
because tears and laughter both spring from a common centre
of emotion, if such a term may be used. In both divisions
of humour there is enormous range of feeling available for
expression, from the passionate grief of Lady Constance to
the quiet melancholy of Ophelia, from the dry wisdom of
Touchstone to the rollicking joviality of Falstaff.
For gaiety and solemnity of manner take the two following
exercises :-
L'ALLEGRO.
“But come, thou goddess, fair and free,
In Heaven yclept Euphrosyne;
And by men heart-easing Mirth,
Whom lovely Venus at a birth
With two sister Graces more
To ivy-crowned Bacchus bore;
Haste thee, Nymph, and bring with thee
Jest and youthful jollity,

Quips, and cranks and wanton wiles,
Nods, and becks, and wreathed smiles,
Such as hang on Hebe's cheek,
And love to live in dimple sleek;
Sport that wrinkled Care derides,
And laughter holding both his sides;
Come, and trip it as you go
On the light fantastic toe,
And, in thy right hand, lead with thee
The mountain nymph, sweet liberty ;
And if I give thee honour due,
Mirth, admit me of thy crew,
To live with her and live with thee,
In unreproved pleasures free.”—Milton.
IL PENSEROSO.
“But hail, thou goddess, sage and holy,
Hail, divinest Melancholy !
Whose saintly visage is too bright
To hit the sense of mortal sight,
And therefore to our weaker view
O'erlaid with black, staid Wisdom's hue;
Come, pensive Nun, devout and pure,
Sober, steadfast and demure,
All in a robe of darkest grain
Flowing with majestic train,
And sable stole of cypress lawn,
Over thy decent shoulders drawn :
Come, but keep thy wonted state,
With even step and musing gait,
And looks commercing with the skies,
Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes;
There held in holy passion still,
Forget thyself to marble, till
With a sad, leaden, downward cast,
Thou fix them on the earth as fast."
Milton.

For finish of speaking, musical cadence, tender sentiment
growing into intense pathos, take the following :
THE SOLDIER'S DREAM.
“Our bugles sang truce—for the night-cloud had lowered,
And the sentinel stars set their watch in the sky;
And thousands had sunk on the ground, overpowered-
The weary to sleep, and the wounded—to die !
When reposing that night on my pallet of straw,
By the wolf-scaring fagot that guarded the slain,
At the dead of the night a sweet vision I saw,
And thrice, ere the morning, I dreamt it again.
Methought, from the battle-field's dreadful array,
Far, far I had roamed on a desolate track ;
'Twas autumn-and sunshine arose on the way
To the home of my fathers, that welcomed me back !
I flew to the pleasant fields, traversed so oft
In life's morning march, when my bosom was young;
I heard my own mountain-goats bleating aloft,
And knew the sweet strain that the corn-reapers sung ;
Then pledged we the wine-cup; and fondly I swore
From my home and my weeping friends never to part;
My little ones kissed me a thousand times o’er,
And my wife sobbed aloud in her fulness of heart :-
Stay! stay with us !-- rest! thou art weary and worn!'
And fain was their war-broken soldier to stay-
But sorrow returned with the dawning of morn,
And the voice in my dreaming ear melted away.”
Campbell.
Many passages of great pathetic power (rising in “Lear” to
the highest tragedy) might be 'selected for practice from
Shakespeare. For pathos and grief, quiet rather than
passionate, see Tennyson's “In Memoriam,” and the beautiful
ballad of the “ Lord of Burleigh,” also Longfellow's “Resig-

nation"; and for pathos requiring a more pronounced and
'
intense and passionate expression, occasionally deepening into
despair, Hood's “Bridge of Sighs” and “Song of the Shirt”;
and Mrs. Browning's “Cry of the Children.” For exquisite
consistency of musical verse, picture and sentiment, Gray's
Elegy may be taken. The union also of tender regretful
feeling with an appropriate picture will be observed in the
following lines :-
THE FIRE OF DRIFT-WOOD.
We sat within the farm-house old
Whose windows, looking o'er the bay,
Gave to the sea-breeze, damp and cold,
An easy entrance, night and day.
Not far away we saw the port, —
The strange, old-fashioned, silent town,-
The lighthouse,—the dismantled fort,-
The wooden houses, quaint and brown.
We sat and talked until the night,
Descending filled the little room ;
Our faces faded from the sight,
Our voices only broke the gloom.
We spake of many a vanished scene,
Of what we once had thought and said,
Of what had been, and might have been,
And who was changed, and who was dead.
And all that fills the hearts of friends,
When first they feel, with secret pain,
Their lives henceforth have separate ends,
And never can be one again.
The first slight swerving of the heart,
That words are powerless to express,
And leave it still unsaid in part,
Or say it in too great excess.

The very tones in which we spake
Had something strange, I could but mark;
The leaves of memory seemed to make
A mournful rustling in the dark.
Oft died the words upon our lips,
As suddenly from out the fire,
Built of the wreck of stranded ships,
The flames would leap and then expire.
And as their splendour flashed and failed,
We thought of wrecks upon the main,-
Of ships dismasted,—that were hailed,
And sent no answer back again.
The windows rattling in their frames, -
The ocean roaring up the beach,
The gusty blast,--the bickering flames,-
All mingled vaguely in our speech;
Until they made themselves a part
Of fancies floating through the brain,-
The long-lost ventures of the heart,
That send no answer back again.
O flames that glowed! O hearts that yearned !
They were indeed too much akin,
The drift-wood fire without that burned,
The thoughts that burned and glowed within.
Longfellow.
The following is a Shakespearian contrast, the brave picture
of Bolingbroke with its pendant in the pathetic aspect of
Richard :
York- Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,
Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed,
Which his aspiring rider seemed to know,-
With slow but stately pace kept on his course,
While all tongues cried—“God save thee, Bolingbroke !"
You would have thought the very windows spake,
So many greedy looks of young and old
Through casements darted their desiring eyes

Upon his visage ; and that all the walls
With painted imagery had said at once,
“Jesu preserve thee ! welcome, Bolingbroke !”
Whilst he, from one side to the other turning,
Bare-headed lower than his proud steed's neck,
Bespake them thus,-"I thank you countrymen !”
And thus still doing, thus he passed along.
Duch.--Alas, poor Richard ! Where rode he the while ?
York- As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
After a well-ġrac'd actor leaves the stage,
Are idly bent on him that enters next,
Thinking his prattle to be tedious,
Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
Did scowl on Richard; no man cried, God save him;
No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home;
But dust was thrown upon his sacred head;
Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,-
His face still combating with tears and smiles,
The badges of his grief and patience,-
That had not God, for some strong purpose, steeld
The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted,
And barbarism itself have pitied him.
But Heaven hath a hand in these events,
To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
Shakespeare.
Mrs. Browning's poem on "A Child's Grave at Florence,"
“
may be read for its exquisite blending of sorrow and joy.
For practice in pathetic expression take the following :

THE THREE FISHERS.
Three fishers went sailing out into the West,
Away to the West as the sun went down ;
Each thought on the woman who loved him the best,
And the children stood watching them out of the town;
For men must work, and women must weep,
And there's little to earn, and many to keep,
Though the harbour bar be moaning.

Three wives sat up in the lighthouse tower,
And they trimmed the lamps as the sun went down ;
They looked at the squall, and they looked at the shower,
And the night-rack came rolling up ragged and brown.
But men must work, and women must weep,
Though storms be sudden, and waters deep,
And the harbour bar be moaning:
Three corpses lay out on the shining sands
In the morning gleam as the tide went down,
And the women are weeping and wringing their hands
For those who will never come home to the town ;
For men must work, and women must weep,
And the sooner 'tis over, the sooner to sleep,
And good-bye to the bar and its moaning.-Kingsley.
Pathetic description with appropriate change of voice for
different speakers :-
WOLSEY'S DEATH.
Katherine. Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,
That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey,
Was dead ?
Griffith. Yes, madam; but I think your grace,
Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to 't.
Kath. Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died :
If well, he stepp'd before me, happily
For my example.
Grif. Well, the voice goes, madam :
For after the stout Earl Northumberland
Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,
As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,
He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill
He could not sit his mule.
Kath.
Alas, poor man !
Grif. At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester;
Lodged in the abbey ; where the reverend abbot,

With all his convent, honourably received him ;
To whom he gave these words, O, father abbot,
An old man, broken with the storms of state,
Is come to lay his weary bones among ye ;
Give him a little earth for charity!'
So went to bed ; where eagerly his sickness
Pursued him still : and, three nights after this,
About the hour of eight, which he himself
Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,
Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,
He gave his honours to the world again,
His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.-Shakespeare.
The following selected lines should be read with a quick
movement of voice, but with a very clear rendering of con-
sonants, broadening into a somewhat slower and more
emphatic movement in the concluding lines of each verse :-
THE BROOK.
I come from haunts of coot and hern,
I make a sudden sally,
And sparkle out among the fern,
To bicker down a valley.
By thirty hills I hurry down,
Or slip between the ridges ;
By twenty thorps, a little town,
And half a hundred bridges.
Till last by Philip's farm I flow
To join the brimming river,
For men may come, and men may go,
But I go on for ever..

I chatter over stony ways,
In little sharps and trebles,
I bubble into eddying bays,
I babble on the pebbles.
With many a curve my bank I fret
By many a field and fallow,

And many a fairy foreland set
With willow-weed and mallow.
I chatter, chatter, as I flow
To join the brimming river,
For men may come, and men may go,
But I go on for ever.
I wind about, and in and out,
With here a blossom sailing,
And here and there a lusty trout,
And here and there a grayling,
And here and there a foamy flake
Upon me as I travel,
With many a silvery waterbreak
Above the golden gravel,
And draw them all along, and flow
To join the brimming river,
For men may come, and men may go,
But I go on for ever.
Tennyson.
Of the verbal pleasantries of Hood an example is appended.
He moves laughter, not only by the extravagance of caricature,
but by the sudden transitions and incongruities of thought, or.
puns, which his pieces contain. The words that involve the
double incongruous and yet connected meanings must be
rendered with much point by the voice.
FAITHLESS NELLY GRAY.
“ Ben Battle was a soldier bold, and used to war's alarms; but
a cannon-ball shot off his legs, so he laid down his arms! Now,
as they bore him off the field, said he, 'Let others shoot, for here
I leave my second leg, and the Forty-second foot !'-
surgeons made him limbs : said he, ‘They're only pegs: but
there's as wooden members quite, as represent my legs !'
Now, Ben long loved a pretty maid, whose name was Nelly
Gray: and he went to pay her his devours, when he'd devoured
his pay. But when he called on Nelly Gray, she made him quite
a scoff : and when she saw his wooden legs, began to take them

off! Oh, Nelly Gray! oh, Nelly Gray! is this your love so
warm ? the love that loves a scarlet coat should be more
uniform !' Said she, “I loved a soldier once, for he was blythe
and brave : but I will never have a man with both legs in the
grave. Before you had those timber toes, your love I did allow:
but then, you know, you stand upon another footing now!!
Oh, Nelly Gray! oh, Nelly Gray! for all your jeering speeches,
at duty's call I left my legs in Badajos's breaches !'Why,
then,' said she, 'you've lost the feat of legs in war's alarms: and
now you cannot wear your shoes, upon your feats of arms.' 'Oh,
false and fickle Nelly Gray, I know why you refuse : though I've
no feet, some other man is standing in my shoes! I wish I ne’er
had seen your face, but now, a long farewell! for you will be my
death :-alas! you will not be my Nell.'
“Now, when he went from Nelly Gray his heart so heavy got,
and life was such a burden grown, it made him take a knot. So
round his melancholy neck a rope he did entwine; and, for the
second time in life, enlisted in the Line! One end he tied around
a beam, and then removed his pegs; and, as his legs were off, of
course he soon was off his legs. And there he hung till he was
dead as any nail in town : for though distress had cut him up it
could not cut him down. A dozen men sat on his corpse to find
out why he died ; and they buried Ben in four cross-roads, with a
stake in his inside!”-Hood.
The following selection may be read as an exercise in
sympathetic elocution,-each passion to be not merely
described, but embodied, and accompanied by appropriate
gesture. For instance, anger must be expressed in loud and
passionate tones, and with very forcible gesture—fear in a
subdued and trembling voice, and so on in accordance with
the subject of each impersonation. The piece is printed in
the prosaic form, so that the rhythm may be practised without
the help afforded by measured poetical lines :-
When Music (heavenly maid) was young, ere yet in earliest
Greece she sung, the Passions, oft, to hear her shell, thronged
around her magic cell, exulting-trembling-raging--fainting-

possessed, beyond the muses' painting. By turns they felt the
glowing mind disturbed-delighted, raised, refined'; till once, 'tis
said, when all were fired, filled with fury, rapt, inspired, from the
supporting myrtles round they snatched her instruments of sound;
and, as they oft had heard, apart, sweet lessons of her forceful
art, each—for madness ruled the hour-would prove his own
expressive power.
First, Fear-his hand its skill to try, amid the chords
bewildered laid-and back recoiled-he knew not why: even at
the sound himself had made !
“Next Anger rushed, his eyes on fire; in lightnings owned his
secret stings; with one rude clash he struck the lyre, and swept,
with hurried hands, the strings.
“With woeful measures, wan Despair :-low, sullen sounds his
grief beguiled; a solemn, strange, and mingled air ; 'twas sad,
by fits—by starts, 'twas wild. But thou, O Hope; with eyes so
fair, what was thy delighted measure! still it whispered promised
pleasure, and bade the lovely scenes at distance ‘Hail!! Still
would her touch the strain prolong; and from the rocks, the
woods, the vale, she called on Echo, still, through all her song ;
and, where her sweetest theme she chose, a soft, responsive voice
was heard at every close !--and Hope, enchanted, smiled, and
waved her golden hair!
“ And longer had she sung—but, with a frown, Revenge
impatient rose; he threw his blood-stained sword in thunder
down; and, with a withering look, the war-denouncing trumpet
took, and blew a blast-so loud and dread, were ne'er prophetic
sounds so full of woe; and ever and anon he beat the doubling
drum, with furious heat. And though, sometimes, each dreary
pause between, dejected Pity, at his side, her soul-subduing voice
applied, yet still he kept his wild unaltered mien; while each
- strained ball of sight seemed bursting from his head.
“Thy numbers, Jealousy, to nought were fixed; sad proof of
thy distressful state of differing themes the veering song was
mixed : and now it courted Love—now raving, called on Hate.
“With eyes upraised, as one inspired, pale Melancholy sat
retired; and from her wild, sequestered seat, in notes by distance

made more sweet, poured, through the mellow horn, her pensive
soul : and, dashing soft, from rocks around, bubbling runnels
joined the sound. Through glades and glooms the mingled
measure stole; or, o'er some haunted stream, with fond delay-
round a holy calm diffusing, love of peace and lonely musing—in
hollow murmurs died away.
“But oh ! how altered was its sprightlier tone, when Cheerful-
ness, the nymph of Gealthiest hue, her bow across her shoulder
flung, her buskins gemmed with morning dew,-blew an inspiring
air, that dale and thicket rung; the hunter's call, to Faun and
Dryad known. The oak-crowned Sisters, and their chaste-eyed
Queen, Satyrs, and Sylvan Boys, were seen peeping from forth
their alleys green-brown Exercise rejoiced to hear; and Sport
leaped up, and seized his beechen spear.
“Last came Joy's ecstatic trial : he, with viney crown
advancing, first to the lively pipe his hand addressed ; but soon
he saw the brisk awakening viol, whose sweet entrancing voice
he loved the best. They would have thought, who heard the
strain, they saw, in Tempe's vale, her native maids, amid the
festal-sounding shades to some unwearied minstrel dancing ;
while, as his flying fingers kissed the strings, Love framed, with
Mirth, a gay, fantastic round ;-loose were her tresses seen, her
zone unbound ;-and he, amidst his frolic play, as if he would
the charming air repay, shook thousand odours from his dewy
wings."'--Collins.
THE SEVEN AGES.
« All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players :
They have their exits and their entrances,
And one man in his time plays many parts
His acts being seven ages. First the infant,
Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms;
And then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,

Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard,
Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
Seeking the bubble reputation
Ev’n in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
In fair round belly, with good capon lined,
With eyes severe, and beard of formal cut,
Full of wise saws, and modern instances;
And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side;
His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
That ends this strange, eventful history,
Is second childishness, and mere oblivion,
Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.”
Shakespeare.
The following selections are added for general practice :
DUKE AND LORD.
Duke. Now, my co-mates, and brothers in exile,
Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
More free from peril than the envious court ?
Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
The season's difference; as the icy fang,
And churlish chiding of the winter's wind;
Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
Ev’n till I shrink with cold, I smile, and say,
This is no flattery; these are counsellors,
That feelingly persuade me what I am.
Sweet are the uses of adversity,
Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
And this our life, exempt from public haunt,
Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
Sermons in stones, and good in everything.

Come, shall we go, and kill us venison ?
And yet it irks me, the poor dappled fools,
Being native burghers of this desert city,
Should, in their own confines, with forked heads,
Have their round haunches gored.
Lord.
Indeed, my lord,
The melancholy Jaques grieves at that;
And in that kind swears you do more usurp,
Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
To-day my lord of Amiens and myself
Did steal behind him as he lay along
Under an oak, whose antique root peeps out
Upon the brook that brawls along this wood;
To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,
That from the hunter's aim had ta’en a hurt,
Did come to languish ; and, indeed, my lord,
The wretched animal heaved forth such groans,
That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
Almost to bursting; and the big round tears
Coursed one another down his innocent nose
In piteous.chase; and thus the hairy fool,
Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,
Augmenting it with tears.
Duke. But what said Jaques ?
Did he not moralize this spectacle ?
Lord. Oh, yes, into a thousand similes.
First, for his weeping in the needless stream;
Poor deer, quoth he, thou makest a testament
As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more,
To that which had too much. Then being there alone,
Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends;
'Tis right, quoth he, thus misery doth part
The flux of company. Anon a careless herd,
Full of the pasture, jumps along by him,
And never stays to greet him : ay, quoth Jaques,
Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens,

'Tis just the fashion : wherefore do you look
Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?
Thus most invectively he pierceth through
The body of the country, city, court,
Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
Are mere usurpers, tyrants, and what's worse,
To fright the animals, and to kill them up,
In their assign'd and native dwelling place.
Duke. And did you leave him in this contemplation ?

Upon the sobbing deer.

And they did make no noise, -in such a night,
Troilus, methinks, mounted the Trojan walls,
And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
Where Cressid lay that night.

And with an unthrift love did run from Venice,
As far as Belmont.
Jes.

Did young Lorenzo swear he lov'd her well ;
Stealing her soul with many vows of faith,
And ne'er a true one.

Slander her love, and he forgave it her.
How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank !
Here will we sit, and let the sounds of music
Creep in our ears; soft stillness, and the night,
Become the touches of sweet harmony.
Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of Heaven
Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold.
There's not the smallest orb which thou beholdst
But in his motion like an angel sings,
Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims:
Such harmony is in immortal souls;
But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.-
Enter Musicians.
Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn;
With sweetest touches pierce your mistress ear,
And draw her home with music.
Jes. I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
Lor. The reason is, your spirits are attentive :
For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
Fetching mad bounds, bellowing, and neighing loud,
Which is the hot condition of their blood ;
If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
Or
any
air of music touch their ears,
You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,

:
Their savage eyes turned to a modest gaze,
By the sweet power of music : Therefore, the poet
Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones, and floods ;
Since nought so stockish, hard, and full of rage,
But music for the time doth change his nature ;
The man that hath no music in himself,
Nor is not mov'd with concord of sweet sounds,
Is fit for treasons, stratagems, and spoils;
The motions of his spirit are dull as night,
And his affections dark as Erebus :
Let no such man be trusted.—Mark the music.
Enter PORTIA and NERISSA at a distance.
Por. That light we see is burning in my hall.
How far that little candle throws his beams!
So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
Ner. When the moon shone we did not see the candle.
Por. So doth the greater glory dim the less :
A substitute shines brightly as a king,
Until a king be by; and then his state
Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
Into the main of waters. Music! hark !
Ner. It is your music, madam, of the house.
Por. Nothing is good, I see, without respect;
Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
Ner. Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
Por. The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,
When neither is attended; and, I think,
The nightingale, if she should sing by day,
When every goose is cackling, would be thought
No better a musician than the wren.
How many things by season season'd are
To their right praise and true perfection !-
Peace! Now the moon sleeps with Endymion,
And would not be awak'd !-Shakespeare.

Not this the End : still faithful song
Shall nerve the weak, direct the strong,
And help the weary feet along
A path untravelled yet.
As runs the rill from rock to mere,
As rolls the world, sphere tuned to sphere
So has each life of labour here
Its course to music set.
And faithfully, from farthest days
When Cædmon gave to God the praise,
Have English hearts in English lays
Still hymned the battle-song
Of duty, England's champion knight,
Who, daily striving, gathers might,
That shall, at last, assure the right,
And overcome the wrong.
In Chaucer's verse his name was Love;
Through Gower, as Love's Priest, he strove
With all the sins, and taught and shrove
The lover who confessed ;
One called him Piers, of heavenly mind,
A Ploughman helping human kind,
Its three sure earthly friends to find, -
Do-well, Do-bet, Do-best.
When Spenser sings, true, loving, just,
He turns to dew the highway dust,
Between the stones fresh blossoms thrust
Their buds where all was dry
In sweetest Shakespeare is such art
When duty bids him heal our smart,
That killing care and grief of heart
Are lulled, or hearing, die.
Our Milton, whom the truth made free;
Our Wordsworth asking, what we see
One is, why may not millions be ;
Our singers of like strain,

With unlike voices and one soul,
Each with the yearning of the whole,-
Who next shall press toward the goal
Ye sought, and who attain ?
Glad Chaucer of the latest day,
When all who live shall love the lay
That helps them on the upward way
And discords are no more.
What Spensers, Miltons, yet to be,
What other Shakespeare, passed for thee,
Shalt thou look back on ere thou see,
In ages long before,
These toilers singing through the night,
These singers toiling with their might,
To turn the darkness into light
By cherishing that friend,
Duty, whose armour lights the place,
Because he moves with even pace
Full in the light of God's own face,
Our champion to The End.-Procter.
SUMMARY OF RULES FOR GOOD SPEAKING.
Articulation.-Audibility, or extent of carrying power of
voice, depends upon full utterance of vowels. Recognizability
of words, or the intelligible expression of meaning, depends
upon the care with which the consonants are rendered, in
their relation to vowels in the formation of words.
Each syllable in a word should be clearly rendered; accented
syllables with proper stress: unaccented syllables should not
be slurred. The lungs should be kept well supplied with
breath, which should be taken at frequent intervals, con-
siderably through the nasal passages.

Outlines of the Art of Elocution.
Mere vocal force should never overpower the consonant
influences. Aspirates should be carefully given or avoided, as
occasion requires.
Modulation.—The tones of voice and rate of movement
must be varied to suit each variety or modification of meaning.
Parenthetical clauses must be marked by a distinct change
in tone.
0
Tones of voice to be adapted to increasing importance of
meaning as words (or sentences) are spoken, and climax is
reached. Illustrative passages should be modulated to show
their importance.
Movement of voice should not be
necessarily slow, but deliberate, allowing of the complete
utterance of a word so that it should be recognised as spoken.
In beginning to speak the voice may be pitched at its natural
level, and then varied as required by meaning.
Inflection.-Accented syllable of the principal emphatic
word in a clause should be inflected in such a way as to show
the relation of that clause to others in the same sentence.
Upward inflection in incomplete, suspensive, conditional,
and negative clauses, downward in complete clauses and
clauses that complete the meaning.
First part of an antithesis generally to be read with upward,
second with downward turn of voice. Determinate questions
to be spoken with downward inflection, as containing both
question and answer; indeterminate questions, asking for
information, with upward.
Words, ironical or of indirect or implied meaning to be
spoken with circumflex inflections.

Outlines of the Art of Elocution.
157
Emphasis.-The following should be emphasized :-
Words that express the subject of sentence.
Words that qualify same.
Words that suggest distinction, comparison, antithesis,
and important modification of meaning.
Words that determine the particular form of a sentence,
such as interrogative, conditional, &c.
Pause should be frequently made without breaking con-
tinuity of sentence, or separating words (such as the adjective
immediately qualifying substantive, or adverb and verb) that
belong to the same grammatical group. But each noun or
adjective (except an adjective immediately before noun) in a
series may be marked by slight pause. Many emphatic words
should be followed by a pause-also parentheses.
The suspensive inflection, being used to denote words to
follow, allows of frequent pauses for breath-taking.
Pause should be judiciously distributed in reading poetry,
especially to create variety in blank verse.
Rhythm must be strongly marked in reading poetry.
The rhythmical accent must agree as far as possible with
the grammatical accent, so as to allow of the usual pronuncia-
tion of words. Sing-song to be avoided by a judicious dis-
tribution of the rhetorical emphasis.
Rhyme.—The accented syllable in the rhyming word, or the
word itself if a monosyllable, should be spoken with con-
siderable stress of voice.

Gesture.—Head well up, shoulders back, chest forward, left
foot forward bearing principal weight of body. Strength of
gesture from shoulder, grace of gesture and curve by
flexibility of wrist and bend of elbow. Gesture should not be
too frequent or continuous. It must be prepared for, so that
when the emphatic word comes the movement upon that word
should be immediate and spontaneous. Gesture should be
adapted to character of speech, whether declamation, soliloquy,
argument, description, or actual embodiment of character and
passion.
