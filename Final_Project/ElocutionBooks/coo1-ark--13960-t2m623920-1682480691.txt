PREFACE. 
 
 The time has gone by for emphasizing the necessity of Elocu- 
 tion : its utility is self-evident in every walk of life, particularly 
 in public life. What teachers have now to do is to make their 
 instruction of practical service to every learner. We can best 
 accomplish this by setting forth the true basis of Elocution, 
 showing that its roots are in human nature no less than in 
 Art. 
 
 There is no attempt in these few pages to compass the whole 
 subject of Elocution ; I simply define the elements and their 
 relationships, and at the same time raise into due importance 
 the literary aspect of Elocution. In my opinion too much 
 attention has been given to the trivialities of display, while 
 the fundamental principles binding together thought and 
 speech have been proportionately neglected. A better state of 
 things cannot prevail till there is more universal reverence 
 and affection for literature as the artistic embodiment of 
 human life and character. 
 
 I beg to acknowledge with thanks the courtesy of the 
 following Authors and Publishers in granting permission

 Mackay ; Messrs. James Nisbet & Co.; Messrs. Kegan, Paul, 
 Trubner & Co., publishers of the " Lotos '' edition of the poems

 Ruskin's works. Should any copyright piece have been inserted 
 without permission, I most heartily apologize to the holders, 
 assuring them that every care has been taken to avoid such

 vey similar impressions T;o~aEIier mmas. iSEin zo tne poei; s 
 art of interpreting nature and life first-hand, is the art that 
 seeks to articulate the sights and feelings of the poet : the 
 art of representing in human tones the lights and shades, the 
 heights and depths of passion and imagination. In these 
 pages we shall consider elocution as connected inseparably, 
 though not exclusively, with passion and conception : as that 
 scheme of exposition by which mind appreciates mind through 
 the medium of the voice and its accompaniments. And he 
 who would truly read Uke "he who would truly write a great 
 poem, ought himself to be a true poem.'' 
 
 II. We may give a more practical definition of elocution. 
 It is the art of expressing all communicable thought, written

 and impromptu, with clearness and propriety. Clearness 
 relating to the mechanical utterance of words; propriety con- 
 cerning itself with the apprehension of the subject-matter, and 
 everything affectiag the reflection of the author's mind as it 
 appears in paragraph or verse. 
 
 For convenience and simplicity we shall divide our subject 
 into three parts : — 
 
 (1) The Matter, or that which is to be expressed ; 
 
 (2) The Mechanism, or vehicle of expression ; and 
 
 (3) The Manner, or symboHsm of expression. 
 
 This threefold view of elocution gives room for a brief ex- 
 amination of the nature of literature, of the vocal organs, and 
 of expression. 
 
 (A.) POETRY. (B.) PROSE. 
 
 III. (A.) Poetry. — Before we can successfully re-create the 
 work of an author vocally, we must in a manner appropriate 
 his mind. With such as Goldsmith, Longfellow, and Dickens, 
 the task will be comparatively easy. Shakspere, Milton, 
 Browning, Carlyle, and the like, will exact much more from 
 us ; here we shall find a heavy call upon our imagination, 
 sympathy, and experience, such, indeed, that we can never hope 
 to fully meet. It matters not, however, whether the subject 
 be trifling or profound, we must obey the principle of adopting 
 with all possible nearness the author's attitude toward his 
 subject. 
 
 Our first act must be to immerse ourselves in the spirit of 
 the composition we wish to read : leaving the consideration of 
 voice and gesture until we have caught every point of the 
 author's meaning. When the intellect becomes mature, a

 suitable form of delivery will appear in umon with the aim of 
 the writer : this is one reason why a skilled elocutionist can 
 interpret literature so much more readily than others. 
 
 If you give critical attention to public readers or reciters 
 who have had no systematic training, or who lack the " literary 
 faculty,'' you will find them confuse the literary elements of a 
 composition. That is, they will probably narrate where they 
 should describe, and describe where they should narrate, or 
 declaim where they need merely to explain. The richest voice 
 and most elegant gesture, though they may do much, cannot 
 compensate for habitual misapprehension of this kind. In 
 order, then, to gain a clearer notion of the elements represent- 
 able in speech, the student must know something of the lead- 
 ing constituents of literature as an embodiment of mind- 
 Some such scheme as we here give, though incomplete and 
 unsatisfactory in many ways, may help to greater facility of 
 apprehension, and show the propriety of consonance between 
 mind and voice. 
 
 IV. Take Poetry first. Everyone will see reason in our 
 distinguishing between the material of Gowper's "John Gilpin'' 
 and Shelley's " Skylark " : one a humorous story, and the other 
 jin outburst of emotional admiration. 
 
 Again, the play of " The Merchant of Venice " is different 
 in substance and structure from the " Paradise Lost " or the 
 "Light of Asia." 
 
 Further, Pope's " Essay on Man," with its connected chains 
 of reason, is altogether unlike Goldsmith's description of the 
 " Country Clergyman," or Byron's exciting picture of "Water- 
 loo." 
 
 From this we gather that there are certain large elements, 
 more or less distinct, which, existing in separate or in mixed 
 


## p. (#16) #################################################

4 The Elements of Elocution. 
 
 form, may be said to constitute the great mass of literature. 
 The poem will of course take its definition from the prevailing 
 element. 
 
 Generally speaking, poetry is resolvable into the following 
 five classes : — 
 
 1. Narrative = Story-teUing. Examples: "John Gilpin," 
 
 "Horatius," "Herve Kiel." 
 
 2. Dramatic = Dialogue. Examples : "Julius Osesar," 
 
 " Othello," etc. 
 
 3. Lyric = Emotional. Examples: "The Skylark," "Hymn 
 
 to the Sunrise," " The Day is done." 
 
 4. Descriptive = Pictorial. Examples : "The Field of 
 
 Waterloo," "HohenUnden," "The Cottar's Saturday 
 Night." 
 
 5. Reflective = Didactic, Argumentative. Examples: "Thfe 
 
 Task," " Essay on Man." 
 It will at once be seen that while each class of poem 
 represents a given state of mind, the whole five states of mind 
 enter into some poems ; many will contain three, and others 
 only two, and some few have but one element. 
 
 V. We are now face to face with the real question : shall we 
 deliver a poem that combines within itself, say, three elements, 
 in the spirit of the leading element, and ignore the other two ? 
 No. We must at all times, as a fixed principle, accommodate 
 our mood to that of the poem, however it may change. In 
 this way we make the Manner accord perfectly with the 
 Matter, and so accompKsh our purpose. 
 
 Were it necessary for the exponent of poetry to possess the 
 creative genius of the poet, and at the same time the poet to 
 have the art of the reader, there is a possibility that we should 
 have few of either. Fortunately this is not so : but it con- 
 cerns us to know that what fills the mind of the author 
 


## p. (#17) #################################################

The Elements of Elocution. 5 
 
 ought, in some degree, to occupy the mind of the reader, 
 while he reads aloud, as well as during his study of the poet. 
 
 Or it may be put thus : "We are the workmen ; speech, look 
 and gesture are our materials, and the poem is the design to 
 be implicitly followed : consequently an irreproachable copy 
 depends on the truth of our conception and the knowledge we 
 have of our materials. From all this we may argue that any 
 person bringing to the work of an author a fixed habit or 
 mannerism, prevents the direct reflection of the author's mind, 
 and so violates the first principle of vocal and mental union. 
 
 Let us learn to approach literature, as the wiser scientists 
 approached nature, with simplicity and openness of mind, and 
 literature, like nature, wiU withhold no secrets. 
 
 VI. In Preparing a Selection for Recitation we might 
 adopt this fashion of inquiry : — 
 
 1. What are its elements ? 
 
 2. What the real gist of the poem, and where its climax ? 
 
 3. What parts come next in importance to the climax ? 
 
 4. Where will gesture help the matter, or, appropriately, 
 
 supplement the delivery ? 
 
 There are poems, beautiful and effective, that seem to have 
 no conspicuous climax or crisis, the temperature being uniform 
 throughout. " The Village Blacksmith " and " Maud Miiller " 
 in many respects are of this class, while the " Bridge of Sighs," 
 " Charge of the Light Brigade," and " Horatius " are remark- 
 able for climax. 
 
 Apply this our analytical test to 
 
 "The Charge of the Light Brigade." 
 
 1. We find four elements present: Descriptive, narrative, 
 dramatic, and lyric. The body of the poem is descrip- 
 


## p. (#18) #################################################

6 The Elements of Elocution. 
 
 tive ; the opening reveals a trace of the dramatic, and 
 the close a trace of the lyric, while a thin narrative- 
 thread binds the whole. 
 
 2. The gist or substance of this martial ballad is heroic 
 
 obedience to duty in the face of death : the most active 
 climax is reached when the horsemen plunge in the 
 battery-smoke, mingle in terrible conflict with the 
 Russians, and finally spike the guns. 
 
 3. The depiction of their return is slightly inferior as a 
 
 rhetorical cUmax, but eloquently pathetic. The last 
 few lines, that have the breadth and depth of national 
 acclamation, are bold and full of enthusiasm. 
 
 4. Many carefully studied gestures are wanted to make this 
 
 poem live. " Cannon to right of them, cannon to left of 
 them," etc., should have illustrative action from the 
 right arm ; imitative sword-cuts at the climax are ad- 
 missible ; a gesture in keeping with the acclaim of the 
 last Une gives the poem finish. 
 
 To re-emphasize this principle of the poem dictating its 
 own style of interpretation, let us add : A If arrative piece 
 must be uttered in a tale-telling way ; a Lyric with a suitable 
 temperature of feeling; a Descriptive Scene with a just amount 
 of vividness and colouring ; a Dialogue, or Drama, with suffi- 
 cient individuaHsation of the characters ; and a Reflective, or 
 Didactic, work with its right proportion of argumentativeness 
 or counsel. 
 
 One fact, however, keep always in mind, and that is that 
 there are degrees of quality, from the simple, to the sublime, 
 in each class of Hterature. For example, a tragedy usually 
 reveals more extraordinary life than a comedy, and yet both 
 are correctly called Dramatic literature : " Paradise Lost " and 
 "Hiawatha,'' both Narrative in kind, difier widely in degree: 
 


## p. (#19) #################################################

The Elements of Elomtion. 7 
 
 so with the other classes. The degree of temper or spirit 
 applied to various poems must exactly agree with the quality 
 of the matter. 
 
 "VII. The Eeading op Scriptuee. — The double rule we have 
 laid down, respecting kind and degree, touches the Bible with 
 the same certainty that it does other books. The "Psalms," 
 lyrical in essence, are totally difierent from the book of 
 " Revelation." Again, the Bible swarms with dramatic chap- 
 ters, such as "Acts" xxiv. and xxvi., essentially dissimilar from, 
 say, the pastoral scenes in the book of "Ruth." In all its 
 departments the Bible stands foremost, while much of it is 
 transcendantly loftier than anything else we know ; accord- 
 ingly, a treatment more uniformly dignified is required for 
 Scripture, modulated in degree to the grandeur or simplicity 
 of its chapters. 
 
 VIII. (B.) Prose. — ^What has been said with reference to 
 the interpretation of Poetry and the Bible must, in the main, be 
 repeated with respect to Prose. Our classification of poetry — 
 the Lyric excepted — serves for prose. The term Lyric, never- 
 theless, has its prose equivalent in " Eloquence " : so that by 
 substituting "Eloquence" for "Lyric," the one order is pre- 
 served for poetry and prose, with, practically, the same method 
 of exposition. We do not state that prose and poetry are 
 synonymous, requiring a common treatment — they are palpably 
 distinct — but that the excitement created by a given spirit 
 is the same whether the composition be a metrical or prose 
 medium. 
 
 IX. HtJMOUE, in spite of Tom Hood, reads best in prose. 
 Students of Shakspere will have noticed that his naturally 
 comic characters drop into prose when they speak at length.

8 The Elements of Elocution. 
 
 Swift's humour is dry and demure : Addison's humour is light 
 and sportive for the most part : the humour of Dickens is in- 
 variably broad and merry : Holmes and Twain have an odd 
 vein each, all to themselves. We mention humour because, 
 as no nature is complete without a degree of it, so no reader 
 would be an all-round representative of human experience who 
 had not a quick perception of wit and humour. The reader 
 needs to distinguish between these several classes of humour, 
 or he will mistake demure absurdity for fact. The "Coverley 
 Papers," by Addison, afford the amateur room for capital 
 practice, and many of the funnier papers would be most wel- 
 come to a select audience, either public or private. The mass 
 of Englishmen love fun not less than excitement. 
 
 We cannot conclude this stage of our study without urging 
 upon the aspirant the necessity for careful and patient pre- 
 paration of his recitals ; remembering that the hsteners have 
 only the time the deUvery occupies in which to grasp the 
 poem. As an interpreter he is bound to make his hearers see 
 and feel what the author intends : this will often entail long 
 and critical study, but it is, even on the meanest ground, 
 preferable to the perilous course of superficial study. No 
 reader should allow himself to speak words the meaning of 
 which he does not fuUy comprehend. On our way, then, to 
 establish a sound and consistent connection between litera- 
 ture and DELIVERY, what have we found ? 
 
 1. That as Literature interprets Life and Nature, so Elocu- 
 tion interprets Literature. 
 
 2. That literature is divisible into certain classes, each of 
 which requires specific treatment. 
 
 3. That the rules laid down for reading and reciting stand 
 good for extemporaneous or prepared speech of our own con- 
 trivance.

 The reader will note that the following elements prepon- 
 derate in, but do not monopolize, the examples as they are 
 classified. Three degrees of value, i.e. important, more im- 
 portant, most important, are represented in italics, small 
 capitals, and large capitals respectively. 
 
 ISTaeeative, . . "Ginevra." Rogers. 
 
 There is nothing complex ahout this poem, it is a plainly -told story in three parts. 
 First, the appearance of a beautiful, laughing young bride ; second, her alarming 
 disappearance ; and third, the revelation of her tragic death. 
 
 The poem should be opened and continued brisltly and cheerfully till the gloom 
 of her absence sets in upon the wedding festival. The strain of anxiety on the part 
 of her father and guests must be realistically exhibited. Begin from " Full fifty

 She was an only child— her name Ginevra, the joy, the pride of an m- 
 dulgent sire ; and in her iifteenth year became a bride, marrying an only 
 son, Francesco Doria, her playmate hom her birth, and her first love. 
 She was all gentleness, aU gaiety, her pranks the favourite theme of every 
 tongue. But now the day was come, the day, the hour ; now, frowning, 
 smiling, for the hundi-edtn time, the nurse, that ancient lady, preached 
 decorum ; and Ginevra, in the histre of her youth, gave her hand, with 
 her heart in it, to Francesco. Great was the joy; but, at the nuptial 
 feast, when ah sat down, the bride was wanting there, nor was she to be 
 found ! Her father cried, " 'Tis hut to make a trial of our love ! " and 
 filled his glass to all ; but his hand shook, and soon from guest to guest 
 the panic spread. 'Twas but that instant she had left Francesco, laugh- 
 ing, and lookhig back, and flying still— her ivory tooth imprinted on his 
 finger. But now, alas ! she was not to be found ; nor from that hour 
 could any thing be guessed, but that she was not! 
 
 Weary of his Ufe, Francesco flew to Venice, and forthwith flung it away 
 in battle with the Turk. Oisini lived ; and long mightst thou have seen 
 an old man wandering as in quest of something, something he could not 
 find— ha knew not what. When he was gone, the house remained awhile 
 Ment and tenantless — then went to strangers.

 I 'will feed fat the ancient grudge I Dear him. 
 He hates our sacred nation ; and he rails, 
 Even there where merchants most do congregate.

 Which he calls interest. Curskl be my tribe, 
 If I forgive him ! 
 
 Bass. Shylock, do you hear ? 
 
 Shy. I am debating of my present store ; 
 And, by the near guess of my memory, 
 I cannot instantly raise up the gross 
 Of full three thousand ducats. What of that ?

 Still have I borne it with a, patient shrug; 
 For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe ; 
 You call me — misbeliever, cut-throat dog.

 And all for use of that which is mine own. 
 Well then, it now appears, you need my help ;

 Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last ; 
 You spumed me such a day ; another tiine 
 You calld me— dog ; and for these courtesies

 To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too. 
 If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not 
 As to thy friends; (for when did friendship take 
 A breed for barren metal of his friend 1) 
 But lend it rather to thine enemy ; 
 Who, if he break, thou may'st with better face 
 Exact the penalty. 
 
 Shy. Why, look you, how you storm ! 
 
 I would be friends with you, and have your love, 
 Forget the shames that you have stain d me with,

 Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me : 
 This is kind I offer.

 Go with me to a notary, seal me there 
 Your single bond ; and, in a merry sport. 
 If you repay me not on such a day. 
 In such a place, such sum, or sums, as are 
 Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit 
 Be nominated for an eqtial pound 
 Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken 
 In what part of your body pleaseth me.

 And say there is much kindness in the Jew.

 Desceiptive, "The Norman Baron," Longfellow. 
 
 Here is represented the death-bed of a Baron who covers his name with honour 
 by liberating with his last breath the slaves and vassals in his service. The influ- 
 ences at work are the prayers of the monk, the songs of freedom sung by Saxon 
 minstrels, and the lightning of the heavens. The progress of repentance and noble 
 resolution must be carefully brought out amid the vivid scenic effects. 
 
 The good deed, at the elevenMi hour, snatches his name from obscurity, and 
 elevates truth and justice high over the show and fashion of the world. 
 
 Give the last two verses all the breadth and dignity you can command, especially 
 emphasising the antithesis.

 In his chamber, weak and dying. 
 Was the Norman Baron lying ; 
 Loud, without, the tempest thundered, 
 
 And the castle-tm:ret shook. 
 In this fight was Death the gainer, 
 Spite of vassal and retainer. 
 And the lands his sires had plundered, 
 
 Written in the Doomsday Book. 
 By his bed a monk was seated, 
 Who in humble voice repeated 
 Many a prayer and pater-noster. 
 
 Prom the missal on his knee ; 
 And, amid the tempest pealing, 
 Sounds of bells came faintly stealino-, 
 Bells, that from the neighbouring cloister, 
 
 Rang for the Nativity. 
 In the hall, the serf and vassal 
 Held, that night, thek Christmas wassail ; 
 Many a carol, old and saintly, 
 
 Sang the minstrels and the waits. 
 And so loud these Saxon gleemen 
 Sang to slaves the songs ot freemen. 
 That the storm was heard but faintly. 
 
 Knocking at the castle gates. 
 Till at length the lays they chaunted 
 Reached the chamber terror-haunted, 
 Where the monk with accents holy, 
 
 Whispered in the baron's ear. 
 Tears upon his eyelids gUstened, 
 As he paused awhile and listened. 
 And the dying baron slowly 
 
 Turned his weary head to hear 
 "Wassail for the kingly stranger. 
 Born and cradled in a manger ! 
 King, like David, priest, like Aaron, 
 
 Christ is born to set \iafree I "

 Wordsworth. 
 
 The pre-ordained harmony between Nature and Man that Wordsworth contended 
 for and preached of so eloquently is uppermost in these lines : 
 " To her fair works did Nature link 
 The human soul that through me ran." 
 He shows that man lives out his best self under the refining and ennobling 
 influences of Nature. Man divorced from nature is a failure ; " much it grieved 
 my heart to think what man has made of man." 
 
 The interpreter must dintU the thought and teaching of this poem, or he will fail 
 to give his hearers a true impression of Wordsworth's mind. Give prominence to 
 the doctrine of Nature having an indweliing spirit ; 
 
 " 'Tis ray faith that every flower 
 Enjoys the air it breathes." 
 A calm, simple but reverent manner is the most appropriate for this poem.

 While in a grove I sat reclined, 
 In that sweet mood when^^easawf thoughts 
 Bring sad thoughts to the mind.

 And much it grieved my heart to think

 Their thoughts I cannot measure — 
 But the least motion which they made, 
 It seemed a thrill oi pleasure. 
 
 The budding twigs spread out their fan, 
 To catch the breezy air ; 
 And I must think, do all I can. 
 That there was pleasure there.

 XI. The Medianism.. — We now come to consider in a very 
 general way the structure and function of the instrument by 
 which all vocal effects are produced. By way of preface to 
 this part of our study, it wiU not be out of place to remark 
 that the truth, vigour, and beauty of interpretation depends 
 much upon the strength, resonance, and compass of the voice. 
 We can do as little justice to a grand poem or a noble chapter 
 of prose with a defective voice as a musician with an exhausted 
 organ or tuneless piano can do to the composition of a great 
 master. Hence, two thiags are accepted, first, that we must, 
 if possible, secure what is called a "good voice," and secondly,

 having acquired an ample and manageable voice, learn to pre- 
 serve it by regular and careful exercise. The exercises arranged 
 in this book, if strictly and systematically followed, are calcu- 
 lated not only to keep a good voice in order, but to estab- 
 lish any voice that is capable of being trained ; and it is 
 not too much to assert that unless some such exercises are 
 methodically practised, no voice will maintain its tone and 
 power. 
 
 Roughly speaking, the speech-mechanism embraces the follow- 
 ing parts, varying, of course, in their degree of importance, 
 but all demanding the attention of the student. 
 
 (1) The Lungs, (2) The Vocal Chords, (3) The Tongue, the 
 Teeth, and the Lips. 
 
 In the act of speech, the vocal chords, otherwise apart and at 
 rest, are brought together at due tension, and as the air from 
 the lungs strives to escape through the narrow chink, the 
 edges of the chords vibrate and produce sound, which, modified 
 by the upper portion of the throat and the mouth, may be 
 articulated into words by the tongue, teeth, and lips. 
 
 This, though a bald description of the process of speech- 
 formation, will give the beginner all he needs to know at the 
 outset. 
 
 XII. (1.) The Lungs. — There is a common fallacy abroad 
 that the normal capacity of these organs is sufficient in all cases 
 to meet the extraordinary strain put upon them by public speak- 
 ing and reading. For the ordinary purposes of life they may 
 well perform their function without care on our part, but 
 when we wish to speak long and frequently in large buildings, 
 their power must be economised. 
 
 The voice is so dependent upon the lungs that any excessive 
 or mis-use of the latter quickly shows itself in a deterioration 
 of tone and power. The following precepts, along with the 
 


## p. (#31) #################################################

The Elements of Elocution. 19 
 
 breathing-exercises, will help the speaker to gaia complete 
 control over the lungs, and give ease, steadiness, and endurance 
 to the voice. 
 
 1. Take in the breath steadily through the nostrils, and 
 
 always inflate the loioer part of the chest. 
 
 2. Avoid, as a system of breathing, throwing out the upper 
 
 part of the chest and drawing in the lower part. 
 
 3. Take as many deep inhalations as you conveniently can 
 
 at the outstart of your recital or speech. 
 
 4. Commence to speak the instant your lungs are filled : 
 
 delay causes exhaustion and confusion. 
 
 5. Remember that you control the emission of breath by 
 
 the lower chest-muscles. 
 
 6. Stoop as little as possible while you speak, and refrain 
 
 from gestures that unnecessarily cramp the chest. 
 
 XIII. (2.) The Vocal Chords, extremely simple in struc- 
 ture, are governed by an indescribably complicated set of 
 muscles, the action of which can be best understood by the 
 examination of a bullock's or human larynx. Though few 
 details of tliis branch of our subject come within the scope of 
 so general a view as the present, something more than a pass- 
 ing reference may naturally be expected. Let it be remem- 
 bered, then, that during silent respiration the vocal chords lie 
 apart, but when we will to utter a sound they approximate. 
 Now this coming-together of the chords is a form of attack, 
 which it is highly important to perfect by exercise. 
 
 The exercise best suited to the strengthening of these attack- 
 muscles is the one that secures the dilatation and contraction 
 of the vocal chords for every vowel sound (see exercise), and 
 the value of moderate daily practice in this way cannot be 
 overstated. On the other hand, violent or long-sustained use

20 The Elements of Elocution. 
 
 of the voice during the early years of training might result in 
 some very obstinate form of laryngitis, or " Clergyman's sore 
 throat." 
 
 Another point is, the position of the vocal chords in the 
 throat, relative to pitch. It is not at all uncommon to hear 
 of singing masters requiring their pupils to keep the vocal 
 chords at one fixed elevation during the production of low, 
 middle, and high tones : this, in the face of nature, seems 
 almost incredible. 
 
 If you look in the mirror at that prominence in the throat 
 commonly called " Adam's Apple " (properly speaking, the 
 thyroid cartilage, containing the vocal chords), as you sing up 
 and down the scale, you will notice its upward and downward 
 movement corresponds with the rise and fall in the scale. The 
 lid (or epiglottis) follows the same course. 
 
 Jfature's argument then is, that the nearer the voice-pro- 
 ducing apparatus is to the chest, the longer must be the 
 tunnel-Uke cavity or resonator of the throat above it, and 
 hence the deeper tones ; whilst the nearer this organ is to the 
 top of the throat, the shallower must be the cavity or reson- 
 ator, and so the higher and thinner tones. 
 
 This is not the whole, but it is an important part of the 
 cause of pitch-variation, considered independently of the 
 speaker's ivill. 
 
 To the public reader — especially the reader of dramatic 
 literature — a knowledge of this agreement between the posi- 
 tion of the larynx and the pitch of voice is most, helpful in 
 enabling him to assume more quickly and decidedly the various 
 needful " changes of voice," as we say. 
 
 It should be mentioned that the nasal channels and the 
 mouth form parts of the varied cavity or resonator to which 
 reference has just been made ; and should there be any struc- 
 tural defect of the nose or mouth, the purity of the voice is 
 


## p. (#33) #################################################

The Elements of Elocution. 2 1 
 
 sure to be affected. A deficient supply of teeth, or an impeded 
 nostril, will often mar the tone and articulation of a speaker. 
 
 XIV. (3.) The Mouth (Tongue, Teeth, and Lips). A lazy 
 jaw is not less to be condemned than one too active. They 
 are alike unlovely. How frequently are we aggravated by the 
 unintelligible mumblings of people who will not open their 
 mouths ; they keep the lower jaw tightly wedged under the 
 upper jaw, and force their words through the nose and teeth 
 in a manner disagreeable to the sensitive listener, and, at the 
 same time, detrimental to their own vocal organs. If we 
 would articulate audibly and easily, we must open the mouth : 
 that is, move the lower jaw adequately. 
 
 And again, let us remember that we are not to speak in the 
 throat, but well to the front of the mouth, so that the voice 
 in its free forward-passage may catch some character from the 
 roof of the mouth, and from what may be called the metallic 
 Iceys — the teeth. The teeth give an indispensable sibilant 
 quality to the letter s in certain positions, while the lips make 
 the p's and h's, and secondarily, the m's, impressive. No 
 speaker can hope to faithfully utter the subtleties of poetic 
 expression — where sense and sound-symbols are perfectly 
 wedded — without a nice control over these two auxiliaries ; 
 and it is possible so to master them as to give extraordinary 
 significance to a single word : for example, the words "serpent" 
 and "bond," used as they are in the " Merchant of Venice,'' 
 carry an immense amount of meaning when correctly spoken 
 (see exercises). 
 
 This consideration of the function of the mouth brings us 
 into the domain of what may be styled the " Technique " of 
 our art. 
 
 XV. Midway, however, between the " Mechanism " and the 
 " Technique " are two seemingly independent subjects — Enun-

 ciation consists in an ample and an infallibly dear utterance 
 of letters, syllables, and words. Few are gifted with perfect 
 enunciation, owing to the careless habits of speech formed 
 during the period of youth: stiU, faults the most stubborn 
 can, as a rule, be removed by watchfulness and constant con- 
 tact with good models. In addition to the set exercises, the 
 pupil should remember to — 
 
 1. Keep the lungs well suppUed. 
 
 2. Raise the tongue to the roof of the mouth before begin- 
 
 ning to speak. 
 
 3. Open the mouth well. 
 
 4. Speak forward. 
 
 5. Form each syllable fully and firmly, and liberate all 
 
 articulations promptly, but not abruptly. 
 
 Pronunciation means something different from enunciation, 
 though they are frequently confounded. In elocutionary 
 phraseology pronunciation has to do with exactness of accentu- 
 ation, and purity of the vowel and consonant. Some persons 
 have a naturally good pronunciation, but most are in some 
 degree faulty. Patient, incessant correction will reform even 
 obstinate provincialisms. 
 
 The vowels o and u are usually the most sinned against, and 
 should be practised with the other exercises here given. 
 
 1. NG : singing, running, jumping, shouting — not singin', etc 
 
 2. TS : gTiests, acts, tracts, facts, gusts, sects — not tracs, etc. 
 
 3. IBIjE : horribte, terrible, possible, edible, indestructible — not horraile, etc 
 
 4. ENT : dependent, resplendent, consistent — not consistant, etc. 
 
 5. ITY : charity, purity, serenity, liberality— not charaty, etc.

 PART III. 
 
 XVI. The Manner. — We shall now study very briefly 
 'some of the more technical elements of elocution. 
 
 Assuming that all " Art is Nature better understood," we 
 must be compliant, and satisfy ourselves as to the ways of 
 nature in her best types, and establish out of these a standard 
 or ide<d. What we mean is this : One who speaks with correct 
 emphasis, intonation, and inflexion, is preferable to the one 
 who has no true appreciation of the affinity of speech and 
 thought. 
 
 It is a curious and perplexing fact that many persons who 
 betray few faults in extemporaneous speech fail utterly in 
 reading the writings of others. This is due, we think, to their 
 unfamiliarity with the artistic basis of elocution, though it is 
 generally described as a "lack of voice-control." A knowledge 
 of i^e principles of reading will not create a stiff and unnatural 
 style of speaking ; rather will it make the voice a finer and 
 vaoTQ faithful vehicle of thought in both forms of exposition. 
 
 Inflexion, Emphasis, Time, Pitch, and Tone are the only 
 elements we can here intelligibly treat. 
 
 XVII. 1. Inflexion is the upward and downward bending 
 of the voice, and should not be identified with Pitch. 
 
 Signs : — Upward / , Downward \ , Cu-cumflex /s ; these are the 
 principal forms.

 As a rule the upward inflexion opens a sentence, and the 
 
 cadence of repose closes it; but the fall should rarely be longer 
 
 than the longest rise in the sentence. In the simplest unim- 
 
 passioned speech the voice moves in di-tones, rising to a third 
 
 on the introduction of a nev7 subject-word ; the cadence of the 
 
 third, therefore, closes the sense. 
 
 For example : — " A thing of beauty is a joy for ever." 
 Though this rule applies pretty generally, the upward in- 
 flexion frequently best closes the sense. 
 
 Example.—" I'd rather be a dog, and bay the moon. 
 
 Than such a Roman." — Julius Ccesar. 
 
 The subtle laws regulating inflexion are far too numerous 
 for our space, and for the present can only be thus hinted at. 
 
 XVIII. 2. Emphasis. — There are many kinds of emphasis, 
 of which the following four are perhaps chief. (1) Emphatic 
 Vocal Stress. (2) Emphasis of Expansion. (3) Emphasis 
 of Individualization. (4) Percussive Emphasis. 
 
 C(l) Stress. — "I pray you think you question with tlie 
 Jew." — M. of Venice. 
 „ " In she pi unged boldly." — Bridge of Sighs. 
 
 (2) Expansion. — " Away slight man." — Jnlius Ccesar.

 The reader will see that this has reference to the quality of 
 emphasis, and has nothing to do with the relative value of 
 words in a sentence. It is what we may term arbitrary em- 
 phasis in contradistinction to logical emphasis. The two are 
 quite different. For instance, the logical expression of the 
 speech, " Away slight man," would not require the con- 
 temptuous tone which we naturally, or arbitrarily, bring to the 
 word " slight." The difference is that of sense and sentiment. 
 To emphasize logically is to give prominence to the word or 
 words in each sentence that most fully symbolize the writer's 
 thought in relation to the context. Invariably the subject or 
 picture-word should be conspicuous, as the other parts of 
 speech, like chess-men to the king, are only attendants.

 Made glorious summer by tliis sun of York."

 2. " Is it for thee the lark ascends and sings ? 
 Is it for thee the linnet ■pours his throat?" 
 
 Essay on Man. 
 
 XIX. Tone. — In the life of George Eliot we are told that "by 
 her subtle modulation of voice she was able to throw a glamour 
 over even indifferent composition.'' Mastery of the expression 
 oi feeling is one of the crowning graces of elocution. ^Nothing 
 can be more insipid than monotonous reading and speaking : 
 passionless, unanimated, unmodulated reading or speaking is 
 untrue to nature, and aggravating to the last degree. Make 
 the tone of the voice sympathize with all the fluctuations of 
 feeling you have to express, and as an exercise in tim,e, pitch, 
 and especially tone, practise Collins' perfect poem "The 
 Passions " till you get the transition in tone, from passion to 
 passion, faultless. 
 
 THE PASSIONS. 
 William Collins. 
 
 When Music, (heavenly maid 1) was youn^, ere yet in earliest Greece 
 she sung, the Passions oft, to hear her shell, thronged around her magic 
 cell: exulting,— tremblmg;— raging,— fainting; -possessed, beyond the

 Muse's minting. By turns, they felt the glowing mind disturbed,— 
 delighted,— raised, — refined ; till once, 'tis said, when all were fired, filled 
 with fury, rapt, inspired, from the supporting myrtles round they snatched 
 her instruments of sound ; and as they oft had heard, apart, sweet lessons 
 of her forceful art, each — for madness ruled the hour — would prove his 
 own expressive power. 
 
 First, Fear — his hand, its skiU to try, amid the chords bewildered laid — 
 and back recoiled— he knew not why : — even at the sound himself had 
 made I 
 
 Next Anger rushed, his eyes on fire : in lightnings owned his secret 
 stings ; with one rude clash he struck the lyre, and swept, with hurried 
 hands, the strings. 
 
 With woeful measures, wan Despair : — low, sullen sounds his grief be- 
 guiled ; a solemn, strange, and mingled air ; 'twas sad, by fits — by starts, 
 Tiwas wild. 
 
 But thou, Hope ! with eyes so fair, what was thy dehghted measm-e ? 
 Still it whispered promised pleasure, and bade the lovely scenes at dis- 
 tance " Hail 1 " Still would ner touch the strain prolong ; and, from the 
 rocks, the woods, the vale, she called on " Echo," still, through all her song ; 
 and, where her sweetest theme she chose, a soft, responsive voice was 
 heard at every close ! — and Hope, enchanted, smiled, and waved her 
 golden hair ! 
 
 And longer had she sung — ^but, with a frown, Revenge impatient rose : 
 he threw his blood-stained sword in thunder down ; and with a witherina 
 look, the war-denouncing trumpet took, and blew a blast— so loud and 
 dread, were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of woe ; and ever and anon, he 
 beat the doubhng drum, with furious heat. And though sometimes, each 
 dreary pause between, dejected Pity, at his sidOj her soul-subduing voice 
 applied, yet still he kept his wild unaltered mien ; while each strained 
 ball of sight — seemed bursting from his head. 
 
 Thy numbers. Jealousy, to nought were fixed ; sad proof of thy dis- 
 tressful state 1 Of differing themes the veering song was mixed ; and now, 
 it courted Love — now, raving, called on Hate. 
 
 With eyes upraised, as one inspired, pale Melancholy sat retired ; and 
 from her wild, sequestered seat, in notes by distance made more sweet, 
 poured, through the mellow horn, her pensive soul : and, dashing soft, 
 from rocks around, bubbling runnels joined the sound. Through glades 
 and glooms the mingled measure stole ; or, o'er some haunted stream, 
 with fond delay,— roimd a holy calm diffusingi love of peace and lonely 
 musing, — in hollow murmurs died away. 
 
 But, oh, how altered was its spriglitlier tone, when Cheerfulness — a 
 nymph of healthiest hue, — her bow across her .shoulder flung, her buskins 
 gemmed with morning dew, — blew an inspiring air, that dale and thicket 
 rung ; the hunter's call, to Faun and Dryad known. The oak-crowned 
 Sisters, and thek chaste-eyed Queen, Satyrs, and Sylvan Boys were seen 
 peeping from forth their alleys green : brown " Exercise " rejoiced to hear ; 
 and " Sport " leaped up, and seized his beechen spear. 
 
 Last, came Jofs ecstatic trial ; he, with viny crown advancing, first to 
 the lively pipe his hand addressed ; but soon he saw the brisk awakening 
 viol, whose sweet, entrancing voice he loved the best. They would have

 thought who heard the strain, they saw, in Tempi's vale, her native maids, 
 amid the festal-sounding shades to some unwearied minstrel dancing; 
 while, as his flying fingers kissed the strings, Love framed, with Mirth^ a 
 gay, fantastic round ; — loose were her tresses seen, her zone unbound ; — 
 and he, amidst his frolic play, as if he would the charming air repay, 
 shook thousand odours from his dewy wings. 
 
 XX. 3. Time, or the rate of utterance, may fall into many 
 degrees, but the three degrees of slow, moderate, and quick time 
 will serve our purpose. Little more can be said to the reader, 
 on this subject, than that the rate of speaking must in all cases 
 be governed by the spirit of the composition. 
 
 1. Slow. — " Slowly in all his splendours dight. 
 The great sun rises to behold the sight." 
 
 The Buildiiig of the Ship. 
 
 2. Moderate. — " The Fathers of the city 
 They sat aU night and day." — Horatius. 
 
 3. Quick. — "With one rude clasp he struck the lyre. 
 And swept with hurried hands the strings." 
 
 The Passions. 
 
 A keen perception of the opportunities of time-variation is a 
 rare gift in a public reader. The truly sensitive reader sees 
 innumerable chances for fine shades of time-change, and so 
 frees himself and his hearers from fatigue and a sense of 
 monotony. Much thought and experiment are necessary before 
 success is attained. 
 
 XXI. 4. Pitch. — We speak of a low, a medium, and a 
 high pitch of voice. 
 
 By a low pitch and a high, we mean those that can be pro- 
 duced easily, and, if need be, sustained. 
 
 The middle or conversational pitch should be that part of 
 the voice naturally strongest. All parts of the voice may be 
 beneficially exercised, but it is of moment that we cultivate 
 that register of voice peculiarly ours by nature. 
 
 il. High. — "The quality of mercy is not strained." 
 2. Middle. — "I am armed and well prepared." 
 3. Low.— "I have possessed your grace of what I pur- 
 pose."— TAe Merchant of Venice.

 XXII. Parenthesis. — 
 
 " And where thou now exacts the penalty (whidi is a pound of this 
 poor merchant's flesh), thou wilt not only lose the forfeiture," &c. 
 
 The word immediately preceding the parenthesis, and the 
 last word of the parenthesis, take the upward inflexion ] the 
 voice sinks a tone for the early part of the parenthesis, and 
 has quicker movement than for the rest of the sentence. It is 
 admissible (and some prefer) to raise the voice a tone for the 
 parenthesis instead of lowering it ; in that case the inflexions 
 alter thus, — • 
 
 " . . penalty ( flesh) . . , ." 
 
 Either way is natural, and in selections containing many par- 
 entheses it is best to vary the treatment. Hood's amusing 
 medley, "A Parental Ode to my Son," is the happiest paren- 
 thesis-exercise in literature. Mark the inflexions for your- 
 selves, and give special prominence to the last word of each 
 parenthesis. 
 
 A PARENTAL ODE TO MY SON. 
 
 Thomas Hood. 
 
 Thou happy, happy elf ! {but stop, — first let me kiss away that tear) 
 —thou tiny image of myself ! (my love, he's poking peas into his ear !) 
 thou merry, laughing sprite ! with spirits feather-hght, untouched by 
 sorrow, and unsoued by sin — (good heavens ! the child is swallowing a, pin !) 
 Thou little tricksy Puck ! with antic toys so funnily bestruck, li^t as 
 the singing-bird that wings the air — (the door I the door ! he^ tumble 
 down the stair !) thou darling of thy sire ! (why, Jane, he'U set hLs 
 pinafore a-f,re /) thou imp of mbth and joy ! in love's dear chain so strong 
 and bright a link, thou idol of thy parents— (drat the boy I there goes my 
 ink/) Thou cherub— but of earth ; fit i^layfellow for fays, by moonUght 
 pale, in harmless sport and mirth (that dog wUl bite him, if he puis its 
 tail !) Thou human humming-bee, extractiiig honey from every blossom 
 in the world that blows, singmg in youth's Elysium ever sunny (another 
 tumble ! that's his precious nose .'J Thy father's pride and hope 1 (he'll 
 break the mirror with that shipping-rope!) with pure heart newly 
 stamped from Natm-e's mint— (where did he learn that squint?) Thou 
 young domestic dove ! (he'll have that jug oflf, with another shove.') dear 
 nursling of the hymeneal nest 1 (are those torn clothes his best?) little

 epitome of man ! (he'll climb the table, that's his plan /) touched with the 
 beauteous tints of dawning life — (he's got a kfdfe !) Thou enviable being ! 
 no storms, no clouds, in tliy blue sky foreseeing ! play on, play on, my 
 elfin John ! toss the light ball — bestride the stick — (I knew so many cakes 
 would make him sick!) With fancies, buoyant as the thistle-down, 
 prompting the face grotesque and antic brisk, with many a lamb-Uke frisk 
 (he's got the scissors, snipping at your gown !) Thou pretty opening rose ! 
 (go to your mother, child, and wipe your nose/) balmy and breatliuig 
 music like the South (he really brings my heart into my mouth !) fresh as 
 the morn, and brilUant as its sta,r, — (I wish that window had an iron bar !) 
 Bold as the hawk, yet gentle as the dove, — (I tell you what, my love, I 
 cannot write unless he's sent above !) 
 
 XXIII. Series of Words and Phrases. — Words are sub- 
 ject to the same rules as phrases. 
 
 (a) Three words or three phrases have the upward inflexion 
 on the first and third, vrith a falling inflexion of the same 
 length on the second. 
 
 Example : (1) Words— Grood, Better, Best. 
 
 (2) Phrases— 
 
 " My lords, we are called upon as members of this 
 
 house, as men, as Christians, to protest against such 
 
 horrible barbarity." 
 
 (6) A series of four words or four phrases are usually in- 
 flected as two separate pairs would be — thus 
 
 Examples. (1.) " The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones, and all, 
 ere thou shalt lose for me one di'op of blood." 
 
 „ (2.) "We have petitioned, we have remonstrated, we have 
 
 supplicated, we have prostrated ourselves before the 
 thi-one." 
 


## p. (#42) #################################################

30 The Elements of Elocution. 
 
 XXIV. Simple Antithesis. — The rule is that words or 
 phrases in opposition require opposite inflexions. 
 
 Examples. (1.) " Cannon to right of them, cannon to left of them." 
 „ (2.) "This was your husband : here is your husband." 
 
 „ (3.) (Phrases) " Never here, forever there." 
 
 „ (4.) " The grappUng vigour and rough frown of war is cold 
 
 Lq amity and painted peace." 
 
 XXV. The Halt, or suggestive pause. — When skilfully 
 managed, a pause of this kind is very effective, but it can be 
 called little else than a subtle trick of elocution. 
 
 • ■?••■ 
 Examples. (1.) "Rashly importunate, gone to • " her 
 
 death." 
 
 ■?•-. 
 (2.) "How that red rain hath •• • '• made the 
 
 harvest grow. " 
 
 (3.) "He finds his fellow gmlty of . • '•. a skin 
 
 not coloured like his own." 
 
 XXVI. The Climax.— In the three examples following, 
 the voice steps up, as it were, till the summit of the sentence 
 is reached. Always arrange to be on a sufficiently low pitch 
 before you commence an important expanding climax. 
 
 (1-) "■ . • . But, were I Brutus, 
 
 And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony 
 
 Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue 
 
 In every wound of Cjesar, that should move 
 
 The stones of Rome to rise and nm.tmj."—Shakspere.

 (2. ) " That principle, which neither tlie rudeness of ignorance can stifle, 
 nor the enervation of refinement extinguish— that principle which 
 makes it base for a man to siiflfer, when he ought to act — which, 
 tending to preserve to the species the original designations of 
 Providence, spurns at the arrogant distinctions of man, and vindi- 
 cates the independent quality of his race." — Sheridan. 
 
 (3.) " And now with shouts and clapping, 
 
 And noise of weeping loud, 
 He enters through the river gate, 
 Borne by the joyous crowd." — Macaulay. 
 
 GESTURE. 
 
 XXVII. Any attempt to fully explain the principles of 
 gesture without actual demonstration would be futile. A 
 living instructor of taste and experience will be of far greater 
 service than books. A general consideration of the subject 
 may, however, aid those who are out of the reach of tutors. 
 
 Almost all literature, to be naturally recited, requires the 
 accompaniment of gesture, with this restriction, that the 
 movement shall in some way assist and not overwhelm the 
 sense. Indiscriminate gesture, obviously used for display, is a 
 lamentable degradation of art; suited to the pantomimic 
 actor, but utterly unworthy an exponent of the world's master 
 minds. 
 
 The gesture to be acquired is elegant and appropriate, not 
 angular and accidental. 
 
 Graceful movement depends upon, — 
 
 (a) The arms being extended from the shoulder first, and not 
 
 the elbow. 
 (6) The hands depending loosely from the wrists till full 
 
 extension of the arms. 
 
 (c) The fingers being shaped and moved with a definite 
 
 purpose. 
 
 (d) The outward bending of the elbows (on the return of 
 
 the arms) to allow an easy curve to the position of 
 repose.

 VOCAL EXERCISES. 
 
 XXVIII. Voice development : 
 
 (1) Breathing Exercise. Take a deep breath ; count aloud np to 30 at 
 moderate speed, controlling the emission of breath by the lower chest 
 muscles. Practise for 15 minutes daily, gradually increasing the number 
 till you can easily count 80. Or, by way of change, speak these two 
 verses slowly in one breath. 
 
 " The shades of night were faUing fast. 
 As, tluough an Alpine village, passed 
 A youth, who bore, 'mid snow and ice, 
 A banner with the strange device, 
 
 " Excelsior ! " 
 
 His brow was sad ; his eye beneath 
 Flashed like a falchion from its sheath ; 
 And like a silver clarion rung 
 The accents of that unknown tongue, 
 
 " Excelsior ! " 
 
 (2) (a) Sing up the scale, in the lowest part of the voice, say from 
 
 : KOO, KOO, KOO, KOO, KOO. 
 
 Sing in the middle voice, say from & : AH, AH, AH, AH, AH. 
 Sing in the highest voice, say from E : AI, AI, AI, AI, AI. 
 (J) Now sing : 00, 00, 00, 0, : AH, AH, AH, AH, AH : 
 
 TjiTli Tj'Iji 1717 "UT? "CT? 
 i!ji^, Jujl2J, JliJ^, ElEl^ ElEl. 
 
 Take a short breath for each tone. 
 
 The mouth should be weU opened, and the tongue kept almost flat, the 
 tip touching the lower teeth inside. 
 
 Throw the voice well forward. 
 
 XXIX. Elocutionaey. 
 
 3) The Sibilant, S. Practise the following — 
 (1) " He is a very serpent in my way.'' 
 (2j " Would'st thou have a serpent sting thee twice ? " 
 (3) " .50 service shall with steeled sinews toil. 
 To do your grace incessant .services." 
 
 ( Shakspere.)

 (4) The Labials : P. Pi-aise, pabulum, patter, pepper, penny, pester. 
 
 B. Beauty, bonny, bright, breast, beat, bend. 
 M. Member, much, mentor, might, mystic. 
 
 (5) Syllabimoation : intercommunicability, incomprehensibility lati- 
 tudmarianism, transcendentalism, transubstantiation. ' 
 
 XXX. The Orotund, or round full voice, is produced 
 in the high arch of the mouth, close by the soft palate : it is 
 most suitable for dignified and impressive poetry and eloquence, 
 and should be cultivated by every ambitious reader. 
 
 ExAMPiES. ( A) " Danger knows full well that Caesar is more dangerous 
 than he." 
 (B) "Of man's first disobedience, and the fruits of that 
 forbidden tree, whose mortal taste brought death 
 into this world .... sing heavenly Muse," 
 (b) "The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces, the 
 solemn temples, the great globe itself, yea, all 
 which it inherit — shall dissolve." 
 
 A word, in conclusion, with regard to the readings and 
 recitations that make up the second half of this volume. 
 Farther than grouping them in their natural order, no ex- 
 planations or marks have been added to assist the reader, as 
 the plan and illustrations given in Part I. will make clear the 
 method of interpretation to be pursued. 
 
 All the selections have literary merit and fitness for popular 
 uses, but the scenes from Shakspere's plays are unquestionably 
 best adapted, ia every way, to the needs of beginners. They 
 are the richest exercises for mind, memory, and voice, even if 
 the depths of the Dramatist's purposes cannot always be 
 fathomed at first. 
 
 Several poems appear here in prose form, to quicken the 
 elementary student's apprehension of the sense, and to free 
 him from, or help him to escape, that sing-song style so often 
 induced by rhyme.

 And little bless'd with the set phrase of peace ; 
 For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith. 
 Till now some nine moons wasted, they have us'd 
 Their dearest action in the tented field ; 
 And little of this great world can I speak, 
 More than pertaius to feats of broil and battle ; 
 And therefore little shall I grace my cause,

 Of my whole course of love ; what drugs, what charms. 
 What conjuration, and what mighty magic,

 Of spirits so still and quiet, that her motion 
 Blush'd at herself. And she, — in spite of nature.

 To fall in love with what she feared to look on ?

 It is a judgment maim'd, and most imperfect, 
 That will confess — perfection so could err 
 Against all rules of nature, and must be dri\"on 
 To find out practices of cunning hell, 
 Why should this be. I therefore vouch again. 
 That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood, 
 Or with some dram conjur'd to this effect, 
 He wrought upon her. 
 
 Buke. To vouch this, is no proof ; 
 
 Without more certain and more overt test. 
 Than these thin habits, and poor likelihoods 
 Of modern seeming, do prefer against him. 
 
 \st Sen. But, Othello, speak ; — 
 Did you by indirect or forced courses 
 Subdue and poison this young maid's affections ? 
 Or came it by request, and su.ch fair question 
 As soul to soul affordeth ? 
 
 0th. I do beseech you. 
 
 Send for the lady to the Sagittary, 
 And let her speak of me before her father : 
 If you do find me foul on her report. 
 The trust, the oiEce, I do hold of you. 
 Not only take away, but let your sentence 
 Even fall upon my life. 
 
 Duke. Fetch Desdemona hither. 
 
 Oih. Ancient, conduct them ; you best know the place — 
 
 [Exeunt lago, and Attendants, 
 And, till she come, as truly as to heaven 
 I do confess the vices of my blood, 
 So justly to your grave ears I'll present 
 How I did thrive in this fair lady's love, 
 And she in mine. 
 
 Duke. Say it, Othello. 
 
 0th. Her father lov'd me ; oft invited me ; 
 StUl question'd me the story of my life, 
 From year to year ; the battles, sieges, fortunes. 
 That I have pass'd. 
 
 I ran it through, even from my boyish days, 
 To the very moment that he bade me tell it. 
 Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances.

 Of moving accidents, by flood and field ; 
 
 Of hair-breadth 'scapes in the imminent deadly breach ; 
 
 Of being taken by the insolent foe, 
 
 And sold to slavery ; of my redemption thence. 
 
 And portance in my travel's, history ; 
 
 Wherein of antres vast, and desarts idle. 
 
 Rough quarries, rocks, and hiUs whose heads touch heaven. 
 
 It was my hint to speak, such was the process ; 
 
 And of the Cannibals that each other eat, 
 
 The Anthropophagi, and men whose heads 
 
 Do grow beneath their shoulders. These things to hear, 
 
 Would Desdemona seriously incline : 
 
 But still the house affairs would draw her thence ; 
 
 Which ever as she could with haste despatch. 
 
 She'd come again, and with a greedy ear 
 
 Devour up my discourse. Which I observing. 
 
 Took once a pliant hour ; and found good means 
 
 To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart. 
 
 That I would all my pilgrimage dilate, 
 
 Whereof by parcels she had something heard. 
 
 But not intentively. I did consent ; 
 
 And often did beguile her of her tears, 
 
 When I did speak of some distressful stroke 
 
 That my youth suffer'd. My story being done, 
 
 She gave me for my pains a world of sighs ; 
 
 She swore, — In faith, 'twas strange, 'twas passing strange ; 
 
 'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful : 
 
 She wish'd she had not heard it ; yet she wish'd 
 
 That heaven had made her such a man : she thanked me ; 
 
 And bade me, if I had a friend that lov'd her, 
 
 I should but teach him how to tell my story, 
 
 And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake ; 
 
 She lov'd me for the dangers I had passed ; 
 
 And I loved her, that she did pity them. 
 
 This only is the witchcraft I have us'd ; 
 
 Here comes the lady, let her witness it.

 The Merchant of Venice. 
 
 Scene — Venice. A Court of Justice. 
 
 Duke. What, is Antonio here ? 
 
 Ant. Ready, so please your grace. 
 
 Duhe. I am sorry for thee : thou art come to answer 
 A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch, 
 TTncapable of pity, void and empty 
 From any dram of mercy. 
 
 Ant. I have heard 
 
 Your grace hath ta'en great pains to quaUfy 
 His rigorous course ; but since he stands obdurate. 
 And that no lawful means can carry me 
 Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose 
 My patience to his fury, and am armed 
 To suffer, with a quietness of spirit. 
 The very tyranny and rage of his. 
 
 Duke. Go one, and call the Jew into the court. 
 
 Solan. He is ready at the door : he comes, my lord. 
 
 Enter Shylock. 
 
 Duke. Make room, and let him stand before our face.- 
 Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too. 
 That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy maHce 
 To the last hour of act ; and then, 'tis thought, 
 Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange 
 Than is thy strange apparent cruelty : 
 We all expect a gentle answer, Jew. 
 
 Shy. I have possessed your grace of what I purpose ; 
 And by our holy sabbath have I sworn 
 To have the due and forfeit of my bond : 
 If you deny it, let the danger light 
 Upon your charter and your city's freedom. 
 You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have 
 A weight of carrion flesh, than to receive 
 Three thousand ducats : I'U not answer that ; 
 But say it is my humour : is it answered ? 
 
 Bass. This is no answer, thou unfeeling man, 
 To excuse the current of thy cruelty. 
 
 Shy. I am not bound to please thee with my answer.

 Bass. Do all men kill the things they do not love ? 
 
 Shy. Hates any man the thing he would not kill ! 
 
 Bass. Every offence is not a hate at first. 
 
 Shy. What ! would'st thou have a serpent sting thee twice 1 
 
 Ant. I pray you, think you question with the Jew : 
 You may as well go stand upon the beach, 
 And bid the main flood bate his usual height ; 
 You may as well use question with the wolf, 
 Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb ; 
 You may as well forbid the mountain pines 
 To wag their high tops, and to make no noise, 
 When they are fretted with the gusts of heaven ; 
 You may as well do anything most hard, 
 As seek to soften that — than which what's harder ?— 
 His Jewish heart : therefore, I do beseech you, 
 Make no more offers, use no further means. 
 But with all brief and plain conveniency 
 Let me have judgment, and the Jew his will. 
 
 Bass. Por thy three thousand ducats, here is six. 
 
 Shy. If every ducat in six thousand ducats 
 Were in six parts, and every part a ducat, 
 I would not draw them ; I would have my bond. 
 
 Duhe. How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none ? 
 
 Shy. What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong ? 
 The pound of flesh, which I demand of him, 
 Is dearly bought ; 'tis mine, and I will have it. 
 If you deny me, fie upon your law ! 
 There is no force in the decrees of Venice. 
 I stand for judgment : answer, shall I have it ? 
 
 Duke. Upon my power I may dismiss this court. 
 Unless Bellario, a learned doctor, 
 Whom I have sent for to determine this. 
 Come here to-day. 
 
 Solan. My lord, here stays without 
 
 A messenger with letters from the doctor, 
 New come from Padua. 
 
 Duhe. Bring us the letters ; call the messenger. 
 
 Enter Neeissa. 
 Duke. Came you from Padua, from Bellario ?

 Ner. From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace. 
 
 \Presenting a letter. 
 
 Bass. Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly ? 
 
 Shy. To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there. 
 
 Duke. This letter from Bellario doth commend 
 A young and learnfed doctor to our court. 
 Where is he ? 
 
 Ner. He attendeth here hard by, 
 
 To know your answer, whether you'll admit him. 
 
 Duke. With all my heart. — Some three or four of you, 
 Go give him courteous conduct to this place. 
 
 Enter Portia. 
 
 Give me your hand : Came you from old Bellario ? 
 
 For. I did, my lord. 
 
 Duke. You are welcome : take your placa 
 
 Are you acquainted with the difference 
 That holds this present question in the court ? 
 
 For. I am informed throughly of the cause. 
 Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew ? 
 
 Duke. Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth. 
 
 For. Is your name Shylock ? 
 
 Shy. Shylock is my name. 
 
 For. Of a strange nature is the suit you follow ; 
 Yet in such rule, that the Venetian law 
 Cannot impugn you, as you do proceed. — 
 You stand within his danger, do you not 1 [To A ntonio. 
 
 Ant. Ay, so he says. 
 
 For. Do you confess the bond ? 
 
 Ant. I do. 
 
 For. Then must the Jew be merciful. 
 
 Shy. On what compulsion must I ? tell me that. 
 
 For. The quality of mercy is not strain'd ; 
 It droppeth, as the gentle rain from heaven. 
 Upon the place beneath : it is twice bless'd ; 
 It blesseth him that gives and him that takes : 
 'Tis mightiest in the mightiest ; it becomes 
 The throned monarch better than his crown ; 
 His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,

 The attribute to awe and majesty, 
 
 Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings ; 
 
 But mercy is above this sceptr'd sway, 
 
 It is enthroned in the hearts of kings, 
 
 It is an attribute to God himself ; 
 
 And earthly power doth then show likest God's, 
 
 When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew, 
 
 Though justice be thy plea, consider this — 
 
 That in the course of justice, none of us 
 
 Should see salvation : we do pray for mercy ; 
 
 And that same prayer doth teach us all to render 
 
 The deeds of mercy. I have spoken thus much 
 
 To mitigate the justice of thy plea ; 
 
 Which, if thou foUow, this strict court of Venice 
 
 Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there. 
 
 Shy. My deeds upon my head ! I crave the law, 
 The penalty and forfeit of my bond. 
 
 Pot. Is he not able to discharge the money ? 
 
 Bass. Yes, here I tender it for him in the court ; 
 Yea, twice the sum : if that will not suffice, 
 I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er. 
 On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart ; 
 If this will not suffice, it must appear 
 That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you, 
 Wrest once the law to your authority ; 
 To do a great right do a little wrong ; 
 And curb this cruel devil of his will. 
 
 Por. It must not be ; there is no power in Venice 
 Can alter a decree established : 
 'Twill be recorded for a precedent ; 
 And many an error, by the same example. 
 Will rush into the state : it cannot be. 
 
 Shy. A Daniel come to judgment ! yea, a Daniel ! 
 O wise young judge, how do I honour thee ! 
 
 Por. I pray you, let me look upon the bond. 
 
 Shy. Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is. 
 
 Por. Shylock, there's thrice thy money offered thee. 
 
 Shy. An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven : 
 Shall I lay perjury upon my soul ? 
 No, not for Venice.

 For. Why, this bond is forfeit ; 
 
 And lawfully by this the Jew may claim 
 A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off 
 Nearest the merchant's heart. — Be merciful : 
 Take thrice thy money ; bid me tear the bond. 
 
 Shy. When it is paid according to the tenour. — 
 It doth appear you are a worthy judge ; 
 You know the law, your exposition 
 Hath been most sound : I charge you by the law, 
 Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar. 
 Proceed to judgment : — by my soul, I swear 
 There is no power in the tongue of man 
 To alter me : I stay here on my bond. 
 
 Ant. Most heartily I do beseech the court 
 To give the judgment. 
 
 For. Why then, thus it is : 
 
 You must prepare your bosom for his knife — 
 
 Shy. O noble judge ! O excellent young man ! 
 
 For. For the intent and purpose of the law 
 Hath full relation to the penalty. 
 Which here appeareth due upon the bond — 
 
 Shy. 'Tis very true : O wise and upright judge ! 
 How much more elder art thou than thy looks ! 
 
 For. Therefore lay bare your bosom. 
 
 Shy. Ay, his breast : 
 
 So says the bond ; — doth it not, noble judge ? — 
 " Nearest his heart : " those are the very words. 
 
 For. It is so. Are there balance here to weigh 
 The flesh? 
 
 Shy. I have them ready. 
 
 For. Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge, 
 To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death. 
 
 Shy. Is it so nominated in the bond ? 
 
 For. It is not so expressed : but what of that ? 
 'Twere good you do so much for charity. 
 
 Shy. I cannot find it ; 'tis not in the bond. 
 
 For. You, merchant, have you anything to say? 
 
 Ant. But little ; I am armed and well prepared. — 
 Give me your hand, Bassanio : fare you well ! 
 Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you ;

 For herein Fortune shows herself more kind 
 
 Than is her custom : it is still her use, 
 
 To let the wretched man outlive his wealth, 
 
 To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow 
 
 An age of poverty ; from which lingering penance 
 
 Of such misery doth she cut me off. 
 
 Commend me to your honourable wife : 
 
 Tell her the process of Antonio's end ; 
 
 Say how I lov'd you, speak me fair in death ; 
 
 And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge. 
 
 Whether Bassanio had not once a love. 
 
 Repent not you that you shall lose your friend. 
 
 And he repents not that he pays your debt ; 
 
 For, if the Jew do cut but deep enough, 
 
 I'll pay it presently with all my heart. 
 
 Bass. Antonio, I am married to a wife 
 Which is as dear to me as Hf e itself ; 
 But life itself, my wife, and all the world. 
 Are not with me esteem'd above thy life : 
 I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all 
 Here to this devU, to deliver you. 
 
 For. Your wife would give you httle thanks for that. 
 If she were by, to hear you make the offer. 
 
 Gra. I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love : 
 I would she were in heaven, so she could 
 Entreat some power to change this currish Jew. 
 
 Ner. 'Tis well you offer it behind her back ; 
 The wish would make else an unquiet house. 
 
 Shy. \Asid6i\ These be the Christian husbands ! I have a 
 daughter ; 
 Would any of the stock of Barrabas 
 Had been her husband, rather than a Christian ! 
 \Aloud?^ We trifle time : I pray thee, pursue sentence. 
 
 For. A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine ; 
 The court awards it, and the law doth give it. 
 
 Shy. Most rightful judge ! 
 
 Por. And you must cut this flesh from off his breast ; 
 The law allows it, and the court awards it. 
 
 Shy. Most learned judge ! — A sentence ; come, prepare. 
 
 Por. Tarry a little ; — there is something else. —

 This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood ; 
 
 The words expressly are, a pound of flesh : 
 
 Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh, 
 
 But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed 
 
 One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods 
 
 Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate 
 
 Unto the state of Venice. 
 
 Gra. O uprigljt judge ! — Mark, Jew ; O learnfed judge ! 
 
 Shy. Is that the law ? 
 
 For. Thyself shall see the act ; 
 
 For, as thou urgest justice, be assur'd 
 Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desir'st. 
 
 Gra. O learned judge ! — Mark, Jew ; — a learnfed judge ! 
 
 Shy. I take this offer then, — pay the bond thrice, 
 And let the Christian go. 
 
 Bass. Here is the money. 
 
 For. Soft; 
 The Jew shall have all justice ; — soft ; — no haste ; — 
 He shall have nothing but the penalty. 
 
 Gra. O Jew ! an upright judge, a learned judge. 
 
 For. Therefore, prepare thee to cut off the iiesh. 
 Shed thou no blood ; nor cut thou less, nor more. 
 But just a pound of flesh : if thou tak'st more 
 Or less than a just pound, — be it but so much 
 As makes it light, or heavy, in the substance, 
 Or the division of the twentieth part 
 Of one poor scruple : nay, if the scale do turn 
 But in the estimation of a hair, — 
 Thou diest, and all thy goods are confiscate. 
 
 Gra. A second Daniel ! a Daniel, Jew ! 
 Now, infidel, I have thee on the hip. 
 
 For. Why doth the Jew pause ? take thy forfeiture. 
 
 Shy. Give me my principal, and let me go. 
 
 Bass. I have it ready for thee ; here it is. 
 
 For. He hath refus'd it in the open court : 
 He shaU have merely justice, and his bond. 
 
 Gra. A Daniel, stUl say I ; a second Daniel ! 
 
 I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word. 
 
 Shy. Shall I not have barely my principal ? 
 
 For. Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture

 To be so taken at thy peril, Jew. 
 
 &hy. Why, then the devil give him good of it ! 
 I'll stay no longer question. 
 
 For. Tarry, Jew : 
 
 The law hath yet another hold on you. 
 It is enacted in the laws of Venice, — 
 If it be prov'd against an alien 
 That by direct or indirect attempts 
 He seek the life of any citizen. 
 The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive 
 Shall seize one half his goods ; the other half 
 Comes to the privy coffer of the state ; 
 And the offender's life lies in the mercy 
 Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice. 
 In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st ; 
 Por it appears, by manifest proceeding, 
 That indirectly, and directly too, 
 Thou hast contriv'd against the very Hfe 
 Of the defendant ; and thou hast incurr'd 
 The danger formerly by me rehears'd. 
 Down, therefore, and beg mercy of the duke. 
 
 Gra. Beg that thou may'st have leave to hang thyself : 
 And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state. 
 Thou hast not left the value of a cord ; 
 Therefore, thou must be hang'd at the state's charge. 
 
 Duke. That thou shalt see the difference of our spirit, 
 I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it : 
 For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's ; 
 The other half conies to the general state, 
 WMch humbleness may drive into a fine. 
 
 Pw. Ay, for the state, — not for Antonio. 
 
 Shy. I^ay, take my life and all ; pardon not that : 
 You take my house, when you do take the prop 
 That doth sustain my house : you take my Hfe, 
 When you do take the means whereby I live. 
 
 Por. What mercy can you render him, Antonio ? 
 
 Gra. A halter gratis ; nothing else, for Heaven's sake. 
 
 Ant. So please my lord the duke, and all the court. 
 To quit the fine for one half of his goods ; 
 I am content, so he will let me have

 The other half in use, to render it, 
 
 Upon his death, unto the gentleman 
 
 That lately stole his daughter : 
 
 Two things provided more, — that, for this favour, 
 
 He presently become a Christian ; 
 
 The other, that he do record a gift. 
 
 Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd. 
 
 Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter. 
 
 Buhe. He shall do this ; or else I do recant 
 The pardon that I late pronouncfed here. 
 
 For. Art thou contented, Jew ? what dost thou say ? 
 
 Shy. I am content. 
 
 For. Clerk, draw a deed of gift. 
 
 Shy. I pray you give me leave to go from hence ; 
 I am not well : send the deed after me, 
 And I will sign it. 
 
 Duke. Get thee gone, but do it. 
 
 Gra. In christening shalt thou have two godfathers : 
 Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more. 
 To bring thee to the gallows, not the font. 
 
 \Exit Shylock. 
 
 Buhe. Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner. 
 
 For. I humbly do desire your grace of pardon : 
 I must away this night toward Padua, 
 And it is meet I presently set forth. 
 
 Buke. I am sorry that your leisure serves you not. 
 Antonio, gratify this gentleman ; 
 For, in my mind, you are much bound to him. 
 
 \Exeunt Buke, Magnificoes, and train.

 Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted 
 Of grievous penalties, in lieu whereof. 
 Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew, 
 We freely cope your courteous pains withal.

 In love and service to you evermore.

 Cal. What mean you, Csesar ? think you to walk forth ? 
 You shall not stir out of your house to-day.

 Ne'er looked but on my back : when they shall see 
 The face of Csesar, they are vanished. 
 
 Gal. Csesar, I never stood on ceremonies, 
 Yet now they fright me. There is one within, 
 Besides the things that we have heard and seen. 
 Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch. 
 A lioness hath whelped in the streets ; 
 And graves hath yawned, and yielded up their dead ; 
 Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds. 
 In ranks, and squadrons, and right form of war, 
 Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol ; 
 The noise of battle hurtled in the air. 
 Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan. 
 And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets. 
 O Csesar ! these things are beyond all use. 
 And I do fear them.

 Yet Csesar shall go forth ; for these predictions 
 Are to the world in general as to Caasar. 
 
 Gal. When beggars die there are no comets seen ; 
 The heavens themselves blaze. forth the death of princes. 
 
 Goes. Cowards die many times before their deaths ; 
 The valiant never taste of death but once. 
 Of all the wonders that I yet have heard, 
 It seems to me most strange that men should fear ; 
 Seeing that death, a necessary end, 
 Will come when it will come. — 
 
 Re-enter Servant. 
 
 What say the augurers ? 
 
 Serv. They would not have you to stir forth to-day. 
 Plucking the entrails of an offering forth. 
 They could not find a heart within the beast. 
 
 Gees. The gods do this in shame of cowardice : 
 Cassar should be a beast without a heart. 
 If he should stay at home to-day for fear. 
 No, Csesar shall not : Danger knows full well 
 That Caesar is more dangerous than he. 
 We are two lions littered in one day, 
 And I the elder and more terrible ; 
 And Csesar shall go forth. 
 
 Gal. Alas, my lord, 
 
 Your wisdom is consumed in confidence. 
 Do not go forth to-day : call it my fear 
 That keeps you in the house, and not your own. 
 We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house ; 
 And he shall say you are not well to-day : 
 Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this. 
 
 Gees. Mark Aiitony shall say I am not well ; 
 And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.

 To bear my greeting to the senators, 
 And tell them that I will not come to-day. 
 Cannot, is false ; and that I dare not, falser ; 
 I will not come to-day : tell them so, Decius. 
 
 Gal. Say he is sick. 
 
 Gees. Shall Csesar send a He ? 
 
 Have I in conquest stretched mine arm so far. 
 To be afeard to tell graybeards the truth ? — 
 Decius, go tell them Csesar will not come. 
 
 Dec. Most mighty Csesar, let me know some cause. 
 Lest I be laughed at when I tell them so. 
 
 GcBS. The cause is in my will : I will not come ; 
 That is enough to satisfy the senate. 
 But for your private satisfaction, 
 Because I love you, I will let you know. 
 Calpurnia, here, my wife, stays me at home : 
 She dreamt to-night she saw my statua, 
 Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts, 
 Did run pure blood ; and many lusty Romans 
 Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it : 
 And these does she apply for warnings, and portents, 
 And evils imminent ; and on her knee 
 Hath begged that I will stay at home to-day. 
 
 Dec. This dream is all amiss interpreted ; 
 It was a vision fair and fortunate : 
 Your statue spouting blood in many pipes. 
 In which so many smiling Romans bathed, 
 Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck 
 Reviving blood ; and that great men shall press 
 For tinctures, stains, relics, eind cognizance.

 To give this day a crown to mighty Csesar.

 " Lo, Caesar is afraid " ? 
 Pardon me, Caesar ; for my dear, dear love

 Enter Brutus and Cassius, and a throng of Citizens.

 Cassius, go you into the other street, 
 And part the numbers. —

 And public reasons shall be rendered 
 Of Caesar's death.

 be silent, that you may hear : believe me for mine honour, 
 and have respect to mine honour, that you may believe : cen- 
 sure me in your wisdom, and awake your senses, that you may 
 the better judge. If there be any in this assembly, any dear 
 friend of Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar was 
 no less than his. If then that friend demand why Brutus 
 rose against Osesar, this is my answer : Not that I loved Caesar 
 less, but that I loved Rome more. Had you rather Osesar 
 were living, and die all slaves ; than that Caesar were dead, to

 live all free men. ? As Osesar loved me, I weep for him ; as he 
 was fortunate, I rejoice at it ; as he was valiant, I honour 
 him ; but as he was ambitious, I slew him. There is tears for 
 his love ; joy for his fortune \ honour for his valour ; and 
 death for his ambition. Who is here so base that would be a 
 bondman ? If any, speak ; for him have I oflfended. Who is 
 here so rude that would not be a Roman ? If any, speak ; for 
 him have I oifended. Who is here so vile that will not love 
 his country 1 If any, speak ; for him have I offended. I 
 pause for a reply. 
 
 All. None, Brutus, none. 
 
 Bru. Then none have I offended, I have done no more to 
 Csesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of his death 
 is enrolled in the Capitol : his glory not extenuated, wherein 
 he was worthy ; nor his offences enforced, for which he suffered 
 death. 
 
 Enter Antony and others, with Caesar's body. 
 
 Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony : who, though 
 he had no hand in his death, shall receive the benefit of his 
 dying, a place in the commonwealth ; as which of you shall 
 not ? With this I depart, — That, as I slew my best lover for 
 the good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself, when it 
 shall please my country to need my death.

 With shouts and clamours.

 B'TU. Good countrymen, let me depart alone ; 
 And, for my sake, stay here with Antony : 
 Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech 
 Tending to Caesar's glories ; which Mark Antony, 
 By our permission, is allowed to make.

 He finds himself beholding to us all.

 1st Git. This Csesar was a tyrant.

 We are blest that Rome is rid of him. 
 
 2nd Git. Peace ! let us hear what Antony can say. 
 
 Ant. You gentle Romans,

 Ant. Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears : 
 I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him. 
 The evil that men do lives after them ; 
 The good is oft interred with their bones : 
 So let it be with Csesar. The noble Brutus 
 Hath told you, Csesar was ambitious : 
 If it were so, it was a grievous fault, 
 And grievously hath Csesar answer'd it. 
 Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest, 
 (For Brutus is an honourable man ; 
 So are they all, aU honourable men,) 
 Come I to speak in Csesar's funeral. 
 He was my friend, faithful and just to me : 
 But Brutus says, he was ambitious ; 
 And Brutus is an honourable man. 
 He hath brought many captives home to Rome, 
 Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill : 
 Did this in Csesar seem ambitious ? 
 When that the poor have cried, Csesar hath wept : 
 Ambition should be made of sterner stuff : 
 Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious ; 
 And Brutus is an honourable man.

 And none so poor to do him reverence.

 To wrong the dead, to wrong myself, and you, 
 Than I will wrong such honourable men. 
 But here's a parchment with the seal of Csesar, 
 I found it in his closet ; 'tis his will : 
 Let but the commons hear this testament, 
 (Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read,)

 See what a rent the envious Oasca made : 
 
 Through this the well-belovM Brutus stabb'd ; 
 
 And, as he pluck'd his cursfed steel away, 
 
 Mark how the blood of Csesar followed it. 
 
 As rushing out of doors, to be resolv'd 
 
 If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no ; 
 
 Tor Brutus, as you know, was Csesar's angel : 
 
 Judge, O you gods, how dearly Csesar lov'd him ! 
 
 This was the most unkindest cut of aU ; 
 
 For when the noble Caesar saw him stab. 
 
 Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms, 
 
 Quite vanquish'd him : then burst his mighty heart ; 
 
 And, in his mantle muffling up his face, 
 
 Even at the base of Pompey's statua, 
 
 Which aU the while ran blood, great Csesar fell. 
 
 O, what a fall was there, my countrymen \ 
 
 Then I, and you, and all of us fell down, 
 
 WhUst bloody treason flourish'd over us. 
 
 O, now you weep ; and, I perceive, you feel 
 
 The dint of pity : these are gracious drops.

 What private griefs they have, alas, I know not, 
 That made them do it ; they are wise and honourable.

 I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts : 
 
 I am no orator, as Brutus is ; 
 
 But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man, 
 
 That love my friend ; and that they know full well 
 
 That gave me public leave to speak of him : 
 
 For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth. 
 
 Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech. 
 
 To stir men's blood : I only speak right on ; 
 
 I tell you that which you yourselves do know ; 
 
 Show you sweet Ca;sar's wounds, poor, poor dumb mouths, 
 
 And bid them, speak for me : but were I Brutus, 
 
 And Brutus Antony, there were an Ajitony 
 
 Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue

 For taking bribes here of the Sardians ; 
 Wherein my letters, praying on his side. 
 Because I knew the man, were slighted ofi'.

 And chastisement doth therefore liide his head.

 Be angry when you will, it shall have scope ; 
 Do what you will, dishonour shall be honour. 
 O Cassius, you are yokfed with a lamb 
 That carries anger as the flint bears fire ; 
 Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark.

 Have you consider'd of my speeches ? "Know, 
 That it was he, in the times past, which held you 
 So under fortune ; wliich, you thought, had been 
 Our innocent self : this I made good to you 
 In our last conference ; pass'd in probation with you. 
 How you were borne in hand ; how cross'd ; the instruments ; 
 Who wrought with them ; and all things else, that might. 
 To half a soul, and to a notion craz'd. 
 Say, Thus did Banquo. 
 
 \st Mur. You made it known to us. 
 
 Macb. I did so ; and went further, which is now 
 Our point of second meeting. Do you find 
 Your patience so predominant in your nature, 
 That you can let this go ? Are you so gospell'd, 
 To pray for this good man, and for his issue. 
 Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave. 
 And beggar'd yours for ever ? 
 
 \st Mur. We are men, my liege. 
 
 Macb. Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men ; 
 As hounds, and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs, 
 Shoughs, water-rugs, and demi-wolves, are cleped 
 All by the name of dogs : the valued file 
 Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle, 
 The housekeeper, the hunter, every one 
 Accordiag to the gift which bounteous nature 
 Hath in him clos'd ; whereby he does receive 
 Particular addition, from the bill

 Not in the worst rank of manhood, say 't ;

 That every minute of his being thrusts 
 Against my near'st of life : And though I could 
 With bare-fac'd power sweep him from my sight. 
 And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not. 
 For certain friends that are both his and mine. 
 Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall

 That I to your assistance do make love ;

 Prince H. Welcome, Jack : where hast thou been ? 
 
 Falstaff. A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance 
 too ! Marry, and amen ! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I 
 lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks, and mend them, and 
 foot them too. A plague of all cowards ! Give me a cup of 
 sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant 1 
 
 Prince H. Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter ? 
 pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale of the sun ! 
 If thou didst, then behold that compound. 
 
 Falstaff. You rogue, here's lime in this sack, too ! — there is 
 nothing but roguery to be found in villainous man ; yet a 
 coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime in it : a villainous 
 coward ! Go thy ways, old Jack ; die when thou wilt, if man- 
 hood, good manhood, be not forgot upon the face of the earth, 
 then am I a shotten herring. There Hve not three good men 
 unhanged in England, and one of them is fat and grows old. 
 A bad world I say ! — I would I were a weaver ; I could sing 
 psalms, or any thing. A plague of all cowards, I say stiU. 
 
 Prince H. How now, woolsack ! what mutter you ? 
 
 Falstaff. A king's son ! If I do not beat thee out of thy 
 kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy subjects before 
 me like a flock of wild geese, I'll never wear hair on my face 
 more. You Prince of Wales !

 Falstaff. What's the matter! There be four of us have 
 ta'en a thousand pounds this morning. 
 
 Prince H. Where is it. Jack 2 Where is it 1 
 
 Falstaff. Where is it! Taken from us it is : a hundred 
 upon four of us. 
 
 Prince H. What ! a hundred, man ? 
 
 Falstaff. I am a rogue if I were not at half-sword with a 
 dozen of them, two hours together. I have escaped by miracle. 
 I am eight times thrust through the doublet, four through the 
 hose ; my buckler cut through and through ; my sword hacked 
 like a hand-saw, ecce signuni. I never dealt better siace I was 
 a man I AU would not do. A plague of all cowards ! 
 
 Prince H. Speak, Jack ; how was it ? 
 
 Falstaff. Four of us set upon some dozen, and bound them 
 — every man of them ; and as we were sharing, some six or 
 seven fresh men set upon us, and unbound the rest ; and then 
 came in the others. 
 
 Prince H. What ! fought ye with them all ? 
 
 Falstaff. All ! I know not what you call all ; but if I fought 
 not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish ; if there were 
 not two or three-and-fifty upon poor old Jack, then am I no 
 two-legged creature. 
 
 Prince H. I pray, you have not murdered some of them ?

 drive at me— 
 
 Friiioe H. What ! four ? Thou said'st but two, even now. 
 
 Falstaff. Four, Hal ; I told thee, four. These four came 
 all afront, and mainly thrust at me. I made no more ado, but 
 took all their seven points iu my target, thus. 
 
 Prince H. Seven ? Why, there were but four, even now. 
 
 Falstaff. In buckram ? 
 
 Prince H. Ay, four in buckram suits. 
 
 Falstaff. Seven, by these hUts, or I am a villain else. Dost 
 thou hear me, Hal ? 
 
 Prince H. Ay, and mark thee too. 
 
 Falstaff. Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine 
 iu buckram that I told thee of 
 
 Prince S. So, two more already ! (aside.) 
 
 Falstaff. Their points being broken, they began to give me 
 ground ; but I followed them close ; came in, foot and hand ; 
 and, with a thought, seven of the eleven I paid. 
 
 Prince H. O monstrous ! eleven buckram men grown out of 
 two ! 
 
 Falstaff. But, as bad luck would have it, three misbegotten 
 knaves, in Kendal Green, came at my back, and let drive at 
 me ; for, it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy 
 hand. 
 
 Prince H. These lies are like the father that begets them — 
 gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why thou clay-brained 
 and knotty-pated fool, thou obscene, greasy tallow-keech 
 
 Falstaff. What ! art thou mad ? art thou mad ? Is not the 
 truth the truth ? 
 
 Prince M. Why, how couldst thou know these men in 
 Kendal-green when "it was so dark, thou couldst not see thy

 Come, your reason. Jack, your reason.

 Into our hands ; and to confine yourself 
 
 To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's, 
 
 Till you hear further from his highness. 
 
 Wol. Stay : 
 
 Where's your commission, lords ? words cannot carry 
 
 Authority so weighty 
 
 Suf. Who dare cross 'em, 
 
 Bearing the king's wiU from his mouth expressly ? 
 Wol. Till I find more than will or words to do it, 
 
 (I mean your malice), know, officious lords, 
 
 I dare and must deny it. Now I feel 
 
 Of what coarse metal ye are moulded, — envy : 
 
 How eagerly ye follow my disgraces. 
 
 As if it fed ye ! and how sleek and wanton 
 
 Ye appear in everything may bring my ruin ! 
 
 Follow your envious courses, men of malice ; 
 
 You have Christian warrant for them, and, no doubt. 
 
 In time will find their fit rewards. That seal 
 
 You ask with such a violence, the king 
 
 (Mine and your master) with his own hand gave me ; 
 
 Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours. 
 
 During my life ; and to confirm his goodness, 
 
 Tied it by letters-patent : — now, who'll take it ? 
 Sur. The king, that gave it, 
 Wol. It must be himself, then. 
 
 Sur. Thou art a proud traitor, priest. 
 Wol. Proud lord, thou liest : 
 
 Within, these forty hours Surrey durst better 
 Have burnt that tongue than said so. 
 
 Sur. Thy ambition, 
 
 Thou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing land 
 Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law : 
 The heads of all thy brother cardinals 
 (With thee and aU thy best parts bound together) 
 Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy ! 
 You sent me deputy for Ireland ; 
 Far from his succour, from the king, from all

 Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity. 
 Absolved him with an axe.

 Wol. This, and all else 
 
 This talking lord can lay upon my credit, 
 I answer is most false. The duke by law 
 Found his deserts : how innocent I was 
 From any private malice in his end. 
 His noble jury and foul cause can witness. 
 If I lov'd many words, lord, I should tell you, 
 You have as Httle honesty as honour ; 
 That, in the way of loyalty and truth 
 Toward the king, my ever royal master. 
 Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be, 
 And all that love his follies.

 Your long coat, priest, protects you ; thou should'st feel 
 My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. — My lords, 
 Can ye endure to hear this arrogance ? 
 And from this fellow ? If we live thus tamely. 
 To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet. 
 Farewell nobility ; let his grace go forward. 
 And dare us with his cap, like larks. 
 
 Wol. All goodness 
 
 Is poison to thy stomach. 
 
 Sur. Yes, that goodness 
 
 Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one. 
 Into your own hands, cardinal, by extortion ; 
 The goodness of your intercepted packets 
 You writ to the pope against the king : your goodness. 
 Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious. — 
 My lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble. 
 As you respect the common good, the state 
 Of our despis'd nobility, our issues, 
 Who, if he Kve, will scarce be gentlemen, — 
 Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles 
 Collected from his life : — 
 
 Wol. How much, methinks, I could despise this man, 
 But that I am bound in charity against it ! 
 
 Nor. Those articles, my lord, are in the king's hands ; 
 But, thus much, they are foul ones.

 Sur. This cannot save yoii : 
 
 I thank my memory I yet remember 
 Some of these articles ; and out they shall. 
 Now, if you can blush and cry guilty, cardinal, 
 You'll show a little honesty. 
 
 Vol. Speak on. Sir ; 
 
 I dare your worst objections : if I blush. 
 It is to see a nobleman want manners. 
 
 SuT. I'd rather want those, than my head. Have at you. 
 First, that, without the king's assent or knowledge, 
 You wrought to be a legate ; by which power 
 You maimed the jurisdiction of all bishops. 
 
 Nor. Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else 
 To foreign princes, Ego et Rex mens 
 Was still inscrib'd ; in which you brought the king 
 To be your servant. 
 
 Suf. Then, that, without the knowledge 
 
 Either of king or council, when you went 
 Ambassador to the emperor, you made bold 
 To carry into Flanders the great seal. 
 
 Su7: Item, you sent a large commission 
 To Gregory de Cassado to conclude, 
 Without the king's will, or the state's allowance, 
 A league between his highness and Ferrara. 
 
 Suf. That, out of mere ambition, you have caus'd 
 Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin. 
 
 Sur. Then, that you have sent innumerable substance, 
 (By what means got, I leave to your own conscience,) 
 To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways 
 You have for dignities ; to the mere undoing 
 Of all the kingdom. Many more there are ; 
 Which, since they are of you, and odious, 
 I will not taint my mouth with. 
 
 Cha7n. O my lord. 
 
 Press not a falling man too far ; 'tis virtue : 
 His faults lie open to the laws ; let them, 
 Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him 
 So little of his great self.

 Because all those things you have done of late.

 To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,

 Out of the king's protection : — this is my charge.

 How to live better. For your stubborn answer

 Wol. So, farewell to the little good you bear me. 
 Farewell, a long farewell, to all my greatness ! 
 This is the state of man : to-day he puts forth 
 The tender leaves of hope ; to-morrow blossoms. 
 And bears his blushing honours thick upon him : 
 The third day comes a frost, a killing frost ; 
 And, — when he thinks, good easy man, full surely 
 His greatness is a ripening, — nips his root. 
 And then he falls, as I do. I have ventur'd, 
 Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders. 
 This many summers in a sea of glory ; 
 But far beyond my depth : my high-blown pride 
 At length broke imder me ; and now has left me, 
 Weary and old with service, to the mercy 
 Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me. 
 Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye : 
 I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched 
 Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours : 
 There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to, 
 That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin. 
 More pangs and fears than wars or women have ; 
 And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer, 
 Never to hope again. —

 Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell. 
 I know myself now ; and I feel within me 
 A peace above all earthly dignities, 
 A still and quiet conscience. The king has cur'd me, 
 I humbly thank his grace ; and from these shoulders. 
 These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken 
 A load would sink a navy, too much honour : 
 O, 'tis a burden, Cromwell, 'tis a burden 
 Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven ! 
 
 Grom. I am glad your grace has made that right use of it. 
 
 Wol. I hope I have : I am able now methinks, 
 (Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,) 
 To endure more miseries, and greater far, 
 Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer. 
 What news abroad 1 
 
 Grom. The heaviest and the worst. 
 
 Is your displeasure with the king. 
 
 Wol. God bless him ! 
 
 Grom. The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen 
 Lord chancellor in your place. 
 
 Wol. That's somewhat sudden : 
 
 But he's a leamfed man. May he continue 
 Long in his highness' favour, and do justice 
 For truth's sake, and his conscience ; that his bones. 
 When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings. 
 May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on them. 
 What more ? 
 
 Grom. That Cranmer is return'd with welcome, 
 Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury. 
 
 Wol. That's news indeed ! 
 
 Grom. Last, that the lady Anne, 
 
 Whom the king hath in secrecy long married, 
 This day was view'd in open, as his queen.

 Only about her coronation. 
 
 Wol. There was the weight that puU'd me down. O Crom- 
 The king has gone beyond me : all my glories [well, 
 
 In that one woman I have lost for ever : 
 No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours, 
 Or gild again the noble troops that waited 
 Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell ; 
 I am a poor fallen man, unworthy now 
 To be thy lord and master : seek the king ; 
 (That sun, I pray, may never set !) I have told him 
 What, and how true thou art : he wiU advance thee ; 
 Some little memory of me will stir him, 
 (I know his noble nature,) not to let 
 Thy hopeful service perish too : good Cromwell, 
 Neglect him not ; make use now, and provide 
 For thine own future safety. 
 
 Grom. O my lord. 
 
 Must I, then, leave you ? must I needs forego 
 So good, so noble and so true a master ? — 
 Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron, 
 With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord. — 
 The king shall have my service ; but my prayers 
 For ever and for ever shall be yours. 
 
 Wol. Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear 
 In all my miseries ; but thou hast forced me, 
 Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman. 
 Let's dry our eyes ; and thus far hear me, Cromwell ; 
 And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be. 
 And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention 
 Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee, — 
 Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory, 
 And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour. 
 Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise ia ; 
 A sure and safe one, though thy master missed it. 
 Mark but my fall, and that that ruined me. 
 Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition : 
 By that sin fell the angels ; how can man, then, 
 The image of his Maker, hope to win by it 1 
 Love thyself last : cherish those hearts that hate thee ;

 other knowing no burden of heavy tedious penury : these 
 Time ambles withal. 
 
 Orl. Who doth he gallop withal ? 
 
 Ros. With a thief to the gallows; for though he go as 
 softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there. 
 
 Orl. Who stays it still withal ? 
 
 Ros. With lawyers in the vacation ; for they sleep between 
 term and term, and then they perceive not how Time moves. 
 
 Orl. Where dwell you, pretty youth ? 
 
 Ros. With this shepherdess, my sister ; here in the skirts 
 of the forest, like a fringe upon a petticoat. 
 
 Orl. Are you a native of this place ? 
 
 Ros. As the coney, that you see dwell where she is kindled. 
 
 Orl. Your accent is something finer than you could purchase 
 in so removed a dwelling. 
 
 Ros. I have been told so by many : but indeed an old 
 religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was in his 
 youth an inland man ; one that knew courtship too well, for 
 there he fell in love. I have heard him read many lectures 
 against it ; and I thank God, I am not a woman, to be touched 
 with so many giddy offences, as he hath generally taxed their 
 whole sex withal. 
 
 Orl. Can you remember any of the principal evils that he 
 laid to the charge of women ? 
 
 Ros. There were none principal : they were all like one 
 another, as half-pence are ; every one fault seeming monstrous, 
 till his fellow-fault came to match it. 
 
 Orl. I pr'ythee, recount some of them. 
 
 Ros. No, I will not cast away my physic, but on those that 
 are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that abuses our 
 young plants with carving " Rosalind " on their barks ; hangs

 odes upon hawthorns, and elegies on brambles ; all, forsooth, 
 deifying the name of " Rosalind " : if I could meet that fancy- 
 monger, I would give him some good counsel, for he seems to 
 have the quotidian of love upon him. 
 
 Orl. I am he that is so love-shaked : I pray you, tell me 
 your remedy. 
 
 Bos. There is none of my uncle's marks upon you : he taught 
 me how to know a man in love ; in which cage of rushes I am 
 sure you are not prisoner. 
 Orl. What were his marks ? 
 
 Bos. A lean cheek ; which you have not ; a blue eye, and 
 sunken ; which you have not ; an unquestionable spirit ; which 
 -you have not ; a beard neglected ; which you have not ; — but 
 I pardon you for that ; for, simply, your having in beard is a 
 younger brother's revenue : — then, your hose should be un- 
 garter'd, your bonnet unhanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your 
 shoe untied, and everything about you demonstrating a care- 
 less desolation. But you are no such man; you are rather 
 point-device in your accoutrements, as loving yourself, than 
 seeming the lover of any other. 
 
 Orl. Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love. 
 
 Bos. Me believe it ! you may as soon make her that you 
 love believe it ; which, I warrant, she is apter to do, than to 
 confess she does : that is one of the points in the which women 
 still give the lie to their consciences. But, in good sooth, are 
 you he that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind is 
 so admired 1 
 
 Orl. I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, 
 I am that he, that unfortunate he. 
 
 Bos. But are you so much in love as your rh3rmes speak ? 
 
 Orl. Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much. 
 
 Bos. Love is merely a madness ; and, I tell you, deserves as 
 well a dark house and a whip, as madmen do : and the reason 
 why they are not so punished and cured, is, that the lunacy is 
 so ordinary, that the whippers are in love too. Yet I profess 
 curing it by counsel. 
 
 Orl. Did you ever cure any so ? 
 
 Bos. Yes, one ; and in this manner. He was to imagine 
 me his love, his mistress ; and I set him every day to woo me : 
 at which time would I, being but a moonish youth, grieve, be

 effeminate, changeable, longing, and liking ; proud, fantastical, 
 apish, shallow, inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles : for every 
 passion something, and for no passion truly anything, as boys 
 and women are, for the most part, cattle of this colour: 
 would now like him, now loathe him; then entertain him, 
 then forswear him ; now weep for him, then spit at him ; that 
 I drave my suitor from his mad humour of love, to a living 
 humour of madness ; which was, to forswear the full stream 
 of the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic. And 
 thus I cured him ; and this way will I take upon me to wash 
 your Hver as clean as a sound sheep's heart, that there shall 
 not be one spot of love in't. 
 
 Orl. I would not be cured, youth. 
 
 Bos. I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, 
 and come every day to my cot, and woo me. 
 
 Orl. Now, by the faith of my love, I will : tell me where it 
 is. 
 
 Bos. Go with me to it, and I'll show it you : and, by the 
 way, you shall tell me where in the forest you live. WiU you 
 go? 
 
 Orl. With all my heart, good youth. 
 
 Bos. Nay, you must call me Rosalind. \Exeuni. 
 
 Hamlet. 
 
 Act III., Scene I. 
 
 Ham. Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to 
 you, trippingly on the tongue ; but if you mouth it, as many 
 of your players do, I had as lief the town-crier spoke my lines. 
 Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus ; but 
 use aU gently : for in the very torrent, tempest, (and as I may 
 say), whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget a tem- 
 perance that may give it smoothness. O ! it offends me to 
 the soul, to hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow, tear a pas- 
 sion to tatters, to very rags, to split the ears of the ground- 
 lings ; who, for the most part, are capable of nothing but 
 inexpUcable dumb shows and noise : I would have such a 
 fellow whipped for o'er-doing Termagant ; it out-herods Herod : 
 pray you avoid it.

 Is* Play. I warrant, your honour. 
 
 Ham. Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion 
 be your tutor : suit the action to the word, the word to the 
 action, with this special observance, that you o'erstep not the 
 modesty of nature ; for anything so overdone is from the pur- 
 pose of playing, whose end, both at the first, and now, was, 
 and is, to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature ; to show 
 virtue her own feature, scorn her own image, and the very age 
 and body of the time his form and pressure. Now, this over- 
 done, or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful laugh, can- 
 not but make the judicious grieve ; the censure of which one, 
 must, in your allowance, o'er-weigh a whole theatre of others. 
 O ! there be players, that I have seen play, and heard others 
 praise, and that highly — not to speak it profanely, that, neither 
 having the accent of Christians, nor the gait of Christian, 
 pagan, nor man, have so strutted and bellowed, that I have 
 thought some of nature's journeymen had made men, and not 
 made them well, they imitated humanity so abominably. 
 
 Xst Play. I hope we have reformed that indifferently with 
 us. 
 
 Ham. O ! reform it altogether. And let those that play 
 your clown, speak no more than is set down for them : for 
 there be of them that will themselves laugh, to set on some 
 quantity of barren spectators to laugh too ! though in the 
 mean time, some necessary question of the play be then to be 
 considered; that's villainous, and shows a most pitiable am- 
 bition in the fool that uses it. \Exit.

 Pol. How does my good lord Hamlet ? 
 
 Ham. Well, heav'n-'a-mercy. 
 
 Pol. Do you know me, my lord ? 
 
 Ham. Excellent well ; you are a fishmonger.

 Pol. Honest, my lord ? 
 
 Ham. Ay, sir : to be honest, as this world goes, is to be one 
 man picked out of ten thousand. 
 
 Pol. That's very true, my lord. 
 
 Bam. For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a 
 god kissing carrion, — Have you a daughter % 
 
 Pol. I have, my lord. 
 
 Ham,. Let her not walk i' the sun : friend, look to't. 
 
 Pol. \Aside\ How say you by that ? Still harping on my 
 daughter : — yet he knew me not at first ; he said I was a 
 fishmonger. He is far gone, far gone : and truly in my youth 
 I sufiered much extremity for love ; very near this. I'll speak 
 to him again. What do you read, my lord ? 
 
 Ham,. Words, words, words. 
 
 Pol. What is the matter, my lord? 
 
 Ham,. Between whom ? 
 
 Pol. I mean the matter that you rea(^ my lord. 
 
 Ham,. Slanders, sir : for the satirical rogue says here, that 
 old men have grey beards ; that their faces are wrinkled ; 
 their eyes purging thick amber, and plum-tree gum ; and that 
 they have a plentiful lack of wit, together with most weak 
 hams : all of which, sir, (though I most powerfully and 
 potently believe,) yet I hold it not honesty to have it thus set 
 down ; for you yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a 
 crab, you could go backward. 
 
 Pol. Though this be madness, yet there is method in't. 
 [.isicZe.] Will you walk out of the air, my lord ? 
 
 Ham,. Into my grave. 
 
 Pol. Indeed, that is out o' the air. How pregnant sometimes 
 his replies are ! a happiness that often madness bits on, which 
 reason and sanity could not so prosperously be delivered of. 
 I will leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of meeting, 
 between him and my daughter. My honourable lord, I will 
 most humbly take my leave of you. 
 
 Ham,. You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will 
 more willingly part withal; except my life, except my life, 
 except my life. 
 
 Pol. Fare you well, my lord. \Exit.

 Ham. Then is dooms-day near ; but your news is not true. 
 But, in the beaten way of friendship, what make you at 
 Elsinore ? 
 
 Ros. To visit you, my lord ; no other occasion. 
 
 Ham. Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks ; but 
 I thank you : Were you not sent for ? Is it your own 
 inclining ? Is it a free visitation ? Come, come, deal justly 
 with me : come, come — nay, speak. 
 
 Guil. What should we say, my lord ? 
 
 Ham. Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent 
 for ; and there is a kiud of confession in your looks, which 
 your modesties have not craft enough to colour : I know the 
 good king and queen have sent for you. 
 
 Ros. To what end, my lord ? 
 
 Ham,. That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, 
 by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our 
 youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved love, and by 
 what more dear a better proposer could charge you withal, be 
 even and direct with me, whether you were sent or no ?

 Ham,. Nay, then I have an eye of you. [j4.sic?e] If you 
 love me, hold not off. 
 
 Guil. My lord, we were sent for.

 your discovery, and your secresy to the king and queen moult 
 no feather. I have of late, (but wherefore I know not) lost 
 all my mirth, forgone all custom of exercises, and indeed, it

 it appeareth nothing to me, but a foul and pestilent congrega-

 And thy assistance, is King Richard seated : 
 But shaU we wear these glories for a day 1

 To try if thou be current gold indeed : 
 Young Edward lives ; — think now what I would speak. 
 
 Buck. Say on, my loving lord. 
 
 K. Rich. Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king. 
 
 Buck. Why, so you are, my thrice-renownfed liege. 
 
 K. Rich. Ha ! am I king ? ^Tis so :— but Edward lives. 
 
 Buck. True, noble prince. 
 
 K. Rich. O bitter consequence. 
 
 That Edward still should live — 'true, noble prince ! ' 
 
 Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull : 
 Shall I be plain ? I wish the princes dead ; 
 And I would have it suddenly perform'd. 
 What say'st thou now 1 speak suddenly ; be brief.

 "Would tempt into a close exploit of death ?

 Whose humble means match not his haughty spirit : 
 Gold were as good as twenty orators, 
 And will, no doubt, tempt him to anything. 
 
 K. Rich. What is his name ?

 K. Rich. Come hither, Oatesby : rumour it abroad 
 That Anne, my wife, is very grievous sick ; 
 I will take order for her keeping close. 
 Inquire me out some mean, poor gentleman, 
 Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter ; 
 The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.

 Buck. I hear the news, my lord. 
 
 K. Rich. Stanley, he is your wife's son : — well, look to it. 
 
 Buck. My lord, I claim the gift, my due by promise. 
 For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd : 
 The earldom of Hereford, and the movables.

 Hub. Well, see to live ; I will not touch thine eyes 
 For all the treasure that thine uncle owes : 
 Yet am I sworn, and I did purpose, boy, 
 With this same very iron to burn them out.

 You were disguised.

 Queen Mab. 
 
 O, then, I see. Queen Mab hath been with you. 
 She is the fairies' midwife ; and she comes 
 In shape no bigger than an agate stone 
 On the fore-finger of an alderman. 
 Drawn with a team of little atomies 
 Athwart men's noses as they He asleep : 
 Her wagon-spokes made of long spinner's legs ; 
 The cover, of the wings of grasshoppers ; 
 The traces, of the smallest spider's web ; 
 The collars of the moonshine's watery beams ; 
 Her whip, of cricket's bone ; the lash of film : 
 Her wagoner, a small grey-coated gnat, 
 l«rot half so big as a round httle worm 
 Pricked from the lazy finger of a maid :

 Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut, 
 Made by the joiner Squirrel, or old Grub, 
 Time out of mind the fairies' coach-makers, 
 And in this state she gallops night by night 
 Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love : 
 On courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight : 
 O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees : 
 O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream. 
 Sometimes she gallops o'er a courtier's nose, 
 And then dreams he of smelling out a suit : 
 And sometimes comes she with a tithe-pig's tail. 
 Tickling a parson as he lies asleep — 
 Then dreams he of another benefice : 
 Sometimes she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, 
 And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats. 
 Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades. 
 Of healths five-fathom deep ; and then anon 
 Drums in his ear ; at which he starts, and wakes ; 
 And, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two. 
 And sleeps again. 
 
 Gloster's Soliloquy. 
 
 Now is the winter of our discontent 
 
 Made glorious summer by this sun of York ; 
 
 And all the clouds, that lower'd upon our house, 
 
 In the deep bosom of the ocean buried. 
 
 Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths ; 
 
 Our bruisfed arms hung up for monuments ; 
 
 Our stern alarums chang'd to merry meetings ; 
 
 Our dreadful marches to delightful measures. 
 
 Grim-visag'd war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front ; 
 
 And now, — instead of mounting barbed steeds. 
 
 To fright the souls of fearful adversaries, — 
 
 He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber, 
 
 To the lascivious pleasing of a lute. 
 
 But I, — that am not shaped for sportive tricks. 
 
 Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass ; 
 
 I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty,

 To strut before a wanton, ambling nymph ; 
 
 I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion, 
 
 Cheated of features by dissembling nature, 
 
 Deform'd, uniinish'd, sent before my time 
 
 Into this breathing world, scarce half made up, 
 
 And that so lamely and unfashionable, 
 
 That dogs bark at me, as I halt by them ; — 
 
 Why I, in this weak piping time of peace. 
 
 Have no delight to pass away the time 
 
 Unless to see my shadow in the sun, 
 
 And descant on mine own deformity : 
 
 And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover. 
 
 To entertain these fair well-spoken days, 
 
 I am determinfed to prove a \'illain, 
 
 And hate the idle pleasures of these days. 
 
 Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous. 
 
 By drunken prophecies, libels, and dreams. 
 
 To set my brother Clarence and the king 
 
 In deadly hate the one against the other. 
 
 And, if king Edward be as true and just 
 
 As I am subtle, false, and treacherous. 
 
 This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up. 
 
 About a prophecy, which says, that G 
 
 Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be. 
 
 The king is sickly, weak, and melancholy. 
 
 And his physicians fear hiin mightily. 
 
 He cannot live, I hope, and must not die. 
 
 Till George be pack'd with posthorse up to heaven. 
 
 I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence, 
 
 "With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments ; 
 
 And, if I fail not in my deep intent, 
 
 Clarence hath not another day to live : 
 
 Which done, God take king Edward to his mercy, 
 
 And leave the world for me to bustle in ! 
 
 For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter. 
 
 What though I kill'd her husband and her father. 
 
 The readiest way to make the wench amends. 
 
 Is to become her husband, and her father : 
 
 The which will I ; not all so much for love. 
 
 As for another secret close intent.

 When they are gone, then must I count my gains.

 Befoeb the Battle op Agincourt. 
 
 What's he that wishes men from England? you, cousin 
 Westmoreland ! — No, my fair cousin : if we are marked to die, 
 we are enough to do our country loss ; and if to live, the fewer 
 men, the greater share of honour. I pray thee, cousin, wish 
 not one man more. By Jove, I am not covetous for gold : nor 
 care I who doth feed upon my cost ; it yearns me not, if men 
 my garments wear ; such outward things dwell not in my 
 desires ! But, if it be a sin to covet honour, I am the most 
 offending soul alive. No, 'faith, my coz, wish not a man from 
 England : I would not lose so great an honour, as one man 
 more, methinks would share from me, for the best hope I have ! 
 Oh do not wish one more : rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, 
 throughout my host, that he who hath no stomach to this 
 fight may straight depart : his passport shall be made, and 
 crowns of convoy put into his purse : we would not die in 
 that man's company, that fears his fellowship to die with us. 
 This day is call'd the feast of Crispian : he that outlives this 
 day, and comes safe home, will stand a tip-toe when this day 
 is named, and rouse him at the name of Crispian : he that 
 shall live this day, and see old age, will yearly on the vigil 
 feast his friends, and say — " To-morrow is Saint Crispian : " 
 then will he strip his sleeve, and show his scars and 
 say, — " These wounds I had on Crispin's day." Old men 
 forget; yet shall not all forget, but they'll remember with 
 advantages, what feats they did that day. Then shall our 
 names, famUiar in their mouths as household words, Harry 
 the king, Bedford, and Exeter, Warwick, and Talbot, Salisbury, 
 and Gloster, be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd : 
 this story shall the good man teach his son ; and Crispin 
 Crispian shall ne'er go by from this day to the ending of the

 Duke, (staying her) You are at home already.

 Duke or no Duke, I'll be a Duchess, Sir ! 
 
 Duke. A Duchess ? you shall be a Queen — to all 
 Who, of their courtesy, will call you so. 
 
 Juli. And I will have attendance ! 
 
 Duke. So you shall, 
 
 When you have learnt to wait upon yourself.

 You were cut out by nature.

 Why, do you think I'll work ? 
 
 Duke. I think 'twill happen, wife.

 Wait, like an echo, till you're spoken to

 Performs its work, and never speaks at all. 
 
 Juli. To feed your poultry and your hogs ? — oh, monstrous ! 
 And when I stir abroad, on great occasions. 
 Carry a squeaking tithe pig to the vicar ;

 Beneath th' attesting eye of heav'n I've sworn 
 To honour, cherish, and protect you. 
 No human power can part us. What remains, then 1 
 To fret, and worry, and torment each other, 
 And give a keener edge to our hard fate 
 By sharp upbraidings and perpetual jars ? 
 Or, like a loving and a patient pair 
 (Wak'd from a dream of grandeur to depend 
 Upon their daily labour for support). 
 To soothe the taste of fortune's lowliness 
 With sweet consent and mutual fond endearment ? 
 Now to your chamber — write whate'er you please, 
 But pause before you stain the spotless paper 
 With words that may inflame, but cannot heal ! 
 
 Juli. Why, what a patient worm you take me for ! 
 
 Duke. I took you for a wife ; and, ere I've done, 
 I'll know you for a good one. 
 
 Juli. You shall know me 
 
 For a right woman, full of her own sex ; 
 Who, when she suffers wrong, wiU speak her wrongs ; 
 Who feels her own prerogative, and scorns 
 By the proud reason of superior man 
 To be taught patience, when her sweUing heart 
 Cries out revenge !

 The School for Scandal. 
 
 Two Speakers : Sir Petee and Lady Teazle. 
 
 Sir P. When an old bachelor marries a young wife, what 
 is he to expect t 'Tis now above six months since my Lady 
 Teazle made me "the happiest of men," and I have been the 
 most miserable dog ever since ! We tiffed a little going to 
 church, and fairly quarrelled before the bells were done ringing. 
 I was more than once nearly choked with gall during the 
 honeymoon ; and had lost every satisfaction in life before 
 my friends had done wishing me joy. And yet I chose with 
 caution a girl bred wholly in the country, who had never 
 known luxury beyond one silk gown, or dissipation beyond 
 the annual gala of a race-ball. Yet now, she plays her part 
 in all the extravagant fopperies of the town, with as good a 
 grace as if she had never seen a bush or a grass-plot out of 
 Grosvenor Square. I am sneered at by all my acquaiatance — 
 paragraphed in the newspapers — she dissipates my fortune, 
 and contradicts all my humours. And yet, the worst of it is, 
 I doubt I love her, or I should never bear aU this — -but I am 
 determined never to let her know it. — No, no, no ! Oh, here 
 she comes. Lady Teazle, Lady Teazle, I won't bear it. 
 
 Lady T. Very well. Sir Peter, you may bear it or not, just 
 as you please ; but I know I ought to have my own way in 
 everything j and what's more, I wUl. 
 
 Sir P. What, madam ! is there no respect due to the 
 authority of a husband ? 
 
 Lady T. Why, don't I know that no woman of fashion does 
 as she is bid after her marriage ? Though I was bred in the 
 country, I'm no stranger to that. If you wanted me to be 
 obedient, you should have adopted me, and not married me — 
 I'm sure you are old enough. 
 
 Sir P. Ay, there it is !— Oons, madam, what right have 
 you to run into aU this extravagance 1 
 
 Lady T. I'm sure I'm not more extravagant than a woman 
 of quality ought to be. 
 
 Sir P. 'Slife, madam, I'LL have no more sums squandered 
 away upon such unmeaning luxuries : you have as many flowers 
 in your dressing-room as would turn the Pantheon into a 
 green-house, or make a fete champetre at a masquerade.

 Lady T. O, Sir Peter, how can you be so angry at my little 
 elegant expenses ? 
 
 Sir P. Had you any of those little elegant expenses when 
 you married me? 
 
 Lady T. Very true, indeed ; and, after having married you, 
 I should never pretend to taste again ! 
 
 Sir P. Very well, very well, madam ! You have entirely 
 forgot what your situation was when I first saw you. 
 
 Lady T. No, no, I have not ; a very disagreeable situation 
 it was, or I'm sure I never would have married you. 
 
 Sir P. You forget the humble state I took you from — the 
 daughter of a poor country squire. When I came to your 
 father's, I found you sitting at your tambour, in a linen gown, 
 a bunch of keys at your side, and your hair combed smoothly 
 over a roll. 
 
 Lady T. Yes, I remember very well ;— my daily occupations 
 were, to overlook the dairy, superintend the poultry, make 
 extracts from the family receipt-book, and comb my aunt 
 Deborah's lap-dog. 
 
 Sir P. Oh.\ I am so glad to find you have so good a 
 recollection. 
 
 Lady T. My evening employments were to draw patterns 
 for ruffles, which I had not materials to make up ; play at Pope 
 Joan with the curate ; read a sermon to my aunt Deborah ; 
 or perhaps be stuck up at an old spinet, and thrum my father 
 to sleep after a foxchase. 
 
 Sir P. Then you were glad to take a ride out behind the 
 butler upon the old docked coach-horse. 
 
 Lady T. No, no, I deny the butler and the coach-horse. 
 
 Sir P. I say you did. This was your situation. — Now 
 madam, you must have your coach, vis-a-vis, and three 
 powdered footmen to walk before your chair ; and in summer, 
 two white cats, to draw you to Kensington Gardens : and, 
 instead of our living in that hole in the country, I have 
 brought you home here, made a woman of fortune of you, a 
 w^oman of quality — in short, I have made you my wife. 
 
 Lady T. Well ! and there is but one thing more you can 
 now add to the obligation ; and that is 
 
 Sir P. To make you my widow, I suppose 1 
 
 Lady T. Hem !

 Sir P. Very well, madam ; very well ; I am much obliged 
 to you for the hint. 
 
 Lady T. Why, then, will you force me to say shocking 
 things to you ? But now we have finished our morning con- 
 versation, I want you to be in a monstrous good humour; 
 come, do be good-humoured, and let me have two hundred 
 pounds. 
 
 Sir P. What ! can't I be in a good humour without paying 
 for it ? — but look always thus, and you shall want for nothing. 
 \Pulls out a pocket-book,] — There, there are two hundred pounds 
 for you. [Going to kiss her.] ISTow seal my bond for payment. 
 
 Lady T. No ; my note of hand will do as well. [Giving her 
 hand.] 
 
 Sir P. Well, well, I must be satisfied with that You 
 
 sha'n't much longer reproach me for not having made a proper 
 settlement 1 intend shortly to surprise you. 
 
 Lady T. Do you ? you can't think, Sir Peter, how good 
 humour becomes you : now you look just as you did before 
 I married you. 
 
 Sir P. Do I indeed ? 
 
 Lady T. Don't you remember, when you used to walk with 
 me under the elms, and tell me stories of what a gallant you 
 were in your youth, and asked me if I could like an old 
 fellow, who would deny me nothing ? 
 
 Sir P. Ay ! and you were so attentive and obliging to me 
 then! 
 
 Lady T. To be sure I was, and used to take your part 
 against all my acquaintance ; and when my cousin Sophy used 
 to laugh at me, for thinking of marrying a man old enough to 
 be my father, and call you an ugly, stiff, formal, old bachelor, 
 I contradicted her, and said, I did not think you so ugly by 
 any means, and that I dared say you would make a good sort 
 of a husband. 
 
 Sir P. That was very kind of you. — Well, and you were 
 not mistaken ; you have found it so, have you not ? — But shall 
 we always live thus happy ? 
 
 Lady T. With all my heart 1 don't care how soon we 
 
 leave off quarreUing — provided you will own you are tired first. 
 
 Sir P. With all my heart.

 contest be, who shaU be most obliging. 
 
 Lady T. Ay ! 
 
 Sir P. But, my dear Lady Teazle ! — ^my love ! — indeed you 
 must keep a strict watch over your temper — for, you know, 
 my dear, that in all our disputes and quarrels, you always 
 begin first. 
 
 Lady T. No, no, — Sir Peter, my dear, 'tis always you that 
 begin. 
 
 Sir P. No, no, — no such thing. 
 
 Lady T. Have a care, this is not the way to live happy, if 
 you fly out thus. 
 
 Sir P. Madam ! I say 'tis you. 
 
 Lady P. I never saw such a man in my life — just what my 
 cousin Sophy told me. 
 
 Sir P. Your cousin Sophy is a forward, saucy, impertinent 
 
 mimr ! 
 
 Lady T. You are a very great bear, I am sure, to abuse 
 my relations ! 
 
 Sir P. But I am very well served for marrying you — a 
 pert, forward, rural coquette ; who had refused half the honest 
 squires in the country. 
 
 Lady T. I am sure I was a great fool for marrying you — a 
 stiff', cross, dangling old bachelor, who was luimarried at fifty 
 because nobody would have him. 
 
 Sir P. You were very glad to have me — you never had 
 such an ofier. 
 
 Lady T. Oh, yes I had — there was Sir Tivey Terrier, who 
 everybody said would be a better match ; for his estate was 
 full as good as yours, and — he has broke his neck since we 
 were married. 
 
 Sir P. Very well— very well, madam ! — you're an ungrateful 
 woman; and may plagues Kght on me, if I ever try to be 
 friends with you again — -you shall have a separate maintenance ! 
 
 Lady T. By all means, a separate maintenance.

 Three Speakers : Haedcastle, Marlow, and Hastings. 
 
 Hard. Gentlemen, once more you are heartily welcome. 
 Which is Mr. Marlow ? (Mar. advances.) Sir, you are heartily 
 welcome. It's not my way, you see, to receive my friends with 
 my back to the fire ! I like to give them a hearty reception, 
 in the old style, at my gate ; I like to see their horses and 
 trunks taken care of. 
 
 Mar. (Aside.) He has got our names from the servants al- 
 ready. {To Hard.) We approve your caution and hospitality, 
 sir. (To Hast.) I have been thinking, George, of changing 
 our travelling dresses in the morning ; I am grown confoundedly 
 ashamed of mine. 
 
 Hard. I beg, Mr. Marlow, you'll use no ceremony in this 
 house. 
 
 Hast. I fancy, you're right ; the first blow is half the battle. 
 We must, however, open the campaign. 
 
 Hard. Mr. Marlow — Mr. Hastings — gentlemen — pray be 
 under no restraint in this house. This is Liberty-hall, gentle- 
 men ; you may do just as you please here. 
 
 Mar. Yet, George, if we open the campaign too fiercely at 
 first, we may want ammunition before it is over. We must 
 shew our generalship by securing, if necessary, a retreat. 
 
 Hard. Your talking of a retreat, Mr. Marlow, puts me in 
 mind of the Duke of Marlborough, when he went to besiege 
 Denain. He first summoned the garrison 
 
 Mar. Ay, and we'll summon your garrison, old boy.

 Mar. Five minutes to seven. 
 
 Hard. Which might consist of about five thousand men, well 
 appointed with stores, ammunition, and other implements of

 that stood next to him — You must have heard of George 
 Brooks — I'll pawn my dukedom, says he, but I take that gar- 
 rison without spilling a drop of blood. So 
 
 Mar. What? My good friend, if you give us a glass of 
 punch in the meantime, it would help us to carry on the siege 
 with vigour. 
 
 Hard. Punch, sir ! — This is the most unaccountable kind of 
 modesty I ever met with. {Aside^ 
 
 Mar. Yes, sir, punch ! A glass of warm punch after our 
 journey will be comfortable. 
 
 Enter Servant, with a tankard. 
 
 This is Liberty-hall, you know. 
 
 Hard. Here's a cup, sir. 
 
 Mar. So this fellow, in his Liberty-hall, will only let us have 
 just what he pleases. (Aside to Hast.) 
 
 Hard. (Taking the cup.) I hope you'll find it to your mind. 
 I have prepared it with my own hands, and I believe you'll 
 own the ingredients are tolerable. Will you be so good as to 
 pledge me, sir ? Here, Mr. Marlow, here is to our better ac- 
 quaintance. {Drinks, and gives the cup to Marlow.) 
 
 Mar. A very impudent fellow this ; but he's a character, and 
 I'U humour him a little. (Aside.) Sir, my service to you. 
 
 Hast. I see this fellow wants to give us his company, and 
 forgets that he's an innkeeper, before he has learned to be a 
 gentleman. (Aside.) 
 
 Mar. Prom the excellence of your cup, my old friend, I sup- 
 pose you have a good deal of business in this part of the country. 
 Warm work, now and then, at elections, I suppose. (Gives 
 the tankard to Hardcastle.)

 Hard. No, sir, I have long given that work over. Since 
 our betters have hit upon the expedient of electing each other, 
 there's no business for us that sell ale. {Gives the tanha/rd to 
 Hastings.) 
 
 Hast. So, you have no turn for politics, I find. 
 
 Hard. Not in the least. There was a time, indeed, I fretted 
 myself about the mistakes of government, like other people ; 
 but finding myself every day grow more angry, and the govern- 
 ment growing no better, I left it to mend itself. Since that, I 
 no more trouble my head about who's in or who's out, than I 
 do about John Nokes or Tom Stiles. So my service to you. 
 
 East. So that, with eating above stairs and drinking below, 
 with receiving your friends within, and amusing them without, 
 you lead a good, pleasant, bustling life of it. 
 
 Hard. I do stir about a good deal, that's certain. Half the 
 differences of the parish are adjusted in this very parlour. 
 
 Mar. {After drinking.) And you have an argument in your 
 cup, old gentleman, better than any in Westminster-Hall. 
 
 Hard. Ay, young gentlemen, that and a little philosophy. 
 
 Mar. Well, this is the first time I ever heard of an inn- 
 keeper's philosophy. {Aside.) 
 
 Hast. So, then, like an experienced general, you attack them 
 on every quarter. If you find their reason manageable, you 
 attack them with your philosophy ; if you find they have no 
 reason, you attack them with this. Here's your health, my 
 philosopher. {Drinks.) 
 
 Hard. Good, very good ; thank you ; ha ! ha ! Your general- 
 ship puts me in mind of Piince Eugene, when he fought the 
 Turks at the battle of Belgrade. You shall hear. 
 
 Mar. Instead of the battle of Belgrade, I think it's almost 
 time to talk about supper. What has your philosophy got in 
 the house for supper ? 
 
 Hard. Por supper, sir ? Was ever such a request to a man 
 in his own house ? {Aside.) 
 
 Mar. Yes, sir, supper, sir; I begin to feel an appetite. I 
 shall make work to-night in the larder, I promise you. 
 
 Hard. Such a brazen dog sure never my eyes beheld. {Aside.} 
 Why, really, sir, as for supper, I can't well tell. My Dorothy 
 and the cookmaid settle these things between them. I leave 
 these kind of things entirely to them.

 Mar. You do, do you % 
 
 Hard. Entirely. By-the-by, I believe they are in actual 
 consultation upon what's for supper this moment in the kitchen. 
 
 Mar. Then I beg they'll admit me as one of their privy- 
 council. It's a way I have got. When I travel, I always 
 choose to regulate my own supper. Let the cook be called. 
 No offence, I hope, sir. 
 
 Hard. Oh ! no, sir, none in the least : yet, I don't know how, 
 our Bridget, the cookmaid, is not very communicative upon 
 these occasions. Should we send for her, she might scold us 
 all out of the house. 
 
 Hast. Let's see the list of the larder, then. I always match 
 my appetite to my biU of fare. 
 
 Mar. (To Hardcastle, who looks at them with surprise.) Sir, 
 he's very right, and it's my way, too. 
 
 Hard. Sir, you have a right to command here. Here, Roger, 
 bring us the bill of fare for to-night's supper : I believe it'3 
 drawn out. Your manner, Mr. Hastings, puts me in mind of 
 my uncle. Colonel Wallop. It was a saying of his, that no man 
 was sure of his supper till he had eaten it. {Servant brings in 
 the bill of fare, and exit!) 
 
 Hast. AH upon the high ropes ! His uncle a colonel ! We 
 shall soon hear of his mother being a justice of the peace. 
 {Aside.) But let's hear the bill of fare. 
 
 Mar. {Perusing.) What's here? For the first course; for 
 
 the second course ; for the dessert. Do you 
 
 think we have brought down the whole Joiners' Company, or 
 the Corporation of Bedford, to eat up such a supper 1 Two or 
 three little things, clean and comfortable, will do. 
 
 Hast. But let's hear it. 
 
 Mar. {Reading.) For the first course : at the top, a pig and 
 prune sauce. 
 
 Mar. Hang your pig, say I. 
 
 Mar. And hang your prune sauce, say I. 
 
 Hard. And yet, gentlemen, to men that are hungry, pig with 
 prune sauce is very good eating. — Their impudence confounds 
 me. {Aside.) Gentlemen, you are my guests, make what al- 
 terations you please. Is there any thing else you wish to re- 
 trench or alter, gentlemen ? 
 
 Mar. Item : a pork pie, a boiled rabbit and sausages, a

 florentine, a shaking pudding, and a dish of tiff — taff — taffety 
 cream. 
 
 Hast. Confound your made dishes ! I shall be as much at a 
 loss in this house, as at a green and yellow dinner at the French 
 ambassador's table. I'm for plain eating. 
 
 Hard. I'm sorry, gentlemen, that I have nothing you like ; 
 but if there be anything you have a particular fancy to 
 
 Mar. Why, really, sir, your bill of fare is so exquisite, that 
 any one part of it is full as good as another. Send us what 
 you please. So much for supper ; and now to see that our 
 beds are aired and properly taken care of. 
 
 Hard. I intreat you'll leave all that to me. You shall not 
 stir a step. 
 
 Mar. Leave that to you ! I protest, sir, you must excuse 
 me, I always look to these things myself. 
 
 Hard. I must insist, sir, you'll make yourself easy on that 
 head. 
 
 Mar. You see I'm resolved on it. A very troublesome 
 fellow, as ever I met with. (Aside.) 
 
 Hard. Well, sir, I'm resolved at least, to attend you. This 
 may be modern modesty, but I never saw anything look so like 
 an old-fashioned impudence.

 Sir Anth. "Well, Jack, I am glad to see you, though I did 
 not expect it ; for I was going to write to you on a little 
 matter of business. — Jack, I have been considering that I grow 
 old and infirm, and shall probably not trouble you long. 
 
 Ahs. Pardon me, sir, I never saw you look more strong and 
 hearty. 
 
 Sir A nth. Well, then, Jack, I have been considering that I 
 am so strong and hearty, I may continue to plague you a 
 long time. Now, Jack, I am sensible that the income of 
 your commission, with what I have hitherto allowed you, is 
 but a small pittance for a lad of your spirit. 
 
 Ahs. Sir, you are very good. 
 
 Sir Anth. And it is my wish, while yet I live, to have my 
 boy make some figure in the world. I have resolved, there- 
 fore, to fix you at once in a noble independence. 
 
 Ahs. Sir, your kindness overpowers me ; — I cannot express 
 the sense I have of your munificence. — Yet, sir, I presume 
 you would not wish me to quit the army ? 
 
 Sir Anth. Oh, that shall be as your wife chooses. 
 
 Ahs. My wife, sir ! 
 
 Sir Anth. Ay, ay, settle that between you — settle that be- 
 tween you. 
 
 Ahs. A wife, sir, did you say ? 
 
 Sir Anth. Ay, a wife — did I not mention her before ? 
 
 Ahs. Nqt a word of her, sir. 
 
 Sir Anth. I musn't forget her, though. — Yes, Jack, the 
 independence I was talking of is by marriage ; — the fortune is 
 saddled with a wife — but I suppose that makes no difierence. 
 
 Ahs. Sir ! you amaze me. 
 
 Sir Anth. Why, what's the matter with the fool ? Just now 
 you were all gratitude and duty. 
 
 Ahs. I was, sir ; — you talked to me of independence and a 
 fortune, but not a word of a wife. 
 
 Sir Anth. Why, what difference does that make ? Tut, tut 
 sir ! if you have the estate, you must take it with the live 
 stock on it, as it stands. 
 
 Ahs. Pray, sir, who is the lady ?

 Sir Anth. "What's that to you, sir ? — Come, give me your 
 promise to love and to marry her directly. 
 
 Ahs. Sure, sir, this is not very reasonable, to summon my 
 affections for a lady I know nothing of ! 
 
 Sir Anth. I am sure, sir, 'tis more unreasonable in you to 
 object to a lady you know nothing of. 
 
 Ahs. Then, sir, I must tell you plainly, once for all, that on 
 this point I cannot obey you. 
 
 Sir Anth. Hark'ee, Jack ; — I have heard you for some time 
 with patience — I have been cool — quite cool ; but take care — 
 you know I am compliance itself when I am not thwarted ; — ■ 
 no one more easily led, when I have my own way ; — but don't 
 put me in a frenzy.

 while I live !

 Ahs. What, sir, promise to link myself to some mass of 
 ugliness ! 
 
 Sir Anth. Zounds ! sirrah ! the lady shall be as ugly as I 
 choose : she shall have a hump on each shoulder ; she shall be 
 as crooked as the Crescent ; her one eye shall roll like the 
 bull's in Cox's museum ; she shall have a skin like a mummy, 
 and the beard of a Jew — she shall be all this, sirrah ! — yet I 
 will make you ogle her all day, and sit up all night to write 
 sonnets on her beauty. — None of your sneering, puppy ! No 
 grinning, jackanapes ! 
 
 Ahs. Indeed, sir, I never was in a worse humour for mirth 
 in my life. 
 
 Sir Anth. 'Tis false, sir ! I know you are laughing in your 
 sleeve : I know you'll grin when I am gone, sirrah !

 if you please ! — It won't do with me, I promise you.

 Essex and Spenser. 
 
 [Spenser has just escaped from Ireland, where his house and infant child 
 had been burnt. Essex, not yet aware of his misfortune, has sent for him.] 
 
 Essex. Instantly on hearing of thy arrival from Ireland, 
 I sent a message to thee, good Edmund, that I might learn, 
 from one so judicious and dispassionate as thou art, the real 
 state of things in that distracted country ; it having pleased 
 the Queen's Majesty to think of appointing me her deputy, 
 in order to bring the rebellious to submission. 
 
 Spenser. Wisely and well considered; but more worthily of 
 her judgment than her affection. May your lordship overcome, 
 as you have ever done, the difficulties and dangers you foresee. 
 
 Essex. "We grow weak by striking at random ; and know- 
 ing that I must strike, and strike heavily, I would fain see 
 exactly where the stroke shall fall. 
 
 Now what tale have you for us ? 
 
 Spenser. Interrogate me, my lord, that I may answer each 
 question distinctly, my mind being in sad confusion at what 
 I have seen and undergone. 
 
 Essex. Give me thy account and opinion of these very 
 affairs as thou leftest them ; for I would rather know one 
 part well than all imperfectly ; and the violences of which I 
 have heard within the day surpass belief. 
 
 Why weepest thou, my gentle Spenser 1 Have the rebels 
 sacked thy house ? 
 
 Spenser. They have plundered and utterly destroyed it. 
 
 Essex. I grieve for thee, and will see thee righted. 
 
 Spenser. In this they have little harmed me. 
 
 Essex. How ! I have heard it reported that thy grounds 
 are fertile, and thy mansion large and pleasant. 
 
 Spenser. If river and lake and meadow-ground and moun- 
 tain could render any place the abode of pleasantness, pleasant 
 was mine, indeed ! 
 
 On the lovely banks of Mulla I found deep contentment. 
 Under the dark alders did I muse and meditate. Innocent 
 hopes were my gravest cares, and my playfullest fancy was 
 with kindly wishes. Ah ! surely of all cruelties the worst 
 is to extinguish our kindness. Mine is gone : I love the

 people and the land no longer. My lord, ask me not about 
 them : I may speak injuriously. 
 
 Essex. Thiak rather, then, of thy happier hours and busier 
 occupations ; these likewise may instruct me. 
 
 Spenser. The first seeds I sowed in the garden, ere the old 
 castle was made habitable for my lovely bride, were acorns 
 from Penshurst. I planted a little oak before my mansion 
 at the birth of each child. My sons, I said to myself, shall 
 often play in the shade of them when I am gone ; and every 
 year shall they take the measure of their growth, as fondly as 
 I take theirs. 
 
 Essex. Well, well; but let not this thought make thee 
 weep so bitterly. 
 
 Spenser. Poison may ooze from beautiful plants ; deadly 
 grief from dearest reminiscences. I must grieve, I must 
 weep : it seems the law of God, and the only one that men 
 are not disposed to contravene. In the performance of this 
 alone do they effectually aid one another. 
 
 Essex. Spenser ! I wish I had at hand any arguments or 
 persuasions of force sufficient to remove thy sorrow ; but, 
 really, I am not in the habit of seeing men grieve at anything 
 except the loss of favour at court, or of a hawk, or of a buck- 
 hound. And were I to swear out condolences to a man of 
 thy discernment, in the same round, roll-call phrases we 
 employ with one another upon these occasions, I should be 
 guilty, not of insincerity, but of insolence. True grief hath 
 ever something sacred in it ; and, when it visiteth a wise 
 man and a brave one, is most holy. 
 
 Nay, kiss not my hand : he whom God smiteth hath God 
 with him. In his presence what am 1 1 
 
 Spenser. Never so great, my lord, as at this hour, when 
 you see aright who is greater. May He guide your counsels, 
 and preserve your life and glory ! 
 
 Essex. Where are thy friends ? Are they with thee ? 
 
 Spenser. Ah, where, indeed ! Generous, true-hearted Philip ! 
 where art thou, whose presence was unto me peace and safety ; 
 whose smile was contentment, and whose praise renown 1 My 
 lord ! I cannot but think of him among still heavier losses : 
 he was my earliest friend, and would have taught me wisdom. 
 
 Essex. Pastoral poetry, my dear Spenser, doth not require

 tears and lamentations. Dry thine eyes; rebuild thine house: 
 the Queen and Council, I venture to promise thee, will make 
 ample amends for every evil thou hast sustained. What I 
 does that enforce thee to wail still louder ? 
 
 Spenser. Pardon me, bear with me, most noble heart ! I 
 have lost what no Council, no Queen, no Essex, can restore. 
 
 Essex. We will see that. There are other swords, and 
 other arms to yield them, beside a Leicester's and a Ealeigh's. 
 Others can crush their enemies and serve their friends. 
 
 Spenser. O my sweet child ! And of many so powerful, 
 many so wise and so beneficent, was there none to save thee 1 
 None ! none ! 
 
 Essex. I now perceive that thou lamentest what almost 
 every father is destined to lament. Happiness must be 
 bought, although the payment may be delayed. Consider : 
 the same calamity might have befallen thee here in London. 
 Neither the houses of ambassadors, nor the palaces of kings, 
 nor the altars of God himself, are asylums against death. 
 How do I know but under this very roof there may sleep 
 some latent calamity, that in an instant shall cover with 
 gloom every inmate of the house, and every far dependent ? 
 
 Spender. God avert it ! 
 
 Essex. Every day, every hour of the year, do hundreds 
 mourn what thou mournest. 
 
 Spenser. Oh, no, no, no ! Calamities there are around 
 us ; calamities there are all over the earth ; calamities there 
 are in all seasons : but none in any season, none in any place, 
 like mine. 
 
 Essex. So say all fathers, so say aU husbands. Look at 
 any old-mansion house, and let the sun shine as gloriously 
 as it may on the golden vanes, or the arms recently quartered 
 over the gateway or the embayed window, and on the happy 
 pair that haply is toying at it : nevertheless thou mayest say 
 that of a certainty the same fabric hath seen much sorrow 
 within its chambers, and heard many waiKngs ; and each time 
 this was the heaviest stroke of all. Funerals have passed 
 along through the stout-hearted knights upon the wainscot, 
 and amid the laughing nymphs upon the arras. Old servants 
 have shaken their heads, as if somebody had deceived them, 
 when they found that beauty and nobility could perish.

 Edmund ! the things that are too true pass by us as if they 
 were not true at all ; and when they have singled us out, then 
 only do they strike us. Thou and I must go too. Perhaps 
 the next year may blow us away with its fallen leaves. 
 
 Spenser. For you, my lord, many years (I trust) are wait- 
 ing : I never shall see those fallen leaves. No leaf, no bud, 
 will spring upon the earth before I sink into her breast for 
 ever. 
 
 Essex. Thou, who art wiser than most men, shouldst bear 
 with patience, equanimity, and courage what is common to all. 
 
 Spenser. Enough, enough, enough ! Have aU men seen 
 their infant burnt to ashes before their eyes ? 
 
 Essex. Gracious God ! Merciful Father ! what is this ? 
 
 Spenser. Burnt alive ! burnt to ashes ! burnt to ashes ! 
 The flames dart their serpent tongues through the nursery- 
 window. I cannot quit thee, my Elizabeth ! I cannot lay 
 down our Edmund ! Oh, these flames ! They persecute, 
 they enthrall me ; they curl round my temples ; they hiss 
 upon my brain ; they taunt me with their fierce, foul voices ; 
 they carp at me, they wither me, they consume me, throwing 
 back to me a little of Ufe to roll and sufier in, with their 
 fangs upon me. Ask me, my lord, the things you wish to 
 know from me : I may answer them ; I am now composed 
 again. Command me, my gracious lord ! I would yet serve 
 you : soon I shall be unable. You have stooped to raise me 
 up J you have borne with me ; you have pitied me, even like 
 one not powerful. You have brought comfort, and will leave 
 it with me, for gratitude is comfort. 
 
 Oh ! my memory stands aU a tip-toe on one burning point : 
 when it drops from it, then it perishes. Spare me : ask me 
 nothing ; let me weep before you in peace, — the kindest act 
 of greatness. 
 
 Essex. I should rather have dared to mount into the 
 midst of the conflagration than I now dare entreat thee not 
 to weep. The tears that overflow thy heart, my Spenser, will 
 staunch and heal it in their sacred stream ; but not without 
 hope in God. 
 
 Spenser. My hope in God is that I may soon see again 
 what he has taken from me. Amid the myriads of angels, 
 there is not one so beautiful; and even he (if there be any) who

 is appointed my guardian could never love me so. Ah ! these 
 are idle thoughts, vain wanderings, distempered dreams. If 
 there ever were guardian angels, he who so wanted one — my 
 helpless boy — would not have left these arms upon my knees. 
 
 Essex. God help and sustain thee, too gentle Spenser ! _ I 
 never wUl desert thee. But what am I ? Great they have 
 called me ! Alas, how powerless then and infantile is great- 
 ness in the presence of calamity ! 
 
 Come, give me thy hand : let us walk up and down the 
 gallery. Bravely done ! I will envy no more a Sidney or 
 a Raleigh.

 One more unfortunate, weary of breath, rashly importunate,

 fashioned so slenderly, young, and so fair ! Look at her 
 garments, cUnging like cerements ; whilst the wave constantly 
 drips from her clothing. Take her up instantly, loving, not 
 loathing. Touch her not scornfuUy, think of her mournfully, 
 gently and humanly : not of the stains of her : — all that re- 
 mains of her now is pure womanly. Make no deep scrutiny

 Death has left on her only the beautiful. StiU, — ^for all slips

 stood with amazement, houseless — by night. The bleak wind 
 of March made her tremble and shiver ; but not the dark arch, 
 or the black-flowing river: mad from life's history, glad to 
 death's mystery ; swift to be hurled any where, any where, out 
 of the world ! In she plunged boldly, no matter how coldly 
 the rough river ran : — over the brink of it, picture it, think of 
 it, dissolute Man ! lave in it, drink of it, then, if you can ! 
 
 Take her up tenderly, lift her with care : fashioned so 
 slenderly, young, and so fair ! Ere her limbs frigidly stiffen 
 too rigidly, decently, kindly, smooth and compose them ; and 
 her eyes — close them, staring so blindly ! Dreadfully staring, 
 through muddy impurity ; as when, with the daring last look 
 of despairing, fixed on futurity ! Perishing gloomily ; spurred 
 by contumely, cold inhumanity, burning insanity, into her 
 rest. — Cross her hands humbly, as if praying dumbly, over 
 her breast; owning her weakness, her evil behaviour — and 
 leaving, with meekness, her sins to her Saviour ! 
 
 The OhUdren. 
 
 When the lesson and tasks are aU ended, 
 
 And the school for the day is dismissed, 
 And the little ones gather around me 
 
 To bid me " Grood-night," and be kissed. 
 Oh the little white arms that encircle 
 
 My neck in a tender embrace ; 
 Oh the smiles that are halos of heaven. 
 
 Shedding sunshine and love on my face. 
 
 And when they are gone I sit dreaming 
 
 Of my childhood, too lovely to last ; 
 Of love, that my heart will remember 
 
 When it wakes to the pulse of the past ; 
 Ere the world and its wickedness made me 
 
 A partner of sorrow and sin, 
 When the glory of God was about me. 
 
 And the glory of gladness within.

 Oh my head grows weak as a woman's, 
 
 And the fountain of feeling will flow 
 When I think of the paths, steep and stony. 
 
 Where the feet of the dear ones must go : 
 Of the mountains of sins hanging o'er them. 
 
 Of the tempests of fate blowing wild ; 
 Oh there's nothing on earth half so holy 
 
 As the innocent heart of a child ! 
 
 They are idols of heart and of households ; 
 
 They are angels of God in disguise ; 
 His sunlight stiU sleeps in their tresses — 
 
 His glory stUl beams in their eyes. 
 Oh those truants from earth and from heaven, 
 
 They have made me more manly and mild. 
 And I know now how Jesus could liken 
 
 The Kingdom of God to a child. 
 
 Seek not a life for the dear ones 
 
 All radiant, as others have done ; 
 But that life may have just as much shadow 
 
 To temper the glare of the sun. 
 I would pray God to guard them from evil, 
 
 But my prayer would bound back to myself ; 
 Ah ! a seraph may pray for a sinner, 
 
 But a sinner must pray for himself. 
 
 The twig is so easUy bended, 
 
 I have banished the rule of the rod, 
 I have taught them the goodness of knowledge ; 
 
 They have taught me the goodness of God. 
 My heart is a dungeon of darkness. 
 
 Where I shut them from breaking a rule. 
 My frown is sufficient correction, 
 
 My love is the law of the school. 
 
 I shall leave the old home in the Autumn, 
 
 To traverse its threshold no more ; 
 Ah ! how I shall sigh for the dear ones 
 
 That meet me each morn at the door.

 I shall miss the " Good-nights," and the kisses, 
 And the gush of their innocent glee — 
 
 The groups on the green, and the flowers 
 That are brought every morning to me. 
 
 I shall miss them at morn and at even, 
 
 Their songs in the school and the street ; 
 I shall miss the low hum of their voices, 
 
 And the tramp of their delicate feet. 
 When the lessons and tasks are all ended. 
 
 And Death says the school is dismissed, 
 May the little ones gather around me, 
 
 And bid me "Good night," and be kissed ! 
 
 The Children's Hour. 
 
 Between the dark and the daylight, when the night is beginning 
 
 to lower. 
 Comes a pause in the day's occupations, that is known as the 
 
 Children's Hour. 
 I hear in the chamber above me the patter of little feet. 
 The sound of a door that is opened, and voices soft and sweet. 
 
 From my study I see in the lamplight, descending the broad 
 
 hall stair. 
 Grave Alice and laughing Allegra, and Edith with golden hair. 
 A whisper and then a silence ; yet I know by their merry 
 
 eyes 
 They are plotting and planning together to take me by surprise. 
 
 A sudden rush from the stairway, a sudden raid from the hall ! 
 
 By three doors left unguarded they enter my castle wall ! 
 
 They climb up into my turret o'er the arms and back of my 
 chair ; 
 
 If I try to escape they surround me ; they seem to be every- 
 where.

 They almost devour me with kisses, their arms about me 
 
 entwine, 
 Till I think of the Bishop of Bingen in his Mouse-tower on the 
 
 Rhine ! 
 Do you think, O blue-eyed banditti, because you have scaled the 
 
 wall 
 Such an old moustache as I am is not a match for you all ! 
 
 I have you fast in my fortress, and will not let you depart. 
 But put you down in the dungeon in the round tower of my 
 
 heart. 
 And there will I keep you for ever, yes, for ever and a day, 
 Till the walls shall crumble to ruin, and moulder in dust away. 
 
 The Arsenal at Springfield. 
 
 This is the Arsenal. Prom floor to ceiling, 
 Like a huge organ, rise the burnished arms ; 
 
 But from their silent pipes no anthem pealing 
 Startles the villages with strange alarms. 
 
 Ah ! what a sound wiU rise, how wild and dreary. 
 When the death-angel touches those swift keys ! 
 
 What loud lament and dismal Miserere 
 Will mingle with their awful symphonies ! 
 
 I hear even now the infinite fierce chorus. 
 
 The cries of agony, the endless groan. 
 Which, through the ages that have gone before us. 
 
 In long reverberations reach our own. 
 
 On helm and harness rings the Saxon hammer. 
 
 Through Cimbric forest roars the Norseman's song. 
 
 And loud, amid the universal clamour, 
 
 O'er distant deserts sounds the Tartar gong. 
 
 I hear the Florentine, who from his palace 
 Wheels out his battle-bell with dreadful dm, 
 
 And Aztec priests upon their teocallis 
 
 Beat the wild war-drums made of serpent's skm ;

 The tumult of each sacked and burning village ; 
 
 The shout that every prayer for mercy drowns ; 
 The soldiers' revels in the midst of pillage ; 
 
 The wail of famine in beleaguered towns ; 
 
 The bursting shell, the gateway wrenched asunder, 
 The rattling musketry, the clashing blade ; 
 
 And ever and anon, in tones of thunder. 
 The diapason of the cannonade. 
 
 Is it, O man, with such discordant noises, 
 With such accursed instruments as these. 
 
 Thou drownest Nature's sweet and kindly voices, 
 And jarrest the celestial harmonies ? 
 
 Were half the power, that fiUs the world with terror, 
 Were half the wealth, bestowed on camps and courts, 
 
 Given to redeem the human mind from error. 
 There were no need of arsenals nor forts : 
 
 The warrior's name would be a name abhorred ! 
 
 And every nation that should lift again 
 Its hand against a brother, on its forehead 
 
 Would wear for evermore the curse of Cain ! 
 
 Down the dark future, through long generations. 
 The echoing sounds grow fainter, and then cease ; 
 
 And like a bell, with solemn, sweet vibrations, 
 
 I hear once more the voice of Christ say, " Peace !" 
 
 Peace ! and no longer from its brazen portals 
 The blast of War's great organ shakes the skies ! 
 
 But beautiful as songs of the immortals. 
 The holy melodies of love arise. 
 
 The Day is Done. 
 
 The day is done, and the darkness 
 Falls from the wings of Night, 
 
 As a feather is wafted downward 
 From an eagle in its flight.

 I see the lights of the village 
 
 Gleam through the rain and the mist, 
 
 And a feeling of sadness comes o'er me, 
 That my soul cannot resist : 
 
 A feeling of sadness and longing, 
 
 That is not a.1riTi to pain, 
 And resembles sorrow only 
 
 As the mist resembles the rain. 
 
 Come, read to me some poem. 
 
 Some simple and heartfelt lay. 
 That shall soothe this restless feeling. 
 
 And banish the thoughts of day. 
 
 Not from the grand old masters, 
 
 Not from the bards sublime. 
 Whose distant footsteps echo 
 
 Through the corridors of Time. 
 
 For, like strains of martial music. 
 
 Their mighty thoughts suggest 
 Life's endless toil and endeavour ; 
 
 And to-night I long for rest. 
 
 Read from some humbler poet. 
 
 Whose songs gushed from his heart. 
 As showers from the clouds of summer, 
 
 Or tears from the eyelids start ; 
 
 Who, through long days of labour. 
 
 And nights devoid of ease, 
 Still heard in his soul the music 
 
 Of wonderful melodies. 
 
 Such songs have power to quiet 
 
 The restless pulse of care. 
 And come like the benediction 
 
 That follows after prayer.

 Then read from the treasured volume 
 
 The poem of thy choice, 
 And lend to the rhyme of the poet 
 
 The beauty of thy voice. 
 
 And the night shall be filled with music, 
 A'nd the cares that infest the day, 
 
 Shall fold their tents, like the Arabs, 
 And as silently steal away. 
 
 Beethoven at the Piano. 
 
 See where Beethoven sits alone — a dream of days elysian, 
 
 A crownless king upon a throne, reflected in a vision — 
 
 The man who strikes the potent chords which make the world, 
 
 in wonder, 
 Acknowledge him, though poor and dim, the mouthpiece of 
 
 the thunder. 
 
 He feels the music of the skies the while his heart is breaking; 
 He sings the songs of Paradise, where love has no forsaking ; 
 And, though so deaf he cannot hear the tempest as a token, 
 He makes the music of his mind the grandest ever spoken. 
 
 He doth not hear the whispered word of love in his seclusion. 
 Or voice of friend, or song of bird, in Nature's sad confusion ; 
 But he hath made, for Love's sweet sake, so wild a declamation. 
 That all true lovers of the earth have claimed him of their 
 nation.

 O minstrel, whom a maiden spurned, but whom a world has 
 
 treasured ! 
 O sovereign of a grander realm than man has ever measured ! 
 Thou hast not lost the lips of love, but thou hast gained, in 
 
 glory. 
 The love of all who know the thrall of thine immortal story. 
 
 VI. 
 
 Thou art the bard whom none discard, but whom all men dis- 
 cover 
 To be a God, as Orpheus was, albeit a lonely lover ; 
 A king to caU. the stones to life beside the roaring ocean. 
 And bid the stars discourse to trees in words of man's emotion. 
 
 VII. 
 
 A king of joys, a prince of tears, an emperor of the seasons, 
 Whose songs are like the sway of years in Love's immortal 
 
 reasons ; 
 A bard who knows no Me but this : to love and be rejected, 
 And reproduce in earthly strains the prayers of the elected. 
 
 VIII. 
 
 O poet heart ! O seraph soul ! by men and maids adorfed ! 
 Titan with the lion's mane, and with the splendid forehead ! 
 We men who bow to thee in grief must tremble in our gladness, 
 To know what tears were turned to pearls to crown thee in 
 thy sadness. 
 
 IX. 
 
 An angel by direct descent, a German by alliance, 
 
 Thou didst intone the wonder-chords which made Despair a

 Yea, thou didst strike so grand a note that, in its large vibra- 
 tion. 
 
 It seemed the roaring of the sea in nature's jubilation.

 again, it is thine own calm home, thy crystal shrine, thy 
 habitation from eternity ! — O dread and silent mount ! I 
 gazed upon thee, till thou, still present to the bodily sense, 
 didst vanish from my thought : entranced in prayer, I wor- 
 shipped the Invisible alone. 
 
 Yet, like some sweet beguiling melody, so sweet we know 
 not we are listening to it, thou, the meanwhile, wast blending 
 with my thought, yea, with my life and life's own secret joy ; 
 till the dilating soul, enrapt, transfused into the mighty vision 
 passing, — there, as in her natural form, swelled vast to heaven ! 
 
 Awake, my soul ! not only passive praise thou owest ! not

 Awake ! — voice of sweet song ! Awake, my heart, awake, 
 green vales and icy cliffs, all join my hymn ! 
 
 Thou first and chief, sole sovran of the vale ! O, struggling 
 with the darkness all the night, and visited all night by troops 
 of stars, or when they chmb the sky, or when they sink ; — 
 companion of the morning-star at dawn, thyself Earth's rosy 
 star, and of the dawn co-herald, — wake, O wake, and utter 
 praise ! — ^Who sank thy sunless pillars deep in earth 1 Who

 upward from thy base slow travelling, with dim eyes suffused 
 with tears, solemnly seemest, like a vapoury cloud, to rise 
 before me, — rise, O ever, rise ! rise like a cloud of incense 
 from the earth ! Thou kingly spirit, throned among the hUls ! 
 thou dread ambassador from earth to heaven ! great Hierarch ! 
 tell thou the silent sky, and tell the stars, and tell yon rising

 Annabel Lee. 
 
 It was many and many a year ago, in a kingdom by the 
 Sea, that a Maiden there lived, whom you may know by the 
 name of Annabel Leej and this Maiden she lived with no 
 other thought, than to love, and be loved, by me ! / was a 
 child, and she was a chUd, in this kingdom by the Sea : but 
 we loved with a love that was more than love, — I and my 
 Annabel Lee ; with a love that the winged seraphs of heaven 
 coveted her and me ! And this was the reason that, long ago, 
 in this kingdom by the Sea, a wind blew out of the cloud, 
 chilling my beautiful Annabel Lee ; so that her high-bom 
 kinsmen came, and tore her away from me, to shut her up in 
 a sepulchre— in this kingdom by the Sea. The Angels, not 
 half so happy in heaven, went envying her and me ; yes ! that 
 was the reason (as all men know, in this kingdom by the Sea) 
 that the Wind came out of the cloud by night, chilling and 
 killing my Annabel Lee. But our love it was stronger by far

 than the love of those who are older than we — of many far 
 wiser than we ; and neither the Angels, in heaven above, — nor 
 the Demons, down under the sea, — can ever dissever my soul, 
 from the soul of the beautiful Annabel Lee ! For the moon 
 never beams without bringing me dreams of the beautiful 
 Annabel Lee ; and the stars never rise but I feel the bright 
 eyes of the beautiful Annabel Lee ; and so, all the night-tide, 
 I lie down by the side of my darling — my darHng — my life and 
 my bride : in her sepulchre there by the Sea, — in her tomb by 
 the sounding Sea !

 What link existed, human or divine. 
 Between the tiny tot six summers old. 
 And yonder life of mine upon the hills 
 Among the mists and storms ? 'T is strange, 't is strange ! 
 But when I looked on Willie's face, it seem'd 
 That I had known it in some beauteous life 
 That I had left behind me in the north. 
 This fancy grew and grew, till oft I sat — 
 The buzzing school around me — and would seem 
 To be among the mists, the tracks of rain, 
 Nearing the hueless sUence of the snow. 
 Slowly and surely I began to feel 
 That I was all alone in all the world, 
 And that my mother and my father slept 
 Far, far away, in some forgotten kirk — 
 Remember'd but in dreams. Alone at nights, 
 I read my Bible more and Euclid less. 
 
 And when we read the Holy Book, the child 
 Would think and think o'er parts he loved the best ; 
 The draught of fish, the Child that sat so wise 
 In the great Temple, Herod's cruel law

 To slay the weans, or — oftenest of all — 
 
 The Crucifixion, of the Good Kind Man 
 
 Who loved the weans and was a wean Himself. 
 
 He speir'd of death ; and were the sleepers cold 
 
 Down in the dark wet earth ? and was it God 
 
 That put the grass and flowers in the kirk-yard ? 
 
 What kind of dwelling-place was heaven above ? 
 
 And was it full of flowers ? and were there schools 
 
 And dominies there ? and was it far away ?

 As if he knew fuU brawly what we said, 
 
 And ponder'd o'er it, wiser far than we. 
 
 But how I answer'd, how explain'd these themes, 
 
 I know not. Oft I could not speak at all. 
 
 Yet every question made me think of things 
 
 Forgotten, puzzled so, and when I strove 
 
 To reason, puzzled me so much the more, 
 
 That, flinging logic to the winds, I went 
 
 Straight onward to the mark in Willie's way, 
 
 Took most for granted, laid down premises 
 
 Of Faith, imagined, gave my wit the reins, 
 
 And oft on nights at e'en, to my surprise, 
 
 Felt palpably an angel's glowing face 
 
 Glimmering down upon me, while mine eyes 
 
 Dimm'd their old orbs with tears that came unhid 
 
 To bear the glory of the light they saw.

 I started to my feet, look'd out, and knew 
 The winter wind was whistling from the clouds 
 To lash the snow-clothed plain, and to myself 
 I prophesied a storm before the night. 
 Then with an icy pain, an eldritch gleam, 
 I thought of Willie ; Ijut I cheer'd my heart, 
 " He's home, and with his mother, long ere this ! "

 I closed the door, and turn'd me to the fire, 
 With something on my heart — a load — a sense 
 Of an impending pain. Down the broad lum 
 Came melting flakes that hiss'd upon the coal ; 
 Under my eyelids blew the blinding smoke, 
 And for a time I sat like one bewitch'd, 
 Still as a stone. The lonely room grew dark, 
 The flickering fire threw phantoms of the snow 
 Along the floor and on the walls around ; 
 The melancholy ticking of the clock 
 Was like the beating of my heart. But, hush ! 
 Above the moaning of the wind I heard 
 A sudden scraping at the door : my heart 
 Stood still and listen'd ; and with that there rose 
 An awsome howl, shrill as a dying screech. 
 And scrape-scrape-scrape, the sound beyond the door ! 
 I could not think — I could not breathe — a dark, 
 Awful foreboding gript me like a hand, 
 As opening the door I gazed straight out, 
 Saw nothing, till I felt against my knees 
 Something that moved, and heard a moaning sound — 
 Then, panting, moaning, o'er the threshold leapt 
 Donald the dog, alone, and white with snow. 
 
 Down, Donald ! down, old man ! Sir, look at him ! 
 I swear he knows the meaning of my words, 
 And though he cannot speak, his heart is full ! 
 See now ! see now ! he puts his cold black nose 
 Into my palm, and whines ! he knows, he knows ! 
 Would speak, and cannot, but he minds that night ! 
 
 The terror of my heart seem'd choking me ! 
 Dumbly I stared and wildly at the dog. 
 Who gazed into my face and whined and moan'd, 
 Leap'd at the door, then touch'd me with his paws, 
 And, lastly, gript my coat between his teeth, 
 And pull'd and pull'd — whiles growling, whining whiles- 
 Till fairly madden'd, in bewilder'd fear, 
 I let him drag me through the banging door 
 Out to the whirling storm. Bareheaded, wild, 
 The wind and snow-drift beating on my face,

 Blowing me liither, thither, with the dog 
 
 I dash'd along the road. What foUow'd seem'd 
 
 An eerie, eerie dream ! — a world of snow, 
 
 A sky of wind, a whirling howling mist 
 
 Which swam around with hundred sickly eyes ; 
 
 And Donald dragging, dragging, beaten, bruised, 
 
 Leading me on to something that I fear'd — 
 
 An awful something, and I knew not what ! 
 
 On, on, and farther on, and still the snow 
 
 Whirling, the tempest moaning ! Then I mind 
 
 Of groping, groping in the shadowy light. 
 
 And Donald by me burrowing with his nose 
 
 And whining. Next a darkness, blank and deep ! 
 
 But then I mind of tearing through the storm, 
 
 StumbHng and tripping, bhnd and deaf and dumb, 
 
 And holding to my heart an icy load 
 
 I clutch'd with freezing fingers. Far away — 
 
 It seem'd long miles on miles away — I saw 
 
 A yellow light — unto that Ught I tore — 
 
 And last, remember opening a door 
 
 And falling, dazzled by a blinding gleam 
 
 Of human faces and a flaming fire. 
 
 And with a crash of voices in my ears 
 
 Fading away into a world of snow. 
 
 The Singing Leaves. 
 
 A BALLAD. 
 I. 
 " What fairings will ye that I bring ? " 
 
 Said the King to his daughters three ; 
 " For I to Vanity Fair am boun'. 
 Now say what shall they be ? " 
 
 Then up and spake the eldest daughter. 
 
 That lady tall and grand : 
 " Oh, bring me pearls and diamonds great, 
 
 And gold rings for my hand."

 Thereafter spake the second daughter, 
 
 That was both white and red : 
 " For me bring silks that will stand alone, 
 
 And a gold comb for my head." 
 
 Then came the turn of the least daughter, 
 
 That was whiter than thistle-down. 
 And among the gold of her blithesome hair 
 
 Dim shone the golden crown. 
 
 " There came a bird this morning. 
 
 And sang 'neath my bower eaves. 
 Till I dreamed, as his music made me, 
 
 'Ask thou for the Singing Leaves.'" 
 
 Then the brow of the King swelled crimson 
 
 With a flush of angry scorn : 
 " Well have ye spoken, my two eldest. 
 
 And chosen as ye were born ; 
 
 " But she, like a thing of peasant race, 
 
 That is happy binding the sheaves ; " 
 Then he saw her dead mother in her face. 
 
 And said, " Thou shalt have thy leaves." 
 
 II. 
 He mounted and rode three days and nights 
 
 Till he came to Vanity Fair, 
 And 'twas easy to buy the gems and the silk, 
 
 But no Singing Leaves were there. 
 
 Then deep in the greenwood rode he. 
 
 And asked of every tree, 
 " Oh, if you have ever a Singing Leaf, 
 
 I pray you give it me ! " 
 
 But the trees all kept their counsel, 
 
 And never a word said they. 
 Only there sighed from the pine-tops 
 
 A music of seas far away. 
 
 Only the pattering aspen 
 
 Made a sound of growing rain.

 That fell ever faster and faster, 
 Then faltered to silence again. 
 
 " Oh, where shall I find a little foot-page 
 That would win both hose and shoon. 
 
 And will bring to me the Singing Leaves 
 If they grow under the moon ? " 
 
 Then lightly turned him Walter the page. 
 
 By the stirrup as he ran : 
 " Now pledge you me the truesome word 
 
 Of a king and gentleman, 
 
 " That you will give me the first, first thing 
 
 You meet at your castle-gate. 
 And the Princess shall get the Singing Leaves, 
 
 Or mine be a traitor's fate." 
 
 The Eling's head dropt upon his breast 
 
 A moment, as it might be ; 
 'Twill be my dog, he thought, and said, 
 
 " My faith I plight to thee." 
 
 Then Walter took from next his heart 
 
 A packet small and thin, 
 " Now give you this to the Princess Anne, 
 
 The Singing Leaves are therein." 
 
 III. 
 
 As the King rode in at his castle-gate, 
 
 A maiden to meet him ran. 
 And " Welcome, father ! " she laughed and cried 
 
 Together, the Princess Anne. 
 
 " Lo, here the Singing Leaves," quoth he, 
 " And woe, but they cost me dear ! " 
 
 She took the packet, and the smile 
 Deepened down beneath the tear. 
 
 It deepened down till it reached her heart, 
 
 And then gushed up again, 
 And lighted her tears as the sudden sun 
 
 Transfigures the summer rain.

 And the first Leaf, when it was opened, 
 
 Sang : "I am Walter the page, 
 And the songs I sing 'neath thy window 
 
 Are my only heritage." 
 
 And the second Leaf sang : " But in the land 
 
 That is neither on earth or sea. 
 My lute and I are lords of more 
 
 Than thrice this kingdom's fee." 
 
 And the third Leaf sang : " Be miae ! Be mine ! " 
 
 And ever it sang, " Be mine ! " 
 Then sweeter it sang and ever sweeter, 
 
 And said, " I am thine, thine, thine ! " 
 
 At the first Leaf she grew pale enough, 
 
 At the second she turned aside. 
 At the third, 'twas as if a lily flushed 
 
 With a rose's red heart's tide. 
 
 " Good counsel gave the bird," said she, 
 
 " I have my hope thrice o'er, 
 For they sing to my very heart," she said, 
 
 " And it sings to them evermore." 
 
 She brought to him her beauty and truth. 
 
 But and broad earldoms three. 
 And he made her queen of the broader lands 
 
 He held of his lute in fee. 
 
 Hiawatha and the Pearl-Feather. 
 
 On the shores of Gitche Gumee, 
 Of the shining Big-Sea- Water, 
 Stood Nokomis, the old woman, 
 Pointing with hpr finger westward, 
 O'er the waters pointing westward, 
 To the purple clouds of sunset. 
 
 Fiercely the red sun descending 
 Burned his way along the heavens, 
 Set the sky on fire behind him. 
 As war parties, when retreating,

 Burn the prairies on their ■war-trail ; 
 And the moon, the Night-Sun, eastward, 
 Suddenly starting from his ambush, 
 Followed fast those bloody footprints, 
 Followed in that fiery war-trail, 
 With its glare upon its features. 
 
 And Nokomis, the old woman. 
 Pointing with her finger westward. 
 Spake these words to Hiawatha : 
 " Yonder dwells the great Pearl-Feather, 
 Megissogwon, the Magician, 
 Manito of Wealth and Wampum, 
 Guarded by his fiery serpents, 
 Guarded by his black pitch-water. 
 You can see his fiery serpents. 
 The Kenabeek, the great serpents. 
 Coiling, playing in the water ; 
 You can see the black-pitch water 
 Stretching far away beyond them. 
 To the purple clouds of sunset ! 
 
 " He it was who slew my father. 
 By his wicked wiles and cunning. 
 When he from the moon descended, 
 When he came on earth to seek me. 
 He, the mightiest of Magicians, 
 Sends the fever from the marshes, 
 Sends the pestilential vapours. 
 Sends the poisonous exhalations. 
 Sends the white fog from the fen-lands, 
 Sends disease and death among us ! 
 
 " Take your bow, O Hiawatha, 
 Take your arrows, jasper-headed, 
 Take your war-club, Puggawaugun, 
 And your mittens, Myijekahwun, 
 And your birch canoe for sailing, 
 And the oil of Mishe-Nahma, 
 So to smear its sides, that swiftly 
 You may pass the black pitch- water ; 
 Slay this merciless magician. 
 Save the people from the fever

 That he breathes across the fen-lands, 
 And avenge my father's murder ! " 
 
 Straightway then my Hiawatha 
 Armed himself with all his war gear, 
 Launched his birch canoe for sailing ; 
 With his palm its sides he patted, 
 Said with glee, " Cheemaun, my darling, 
 O my Birch Canoe ! leap forward. 
 Where you see the fiery serpents, 
 Where you see the black pitch- water ! " 
 
 Forward leaped Cheemaun exulting. 
 And the noble Hiawatha 
 Sang his war-song wild and woful. 
 And above him the war-eagle, 
 The Keneu, the great war-eagle, 
 Master of all fowls with feathers. 
 Screamed and hurtled through the heavens. 
 
 Soon he reached the fiery serpents, 
 The Kenabeek, the great serpents. 
 Lying huge upon the water. 
 Sparkling, rippling in the water. 
 Lying coiled across the passage. 
 With their blazing crests uplifted, 
 Breathing fiery fogs and vapours. 
 So that none could pass beyond them. 
 
 But the fearless Hiawatha 
 Cried aloud, and spake in this wise : 
 " Let me pass my way, Kenabeek, 
 Let me go upon my journey ! " 
 And they answered, hissing fiercely. 
 With their fiery breath made answer : 
 " Back, go back ! O Shaugodaya ! 
 Back to old Nokomis, Paint-heart ! " 
 
 Then the angry Hiawatha 
 B.aised his mighty bow of ash-tree. 
 Seized his arrows, jasper-headed. 
 Shot them fast among the serpents ; 
 Every twanging of the bow-string 
 Was a war-cry and a death-cry. 
 Every whizzing of an arrow

 Was a death-song of Kenabeek. 
 
 Weltering in the bloody water, 
 Dead lay all the fiery serpents, 
 And among them Hiawatha 
 Harmless sailed, and cried exulting : 
 " Onward, O Cheemaun, my darling ! 
 Onward to the black pitch-water ! " 
 
 Then he took the oil of Nahma, 
 And the bows and sides anointed, 
 Smeared them well with oil, that swiftly 
 He might pass the black pitch-water. 
 
 AU night long he sailed upon it. 
 Sailed upon that sluggish water, 
 Covered with its mould of ages, 
 Black with rotten water-rushes, 
 Rank with flags and leaves of lilies. 
 Stagnant, Ufeless, dreary, dismal, 
 Lighted by the shimmering moonlight, 
 And by will-o'-the-wisps illumined. 
 Fires by ghosts of dead men kindled, 
 In their weary night-encampments. 
 
 AU the air was white with moonlight, 
 All the water black with shadow. 
 And around him the Suggema, 
 The mosquitos, sang their war-song. 
 And the fixe-flies, Wah-wah-taysee, 
 Waved their torches to mislead him ; 
 And the bull-frog, the Dahinda, 
 Thrust his head into the moonlight. 
 Fixed his yeUow eyes upon him. 
 Sobbed and sank beneath the surface ; 
 And anon a thousand whistles 
 Answered over all the fen-lands. 
 And the heron, the Shuh-shuh-gah, 
 Far oflf on the reedy margin. 
 Heralded the hero's coming. 
 
 Westward thus fared Hiawatha, 
 Toward the realm of Megissogwon, 
 Toward the land of the Pearl-Feather, 
 Till the level moon stared at him,

 In his face stared pale and haggard, 
 Till the siin was hot behind him, 
 Till it burned upon his shoulders, 
 And before him on the upland 
 He could see the Shining Wigwam 
 Of the Manito of Wampum, 
 Of the mightiest of IMagioians. 
 
 Then once more Cheemaun he patted. 
 To his birch canoe said, " Onward ! " 
 And it stirred in all its fibres, 
 And with one great bound of triumph 
 Leaped across the water lilies, 
 Leaped through tangled flags and rushes, 
 And upon the beach beyond them 
 Dry-shod landed Hiawatha. 
 
 Straight he took his bow of ash-tree, 
 On the sand one end he rested. 
 With his knee he pressed the middle, 
 Stretched the faithful bow-string tighter, 
 Took an arrow jasper-headed. 
 Shot it at the Shining Wigwam, 
 Sent it singing as a herald. 
 As a bearer of his message. 
 Of his challenge loud and lofty : 
 " Come forth from your lodge, Pearl-Feather ! 
 Hiawatha waits your coming ! " 
 
 Straightway from the Shining Wigwam 
 Came the mighty Megissogwon, 
 Tall of stature, broad of shoulder. 
 Dark and terrible in aspect. 
 Clad from head to foot in wampum. 
 Armed with all his warlike weapons, 
 Painted like the sky of morning. 
 Streaked with crimson, blue, and yellow, 
 Crested with great eagle-feathers ! 
 Streaming upward, streaming outward. 
 
 " Well I know you, Hiawatha ! " 
 Cried he in a voice of thunder. 
 In a tone of loud derision. 
 " Hasten back, O Shaugodaya ! 
 


## p. (#150) ################################################

138 The Elements of Elocution. 
 
 Hasten back among the women, 
 Back to old Nokomis, Faint-heart ! 
 I will slay you as you stand there, 
 As of old I slew her father ! " 
 
 But my Hiawatha answered. 
 Nothing daunted, fearing nothing : 
 " Big words do not smite like war-clubs, 
 Boastful breath is not a bow-string, 
 Taunts are not so sharp as arrows, 
 Deeds are better things than words are, 
 Actions mightier than boastings ! " 
 
 Then began the greatest battle 
 That the sun had ever looked on. 
 That the war-birds ever witnessed. 
 All a Summer's day it lasted, 
 From the sunrise to the sunset ; 
 For the shafts of Hiawatha 
 Harmless hit the shirt of wampum, 
 Harmless fell the blows he dealt it 
 With his mittens, Minjekahwun, 
 Harmless fell the heavy war-club ; 
 It could dash the rocks asunder. 
 But it could not break the meshes 
 Of that magic shirt of wampum. 
 
 Till at sunset Hiawatha, 
 Leaning on his bow of ash-tree. 
 Wounded, weary, and desponding, 
 With his mighty war-club broken. 
 With his mittens torn and tattered, 
 And three useless arrows only. 
 Paused to rest beneath a pine-tree. 
 From whose branches trailed the mosses, 
 And whose trunk was coated over 
 With the Dead-man's Moccasia-leather, 
 With the fungus white and yellow. 
 
 Suddenly from the boughs above him 
 Sang the Mama, the woodpecker : 
 " Aim your arrows, Hiawatha, 
 At the head of Megissogwon, 
 Strike the tuft of hair upon it.

 At their roots the long black tresses ; 
 There alone can he be wounded ! " 
 
 Winged with feathers, tipped with jasper, 
 Swift flew Hiawatha's arrow, 
 Just as Megissogwon, stooping. 
 Raised a heavy stone to throw it. 
 Full upon the crown it struck him, 
 At the roots of his long tresses. 
 And he reeled and staggered forward, 
 Plunging like a wounded bison. 
 Yes, Hke Pezhekee, the bison, 
 "When the snow is on the prairie. 
 
 Swifter flew the second arrow 
 In the pathway of the other, 
 Piercing deeper than the other. 
 Wounding sorer than the other ; 
 And the knees of Megissogwon 
 Shook like windy reeds beneath him. 
 Bent and trembled like the rushes. 
 
 But the third and latest arrow 
 Swiftest flew, and wounded sorest. 
 And the mighty Megissogwon 
 Saw the fiery eyes of Pauguk, 
 Saw the eyes of death glare at him. 
 Heard his voice call in the darkness ; 
 At the feet of Hiawatha 
 Lifeless lay the great Pearl-Feather, 
 Lay the mightiest of Magicians. 
 
 Then the grateful Hiawatha 
 Called the Mama, the woodpecker. 
 From his perch among the branches 
 Of the melancholy pine-tree. 
 And, in honour of his service, 
 Stained with blood the tuft of feathers 
 On the little head of Mama ; 
 Even to this day he wears it. 
 Wears the tuft of crimson feathers. 
 As a symbol of his service. 
 
 Then he stript the shirt of wampum 
 From the back of Megissogwon,

 As a trophy of the battle, 
 
 As a signal of his conquest. 
 
 On the shore he left the body, 
 
 Half on land, and half in water. 
 
 In the sand his feet were buried, 
 
 And his face was in the water. 
 
 And above him wheeled and clamoured 
 
 The Keneu, the great war-eagle, 
 
 Sailing Vound in narrower circles. 
 
 Hovering nearer, nearer, nearer. 
 
 From the wigwam Hiawatha 
 Bore the wealth of Megissogwon, 
 All his wealth of skins and wampum, 
 Furs of bison and of beaver, 
 Furs of sable and of ermine. 
 Wampum belts and strings and pouches, 
 Quivers wrought with beads of wampum, 
 FiUed with arrows, silver-headed. 
 
 Homeward then he sailed exulting. 
 Homeward through the black pitch-water. 
 Homeward through the weltering serpents, 
 "With the trophies of the battle. 
 With a shout and song of triumph. 
 
 On the shore stood old Nokomis, 
 On the shore stood Chibiabos, 
 And the very strong man, Kwasind, 
 Waiting for the hero's coming. 
 Listening to his song of triumph. 
 And the people of the village 
 Welcomed him with songs and dances. 
 Made a joyous feast, and shouted : 
 " Honour be to Hiawatha ! 
 He has slain the great Pearl-Feather, 
 Slain the mightiest of Magicians, 
 Him, who sent the fiery fever. 
 Sent the white fog from the fen-lands. 
 Sent disease and death amongst us ! " 
 
 Ever dear to Hiawatha 
 Was the memory of Mama ! 
 And in token of his friendship,

 As a mark of his remembrance, 
 He adorned and decked his pipe-stem 
 With the crimson tuft of feathers, 
 With the blood-red crest of Mama. 
 But the wealth of Megissogwon, 
 All the trophies of the battle, 
 He divided with his people. 
 Shared it equally among them. 
 
 Barbara Fritchie. 
 
 Up from the meadows rich with corn, clear in the cool 
 September morn, the clustered spires of Frederick stand, 
 green-walled by the hills of Maryland. Eound about them 
 orchards sweep, — apple and peach-tree fruited deep, — fair 
 as a garden of the Lord to the eyes of the famished rebel 
 horde; on that pleasant morn of the early fall, when Lee 
 marched over the mountain wall, — over the mountains 
 winding down, horse and foot, into Frederick town. Forty 
 flags with their silver stars, forty flags with their crimson 
 bars, flapped in the morning wind: the sun of noon looked 
 down, and saw not one. — Up rose old Barbara Fritchie then, 
 bowed with her fourscore years and ten; bravest of all in 
 Frederick town, she took up the flag the men hauled down : 
 in her attic window the staff she set, to show that one heart 
 was loyal yet. . . . Up the street came the rebel tread, Stone- 
 wall Jackson riding ahead. Under his slouched hat, left and 
 right, he glanced : the old flag met his sight. " Halt ! " — the 
 dust-brown ranks stood fast. " Fire ! " — out blazed the rifle- 
 blast. It shivered the window, pane and sash ; it rent the 
 banner with seam and gash. Quick as it fell from the broken 
 staff. Dame Barbara snatched the silken scarf ; she leaned far 
 out on the window-sill, and shook it forth with a royal will. 
 " Shoot, if you must, this old grey head, — but spare your 
 country's flag ! " she said. 
 
 A shade of sadness, a blush of shame, over the face of the 
 leader came ; the nobler nature within him stirred to life at 
 that woman's deed and word. " Who touches a hair of yon 
 gray head, dies like a dog ! March on ! " he said. . . . All day

 long through Frederick street sounded the tread of marching 
 feet ; all day long that free flag tossed over the heads of the 
 rebel host. Ever its torn folds rose and fell on the loyal winds 
 that loved it well; and, through the hill-gaps, sunset light 
 shone over it with a warm good-night. 
 
 Barbara Fritchie's work is o'er, and the Rebel rides on lais 
 raids no more. Honour to her ! — and let a tear fall, for her 
 sake, on Stonewall's bier. Over Barbara Fritchie's grave, flag 
 of Freedom and Union wave ! Peace, and order, and beauty, 
 draw round thy symbol of light and law ; and ever the stars 
 above look down on thy stars below in Frederick town ! 
 
 MAUD MULLER. 
 
 Maud Miiller, on a summer's day, raked the meadow sweet 
 with hay. Beneath her torn hat glowed the wealth of simple 
 beauty and rustic health. Singing, she wrought, and her 
 merry glee the mock-bird echoed from his tree. But, when she 
 glanced to the far-off town, white from its hQl-slope looking 
 down, the sweet song died ; and a vague unrest and a nameless 
 longing filled her breast — a wish, that she hardly dared to own, 
 for something better than she had known ! 
 
 The Judge rode slowly down the lane, smoothing his horse's 
 chestnut mane. He drew his bridle in the shade of the apple- 
 trees, to greet the Maid, and ask a draught, from the spring 
 that flowed through the meadows across the road. — She stooped 
 where the cool spring bubbles up, and filled for him her small 
 tin cup ; and blushed as she gave it, looking down on her feet 
 so bare, and her tattered gown. " Thanks ! " said the Judge, 
 " a sweeter draught from a fairer hand was never quaffed." He 
 spoke of the grass, and flowers, and trees, of the singing birds, 
 and the humming bees ; then talked of the haying, and won- 
 dered whether the cloud in the west would bring foul weather. 
 And Maud forgot her briar-torn gown, and her graceful ankles 
 bare and brown ; and listened, while a pleased surprise looked 
 from her long-lashed hazel eyes. — At last, like one who for 
 delay seeks a vain excuse, he rode away ! 
 
 Maud Miiller looked and sighed: "Ah me! that I the 
 Judge's bride might be ! He would dress me up in silks so fine,

The Elemettts of Eloaitiott. 143 
 
 and praise and toast me at his wine. My father should wear 
 a broad-cloth coat ; my brother should sail a painted boat. I'd 
 dress my mother so grand and gay ! and the baby should have 
 a new toy each day. And I'd feed the hungry, and clothe the 
 poor, and all should bless me who left our door." 
 
 The Judge looked back as he climbed the hill, and saw Maud 
 Miiller standing still. " A form more fair, a face more sweet, 
 ne'er hath it been my lot to meet. And her modest answer 
 and graceful air, show her wise and good as she is fair. Would 
 she were mine ! and I to-day, like her, a harvester of hay : no 
 doubtful balance of rights and wrongs, and weary lawyers with 
 endless tongues ; but low of cattle, and song of birds, and 
 health of quiet and loving words." Then he thought of his 
 sisters, proud and cold ; and his mother, vain of her rank and 
 gold. So, closing his heart, the Judge rode on, and Maud was 
 left in the field alone. But the lawyers smiled that afternoon, 
 when he hummed in court an old love tune ; — and the young girl 
 mused beside the well, till the rain on the unraked clover fell. 
 
 He wedded a wife of richest dower, who lived for fashion, as 
 he for power. Yet oft in his marble hearth's bright glow, he 
 watched a picture come and go : and sweet Maud MiiUer's 
 hazel eyes looked out in their innocent surprise. Oft when the 
 wine in his glass was red, he longed for the wayside-weU instead; 
 and closed has eyes on his garnished rooms, to dream of meadows 
 and clover blooms. And the proud man sighed, with a secret 
 pain : " Ah ! that I were free again ! free as when I rode that 
 day, where the barefoot maiden raked her hay." 
 
 She wedded a man unlearn'd and poor, and many children 
 played round her door. But care and sorrow, and household 
 pain, left their traces on heart and brain. And oft, when the 
 summer-sun shone hot on the new-mown hay in the meadow 
 lot, in the shade of the apple-tree, again she saw a Rider draw 
 his rein: and, gazing down with timid grace, she felt his 
 pleased eyes read her face. Sometimes her narrow kitchen 
 waUs stretched away into stately halls ; the weary wheel to a 
 spinnet turned, the tallow candle an astral burned ; and, for 
 him who sat by the chimney lug, dozing and grumbling o'er 
 pipe and mug, a manly form at her side she saw, — and joy was 
 duty, and love was law! . . . Then, she took up her 
 burden of Hfe again, saying only, " It might have been ! "

 Alas for Maiden ! alas for Judge ! for rich repiner and 
 household drudge ! God pity them both ! and pity us all, who 
 vainly the dreams of youth recall. For, of all sad words of 
 tongue or pen, the saddest are these : " It might have been ! " 
 Ah, well for us all some sweet hope lies deeply buried from 
 human eyes ; and, in the Hereafter, angels may roll the stone

 (D) DESCRIPTIVE. 
 
 The Bishop and the Caterpillar. 
 
 The Bishop sat in the Schoolmaster's chair : 
 The Rector, and Curates two, were there. 
 
 The Doctor, the Squire, 
 
 The heads of the Choir, 
 And the Gentry around of high degree, 
 A highly distinguished company; 
 For the Bishop was greatly beloved in his See ! 
 
 And there below, 
 
 A goodly show. 
 Their faces with soap and with pleasure aglow. 
 Sat the dear little school-children, row upon row ; 
 For the Bishop had said ('twas the death-blow to schism). 
 He would hear those dear children their Catechism. 
 
 And then to complete 
 
 The pleasure so sweet 
 Of these nice little children so pretty and neat. 
 He'd invited them to a magnificent treat ! 
 And filled were the minds of these dear little ones 
 With visions of cakes, and of " gay Sally Lunns," 
 Of oceans of tea, and unlimited buns 
 (The large ones called " Bath," not the plain penny ones). 
 
 I think I have read. 
 
 Or at least heard it said : 
 " Boys are always in mischief, unless they're in bed." 
 
 I put it to you, 
 
 I don't say it is true.

 But if you should ask for my own private view, 
 
 I should answer at once, without further ado, 
 
 " I don't think a boy can be trusted to keep 
 
 From mischief in bed — unless he's asleep !" 
 
 But the Schoolmaster's eye hath a magic spell, 
 
 And the boys were behaving remarkably weU — 
 
 For boys ; and the girls — but 'tis needless to say 
 
 Their conduct was perfect in every way ; 
 
 For I'm sure 'tis well known in all raniks of society, 
 
 That girls always behave with the utmost propriety. 
 
 Now the Bishop arises, and waves his hand ; 
 
 And the children prepared for his questions stand ; 
 
 With admiring eyes his form they scan ; 
 
 He was a remarkably fine looking man ! 
 
 His apron was silk of the blackest dye, 
 
 His lawn the finest money could buy ; 
 
 His sleeves and his ruffles than snow were whiter. 
 
 He'd his best shovel-hat, and his second-best mitre. 
 
 With benignant glance he gazed around — 
 
 You might have heard the slightest sound ! — 
 
 With dignified mien and solemn look 
 
 He slowly opened his ponderous book, 
 
 And proceeded at once the knowledge to try 
 
 Of those nice little children standing by. 
 
 Each child knew its name. 
 
 And who gave it the same, 
 And all the rest of the questions profound 
 Which his Lordship was pleased to the school to propound. 
 Nor less did secular knowledge abound. 
 For the Bishop, to his great pleasure, found 
 That they knew the date when our Queen was crowned, 
 And the number of pence which make up a pound ; 
 And the oceans and seas which our island bound ; 
 That the earth is nearly, but not quite, round ; 
 Their orthography, also, was equally sound, 
 And the Bishop, at last, completely astound- 
 
 Ed, cried. 
 
 In a tone of pride, 
 " You bright little dears, no question can trouble you. 
 You've spelled knife with a k, and wrong with a w.

 " And now that my pleasing task 's at an end, 
 
 I trust you will make of me a friend : 
 
 You've answered my questions, and 'tis but fair 
 
 That I in replying should take a share ; 
 
 So if there is aught you would like to know. 
 
 Pray ask me about it before I go. 
 
 I'm sure it would give me the greatest pleasure 
 
 To add to your knowledge, for learning 's a treasure 
 
 Which you never can lose, and which no one can steal ; 
 
 It grows by imparting, so do not feel 
 
 Afraid or shy. 
 
 But boldly try, 
 Which is the cleverer, you or I ! " 
 
 Thus amusement with learning judiciously blending. 
 
 His Lordship made of his speech an ending, 
 
 And a murmur went round of " How condescending ! " 
 
 But one bright little boy didn't care a jot 
 If his Lordship were condescending or not ; 
 
 For, with scarce a pause 
 
 For the sounds of applause, 
 
 He raised his head, 
 
 And abruptly said : 
 " How many legs has a Caterpillar got ? " 
 
 Now the Bishop was a learned man. 
 
 Bishops always were since the race began. 
 
 But his knowledge in that particular line 
 
 Was less than yours, and no greater than mine j 
 
 And, except that he knew the creature could crawl. 
 
 He knew nothing about its legs at all — 
 
 Whether the number were great or small, 
 
 One hundred, or five, or sixty, or six, — 
 
 So he felt in a " pretty consid'rable fix ! " 
 
 But, resolving his ignorance to hide. 
 
 In measured tones he thus replied : 
 
 *' The Caterpillar, my dear little boy, 
 Is an emblem of life and a vision of joy ! 
 It bursts from its shell on a bright green leaf, 
 It knows no care, and it feels no grief."

 Then he turned to the Rector and whispered low, 
 
 " Mr. Rector, how many? You surely must know." 
 
 But the Rector gravely shook his head, 
 
 He hadn't the faintest idea, he said. 
 
 So the Bishop turned to the class again. 
 
 And in tones paternal took up the strain : 
 
 " The Caterpillar, dear children, see, 
 
 On its bright green leaf from care lives free, 
 
 And it eats, and eats, and grows bigger and bigger, 
 
 (Perhaps the Curates can state the figure ?) " 
 
 But the Curates couldn't ; the Bishop went on. 
 
 Though he felt that another chance was gone. 
 
 " So it eats, and eats, and it grows and grows, 
 
 (Just ask the Schoolmaster if he knows.)" 
 
 But the Schoolmaster said that that kind of knowledge 
 
 Was not the sort he had learned at college. 
 
 " And when it has eaten enough, then soon 
 
 It spins for itself a soft cocoon. 
 
 And then it becomes a chrysalis — 
 
 I wonder what child can spell me this. 
 
 'Tis rather a difficult word to spell — 
 
 (Just ask the Schoolmistress if she can tell.) " 
 
 But the Schoolmistress said, as she shook her grey curls, 
 
 " She considered such things were not proper for girls." 
 
 The word was spelled, and speUed quite right. 
 
 Those nice little boys were so awfully bright ! 
 
 And the Bishop began to get into a fright, 
 
 His face grew red— it was formerly white — 
 
 And the hair on his head stood nearly upright ; 
 
 He was almost inclined to take refuge in flight, 
 
 But he thought that would be too shocking a sight ; 
 
 He was at his wits' end — nearly — not quite, 
 
 For the Pupil Teachers caught his eye. 
 
 He thought they might know — at least he would try — 
 
 Then he anxiously waited for their reply ; 
 
 But the Pupil Teachers enjoyed the fun. 
 
 And they wouldn't have told if they could have done. 
 
 So he said to the Beadle, " Go down in the street, 
 
 And stop all the people you chance to meet.

 I don't care who, 
 Any one will do ; 
 The old woman selling loUipops, 
 The little boys playing with marbles and tops, 
 Or respectable people who deal at the shops ; 
 The crossing-sweeper, the organ-grinder. 
 Or the fortune-teller, if you can find her. 
 Ask any or all, 
 Short or tall. 
 Great or small, it matters not — 
 How many legs has a Caterpillar got ? " 
 The Beadle bowed, and was ofi" like a shot 
 From a pop-gun fired, or that classical arrow 
 Which flew from the bow of the wicked cock-sparrow. 
 Now the Bishop again put on a smile. 
 And the children, who had been waiting meanwhile. 
 In their innocent hearts imagined that these 
 Remarks applied 
 (They were spoken aside) 
 To the weighty afiairs of the Diocese. 
 " The Caterpillar is doomed to sleep 
 For months — a slumber long and deep. 
 Brown and dead 
 It looks, 'tis said. 
 It never even requires to be fed ; 
 And, except that sometimes it waggles its head, 
 Your utmost efibrts would surely fail 
 To distinguish the creature's head from its tail. 
 " But one morning in spring. 
 When the birds loudly sing, 
 And the earth is gay with blossoming ; 
 When the violets blue, 
 Are wet with dew, 
 And the sky wears the sweetest cerulean hue ! 
 " When on all is seen 
 The brightest sheen — 
 When the daises are white, and the grass is green ; 
 Then the chrysaUs breaks. 
 The insect awakes, — 
 To the realms of air its way it takes •

 It did not die, 
 
 It soars on high, 
 A bright and a beauteous butterfly ! " 
 Here he paused and wiped ;i tear from his eye ; 
 The Beadle was quietly standing by, 
 And perceiving the lecture had reached its close, 
 Whispered, softly and sadly, " Nobody knows ! " 
 
 The Bishop saw his last hope was vain. 
 
 But to make the best of it he was fain ; 
 
 So he added, " Dear children, we ever should be, 
 
 Prepared to learn from all we see. 
 
 And beautiful thoughts of home and joy 
 
 Fill the heart, I know, of each girl and boy ! 
 
 Oh, ponder on these, and you will not care 
 
 To know the exact allotted share 
 
 Of legs the creature possessed at its birth, 
 
 When it crawled a mean worm on this lowly earth. 
 
 Yet, if you know it, you now may tell, 
 
 Your answers so far have pleased me well." 
 
 Then he looked around with benignant eye, 
 
 Nor long did he wait for the reply, 
 
 For the bright little boy, with a countenance gay, 
 
 Said, " Sis, for I counted 'em yesterday ! " 
 
 Moral. 
 
 " To all who have children under their care," 
 
 Of two things, nay, three things, I pray you beware — 
 
 Don't give them too many "unlimited buns," 
 
 Six each (Bath) is sufficient, or twelve penny ones ; 
 
 Don't let them go in for examination. 
 
 Unless you have given them due preparation, 
 
 Or the questions, asked with the kindest intention, 
 
 May be rather a strain on their powers of invention. 
 
 Don't pretend you know everything under the sun, 
 
 Though your school-days are ended, and theirs but begun, 
 
 But honestly say, when the case is so, 
 
 "This thing, my dear children, I do not know."

 Hear the sledges -with the bells — 
 Silver bells ! 
 What a world of merriment their melody foretells ! 
 How they tiakle, tinkle, tinkle, 
 
 In the icy air of night ! 
 While the stars that oversprinkle 
 All the heavens seem to twinkle 
 With a crystalhae delight ; 
 Keeping time, time, time, 
 In a sort of Runic rhyme. 
 To the tintinnabulation that so musically wells 
 From the bells, bells, bells, bells, 
 Bells, beUs, bells — 
 From the jingling and the tinkUng of the bells. 
 
 Hear the mellow wedding bells — 
 Golden beUs ! 
 What a world of happiness their harmony foretells ; 
 Through the balmy air of night 
 How they ring out their delight ! 
 From the molten golden notes, 
 And all in tune. 
 What a liquid ditty floats 
 To the turtle-dove that listens, while she gloats 
 On the moon ! 
 Oh, from out the sounding cells, 
 What a gush of euphony voluminously wells ! 
 How it swells ! 
 How it dwells 
 On the Future ! how it tells 
 Of the rapture that impels 
 To the swinging and the ringing 
 Of the bells, bells, bells, bells. 
 Of the bells, bells, bells, bells.

 To the rhyming and the chiming of the bells ! 
 
 Hear the loud alarum bells — 
 Brazen bells !

 What a tale of terror now their turbulency tells ! 
 In the startled ear of night 
 How they scream out their affright ! 
 Too much horrified to speak, 
 They can only shriek, shriek, 
 Out of tune, 
 In a clamorous appealing to the mercy of the fire. 
 In a mad expostulation with the deaf and frantic fire, 
 Leaping higher, higher, higher. 
 With a desperate desire, 
 And a i-esolute endeavour. 
 Now — now to sit or never 
 By the side of the pale-faced moon. 
 Oh the bells, bells, bells. 
 What a tale their terror tells 
 Of despair ! 
 
 How they clang, and clash, and roar ! 
 What a horror they outpour 
 On the bosom of the palpitating air. 
 Yet the ear it fully knows, 
 By the twanging. 
 And the clanging. 
 How the danger ebbs and flows ; 
 Yet the ear distinctly tells. 
 In the jangling. 
 And the wrangling. 
 How the danger sinks and swells, 
 By the sinking or the swelling in the anger of the bells ; 
 Of the bells— 
 Of the bells, beUs, beUs, beUs, 
 BeUs, bells, bells, bells. 
 In the clamour and the clangour of the beUs. 
 
 Hear the tolling of the beUs — 
 Iron bells ! 
 What a world of solemn thought their monody compels 
 In the silence of the night ; 
 How we shiver with affright 
 At the melancholy menace of their tone !

 Guild's Signal. 
 
 [William Guild was engineer of the train ■which plunged into Meadow Brook, on 
 the line of the Stonington and Providence Railroad. It was his custom, as often 
 as he passed his home, to whistle an " AU*s well" to his wife. He was found, 
 after the disaster, dead, with his hand on the throttle-valve of his engine.] 
 
 Two low whistles, quaint and clear, 
 That was the signal the engineer — 
 
 That was the signal that Guild, 'tis said — 
 Gave to his wife at Providence, 
 As through the sleeping town, and thence. 
 Out in the night. 
 On to the light, 
 Down past the farms, lying white, he sped ! 
 
 As a husband's greeting, scant, no doubt, 
 Yet to the woman looking out. 
 
 Watching and waiting, no serenade, 
 Love song, or midnight roundelay 
 Said what that whistle seemed to say : 
 " To my trust true, 
 So love to you ! 
 "Working or waiting, good night ! " it said. 
 
 Brisk young bagmen, tourists fine, 
 Old commuters along the line. 
 
 Brakesmen and porters glanced ahead. 
 Smiled as the signal, sharp, intense, 
 Pierced through the shadows of Providence : 
 " Nothing amiss — 
 Nothing ! — it is 
 Only Guild calling his wife," they said. 
 
 Summer and winter the old refrain 
 Bang o'er the billows of ripening grain, 
 
 Pierced through the budding boughs o'erhead : 
 Flew down the track when the red leaves burned 
 Like living coals from the engine spurned ; 
 Sang as it flew : 
 "To our trust true. 
 First of all, duty. Good night !" it said.

 And then one night it was heard no more 
 From Stonington over Rhode Island shore, 
 
 And the folk in Providence smiled and said, 
 As they turned in their beds, " The engineer 
 Has once forgotten his midnight cheer." 
 One only knew, 
 To his trust true, 
 Guild lay under his engine dead. 
 
 Human Nature. 
 
 Two little children five years old, 
 Marie the gentle, Charlie the bold ; 
 Sweet and bright and quaintly wise, 
 Angela both, in their mother's eyes. 
 
 But you, if you follow my verse, shall see, 
 That they were as human as human can be, 
 And had not yet learned the maturer art 
 Of hiding the " self " of the finite heart. 
 
 One day they found in their romp and play 
 Two little rabbits soft and gray — 
 Soft and gray, and just of a size. 
 As like each other as your two eyes. 
 
 All day long the children made love 
 To their dear little pets — their treasure-trove ; 
 They kissed and hugged them untU the night 
 Brought to the conies a glad respite. 
 
 Too much fondling doesn't agree 
 With the rabbit nature, as we shall see, 
 For ere the light of another day 
 Had chased the shadows of night away 
 
 One little pet had gone to the shades, 
 Or, let us hope, to perennial glades 
 Brighter and softer than any below — 
 A heaven where good little rabbits go.

 The living and dead lay side by side, 
 
 And still aUke as before one died ; 
 
 And it chanced that the children came singly to view 
 
 The pets they had dreamed of all the night through. 
 
 First came Charlie, and, with sad surprise, 
 
 Beheld the dead with streaming eyes : 
 
 Howe'er, consolingly, he said, 
 
 " Poor little Marie— her rabbit's dead ! " 
 
 Later came Marie, and stood aghast ; 
 
 She kissed and caressed it, but at last 
 
 Found voice to say, whUe her young heart bled, 
 
 " I'm sorry for Charlie — his rabbit's dead ! " 
 
 The Field of Waterloo. 
 
 Stop ! — for thy tread is on an Empire's dust ! An Earth- 
 quake's spoil is sepulchred below ! — Is the spot marked with 
 no colossal bust, or column trophied, for triumphal show? 
 None ; but the moral's truth tells simpler so. As the ground 
 was before, thus let it be. — How that red rain — hath made 
 the harvest grow!... And is this aU the world has gained by 
 thee, thou first and last of fields ! King-making Victory ? 
 
 There was a sound of revelry by night : and Belgium's 
 capital had gathered then her Beauty and her Chivalry ; and 
 bright the lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men; a 
 thousand hearts beat happily ; and when music arose with its 
 voluptuous swell, soft eyes looked love to eyes that spake 
 again, and all went merry as a marriage-bell. — But hush ! — 
 hark ! A deep sound strikes like a rising knell ! 
 
 Did ye not hear it ? " No : 'Tis but the wind, or the car 
 rattling o'er the stony street. On with the dance ! — let joy 
 be unconfined ! No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure 
 meet to chase the glowing hours with flying feet." — But hark ! 
 — that heavy sounds breaks in once more, as if the clouds its 
 echo would repeat ; and nearer, clearer, deadher than before ! 
 Arm ! arm ! it is — it is — the cannon's opening roar ! 
 
 Within a window'd niche of that high hall sat Brunswick's 
 fated chieftain : he did hear that sound the first amidst the 
 festival, and caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear; and

 when they smiled because he deemed it near, his heart more 
 truly knew that peal too well which stretched his father on a 
 bloody bier, and roused the vengeance blood alone could quell : 
 he rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell ! 
 
 Ah ! then and there was hurrying to and fro, and gathering 
 tears, and tremblings of distress, and cheeks aU pale, which, 
 but an hour ago, blushed at the praise of their own loveliness; 
 and there were sudden partings, such as press the life from out 
 young hearts, and choking sighs which ne'er might be repeated : 
 who could guess if ever more should meet those mutual eyes, 
 since, upon night so sweet, such awful morn could rise ! 
 
 And there was mounting in hot haste : the steed, the mus- 
 tering squadron, and the clattering car, went pouring forward 
 with impetuous speed, and swiftly forming in the ranks of 
 war ; and the deep thunder, peal on peal, afar ; and near, the 
 beat of the alarming drum, roused up the soldier ere the morn- 
 ing star : while thronged the citizens, with terror dumb, or 
 whispering, with white lips — "The foe ! they come ! they come ! " 
 
 And wild and high the " Cameron's gathering " rose ! (the 
 war-note of Loohiel, which Albyn's hUls have heard — and 
 heard, too, have her Saxon foes !) — How, in the noon of night, 
 that pibroch thrills, savage and shrill ! But, with the breath 
 which fills their mountain pipe, so fill the mountaineers with 
 the fierce native daring which instils the stirring memory of a 
 thousand years ; and Evan's, Donald's fame, rings in each 
 clansman's ears ! 
 
 And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves, dewy 
 with Nature's tear-drops; as they pass, grieving — if aught 
 inanimate e'er grieves — over the unreturning brave ; — alas ! 
 ere evening, to be trodden, like the grass — which now beneath 
 them, but above shall grow in its next verdure ; when this 
 fiery mass of living valour, rolling on the foe, and burning 
 with high hope, shall moulder cold and low ! 
 
 Last noon, beheld them full of lusty Ufe; last eve, in 
 Beauty's circle proudly gay ; the midnight brought the signal- 
 sound of strife, — the morn, the marshalling in arms, — the day, 
 battle's magnificently stern array ! The thunder-clouds close 
 o'er it : which when rent, the earth is covered thick with other 
 clay which her own clay shall cover — heaped and pent ; rider 
 and horse, — friend, foe, — in one red burial blent !

 The Legend Beautiful. 
 
 ' Hadst thou stayed, I must have fled ! " 
 That is what the Vision said. 
 
 In his chamber all alone, 
 Kneeling on the floor of stone. 
 Prayed the Monk in deep contrition 
 For his sins of indecision, 
 Prayed for greater self-denial 
 In temptation and in trial ; 
 It was noonday by the dial. 
 And the Monk was all alone. 
 
 Suddenly, as if it Hghtened, 
 An unwonted splendour brightened 
 AU witliin him and without him 
 In that narrow cell of stone ; 
 And he saw the Blessed Vision 
 Of our Lord, with light Elysian 
 Like a vesture wrapped about him, 
 Like a garment round him thrown. 
 
 Not as crucified and slain. 
 
 Not in agonies of pain, 
 
 Not with bleeding hands and feet, 
 
 Did the Monk his Master see ; 
 
 But as in the village street, 
 
 In the house or harvest-field. 
 
 Halt and lame and blind he healed. 
 
 When he walked in Galilee. 
 
 In an attitude imploring, 
 
 Hands upon his bosom crossed, 
 
 Wondering, worshipping, adoring, 
 
 Bjielt the Monk in rapture lost. 
 
 Lord, he thought, in heaven that reignest. 
 
 Who am I, that thus thou deignest 
 
 To reveal thyself to me ? 
 
 Who am I, that from the centre 
 
 Of thy glory thou shouldst enter 
 
 This poor cell, my guest to be ?

 Then amid his exaltation, 
 Loud the convent bell appaUing, 
 Prom its belfry calling, calling. 
 Rang through court and corridor 
 With persistent iteration 
 He had never heard before. 
 It was now the appointed hour 
 When alike in shine or shower, 
 Winter's cold or summer's heat, 
 To the convent portals came 
 All the bUnd and halt and lame, 
 All the beggars of the street. 
 For their daily dole of food 
 Dealt them by the brotherhood ; 
 And their almoner was he 
 Who upon his bended knee, 
 Rapt in silent ecstasy 
 Of divinest self-surrender. 
 Saw the Vision and the Splendour. 
 
 Deep distress and hesitation 
 Mingled with his adoration ; 
 Should he go, or should he stay ? 
 Should he leave the poor to wait 
 Hungry at the convent gate, 
 Till the Vision passed away ? 
 Should he slight his radiant guest, 
 Slight his visitant celestial, 
 For a crowd of ragged, bestial 
 Beggars at the convent gate ? 
 Would the Vision there remain ? 
 Would the Vision come again ? 
 
 Then a voice within his breast 
 Whispered, audible and clear. 
 As if to the outward ear : 
 " Do thy duty ; that is best ; 
 Leave unto thy Lord the rest ! " 
 Straightway to his feet he started. 
 And with longing look intent 
 On the Blessed Vision bent,

 Slowly from his cell departed, 
 Slowly on his errand went. 
 
 At the gate the poor were waiting, 
 Looking through the iron grating, 
 With that terror in the eye 
 That is only seen in those 
 Who amid their wants and woes 
 Hear the sound of doors that close, 
 And of feet that pass them by ; 
 Grown familiar with disfavour, 
 Grown familiar with the savour 
 Of the bread by which men die ! 
 But to-day, they knew not why. 
 Like the gate of Paradise 
 Seemed the convent gate to rise, 
 Like a sacrament divine 
 Seemed to them the bread and wine. 
 In his heart the Monk was praying. 
 Thinking of the homeless poor, 
 What they suffer and endure ; 
 What we see not, what we see ; 
 And the inward voice was saying : 
 " Whatsoever thing thou doest 
 To the least of mine and lowest 
 That thou doest unto me ! " 
 
 Unto me ! but had the Vision 
 Come to him in beggar's clothing, 
 Come a mendicant imploring, 
 Would he then have knelt adoring, 
 Or have listened -svith derision. 
 And have turned away with loathing ? 
 
 Thus his conscience put the question, 
 FuU of troublesome suggestion. 
 As at length, with hurried pace. 
 Towards his ceU he turned his face, 
 And beheld the convent bright 
 With a supernatural light. 
 Like a luminous cloud expanding 
 Over floor and wall and ceiling.

 But he paused with awe-struck feeling 
 At the threshold of his door, 
 For the Vision still was standing 
 As he left it there before, 
 When the convent bell appalling. 
 From its belfry calling, calling, 
 Summoned him to feed the poor. 
 Through the long hour intervening 
 It had waited his return. 
 And he felt his bosom bum. 
 Comprehending all the meaning.

 The Ropewalk. 
 
 In that building long and low, 
 With its windows all a^row. 
 
 Like the port-holes of a hulk, 
 Human spiders spin and spin. 
 Backward down their threads so thin 
 
 Dropping, each, a hempen bulk. 
 
 At the end, an open door ; 
 Squares of sunshine on the floor 
 
 Light the long and dusky lane ; 
 And the whirring of a wheel. 
 Dull and drowsy, makes me feel 
 
 All its spokes are in my brain. 
 
 As the spinners to the end 
 Downward go and re-ascend. 
 
 Gleam the long threads in the sun ; 
 While within this brain of mine 
 Cobwebs brighter and more fine 
 
 By the busy wheel are spun.

 Like white doves upon the wing,

 Laughing, as their gentle hands 
 Closely clasp the twisted strands, 
 
 At their shadow on the grass. 
 
 Then a booth of mountebanks, 
 "With its smell of tan and planks,

 On a cord, in spangled dress, 
 "With a faded loveliness, 
 
 And a weary look of care. 
 
 Then a homestead among farms. 
 And a woman with bare arms 
 
 Drawing water from a well ; 
 As the bucket mounts apace, 
 With it mounts her own fair face. 
 
 As at some magician's spell. 
 
 Then an old man in a tower. 
 Ringing loud the noontide hour, 
 
 "While the rope coils round and round. 
 Like a serpent at his feet. 
 And again, in swift retreat. 
 
 Nearly lifts him from the ground. 
 
 Then within a prison-yard. 
 Paces fixed, and stem, and hard. 
 
 Laughter and indecent mirth ; 
 Ah ! it is the gallows tree ; 
 Breath of Christian charity, 
 
 Blow, and sweep it from the earth ! 
 
 Then a schoolboy, with his kite 
 Gleaming in a sky of light, 
 
 And an eager, upward look ; 
 Steeds pursued through lane and field ; 
 Fowlers with their snares concealed ; 
 
 And an angler by a brook. 
 
 Ships rejoicing in the breeze, 
 Wrecks that float o'er unknown seas, 
 Anchors dragged through faithless sand;

 Sea-fog drifting overhead, 
 And, with lessening line and lead, 
 Sailors feeling for the land. 
 
 AH these scenes do I behold, 
 These, and many left untold, 
 
 In that building long and low ; 
 While the wheel goes round and round, 
 With a drowsy, dreamy sound. 
 
 And the spinners backward go. 
 
 The Opening of the Piano. 
 
 In the little southern parlour of the house you may have seen 
 With the gambrel-roof, and the gable looking westward to the 
 
 green, 
 At the side toward the sunset, with the window on its right, 
 Stood the London-made piano I am dreaming of to-night. 
 
 Ah me ! how I remember the evening when it came ! 
 What a cry of eager voices, what a group of cheeks in flame, 
 When the wondrous box was opened that had come from over 
 
 seas. 
 With its smeU of mastic- varnish and its flash of ivory keys ! 
 
 Then the children grew fretful in the restlessness of all joy. 
 For the boy would push his sister, and the sister crowd the boy, 
 Till the father asked for quiet in his grave paternal way, 
 But the mother hushed the tumult with the words, " Now, 
 Mary, play." 
 
 For the dear soul knew that music was a very sovereign balm ; 
 She had sprinkled it over sorrow and seen its brow grow calm, 
 In the days of slender harpsichords with tapping tinkling 
 
 quills. 
 Or carolling to her spinet with its thin metallic thrills. 
 
 So Mary, the household minstrel, who always loved to please, 
 Sat down to the new "dementi," and struck the glittering 
 
 keys. 
 Hushed were the children's voices, and every eye grew dim, 
 As, floating from lip and finger, arose the " Vesper hymn."

 — Catharine, child of a neighbour, curly and rosy-red, 
 (Wedded since, and a widow, — something like ten years dead,) 
 Hearing a gush of music such as none before. 
 Steals from her mother's chamber and peeps at the open door. 
 
 Just as the " Jubilate " in threaded whisper dies, 
 
 — " Open it ! open it, lady ! " the little maiden cries, 
 
 (For she thought 'twas a singing creature caged in a box she 
 
 heard,) 
 " Open it, open it, lady ! and let me see the hird ! " 
 
 Queen Mab. 
 
 A little fairy comes at night. 
 
 Her eyes are blue, her hair is brown, 
 
 With silver spots upon her wing. 
 
 And from the moon she flutters down. 
 
 She has a little silver wand. 
 
 And when a good child goes to bed, 
 
 She waves her wand from right to left 
 And makes a circle round its head. 
 
 And then it dreams of pleasant things, 
 Of fountains filled with fairy fish ; 
 
 And trees that bear delicious fruit, 
 And bow their branches at a wish. 
 
 Of arbours filled with dainty scents 
 From lovely flowers that never fade ; 
 
 Bright flies that glitter in the sun, 
 
 And glow-worms shining in the shade. 
 
 And talking birds, wibh gifted tongues, 
 For singing songs, and teUing tales ; 
 
 And pretty dwarfs to show the way 
 Through fairy hills and fairy dales. 
 
 But when the bad child goes to bed. 
 From left to right she weaves her rings. 
 
 And then it dreams all through the night 
 Of only ugly, horrid things !

 Then Kons come mth glaring eyes, 
 And tigers growl a dreadful noise ; 
 
 And ogres draw their cruel knives 
 To shed the blood of girls and boys. 
 
 Then stormy waves rush on to drown, 
 Or raging flames come scorching round ; 
 
 Fierce dragons hover in the air, 
 
 And serpents crawl along the ground. 
 
 Then wicked children wake and weep, 
 And wish the long black gloom away ; 
 
 But good ones love the dark, and find 
 The night as pleasant as the day. 
 
 The Dream of the Reveller. 
 
 Around the board the guests were met, the lights above them 
 
 beaming. 
 And in their cups, replenish'd oft, the ruddy wine was streaming ; 
 Their cheeks were flush'd, their eyes were bright, their hearts 
 
 with pleasure bounded. 
 The song was sung, the toast was given, and loud the revel 
 
 sounded. 
 I drained a goblet with the rest, and cried, " Away with sorrow ! 
 Let us be happy for to-day ; what care we for to-morrow ? " 
 But as I spoke, my sight grew dim, and slumber deep came 
 
 o'er me. 
 And, 'mid the whirl of mingling tongues, this vision passed 
 
 before me. 
 
 Methought I saw a Demon rise ; he held a mighty bicker. 
 Whose burnish'd sides ran brimming o'er with floods of 
 
 burning liquor : 
 Around him press'd a clamorous crowd, to taste this liquor 
 
 greedy. 
 But chiefly came the poor and sad, the suffering and the needy ; 
 All those oppress'd by grief or debt, — the dissolute, the lazy, — 
 Blear-eyed old men and reckless youths, and palsied women, 
 
 crazy ;

 "Give, give!" they cried, "give, give us drink, to drown all 
 
 thought of sorrow ; 
 If we are happy for to-day, what care we for to-morrow ?" 
 
 The first drop warm'd their shivering skins, and drove away 
 
 their sadness ; 
 The second lit their sunken eyes, and filled their souls with 
 
 gladness ; 
 The third drop made them shout and roar, and play each 
 
 furious antic ; 
 The fourth drop boil'd their very blood : and the fifth drop 
 
 drove them frantic. 
 "Drink!" said the Demon, "Drink your fill! drink of these 
 
 waters mellow ; 
 They'll make your eye-balls sear and dull, and turn your white 
 
 skins yellow ; 
 They'll fill your homes with care and grief, and clothe your 
 
 backs with tatters ; 
 They'll fill your hearts with evil thoughts ; but never mind ! — 
 
 what matters ? 
 
 "Though virtue sink, and reason fail, and social ties dissever, 
 I'll be your friend in hour of need, and find you homes for ever ; 
 For I have built three mansions high, three strong and goodly 
 
 houses, 
 To lodge at last each jolly soul who aU his Hfe carouses. — 
 The first, it is a spacious house, to all but sots appalling, 
 Where, by the parish bounty fed, vile, in the sunshine crawling. 
 The worn-out drunkard ends his days, and eats the dole of 
 
 others, — 
 A plague and burthen to himself, an eye-sore to his brothers. 
 
 " The second is a lazarhouse, rank, fetid, and unholy ; 
 Where, smitten by diseases foul and hopeless melancholy, 
 The victims of potations deep, pine on the couch of sadness, — 
 Some calling Death to end their pain, and some imploring 
 
 The third and last is black and high, the abode of guilt and 
 
 anguish, ,j <; 1 
 
 And full of dungeons deep and fast, where death-doom d felons 
 
 languish.

 So drain the cup, and drain again ! One of my goodly houses 
 Shall lodge at last each jolly soul who to the dregs carouses ! " 
 
 But well he knew — that Demon old — how vain was all his 
 
 preaching, 
 The ragged crew that round him flock'd were heedless of his 
 
 teaching ; 
 Even as they heard his fearful words, they cried, with shouts 
 
 of laughter, — 
 " Out on the fool who mars To-day with thoughts of a Hereafter ! 
 We care not for thy houses three ; we live but for the present ; 
 And merry will we make it yet, and quaff our bumpers 
 
 pleasant."... 
 Loud laugh'd the fiend to hear them speak, and, lifting high 
 
 his bicker, 
 "Body and Soul are mine !" said he ; " I'll have them both— 
 
 for liquor ! " 
 
 The WeU of St. Keyne. 
 
 A weU there is in the west country, and a clearer one never 
 was seen ; 
 
 There is not a wife in the west country, but has heard of the 
 WeU of St. Keyne. 
 
 An oak and an elm-tree stand beside, and behind does an ash- 
 tree grow, 
 
 And a willow from the bank above droops to the water below. 
 
 A traveller came to the Well of St. Keyne ; joyfully he drew 
 
 nigh. 
 For from cock-crow he had been travelling, and there was not 
 
 a cloud in the sky. 
 He drank of the water so cool and clear, for thirsty and hot 
 
 was he ; 
 And he sat him down upon the bank, under the willow tree. 
 
 There came a man from the neighbouring town, at the Well 
 to fill his pail ; 
 On the Well-side he rested it, and he bade the stranger hail.

 " Now, art thou a bachelor, stranger ? " quoth he ; " for, an' if 
 thou hast a wife, 
 
 The happiest draught thou hast drunk this day that ever thou

 Or has thy good woman — ^if one thou hast — ever here in Corn-

 For, an' if she have, I'll venture my life she has drunk of the

 " I have left a good woman who never was here," the

 " But that my draught should be better for that, I pray you 
 answer me why." 
 
 " St. Keyne,'' quoth the Cornish-man, " many a time drank 
 
 of this crystal "Well, 
 And before the angel sununoned her, she laid on the water a 
 
 spell : — 
 If the husband, of this gifted Well shall drink before his wife, 
 A happy man henceforth is he, for he shall be master for life ; 
 But if the wife should drink of it first, — heaven help the

 the water again. 
 
 " You drank of the "Well, I warrant, betimes ? " he to the 
 Cornish-man said :

 Their scanty-leaved and finely-tapering stems, 
 
 Had not yet lost their starry diadems 
 
 Caught from the early sobbing of the morn. 
 
 The clouds were pure and white as flocks new-shorn. 
 
 And fresh from the clear brook ; sweetly they slept 
 
 On the blue fields of heaven, and then there crept 
 
 A little noiseless noise among the leaves. 
 
 Born of the very sigh that silence heaves ; 
 
 For not the faintest motion could be seen 
 
 Of all the shades that slanted o'er the green. 
 
 There was wide wandering for the greediest eye, 
 
 To peer about upon variety ; 
 
 Far round the horizon's crystal air to skim. 
 
 And trace the dwindled edgings of its brim ; 
 
 To picture out the quaint and curious bending 
 
 Of a fresh woodland alley never ending ; 
 
 Or by the bowery clefts, and leafy shelves, 
 
 Guess where the jaunty streams refresh themselves. 
 
 I gazed awhile, and felt as light, and free 
 
 As though the fanning wings of Mercury 
 
 Had play'd upon my heels : I was lighi>hearted, 
 
 And many pleasures to my vision started ; 
 
 So I straightway began to pluck a posy 
 
 Of luxuries bright, milky, soft and rosy. 
 
 A bush of May-flowers with the bees about them ; 
 
 Ah, sure no tasteful nook could be without them ! 
 
 And let a lush laburnum oversweep them, 
 
 And let long grass grow round the roots, to keep them 
 
 Moist, cool, and green ; and shade the violets, 
 
 That they may bind the moss in leafy nets. 
 
 A filbert-hedge with wild-briar overtwined. 
 And clumps of woodbine taking the soft wind 
 Upon their summer thrones ; there too should be 
 The frequent chequer of a youngling tree, 
 That with a score of light green brethren shoots 
 From the quaint mossiness of aged roots : 
 Round which is heard a spring-head of clear waters, 
 Babbling so wildly of its lovely daughters,

 The spreading blue-bells : it may haply mourn 
 That such fair clusters should be rudely torn 
 Prom their fresh beds, and scatter'd thoughtlessly 
 By infant hands, left on the path to die. 
 
 Open afresh your round of starry folds. 
 
 Ye ardent marigolds ! 
 
 Dry up the moisture from your golden lids. 
 
 For great Apollo bids 
 
 That in these days your praises should be sung 
 
 On many harps, which he has lately strung ; 
 
 And when again your dewiness he kisses, 
 
 Tell him, I have you in my world of blisses : 
 
 So haply when I rove in some far vale, 
 
 His mighty voice may come upon the gale. 
 
 Here are sweet peas, on tiptoe for a flight : 
 
 With ^vings of gentle flush o'er delicate white, 
 
 And taper fingers catching at all things. 
 
 To bind them all about with tiny rings. 
 
 Linger awhile upon some bending planks, 
 
 Then lean against a streamlet's rushy banks. 
 
 And watch intently Nature's gentle doings : 
 
 They will be found softer than ringdoves' cooings : 
 
 How silent comes the water round that bend ! 
 
 Not the minutest whisper does it send 
 
 To the o'erhanging sallows : blades of grass 
 
 Slowly across the chequer'd shadows pass. 
 
 Why, you might read two sonnets, ere they reach 
 
 To where the hurrying freshnesses aye preach 
 
 A natural sermon o'er their pebbly beds ; 
 
 Where swarms of minnows show their little heads, 
 
 Staying their wavy bodies 'gainst the streams, 
 
 To taste the luxury of s unn y beams 
 
 Temper'd with coolness. How they ever wrestle 
 
 With their own sweet delight, and ever nestle 
 
 Their silver bellies on the pebbly sand ! 
 
 If you but scantily hold out the hand. 
 
 That very instant not one will remain j 
 
 But turn your eye, and they are there again.

 The ripples seem right glad to reach those cresses ; 
 
 And cool themselves among the emerald tresses ; 
 
 The while they cool themselves, they freshness give, 
 
 And moisture, that the bowery green may live : 
 
 So keeping up an interchange of favours. 
 
 Like good men in the truth of their behaviours. 
 
 Sometimes goldfinches one by one will drop 
 
 Prom low-hung branches : little space they stop ; 
 
 But sip, and twitter, and their feathers sleek ; 
 
 Then off at once, as in a wanton freak : 
 
 Or perhaps, to show their black and golden wings. 
 
 Pausing upon their yellow flutterings. 
 
 Were I in such a place, I sure should pray 
 
 That nought less sweet might call my thoughts away, 
 
 Than the soft rustle of a maiden's gown 
 
 Fanning away the dandelion's down ; 
 
 Than the light music of her nimble toes 
 
 Patting against the sorrel as she goes. 
 
 How she would start, and blush, thus to be caught 
 
 Playing in all her innocence of thought ! 
 
 O let me lead her gently o'er the brook. 
 
 Watch her half-smiHng lips and downward look • 
 
 O let me for one moment touch her wrist ; 
 
 Let me one moment to her breathing list ; 
 
 And as she leaves me, may she often turn 
 
 Her fair eyes looking through her locks auburn

 Autobiography ! So you say. 
 So do I not believe ! 
 
 For no men or women that live to-day,

 Ever would dare to leave 
 
 In faintest pencil or boldest ink 
 All they truly and really think.

 What they have said and what they have done, 
 What they have lived and what they have felt, 
 
 Under the stars or under the sun. 
 At the touch of a pen the dewdrops melt. 
 And the jewels are lost in the grass, 
 Though you count the blades as you pass. 
 At the touch of a pen the lightning is fixed, 
 An innocent streak on a broken cloud ; 
 And the thunder that pealed so fierce and loud, 
 With musical echo is softly mixed. 
 Autobiography ? No ! 
 It never was written yet, I trow. 
 Grant that they try ! 
 Still they must fail ! 
 Words are too pale 
 For the fervour and glow of the lava-flow. 
 
 Can they paint the flash of an eye ? 
 How much less the flash of a heart, 
 Or its delicate ripple and glitter and gleam, 
 Swift and sparkling, suddenly darkling. 
 Crimson and gold tints, exquisite soul-tints, 
 Changing like dawn-flush touching a dream ! 
 Where is the art 
 
 That shall give the play of blending lights 
 Prom the porphyry rock on the pool below ? 
 
 Or the bird-shadow traced on the sunlit heights 
 Of golden rose and snow ? 
 
 You say 'tis a fact that the books exist. 
 Printed and published in Mudie's list. 
 
 Some in two volumes, and some in one — 
 Autobiographies plenty. But look ! 
 
 I will tell you what is done 
 
 By the writers, confidentially ! 
 They cut little pieces out of their lives 
 
 And join them together. 
 Making them up as a readable book, 
 
 And call it an autobiography, 
 Though little enough of the life survives.

 What if we went in the sweet May weather 
 To a wood that I know which hangs on a hill, 
 And reaches down to a tinkling brook, 
 That sings the flowers to sleep at night. 
 And calls them again with the earliest light. 
 Under the delicate flush of green, 
 
 Hardly shading the bank below, 
 Pale anemones peep between 
 
 The mossy stumps where the violets grow ; 
 Wide clouds of bluebells stretch away. 
 
 And primrose constellations rise, — 
 Turn where we may, 
 
 Some new loveliness meets our eyes. 
 The first white butterflies flit around. 
 Bees are murmuring close to the ground. 
 
 The cuckoo's happy shout is heard. 
 Hark again ! 
 
 Was it echo, or was it bird ? 
 
 All the air is full of song, 
 A carolling chorus around and above ; 
 From the wood-pigeon's call so soft and long, 
 To merriest twitter and marvellous trill. 
 Everyone sings at his own sweet will. 
 True to the key-note of joyous love. 
 
 Well, it is lovely ! is it not ? 
 
 But we must not stay on the fairy spot. 
 So we gather a nosegay with care : 
 A primrose here and a bluebell there. 
 
 And something that we have never seen. 
 Probably therefore a specimen rare ; 
 
 Stitchwort, with stem of transparent green. 
 The white-veined woodsorrel, and a spray 
 Of tender -leaved and budding May. 
 
 We carry home the fragrant load, 
 
 In a close, warm hand, by a dusty road ; 
 
 The sun grows hotter every hour ; 
 
 Already the woodsorrel pines for the shade ; 
 We watch it fade.

 And throw away the fair little flower ; 
 
 We forgot that it could not last an hour 
 
 Away from the cool moss where it grows. 
 
 Then the stitchworts droop and close ; 
 
 There is nothing to show but a tangle of green, 
 
 For the white-rayed stars will no more be seen. 
 
 Then the anemones, can they survive ? 
 
 Even now they are hardly alive. 
 
 Ha ! where is it, our unknown spray % 
 
 Dropped on the way ! 
 Perhaps we shall never find one again. 
 At last we come in with the few that are left, 
 Of freshness and fragnance bereft ; 
 
 A sorry display. 
 
 Now, do we say, 
 ' Here is the wood where we rambled to-day ? 
 See, we have brought it to you ; 
 Believe us, indeed it is true. 
 This is the wood ! ' do we say ? 
 
 So much for the bright and pleasant side. 
 There is another. We did not bring 
 All that was hidden under the wing 
 Of the radiant-plumaged Spring. 
 
 We never tried 
 To spy, or watch, or away to bear, 
 Much that was just as truly there. 
 
 What have we seen ? 
 
 Hush, ah, hush ! 
 Curled and withered fern between. 
 And dead leaves under the living green, 
 Thick and damp. A clammy feather. 
 All that remains of a singing thrush 
 Killed by a weasel long ago. 
 In the hungry winter weather. 
 Kettles in unfriendly row. 
 And last year's brambles, sharp and brown, 
 Grimly guarding a hawthorn crown. 
 A pale leaf trying to reach the light 
 By a long weak stem, but smothered down,

 Dying in darkness, with none to see. 
 
 The rotting trunk of a willow tree, 
 
 Leafless, ready to fall from the bank ; 
 
 A poisonous fungus, cold and white. 
 
 And a hemlock growing strong and rank. 
 
 A tuft of fur and a ruddy stain, 
 
 Where a wounded hare has escaped the snare. 
 
 Only perhaps to be caught again. 
 
 No specimens we bring of these. 
 
 Lest they should disturb our ease. 
 
 And spoil the story of the May, 
 
 And make you think our holiday 
 
 Was far less pleasant than we say. 
 
 Ah no ! We write our lives indeed, 
 
 But in a cipher none can read. 
 
 Except the author. He may pore 
 
 The life-accumulating lore 
 For evermore. 
 
 And find the records strange and true. 
 
 Bring wisdom old and new. 
 
 But though he break the seal. 
 
 No power has he to give the key. 
 No licence to reveal. 
 We wait the all-declaring day. 
 When love shall know as it is known. 
 
 Till then, the secrets of our lives are ours and God's alone. 
 
 On Revisiting the Banks of the Wye. 
 
 Five years have passed ; five summers, with the length of 
 five long winters ; and again I hear these waters, rolling from 
 their mountain-springs with a sweet inland murmur. Once 
 again do I behold these steep and lofty cliffs, which, on a wUd 
 secluded scene, impress thoughts of more deep seclusion, and 
 connect the landscape with the quiet of the sky. 
 
 Though absent long, these forms of beauty have not been to 
 me, as is a landscape to a blind man's eye ; but oft, in lonely

 rooms, and 'mid the din of towns and cities, I have owed to 
 them, in hours of weariness, sensations sweet ; felt in the blood, 
 and felt along the heart, and passing even into my purer mind, 
 with tranquil restoration : — feelings, too, of unremembered 
 pleasure : such, perhaps, as may have had no trivial influence 
 on that best portion of a good man's life — his little, nameless, 
 unremembered acts of kindness and of love. Nor less, I trust, 
 to them I may have owed another gift of aspect more sublime ; 
 that blessed mood, in which the burthen of the mystery, in 
 which the heavy and the weary weight of all this unintelligible 
 world, is lightened ; — that serene and blessed mood, in which 
 the affections gently lead us on, untU the breath of this corpo- 
 real frame, and even the motion of our human blood, almost 
 suspended, we are laid asleep in body, and become a living 
 soul ; while, with an eye made quiet by the power of harmony, 
 and the deep power of joy, we see into the life of things. 
 
 If this be but a vain behef — yet, oh ! how oft, in darkness, 
 and amid the many shapes of joyless daylight, when the fretful 
 stir unprofitable, and the fever of the world, have hung upon 
 the beatings of my heart, how oft in spirit have I turned to 
 thee, O sylvan Wye ? — thou wanderer through the woods ; how 
 often has my spirit turned to thee ! And now, with gleams 
 of half -extinguished thought, with many recognitions dim and 
 faint, and somewhat of a sad perplexity, the picture of the 
 mind revives again : whUe here I stand, not only with the 
 sense of present pleasure, but with pleasing thoughts that, in 
 this moment, there is life and food for future years. And so 
 I dare to hope, though changed, no doubt, from what I was 
 when first I came among these hills ; when, like a roe, I 
 bounded o'er the mountains, by the sides of the deep rivers 
 and the lonely streams — ^wherever Nature led; more like a 
 man flying from something that he dreads, than one who sought 
 the thing he loved. For N'ature then (the coarser pleasures of 
 my boyish days, and their glad animal movements all gone by) 
 to me was all in aU. I cannot paint what then I was. The 
 sounding cataract haunted me like a passion; the tall rock, 
 the mountain, and the deep and gloomy wood, their colours, 
 and their forms, were then to me an appetite ; a feeling and a 
 love, that had no need of a remoter charm by thought supplied, 
 or any interest unborrowed from the eye. That time is past,

 and all its aching joys are now no more, and all its dizzy 
 raptures. 
 
 Not for this faint I, nor mourn, nor mui-mur ; other gifts 
 have followed ; — for such loss, I would believe, abundant re- 
 compense. For, I have learned to look on Nature, not as in 
 the hour of thoughtless youth ; but hearing oftentimes the 
 still sad music of Humanity,- — nor harsh nor grating, though 
 of ample power to chasten and subdue. And I have felt a 
 Presence that disturbs me with the joy of elevated thoughts ; 
 a sense sublime of something far more deeply interfused, whose 
 dwelling is the light of setting suns, and the round ocean, and 
 the living air, and the blue sky, and in the mind of man ; a 
 motion and a spirit that impels all thinking things, all objects 
 of aU thought, and roUs through all things. Therefore am I 
 still a lover of the meadows, and the woods, and mountains, 
 and of all that we behold from this green earth ; of all the 
 mighty world of eye and ear, both what they half create, and 
 what perceive ; well pleased to recognise, in Nature, and the 
 language of the sense, the anchor of my purest thoughts ; — 
 the nurse, the guide, the guardian of my heart, — and soul of 
 all my moral being. 
 
 London, September 1802. 
 
 O Friend ! I know not which way I must look 
 
 For comfort, being, as I am, opprest. 
 
 To think that now our life is only drest 
 
 For show ; mean handiwork of craftsman, cook, 
 
 Or groom ! — We must run glittering like a brook 
 
 In the open sunshine, or we are unblest ; 
 
 The wealthiest man amongst us is the best. 
 
 No grandeur now in nature or in book 
 
 Delights us. Rapine, avarice, expense, 
 
 This is idolatry ; and these we adore : 
 
 Plain living and high thinking are no more ; 
 
 The homely beauty of the good old cause 
 
 Is gone ; our peace, our fearful innocence, 
 
 And pure religion breathing household laws.

 London, 1802. 
 
 Milton ! thou should'st be living at this hour ; 
 England hath need of thee ; she is a fen 
 Of stagnant waters ; altar, sword, and pen, 
 Fireside, the heroic wealth of hall and bower, 
 Have forfeited their ancient English dower 
 Of inward happiness. We are selfish men ; 
 Oh ! raise us up, return to us again ; 
 And give us manners, virtue, freedom, power. 
 Thy soul was like a Star, and dwelt apart ; 
 Thou hadst a voice whose sound was like the sea ; 
 Pure as the naked heavens, majestic, free. 
 So didst thou travel on life's common way, 
 In cheerful godliness ; and yet thy heart 
 The lowliest duties on herself did lay. 
 
 (F) MISCELLANEOXTS. 
 
 The Parting of the Ways. 
 
 Who hath not been a poet ? Who hath not, 
 With life's new quiver full of wingfed years. 
 Shot at a venture, and then, following on, 
 Stood doubtful at the Parting of the Ways ? 
 
 There once I stood in dream, and as I paused. 
 Looking this way and that, came forth to me 
 The figure of a woman veiled, that said, 
 " My name is Duty, turn and follow me.'' 
 Something there was that chilled me in her voice ; 
 I felt Youth's hand grow slack and cold in mine, 
 As if to be withdrawn, and I replied : 
 " Oh, leave the hot wild heart within my breast ! 
 Duty comes soon enough, too soon comes Death ; 
 This slippery globe of life whirls of itself. 
 Hasting our youth away into the dark ; 
 These senses, quiveriag with electric heats,

 Too soon will show, like nests on wintry boughs 
 Obtrusive emptiness, too palpable wreck. 
 Which whistling north-winds line with downy snow 
 Sometimes, or fringe with foliaged rime, in vain. 
 Thither the singing birds no more return." 
 
 Then glowed to me a maiden from the left. 
 With bosom half disclosed, and naked arms 
 More white and undulant than necks of swans ; 
 And all before her steps an influence ran 
 Warm as the whispering South that opens buds 
 And swells the laggard sails of Northern May. 
 "I am called Pleasure, come with me !" she said. 
 Then laughed, and shook out sunshine from her hair, 
 Not only that, but, so it seemed, shook out 
 All memory too, and all the moon-lit past, 
 Old loves, old aspirations, and old dreams. 
 More beautiful for being old and gone. 
 
 So we two went together ; downward sloped 
 The path through yeUow meads, or so I dreamed, 
 Yellow with sunshine and young green, but I 
 Saw naught nor heard, shut up in one close joy ; 
 I only felt the hand within my own. 
 Transmuting all my blood to golden fire. 
 Dissolving all my brain in throbbing mist. 
 
 Suddenly shrank the hand ; suddenly burst 
 
 A cry that split the torpor of my brain, 
 
 And as the first sharp thrust of lightning loosens 
 
 From the heaped cloud its rain, loosened my sense : 
 
 " Save me !" it thrilled ; " Oh, hide me ! there is Death ! 
 
 Death the divider, the unmerciful. 
 
 That digs his pitfalls under Love and Youth, 
 
 And covers Beauty up in the cold ground ; 
 
 Horrible Death ! bringer of endless dark ; 
 
 Let him not see me ! hide me in thy breast ! " 
 
 Thereat I strove to clasp her, but my arms 
 
 Met only what slipped crumbling down, and fell, 
 
 A handful of gray ashes, at my feet.

 I would have fled, I would have followed back 
 
 That pleasant path we came, but all was changed ; 
 
 Rocky the way, abrupt, and hard to find ; 
 
 Yet I toiled on, and, toiUng on, I thought, 
 
 "That way lies Youth, and Wisdom, and all Good ; 
 
 'For only by unlearning Wisdom comes. 
 
 And climbing backward to diviner Youth ; 
 
 What the world teaches profits to the world. 
 
 What the soul teaches profits to the soul, 
 
 Which then first stands erect with Godward face. 
 
 When she lets faU her pack of withered facts, 
 
 The gleanings of the outward eye and ear. 
 
 And looks and listens with her finer sense ; 
 
 Nor Truth nor Knowledge cometh from without.'' 
 
 After long weary days I stood again 
 
 And waited at the Parting of the Ways ; 
 
 Again the figure of a women veiled 
 
 Stood forth and beckoned, and I followed now : 
 
 Down to no bower of roses led the path. 
 
 But through the streets of towns where chattering Cold 
 
 Hewed wood for fires whose glow was owned and fenced. 
 
 Where nakedness wove garments of warm wool 
 
 Not for itself ; — or through the fields it led 
 
 Where Hunger reaped the unattainable grain, 
 
 While Idleness enforced saw idle lands. 
 
 Leagues of unpeopled soil, the common earth, 
 
 WaUed round with paper against God and Man. 
 
 "I cannot look," I groaned, "at only these; 
 
 The heart grows hardened with perpetual wont, 
 
 And palters with a feigned necessity. 
 
 Bargaining with itself to be content ; 
 
 Let me behold thy face." 
 
 The Form replied : 
 " Men follow Duty, never overtake : 
 Duty nor lifts her veil nor Jpoks behind." 
 But, as she spake, a loosened lock of hair 
 Slipped from beneath her hood, and I, who looked 
 To see it gray and thin, saw amplest gold ; 
 Not that dull metal dug from sordid earth.

 But such as the retiring sunset flood 
 
 Leaves heaped on bays and capes of island cloud. 
 
 "O Guide divine," I prayed, "Although not yet 
 
 I may repair the virtue which I feel 
 
 Grone out at touch of untuned things and foul 
 
 "With draughts of Beauty, yet declare how soon !" 
 
 "Faithless and faint of heart," the voice returned, 
 " Thou see'st no beauty save thou make it first ; 
 Man, Woman, Nature, each is but a glass 
 Where the soul sees the image of herself, 
 Visible echoes, offsprings of herself. 
 But, since thou need'st assurance of how soon, 
 Wait till that angel comes who opens all, 
 The reconciler, he who lifts the veil. 
 The reuniter, the rest bringer. Death." 
 
 I waited, and methought he came ; but how, 
 Or in what shape, I doubted, for no sign. 
 By touch or mark, he gave me as he passed : 
 Only I knew a lily that I held 
 Snapt short below the head and shrivelled up ; 
 Then turned my Guide and looked at me unveiled, 
 And I beheld no face of matron stern, 
 But that enchantment I had followed erst. 
 Only more' fair, more clear to eye and brain, 
 Heightened and chastened by a household charm ; 
 She smiled, and " Which is fairer," said her eyes, 
 " The hag's unreal Florimel or mine % " 
 
 The Heritage. 
 
 The rich man's son inherits lands, 
 
 And piles of brick, and stone, and gold ; 
 
 And he inherits soft, white hands. 
 And tender flesh that fears the cold. 
 Nor dares to wear a garment old ; 
 
 A heritage, it seems to me. 
 
 One scarce would wish to hold in fee.

 The rich man's son inherits cares : 
 
 The bank may break, the factory burn, 
 
 A breath may burst his bubble shares, 
 And soft white hands could hardly earn 
 A living that ■would serve his turn ; 
 
 A heritage, it seems to me, 
 
 One would not wish to hold in fee. 
 
 What doth the poor man's son inherit ? 
 
 Stout muscles, and a sinewy heart, 
 A hardy frame, a hardier spirit ; 
 
 King of two hands, he does his part 
 
 In every useful toil and art ; 
 A heritage, it seems to me, 
 A king might wish to hold in fee. 
 
 What doth the poor man's son inherit ? 
 
 Wishes o'erjoyed with humble things, 
 A rank adjudged by toil-won merit. 
 
 Content that from employment springs, 
 
 A heart that in his labour sings ; 
 A heritage, it seems to me, 
 A king might wish to hold in fee. 
 
 What doth the poor man's son inherit ! 
 
 A patience learned by being poor ; 
 Courage, if sorrow come, to bear it ; 
 
 A fellow-feeling that is sure 
 
 To make the outcast bless his door ; 
 A heritage, it seems to me, 
 A king might wish to hold in fee. 
 
 O rich man's son ! there is a toil. 
 That with all other level stands ; 
 
 Large charity doth never soil. 
 
 But only whiten soft white hands— 
 This is the best crop from thy lands ; 
 
 A heritage, it seems to me. 
 
 Worth being rich to hold in fee. 
 
 O poor man's son ! scorn not thy state ; 
 There is worse weariness than thine, 
 In merely being rich and great :

 Toil only gives the soul to shine, 
 And makes rest fragrant and benign ; 
 A heritage, it seems to me. 
 Worth being poor to hold in fee. 
 
 Both heirs to some six feet of sod, 
 Are equal in the earth at last ; 
 
 Both children of the same dear God, 
 Prove title to your heirship vast 
 By record of a well-filled past ; 
 
 A heritage, it seems to me, 
 
 Well worth a Ufe to hold in fee. 
 
 The Walrus and the Carpenter. 
 
 The sun was shining on the sea, 
 Shining with all his might : 
 
 He did his very best to make 
 The billows smooth and bright — 
 
 And this was odd, because it was 
 The middle of the night. 
 
 The moon was shining sulkily, 
 Because she thought the sun 
 
 Had got no business to be there 
 After the day was done— 
 
 "It's very rude of him," she said, 
 " To come and spoU the fun ! " 
 
 The sea was wet as wet could be. 
 The sands were dry as dry. 
 
 You could not see a cloud, because 
 No cloud was in the sky : 
 
 No birds were flying over-head — 
 There were no birds to fly. 
 
 The Walrus and the Carpenter 
 Were walking close at hand ; 
 
 They wept like anything to see 
 Such quantities of sand :

 "If this were only cleared away,'' 
 They said, " It would be grand ! " 
 
 " If seven maids, with seven mops 
 
 Swept it for half a year. 
 Do you suppose," the Walrus said, 
 
 " That they could get it clear ? " 
 " I doubt it," said the Carpenter, 
 
 And shed a bitter tear. 
 
 " O Oysters, come and walk with us ! " 
 
 The Walrus did beseech ; 
 " A pleasant walk, a pleasant talk. 
 
 Along the briny beach : 
 We cannot do with more than four. 
 
 To give a hand to each." 
 
 The eldest Oyster looked at him, 
 
 But never a word he said : 
 The eldest Oyster winked his eye, 
 
 And shook his heavy head — 
 Meaning to say he did not choose 
 
 To leave the oyster-bed. 
 
 But four young Oysters hurried up. 
 
 All eager for the treat : 
 Their coats were brushed, their faces washed, 
 
 Their shoes were clean and neat — - 
 And this was odd, because, you know. 
 
 They hadn't any feet. 
 
 Four other Oysters followed them. 
 
 And yet another four ; 
 And thick and fast they came at last, 
 
 And more, and more, and more — 
 All hopping through the frothy waves. 
 
 And scrambling to the shore. 
 
 The Walrus and the Carpenter 
 
 Walked on a mile or so. 
 And then they rested on a rock 
 
 Conveniently low :

 And all the little Oysters stood 
 And waited in a row. 
 
 " The time has come," the Walrus said, 
 " To talk of many things : 
 
 Of shoes — and ships — and sealing-wax- 
 Of cabbages — and kings — 
 
 And why the sea is boiling hot — 
 And whether pigs have wings." 
 
 " But wait a bit," the Oysters cried, 
 " Before we have our chat ; 
 
 For some of us are out of breath, 
 And all of us are fat ! " 
 
 " No hurry ! " said the Carpenter : 
 They thanked him much for that. 
 
 " A loaf of bread," the Walrus said, 
 " Is what we chiefly need : 
 
 Pepper and vinegar besides 
 Are very good indeed — 
 
 Now, if you're ready, Oysters dear. 
 We can begin to feed." 
 
 " But not on us," the Oystera cried, 
 
 Turning a little blue. 
 " After such kindness, that would be 
 
 A dismal thing to do ! " 
 " The night is fine," the Walrus said, 
 
 "Do you admire the view? 
 
 " It was so kind of you to come ! 
 
 And you are very nice ! " 
 The Carpenter said nothing but 
 
 " Cut us another slice : 
 I wish you were not quite so deaf — 
 
 I've had to ask you twice ! " 
 
 "It seems a shame," the Walrus said, 
 "To play them such a trick. 
 
 After we've brought them out so far, 
 And made them trot so quick ! "

 The Carpenter said nothing but 
 " The butter's spread too thick ! " 
 
 " I weep for you," the "Walrus said, 
 
 "I deeply sympathize." 
 With sobs and tears he sorted out 
 
 Those of the largest size, 
 Holding his pocket-handkerchief 
 
 Before his streaming eyes. 
 
 "0, Oysters," said the Carpenter, 
 
 "You've had a pleasant run ! 
 Shall we be trotting home again ? " 
 
 But answer came there none — 
 And this was scarcely odd, because 
 
 They'd eaten every one. 
 
 Abou Ben Adhem and the Angel. 
 
 Abou Ben Adhem (may his tribe increase) 
 Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace. 
 And saw, within the moonlight in his room. 
 Making it rich, and like a lily in bloom. 
 An angel, writing in a book of gold : — 
 Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold, 
 And to the presence in the room he said, 
 " What writest thou ? " — The vision raised its head. 
 And, with a look made of all sweet accord. 
 Answered, " The names of those who love the Lord." 
 "And is mine one ? " said Abou. " N^ay, not so," 
 Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low. 
 But cheerily still ; and said, " I pray thee, then, 
 Write me as one that loves his fellow-men." 
 
 The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night 
 It came again with a great wakening light. 
 And showed the names whom love of God had blessed. 
 And lo ! Ben Adhem's name led all the rest.

 Tubal Cain. 
 
 Old Tubal Cain was a man of might in the days when earth 
 was young ; by the fierce red light of his furnace bright the 
 strokes of his hammer rung ; and he lifted high his brawny 
 hand on the iron glowing clear, tUl the sparks rush'd out in 
 scarlet showers, as he fashion'd the sword and the spear. 
 
 To Tubal Cain came many a one, as he wrought by his 
 roaring fire, and each one pray'd for a strong steel blade as 
 the crown of his desire ; and he made them weapons sharp and 
 strong, till they shouted loud for glee, and gave him gifts of 
 pearls and gold, and spoils of the forest free. 
 
 But a sudden change came o'er his heart ere the setting of 
 the sun, and Tubal Cain was fiU'd with pain for the evil he had 
 done ; he saw that men, with rage and hate, made war upon 
 their kind, that the land was red with the blood they shed in 
 their lust of carnage, bUnd. And he said — " Alas ! that ever 
 I made, or that skUl of mine should plan, the spear and the 
 sword, for men whose joy is to slay their fellow-man ! " 
 
 And for many a day old Tubal Cain sat brooding o'er his 
 woe ; and his hand forbore to smite the ore, and his furnace 
 smoulder'd low. But he rose at last with a cheerful face, and 
 a bright courageous eye, and bared his strong right arm for 
 work, while the quick flames mounted high. And he sang — 
 " Hurrah for my handiwork ! " and the red sparks lit the air ; 
 " not alone for the blade was the bright steel made ; " and he 
 fashion'd the first ploughshare. 
 
 And men, taught wisdom from the Past, in friendship join'd 
 their hands, hung the sword in the hall, the spear on the wall, 
 and plough'd the willing lands, and sang — " Hurrah for Tubal 
 Cain ! our stanch good friend is he ; and for the ploughshare 
 and the plough, to him our praise shall be. But while Oppres- 
 sion lifts its head, or a tyrant would be lord, though we thank 
 him chiefly for the Plough, we'll not forget the Sword ! " 
 
 Contest between the Nose and the Eyes. 
 
 Between Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose, the spec- 
 tacles set them unhappily wrong ; the point in dispute was, as 
 all the world knows, to which the said spectacles ought to

 belong. So the Tongue was the lawyer, and argued the cause 
 with a great deal of skill, and a wig full of learning ; while 
 Chief -baron Ear sat to balance the laws, so famed for his talent 
 in nicely discerning. "In behalf of the Nose, it will quickly 
 appear, and your lordship," he said, " will undoubtedly find, 
 that the Nose has had spectacles always in wear, which amounts 
 to possession, time out of mind." Then holding the spectacles 
 up to the court — " Your lordship observes they are made with 
 a straddle, as wide as the ridge of the nose is ; in short, de- 
 signed to sit close to it, just like a saddle. Again, would your 
 lordship a moment suppose ('tis a case that has happened, and 
 may be again,) that the visage or countenance had not a Nose, 
 pray, who would, or who could, wear spectacles then ? On the 
 whole, it appears, and my argument shows, with a reasoning 
 the court will never condemn, that the spectacles plainly were 
 made for the Nose, and the Nose was as plainly intended for 
 them." 
 
 Then shifting his side, as a lawyer knows how, he pleaded 
 again in behalf of the Byes ; but what were his arguments few 
 people know, for the Court did not think they were equally 
 wise. So his lordship decreed, in a grave solemn tone, decisive 
 and clear, without one if or hut, that — " Whenever the Nose 
 put his spectacles on, by daylight or candle-light — Eyes should 
 be shut." 
 
 The Bachelor's Dream.

 She look'd so fair, she sang so well, I could but woo, and 
 she was won ! myself ia blue, the bride in white, the ring was 
 placed, the deed was done ! Away we went in chaise and four, 
 as fast as grinning boys could flog — what d'ye think of that,

 What loving tete-a-tetes to come ! But tete-a-tetes must stUl

 live with her ! With Sister Belle she couldn't part, but all -nnj 
 ties had leave to jog — what d'ye think of that, my cat? what 
 d'ye think of that, my dog ? 
 
 The Mother brought a pretty poll — a monkey, too — what 
 work he made! the Sister introduced a Beau — my Susan 
 brought a favourite Maid. She had a tabby of her own, a 
 snappish mongrel, • christen'd Gog — what d'ye think of that, 
 my cat ? what d'ye think of that, my dog ? 
 
 The monkey bit — the parrot scream'd — aU day the Sister 
 strumm'd and sung ; the petted Maid was such a scold ! my 
 Susan learned to use her tongue ! No longer " Deary ! " 
 " Duck ! " and " Love ! " I soon came down to simple " Mogg ! " 
 — what d'ye think of that, my cat ? what d'ye think of that, 
 my dog ? 
 
 Her Mother had such wretched health, my comforts one by 
 one must go : the very servants crossed my wish — I found my 
 Susan schooled them so ! The poker hardly seem'd my own, I 
 might as well have been a log — what d'ye think of that, my 
 cat ? what d'ye think of that, my dog ? 
 
 My clothes they were the queerest shape ; such coats and 
 hats she never met ! My ways they were the oddest ways ; 
 my friends were such " a vulgar set ! " Poor Tomkinson was 
 snubb'd and huflf'd — she could not bear that Mister Blogg — 
 what d'ye think of that, my cat ? what d'ye think of that, my 
 dog? 
 
 At times we had a spar, and then Mamma must mingle in 
 the song — the Sister took a sister's part — the Maid declared 
 her master wrong — ^the parrot learn'd to call me " fool ! " my 
 life was like a London fog — what d'ye think of that, my cat ? 
 what d'ye think of that, my dog ? 
 
 My Susan's taste was superfine, as proved by bills that had 
 no end — / never had a decent coat—/ never had a coin to 
 spend ! She forced me to resign my club, lay down my pipe, 
 retrench my grog — what d'ye think of that, my cat? what 
 d'ye think of that, my dog ? 
 
 Now, was not that an awful dream, for one who single is, 
 and snug, — with pussy in the elbow-chair, and Tray reposing 
 on the rug ? If I must totter down the hill, 'tis safest done 
 without a clog — what d'ye think of that, my cat ? what d'ye 
 think of that, my dog ?

 Speech on the Outbreak of Hostilities with China; 
 dehvered in the House of Commons, 1857. 
 
 W. E. Gladstone. 
 
 There is not war with ChLna. No, Sir, there is not war 
 with China, but what is there ? There is hostility. There is 
 bloodshed. There is a trampling down of the weak by the 
 strong. There is the terrible and abominable retaliation of the 
 weak upon the strong. You are occupied in this House by 
 revolting and harrowing details about a Chinese baker, who 
 poisoned bread, — by proclamations for the capture of British 
 heads, — and the waylaying of a postal steamer. And these 
 things you think strengthen your case. Why, they deepen your 
 guilt. War taken at the best is a frightful scourge to the human 
 race; but because it is so, the wisdom of ages has surrounded it 
 with strict laws and usages, and has required formalities to be 
 observed, which shall act as a curb upon the wild passions of 
 man, to prevent that scourge from being let loose, unless 
 under circumstances of fuU deliberation and from absolute 
 necessity. You have dispensed with all these precautions. 
 You have turned a consul into a diplomatist, and that meta- 
 morphosed consul is, forsooth, to be at liberty to direct the 
 whole might of England against the head of a .defenceless 
 people. While war is a scourge and a curse to man, it is yet 
 attended with certain compensations. It is attended with 
 acts of heroic self-sacrifice and of unbounded daring. It is 
 ennobled by a consciousness that you are meeting equals in 
 the field, and that while you challenge the issue of life or 
 death, you at least enter into a fair encounter. But you go 
 to China and make war upon those who stand before you as 
 women or children. And what do these people, who are as 
 mere women and children, when you make war upon them ? 
 They resort to those miserable and detestable contrivances

 which their weakness teaches them. It is not the first time 
 in the history of the world. Have you never read of those 
 rebellions of the slaves, which have risen to the dignity of 
 being called wars, and which stand recorded in history as the 
 servile wars ? And is it not notorious that among aU the 
 wars upon record these have been the most terrible, ferocious, 
 and destructive ? And why ? Because those who have been 
 trampled upon, adopt in their turn the practices of their op- 
 pressors. An.d that is the character of the war which we are 
 prosecuting in China. Every account that we shall read in the 
 journals or hear recited in this House, will teU of calamity 
 heaped upon calamity, and of cruelty heaped upon cruelty. 
 
 But I find an appeal has been made to this House which 
 appears to me to be a false and illegitimate appeal. It is an 
 appeal to fear, which is seldom a rightful and noble senti- 
 ment ; and it is to that fear which is the basis of the worst 
 kind of fear — the fear of being thought afraid. The Govern- 
 ment are afraid of the mischievous impression that will be 
 produced upon the Chinese, if the acts of our officials are dis- 
 avowed. Sir, let us consider fairly, impartially, and at large, 
 the moral impressions that must be produced. Let us weigh 
 the evil upon one side and the other, and I have no fear for 
 the result. , Hereafter we shall be told by the noble lord, of 
 the wise caution that we ought to display, of the solemn pre- 
 dicament in which we are placed, of the political mischief 
 which may ensue. Shadowy pictures will be drawn of the 
 dangers, the confusion, the weakness, and paralysis of British 
 power in the East. But what is the foundation of British 
 power in the East — what is the foundation of the promise to 
 be permanent and useful of that British power ! It is not 
 now a question as if the Chinese are alone concerned, for the 
 debate has been prolonged night after night, and your words 
 have gone throughout the whole earth. The confessions and 
 avowals of the supporters of the Government have been, it 
 appears to me, perfectly fatal either to the continuance of that 
 policy, or else to the character and fame of England. You talk 
 of the consequences, and talk of injustice, and then say that we 
 must go on with that injustice. When you speak of the necessity 
 of applying the law of force to the Chinese, and that it is by 
 force that your influence must spread, I am bound to admit,

 and I do admit, that you have not power to prevent the 
 language of this debate from being read. The opponents of 
 the resolution of my hon. friend, have not generally ascended 
 to the height of boldness. Few have justified the proceedings 
 that have taken place. Many of those who intend to support 
 the Government have openly condemned the proceedings that 
 have taken place. Members more than I could name have 
 condemned the proceedings. I will ask what the effect will 
 be throughout the world, if it goes forth that in the debates 
 held in the two Houses of Parliament, the majority of speakers 
 condemned the proceedings, and that even among those who 
 sustained the Government with their vote, there was a large 
 number who condemned these proceedings. Why, sir, the 
 opinion will be that England is a power which, while it is 
 higher and more daring in its pretensions to Christianity than 
 any other Power on the face of the globe, yet that in a case 
 where her own interests were concerned, and where she was 
 acting in the remote and distant East, when fairly put to it 
 and asked whether she would do right or wrong, she was ready 
 to adopt, for fear of poKtical inconvenience, the principle — " I 
 wiU make the law of wrong the law of my Eastern policy, and 
 will lay the foundation of that empire which is my proudest 
 boast, in nothing more nor less than gross injustice." Sir, 
 this is not my opinion. I will not believe that England will 
 lay the foundations of its Eastern empire on such miserable 
 ground as this. I believe, on the contrary, that if you have 
 the courage to assert your prerogative as the British House of 
 Commons, you will pursue a course which is more consistent 
 with sound policy as well as the eternal principles of justice. 
 Sir, how stands the case at present? I have just now supposed 
 that the House are going to affirm that resolution which will 
 be the seal of our disgrace. But let me reverse the picture 
 and suppose that the House will adopt the other resolution, 
 and then what will the House do, and what will be the history 
 of this case ? Its history will read weU for England, and for 
 the 19th century. Its history wUl, then, be this : — The sub- 
 ordinate officers of England, in a remote quarter of the globe, 
 misconstrued the intentions of their country ; they acted in 
 violation of the principle of right ; the Executive Government 
 failed to check them. The appeal was next made to the House

 of Lords, and made as such an appeal ought to be made, for 
 the House was worthy of the eloquence, and the eloquence 
 was worthy of the cause. It was made to nobles and it was 
 made to bishops, and it failed. But it does not rest with sub- 
 ordinate functionai'ies abroad, it does not rest with the Execu- 
 tive Government, it does not rest with the House of Lords, 
 finally, and in the last resort, to say what shall be the policy 
 of Engla,nd, and to what purpose her power shall be directed. 
 Sir, that function lies within these walls. Every member of 
 the House of Commons is proudly conscious that he belongs 
 to an assembly, which in its collective capacity is the para- 
 mount power of the State. But if it is the paramount power 
 of the State, it can never separate from that paramount power 
 a similar and paramount responsibility. The vote of the 
 House of Lords will not acquit us ; the sentence of the Govern- 
 ment will not acquit us. It is with us that it lies to deter- 
 mine, whether this wrong shall remain unchecked and uncor- 
 rected j and in a time when sentiments are so much divided, 
 every man, I trust, will give his vote with the recollection and 
 the consciousness, that it may depend upon his single vote 
 whether the miseries, the crimes, the atrocities that I fear are 
 now proceeding in China, are to be discountenanced or not. 
 We have now come to the crisis of the case. England is not 
 yet committed. But if an adverse division reject the motion 
 of my hon. friend to-morrow morning, England will have been 
 committed. With every one of us it rests to show that this 
 House, which is the first, the most ancient, and the noblest 
 temple of freedom in the world, is also the temple of that 
 everlasting justice, without which freedom itself would be only 
 a name, or only a curse to mankind. And, Sir, I cherish the 
 trust and belief, that when you rise in your place to-night, to 
 declare the numbers of the division from the chair which you 
 adorn, the words which you speak will go forth from the walls 
 of the House of Commons, as a message of mercy and peace, 
 but also as a message of prudence and true wisdom, to the 
 farthest corners of the world.

 Speech after the Declaration of War with 
 
 Russia. 
 Delivered in the House of Commons, March, 1854. 
 
 John Bright. 
 
 But I come now to another point. How are the interests 
 of England involved in this question ? This is, after all, the 
 great matter which we, the representatives of the people of 
 England, have to consider. It is not a question of sympathy 
 with any other state. I have sympathy with Turkey ; I have 
 sympathy with the serfs of Russia ; I have sympathy with 
 the people of Hungary, whose envoy the noble lord the mem- 
 ber for Tiverton refused to see, and the overthrow of whose 
 struggle for freedom by the armies of Russia he needlessly 
 justified in this House ; I have sympathy with the Italians, 
 subjects of Austria, ISTaples, and the Pope ; I have sympathy 
 with the three millions of slaves in the United States ; but it 
 is not on a question of sympathy that I dare involve this 
 country, or any country, in a war which must cost an incalcul- 
 able amount of treasure and of blood. It is not our duty to 
 make this country the knight-errant of the human race, and to 
 take upon ourselves the protection of the thousand millions of 
 human beings who have been permitted by the Creator of all 
 things to people this planet. 
 
 The hon. member for Aylesbury spoke of our triumphant 
 position — the position in which the Government has placed 
 us by pledging this country to support the Turks. I see 
 nothing like a triumph in the fact, that in addition to our 
 many duties to our own country, we have accepted the defence 
 of twenty milUons or more of the people of Turkey, on whose 
 behalf, but, I believe, not for their benefit, we are about to 
 sacrifice the blood and treasure of England. But there are 
 other*^enalties and other considerations. With regard to 
 trade, I can speak with some authority as to the state of things 
 in Lancashire. The Russian trade is not only at an end, but 
 it is made an offence against the law to deal with any of our 
 customers in Russia. The German trade is most injuriously 
 affected by the uncertainty which prevails on the Continent

 of Europe. The Levant trade, a very important branch, is 
 almost extinguished in the present state of affairs in Greece, 
 Turkey-in-Europe, and Syria. All property in trade is dim- 
 inishing in value, whilst its burdens are increasing. 
 
 I do not pretend to ask thehon. member for Aylesbury (Mr. 
 Layard) to put these losses, these great destructions of property, 
 against the satisfaction he feels at the " triumphant position " 
 at which we have arrived. He may content himself with the 
 dream that we are supporting the "integrity and independence" 
 of Turkey, though I doubt whether bringing three foreign 
 armies on her soil, raising insurrections in her provinces, and 
 hopelessly exhausting her finances, is a rational mode of main- 
 taining her as an independent power. But we are sending out 
 30,000 troops to Turkey, and in that number are not included 
 the men serving on board the fleets. Here are 30,000 Hves ! 
 There is a thrill of horror sometimes when a single life is lost, 
 and we sigh at the loss of a friend, — or of a casual acquaint- 
 ance ! But here we are in danger of losing, and I give the 
 opinions of military men, and not my own merely — 10,000 or 
 it may be 20,000 lives, that may be sacrificed in this struggle. 
 I have never pretended to any sympathy for the military pro- 
 fession, but I have sympathy for my fellow-men and fellow- 
 countrymen, wherever they may be. I have heard very 
 melancholy accounts of the scenes which have been witnessed 
 in the separations from families occasioned by this expedition 
 to the East. But, it will be said, and probably the noble lord 
 the member for Tiverton will say, that it is a just war, a 
 glorious war, and that I am full of morbid sentimentahty, and 
 that I have introduced topics not worthy to be mentioned in 
 Parliament. But these are matters affecting the happiness of 
 the homes of England ; and we, who are the representatives 
 and guardians of those homes, when the grand question of war 
 is before us, should know at least that we have a case — that 
 success is probable — and that an object is attainable commen- 
 surate with the cost of war. 
 
 I am told indeed that the war is popular, and that it is 
 foolish and eccentric to oppose it. I do not trouble myself 
 whether my conduct in Parliament is popular or not. I care 
 only that it shall be wise and just as regards the permanent 
 interests of my country ; and I despise from the bottom of my

 heart the man who speaks a word in favour of this war, or of 
 any war which he believes might have been avoided, merely 
 because the press and a portion of the people urge the Govern- 
 ment to carry it on. 
 
 I believe if this country, seventy years ago, had adopted the 
 principle of non-intervention in every case where her interests 
 were not directly and obviously assailed, she would have been 
 saved from much of the pauperism and Isrutal crimes by which 
 our government and people have alike been disgraced. This 
 country might have been a garden, every dwelling might have 
 been gf marble, and every person who treads its soil might 
 have been sufficiently educated. We should indeed have had 
 less of military glory. We might have had neither Trafalgar 
 nor Waterloo ; but we should have set a high example of a 
 Christian nation, free in its institutions, courteous and just in 
 its conduct towards all foreign states, and resting its policy 
 on the unchangeable foundation of Christian morality. 
 
 Knowledge and the Aspiration of Youth. 
 
 Benjamin Diseaeli. 
 
 As civilization has gradually progressed, it has equalized 
 the physical qualities of man. Instead of the strong arm, it 
 is the strong head that is now the moving principle of society. 
 You have disenthroned force, and placed on her high seat 
 intelligence ; and the necessary consequence of this great revo- 
 lution is, that it has become the duty and delight equally of 
 every citizen to cultivate his faculties. The prince of all 
 philosophy has told you, in immortal apophthegm, so familiar 
 to you all Ijiat it is now written in your halls and chambers]] 
 " Knowledge is power." If the memorable passage had been 
 pursued by the student who first announced the discovery of 
 that great man to society ; he would have found an oracle not 
 less striking, and in my mind certainly not less true ; for 
 Lord Bacon has not only said that "Knowledge is power," 
 but living one century after the discovery of the printing- 
 press, he has also announced to the world that " Knowledge 
 is pleasure."

 Why, when the great body of mankind had become familiar 
 ■with this great discovery — when they learned that a new source 
 was opened to them of influence and enjoyment, is it wonderful 
 that from that hour the heart of nations has palpitated with 
 the desire of becoming acquainted with all that has happened, 
 and with speculating on what may occur ? It has indeed pro- 
 duced upon the popular intellect an influence as great — I 
 might say analogous to — the great change which was produced 
 upon the old commercial world by the discovery of the 
 Americas. A new standard of value was introduced, and, 
 after this, to be distinguished, man must be intellectual. Nor, 
 indeed, am I surprised that this feeling has so powerfully in- 
 fluenced our race ; for the idea that human happiness is de- 
 pendent on the cultivation of the mind, and on the discovery 
 of truth, is, next to the conviction of our immortality, the 
 idea the most full of consolation to man ; for the cultivation 
 of the mind has no limits, and truth is the only thing that is 
 eternal. Indeed, when you consider what a man is who knows 
 only what is passing under his own eyes, and what the con- 
 dition of the same man must be who belongs to an Institution 
 Uke the one which has assembled us together to-night, is it — 
 ought it to be — a matter of surprise that, from that moment 
 to the present, you have had a general feeling throughout the 
 civilized world in favour of a diffusion of knowledge ? A man 
 who knows nothing but the history of the passing hour, who 
 knows nothing of the history of the past,(put that a certain 
 person whose brain was as vacant as his own occupied the 
 same house as himself who in a moment of despondency or of 
 gloom has no hope in the morrow because he has read nothing 
 that has taught him that the morrow has any changes — that 
 man, compared with him who has read the most ordinary 
 abridgement of history, or the most common philosophical 
 speculation, is as distinct and different an animal as if he had 
 fallen from some other planet, was influenced by a different 
 organization, working for a different end, and hoping for a 
 different result. It is knowledge that equalizes the social 
 condition of man — that gives to all, however different their 
 political position, passions which are in common, and enjoy- 
 ments which are universal. Knowledge is like the mystic 
 ladder in the patriarch's dream. Its base rests on the prime-

 val earth — its crest is lost in the shadowy splendour or empy- 
 rean ; while the great authors who for traditionary ages have 
 held the chain of science and philosophy, of poesy and erudi-

 Speech on Parliamentary Reform, delivered in 
 the House of Commons, 1831. 
 
 T. B. Macaulay. 
 
 The question of Parliamentary Reform is still behind. But 
 signs, of which it is impossible to misconceive the import, do 
 most clearly indicate, that unless that question also be speedily 
 settled, property and order, and all the institutions of tliis 
 great monarchy, will be exposed to fearful peril. Is it possible 
 that gentlemen, long versed in high political affairs, cannot 
 read these signs ? Is it possible that they can really believe 
 that the representative system of England, such as it is now, 
 will last tUl the year 1860 ? If not, for what would they have 
 us wait % "Would they have us wait merely that we may show 
 to all the world how little we have profited by our own recent 
 experience ! Would they have us wait that we may once 
 again hit the exact point where we can neither refuse with 
 authority nor concede with grace ? Would they have us wait 
 that the numbers of the discontented party may become larger, 
 its demands higher, its feelings more acrimonious, its organisa- 
 tion more complete ! Would they have us wait tUl the whole 
 tragi-comedy of 1827 has been acted over again, ^till they 
 have been brought into office by a cry of "No Reform ! " to 
 be reformers, as they were once before brought into office by a 
 cry of " No Popery ! " to be emancipators ! Have they oblit- 
 erated from their minds — gladly perhaps would some among 
 them obliterate from their minds — the transactions of that 
 year ? And have they forgotten all the transactions of the 
 succeeding year? Have they forgotton how the spirit of 
 liberty in Ireland, debarred from its natural outlet, found a 
 vent by forbidden passages ? Have they forgotten how we

 were forced to indulge them in all the license of rebels, merely 
 because we chose to withhold from them the liberties of sub- 
 jects ? Do they wait for associations more formidable than 
 that of the Corn Exchange — for contributions larger than the 
 rent — for agitators more violent than those who, three years 
 ago, divided with the King and the Parliament the sove- 
 reignty of Ireland. Do they wait for the last and most dreadful 
 paroxysm of popular rage — for that last and most cruel test of 
 military fidelity ? 
 
 Let them wait, if their past experience shall induce them to 
 think that any high honour or any exquisite pleasure is to be 
 obtained by a policy like this. Let them wait, if this strange 
 and fearful infatuation be indeed upon them, — that they 
 should not see with their eyes, or hear with their ears, or 
 understand with their heart. But let us know our interest 
 and our duty better ; turn where we may, — within, around, — 
 the voice of great events is proclaiming to us reform, that we 
 may preserve. Now, therefore, while everything at home and 
 abroad forebodes ruin to those who persist in a hopeless 
 struggle against the spirit of the age, — now while the crash of 
 the proudest thrones of the continent is still resounding in 
 our ears, — now, while the roof of a British palace affords an 
 ignominious shelter to the exiled heir of forty kings, — now, 
 while we see on every side ancient institutions subverted and 
 great societies dissolved, — now, while the heart of England is 
 still sound, — now, while the old feelings and the old associations 
 retain a power and a charm which may too soon pass away, — 
 now, in this, your accepted time, — now, in this, your day of 
 salvation, take counsel, not of prejudice, not of party spirit, 
 not of the ignominious pride of a fatal consistency, but of 
 history, of reason, of the ages which are past, of the signs of 
 this most portentous time. Pronounce in a manner worthy 
 of the expectation with which this great debate has been 
 anticipated, and of the long remembrance which it will leave 
 behind. Renew the youth of the state. Save property di- 
 vided against itself. Save the multitude, endangered by their 
 own ungovernable passions. Save the aristocracy, endangered 
 by its own unpopular power. Save the greatest, the finest, 
 and most highly civilized community that ever existed, from 
 calamities which may in a few days sweep away all the rich

 heritage of so many ages of wisdom and glory. The danger 
 is terrible. The time is short. If this bill should be rejected, 
 I pray to God that none of those who concur in rejecting it 
 may ever remember their votes with unavailing regret, amidst 
 the wreck of laws, the confusion of ranks, the spoliation of

 NARRATIVE. 
 
 The Three Cherry-Stones. 
 
 When I was a schoolboy, more than fifty years ago, I re- 
 membered to have read a story, which may have been a fiction, 
 but which was very naturally told, and made a deep impression 
 upon me then. I will endeavour to draw it forth from the 
 looker of my memory, and relate it as nearly as I can recollect. 
 
 Three young gentlemen, who had finished the most sub- 
 stantial part of their repast, were lingering over their fruit 
 and wine at a tavern in London, when a man of middle age 
 and middle stature entered the public room where they were 
 sitting, seated himself at one end of a small unoccupied table, 
 and calling the waiter, ordered a simple mutton chop and a 
 glass of ale. His appearance, at first view, was not likely to 
 arrest the attention of any one. His hair was beginning to be 
 thin and grey ; the expression of his countenance was sedate, 
 with a slight touch, perhaps, of melancholy; and he wore a 
 grey surtout with a standing collar, which manifestly had seen 
 service, if the wearer had not — just such a thing as an officer 
 would bestow upon his serving-man. He might be taken, 
 plausibly enough, for a country magistrate, or an attorney of 
 limited practice, or a schoolmaster. 
 
 He continued to masticate his chop and sip his ale in silence, 
 without lifting his eyes from the table, until a cherry-stone, 
 sportively snapped from the thumb and finger of one of the 
 gentlemen at the opposite table, struck him upon his right "ear. 
 His eye was instantly upon the aggressor, and his ready intelli- 
 gence gathered from the ill-suppressed merriment of the party 
 that this petty impertinence was intentional. 
 


## p. (#212) ################################################

200 The EletHents of Elocution. 
 
 The stranger stooped and picked up the cherry-stone, and a 
 scarcely perceptible smile passed over his features as he care- 
 fully wrapped it up in a piece of paper, and placed it in his 
 pocket. This singular procedure, with their preconceived im- 
 pressions of their customer, somewhat elevated as the young 
 gentlemen were by the wine they had partaken of, capsized 
 their gravity entirely, and a burst of irresistible laughter pro- 
 ceeded from the group. 
 
 Unmoved by this rudeness, the stranger continued to finish 
 his frugal repast in quiet, until another cherry-stone, from the 
 same hand, struck him upon the right elbow. This also, to 
 the infinite amusement of the other party, he picked from the 
 floor and carefully deposited with the first. 
 
 Amidst shouts of laughter, a third cherry-stone was soon after 
 discharged, which hit him upon the left breast. This also he 
 very deliberately took from the floor, and deposited with the 
 other two. 
 
 As he rose, and was engaged in paying for his repast, the 
 gaiety of these sporting gentlemen became slightly subdued. 
 It was not easy to account for this. Lavater would not have 
 been able to detect the slightest evidence of irritation or re- 
 sentment upon the features of the stranger. He seemed a 
 little taller, to be sure, and the carriage of his head might 
 have appeared to them rather more erect. He walked to the 
 table at which they were sitting, and with that air of dignified 
 calmness which is a thousand times more terrible than wrath, 
 drew a card from his pocket, and presented it with perfect 
 civility to the offender, who could do no less than ofier his own 
 in return. While the stranger unclosed his surtout, to take 
 the card from his pocket, they had a glance at the undress 
 coat of a military man. The card disclosed his rank, and a 
 brief enquiry at the bar was sufiicient for the rest. He was 
 a captain whom ill-health and long service had entitled to 
 half-pay. In earlier life he had been engaged in several affairs 
 of honour, and, in the dialect of the fancy, was a dead shot. 
 
 The next morning a note arrived at the aggressor's residence, 
 containing a challenge in form, and one of the cherry-stones. 
 The truth then flashed before the challenged party — it was the 
 
 challenger's intention to make three bites at this cherry three 
 
 separate afiairs out of this unwarrantable frolic ! 
 


## p. (#213) ################################################

The Elements of Elocution. 201 
 
 The challenge was accepted, and the challenged party, in 
 deference to the challenger's reputed skill with the pistol, had 
 half decided upon the small sword ; but his friends, who were 
 on the alert, soon discovered that the captain, who had risen 
 by his merit, had, in the earlier days of his necessity, gained 
 his bread as an accomplished instructor in the use of that 
 weapon. 
 
 They met, and fired alternately, by lot — the young man had 
 selected this mode, thinking he might win the first fire — he 
 did — ^fired, and missed his opponent. The captain levelled his 
 pistol and fired — the baU passed through the flap of the right 
 ear, and grazed the bone ; and, as the wounded man involun- 
 tarily put his hand to the place, he remembered that it was on 
 the right ear of his antagonist that the cherry-stone had fallen. 
 Here ended the first lesson. A month had passed. His friends 
 cherished the hope that he would hear notlung more from the 
 captain, when another note — a challenge, of course — and 
 another of those ominous cherry-stones arrived, with the cap- 
 tain's apology, on the score of iU-health, for not sending it 
 before. 
 
 A^ain they met — fired simultaneously, and the captain, who 
 was unhurt, shattered the right elbow of his antagonist — the 
 very point on which he had been struck by the cherry-stone ; 
 and here ended the second lesson. There was something aw- 
 fully impressive in the modus operandi and exquisite skill of 
 his antagonist. The third cherry-stone was still in his posses- 
 sion, and the aggressor had not forgotten that it had struck 
 the 'unojffending gentleman upon the left breast. A month 
 had passed — another— and another, of terrible suspense ; but 
 nothing was heard from the captain. Intelligence had been 
 received that he was confined to his lodging by illness. 
 
 At lenf^th, the gentleman who had been his second m the 
 former duels' once more presented himself, and tendered another 
 note which, as the recipient perceived on taking it, contained 
 the last of the cherry-stones. The note was superscribed m 
 the captain's weU-known hand, but it was the writing evi- 
 dently of one who wrote feebly. There was an unusual solem- 
 nity also in the manner of him who deHvered it The seal 
 was broken, and there was the cherry-stone in a blank enve- 
 lope.

 An Attic Philosopher in Paris. 
 
 LET US LOVE ONE ANOTHER. 
 
 I had reached one of the remote streets, in which those who 
 would live ia comfort and without ostentation, and who love 
 serious reflection, delight to find a home. There were no shops 
 along the dimly Ht pavement ; one heard no sounds but of the 
 distant carriages, and of the steps of some of the inhabitants 
 returning quietly home. 
 
 I instantly recognised the street, though I had only been 
 there once before. 
 
 That was two years ago. I was walking at the time by the 
 side of the Seine, to which the lights on the quays and bridges 
 gave the aspect of a lake surrounded by a garland of stars ; 
 and I had reached the Louvre, when I was stopped by a crowd 
 collected near the parapet : they had gathered round a child of 
 about six, who was crying, and I asked the cause of his tears. 
 
 " It seems that he was sent to walk in the Tuilleries," said a 
 mason, who was returning from his work with his trowel in his 
 hand ; " the servant who took care of him met with some 
 friends there, and told the child to wait for him while he went 
 to get a drink ; but I suppose the drink made him more 
 thirsty, for he has not come back, and the child cannot find 
 his way home." 
 
 " Why do they not ask him his name, and where he lives % " 
 
 " They have been doing it for the last hour ; but all he can 
 say is, that he is called Charles, and that his father is M. 
 Duval — there are twelve hundred Duvals in Paris." 
 
 " Then he does not know in what part of the town he lives ? " 
 
 " I should think not, indeed ! Don't you see that he is a 
 gentleman's child ? He has never gone out except in a 
 carriage, or with a servant ; he does not know what to do by 
 himself."

 Here the mason was interrupted by some of the voices 
 rising above the others. 
 
 " We cannot leave him in the street," said some. 
 
 '• The child-stealers would carry him ott," continued others. 
 
 " We must take him to the overseer." 
 
 " Or to the police-office." 
 
 " That's the thing — come, little one ! " 
 
 But the child, frightened by these suggestions of danger, 
 and at the names of police and overseer, cried louder, and 
 drew back towards the parapet. In vain they tried to per- 
 suade him ; his fears made him resist the more, and the most 
 e:iger began to get weary, when the voice of a little boy was 
 heard through the confusion. 
 
 '' I know him well — I do," said he, looking at the lost 
 child ; " he belongs to our part of the town." 
 
 " What part is it ? " 
 
 " Yonder, on the other side of the Boulevards : Rue des 
 jifagasius." . 
 
 " And you have seen him before ? " 
 
 " Yes, yes ! he belongs to the great house at the end of the 
 street, where there is an iron gate with gilt points." ^ 
 
 The child quickly raised his head, and stopped crying. The 
 little boy answered all the questions that were put to him, and 
 gave such details as left no room for doubt. The other child 
 understood him, for he went up to him as if to put himself 
 under his protection. 
 
 " Then you can take him to his parents 1 " asked the mason, 
 who had listened with real interest to the little boy's account. 
 
 " I don't care if I do," replied he ; "it's the way I'm going." 
 
 " Then you will take charge of him ? " 
 
 " He has only to come with me."

 The crowd dispersed; for my part, I went towards the 
 Louvre : the thought came into my head to follow the two 
 children, so as to guard against any mistake. 
 
 I was not long in overtaking them ; they were walking side 
 by side, talking, and already quite familiar with one another. 
 The contrast in their dress then struck me. Little Duval wore 
 one of those fanciful children's dresses which are expensive as 
 well as in good taste ; his coat was skUfuUy fitted to his figure, 
 his trousers came down in plaits from the waist to his boots of 
 polished leather with mother-of-pearl buttons, and his ringlets 
 were half hid by a velvet cap. The appearance of his guide, 
 on the contrary, was that of the class who dwell on the extreme 
 borders of poverty, but who there maintain their ground with 
 no surrender. His old blouse, patched with pieces of different 
 shades, indicated the perseverance of an industrious mother 
 struggling against the wear and tear of time ; his trousers 
 were become too short, and showed his stockings darned over 
 and over again ; and it was evident that his shoes were not 
 made for him. 
 
 The countenances of the two children were not less different 
 than their dresses. That of the first was delicate and refined ; 
 his clear blue eye, his fair skin, and his smiling mouth, gave 
 him a charming look of innocence and happiness : the features 
 of the other, on the contrary, had something rough in them ; 
 his eye was quick and lively, his complexion dark, his smile less 
 merry than shrewd ; all showed a mind sharpened by too early 
 experience : he boldy walked through the middle of the streets 
 thronged by carriages, and followed their countless turnings 
 without hesitation. 
 
 I found, on asking him, that every day he carried dinner to 
 his father, who was then working on the left bank of the Seine ; 
 and this responsible duty had made him careful and prudent. 
 He had learned those hard but forcible lessons of necessity 
 which nothing can equal, or supply the place of. Unfortu- 
 nately the wants of his poor family had kept him from school, 
 and he seemed to feel the loss ; for he often stopped before the 
 print-shops, and asked his companion to read him the names of 
 the engravings. In this way we reached the Boulevard Bonne 
 Nouvelle, which the little wanderer seemed to know again : 
 notwithstanding his fatigue, he hurried on ; he was agitated by

 mixed feelings ; at the sight of his house he uttered a cry, and 
 ran towards the iron gate with the gilt points ; a lady who was 
 standing at the entrance received him in her arms, and from 
 the exclamations of joy, and the sound of kisses, I soon per- 
 ceived she was his mother. 
 
 Not seeing either the servant or child return, she had sent 
 in search of them in every direction, and was waiting for them 
 in intense anxiety. 
 
 I explained to her in a few words what had happened ; she 
 thanked me warmly, and looked round for the Kttle boy who 
 had recognised and brought back her son, but while we were 
 talking, he had disappeared. 
 
 It was for the first time since then, that I had come into 
 this part of Paris. Did the mother continue grateful ? Had 
 the children met again, and had the happy chance of their first 
 meeting lowered between them that barrier which may mark 
 the difi'erent ranks of men, but should not divide them ? 
 
 While putting these questions to myself, I slackened my 
 pace, and fixed my eyes on the great gate which I just perceived. 
 All at once I saw it open, and two children appeared at the 
 entrance. Although much grown, I recognised them at first 
 sight ; they were the chUd who was found near the parapet of 
 the Louvre, and his young guide. But the dress of the latter 
 was greatly changed : his blouse of grey cloth was neat, and 
 even spruce, and was fastened round the waist by a polished 
 leather belt ; he wore strong shoes, but made to his feet, and 
 had on a new cloth cap. 
 
 Just at the moment I saw him, he held in his two hands an 
 enormous bunch of lilacs, to which his companion was trying 
 to add narcissuses and primroses ; the two children laughed, 
 and parted with a friendly good-bye. M. Duval's son did not 
 go in till he had seen the other turn the corner of the street. 
 
 Then I accosted the latter, and reminded him of our former 
 meeting ; he looked at me for a moment, and then seemed to 
 recollect me. 
 
 " Forgive me if I do not make you a bow," said he merrily ; 
 " but I want both my hands for the nosegay Mr. Charles has 
 given me." 
 
 " You are, then, become great friends ? " said I. 
 
 " Oh ! I should think so," said the child : " and now my 
 father is rich, too ! "

 " How's that ? " 
 
 ■ " M. Duval lent liiTn a little money ; he has taken a shop, 
 where he works on his own account : and, as for me, I go to 
 school." 
 
 " Yes," repHed I, remarking for the first time the cross which 
 decorated his Kttle coat ; " and I see that you are head-boy ! " 
 
 " Mr. Charles helps me to learn, and so I am come to be the 
 first in the class." 
 
 " Are you now going to your lessons ? " 
 
 " Yes, and he has given me some lilacs ; for he has a garden 
 where we play together, and where my mother can always 
 have flowers." 
 
 " Then it is the same as if it were partly your own.'' 
 
 " So it is ! Ah ! they are good neighbours, indeed ! But here 
 I am ; good-bye, sir." 
 
 He nodded to me with a smile, and disappeared. 
 
 I went on with my walk, stiU pensive, but with a feeling of 
 relief. If I had elsewhere witnessed the painful contrast be- 
 tween affluence and want, here I had found the true union of 
 riches and poverty. Hearty good-will had smothered down the 
 more rugged inequalities on both sides, and had opened a road 
 of true neighbourhood and fellowship between the humble 
 workshop and the stately mansion. Instead of hearkening to 
 the voice of interest, they had both listened to that of self- 
 sacrifice, and there was no place left for contempt or envy. 
 Thus, instead of the beggar in rags, that I had seen at the other 
 door cursing the rich man, I had found here the happy child of 
 the labourer loaded with flowers, and blessing him ! The 
 problem, so difficult and so dangerous to examine into with no 
 regard but for the rights of it, I had just seen solved by love. 
 
 DESCRIPTIVE. 
 
 Oopperfield's Houskeeping. 
 
 I doubt whether two young birds could have known less 
 about keeping house, than I and my pretty Dora did. We 
 had a servant, of course. She kept house for us.

 Her name was Paragon. Her nature was represented to us, 
 when we engaged her, as being feebly expressed in her name, 
 bhe had a written character, as large as a proclamation ; and 
 according to this document, could do everything of a domestic 
 nature that ever I heard of, and a great many things that I 
 never did hear of. She was a woman in the prime of life ; of 
 a severe countenance; and subject (particularly in the arms) 
 to a sort of perpetual measles or fiery rash. She had a cousin 
 in the Life Guards, with such long legs that he looked Hke the 
 afternoon shadow of somebody else. His shell-jacket was as 
 much too little for him as he was too big for the premises. 
 He made the cottage smaller than it need have been, by being 
 so very much out of proportion to it. Besides which, the 
 walls were not thick, and whenever he passed the evening at 
 our house, we always knew of it by hearing one continued 
 growl in the kitchen. 
 
 Our treasure was warranted sober and honest. I am there- 
 fore willing to believe that she was in a fit when we found 
 her under the boiler ; and that the deficient teaspoons were 
 attributable to the dustman. 
 
 But she preyed upon our minds dreadfully. We felt our 
 inexperience, and were unable to help ourselves. We should 
 have been at her mercy, if she had any; but she was a 
 remorseless woman, and had none. 
 
 The. next domestic trial we went through, was the Ordeal 
 of Servants. Mary Anne's cousin deserted into our coal-hole, 
 and was brought out, to our great amazement, by a piquet of 
 his companions in arms, who took him away handcuifed in a 
 procession that covered our front-garden with ignominy. This 
 nerved me to get rid of Mary Anne, who went so mildly, on 
 receipt of wages, that I was surprised, until I found out about 
 the teaspoons, and also about the little sums she had borrowed 
 in my name of the tradespeople without authority. After an 
 interval of Mrs. Kidgerbury — the oldest inhabitant of Kentish 
 Town, I believe, who went out charing, but was too feeble 
 to execute her conceptions of that art — we found another 
 treasure, who was one of the most amiable of women, but who 
 generally made a point of falling either up or down the kitchen

 stairs with the tray, and almost plunged into the parlour, as 
 into a bath, with the tea-things. The ravages committed by 
 this unfortunate, rendering her dismissal necessary, she was 
 succeeded (with intervals of Mrs. Kidgerbury) by a long line 
 of Incapables; terminating in a young person of genteel 
 appearance, who went to Greenwich Fair in Dora's bonnet. 
 After whom I remember nothing but an average equality of 
 failure. 
 
 Everybody we had anything to do with seemed to cheat us. 
 Our appearance in a shop was a signal for the damaged goods 
 to be brought out immediately. If we bought a lobster, it 
 was full of water. All our meat turned out to be tough, and 
 there was hardly any crust to our loaves. In search of the 
 principle on which joints ought to be roasted, to be roasted 
 enough, and not too much, I myself referred to the Cookery 
 Book, and found it there established as the allowance of a 
 quarter of an hour to every pound, and say a quarter over. 
 But the principle always failed us by some curious fatality, and 
 
 we never could hit any medium between redness and cinders. 
 ***** 
 
 One of our first feats in the housekeeping way was a little 
 dinner to Traddles. I met him in town, and asked him to 
 walk out with me that afternoon. He readily consenting, I 
 wrote to Dora, saying I would bring him home. It was 
 pleasant weather, and on the road we made my domestic 
 happiness the theme of conversation. Traddles was very full 
 of it ; and said that, picturing himself with such a home, 
 and Sophy waiting and preparing for him, he could think of 
 nothing wanting to complete his bliss. 
 
 I could not have wished for a prettier little wife at the 
 opposite end of the table, but I certainly could have wished, 
 when we sate down, for a little more room. I did not know 
 how it was, but though there were only two of us, we were at 
 once always cramped for room, and yet had always room 
 enough to lose everything in. I suspect it may have been 
 because nothing had a place of its own, except Jip's pagoda, 
 which invariably blocked up the main thoroughfare. On the 
 present occasion, Traddles was so hemmed in by the pagoda 
 and the guitar-case, and Dora's flower-painting, and my 
 writing-table, that I had serious doubts of the possibility of his

 using his knife and fork ; but he protested, with his own good- 
 humour, " Oceans of room, Copperfield ! I assure you. Oceans!" 
 There was another thing I could have wished, namely, that 
 Jip had never been encouraged to walk about the table-cloth 
 during dinner. I began to think there was something dis- 
 orderly in his being there at all, even if he had not been in the 
 habit of putting his foot in the salt or the melted-butter. On 
 this occasion he seemed to think he was introduced expressly 
 to keep Traddles at bay ; and he barked at my old friend, and 
 made short runs at his plate, with such undaunted pertinacity, 
 that he may be said to have engrossed the conversation. 
 
 However, as I knew how tender-hearted my dear Dora wa?!, 
 and how sensitive she would be to any slight upon her favourite, 
 I hinted no objection. For similar reasons I made no allusion 
 to the skirmishing plates upon the floor ; or to the disreputable 
 appearance of the castors, which were all at sixes and sevens, 
 and looked drunk ; or to the further blockade of Traddles by 
 wandering vegetable dishes and jugs. I could not help won- 
 dering in my own mind, as I contemplated the boiled leg of 
 mutton before me, previous to carving it, how it came to pass 
 that our joints of meat were of such extraordinary shapes — 
 and whether our butcher contracted for all the deformed sheep 
 that came into the world ; but I kept my reflections to myself. 
 
 "My love," said I to Dora, "what have you got in that 
 dish?" 
 
 I could not imagine why Dora had been making tempting 
 little faces at me, as if she wanted to kiss me. 
 
 " Oysters, dear," said Dora, timidly. 
 
 " Was that your thought ? " said I, delighted. 
 
 " Ye-yes, Doady," said Dora. 
 
 " There never was a happier one ! " I exclaimed, laying down 
 the carving-knife and fork. " There is nothing Traddles likes 
 so much ! " 
 
 "Ye-yes, Doady," said Dora, " and so I bought a beautiful 
 little barrel of them, and the man said they were very good. 
 But I— I am afraid there 's something the matter with them. 
 They don't seem right." Here Dora shook her head, and 
 diamonds twinkled in her eyes. 
 
 "They are only opened in both shells," said T. " lake the 
 top one off, my love."

 "But it won't come off," said Dora, trying very hard, and 
 looking very much distressed. 
 
 " Do you know, Copperfield," said Traddles, cheerfully ex- 
 amining the dish, "I think it is in consequence — they are 
 capital oysters, but I think it is in consequence — of their 
 never having been opened." 
 
 They never had been opened ; and we had no oyster-knives 
 
 and couldn't have used them if we had ; so we looked at the 
 
 oysters and ate the mutton. At least we ate as much of it as 
 was done, and made up with capers. If I had permitted him, 
 I am satisfied that Traddles would have made a perfect savage 
 of himself, and eaten a plateful of raw meat, to express enjoy- 
 ment of the repast ; but I would hear of no such immolation 
 on the altar of friendship ; and we had a course of bacon 
 instead ; there happening, by good fortune, to be cold bacon 
 in the larder. 
 
 My poor little wife was in such aflBiction when she thought 
 I should be annoyed, and in such a state of joy when she 
 found I was not, that the discomfiture I had subdued very 
 soon vanished, and we passed a happy evening ; Dora sitting 
 with her arm on my chair while Traddles and I discussed a 
 glass of wine, and taking every opportunity of whispering in 
 my ear that it was so good of me not to be a cruel, cross old 
 boy. By and bye she made tea for us ; which it was so pretty 
 to see her do, as if she was busying herself with a set of doll's 
 tea-things, that I was not particular about the quality of the 
 beverage. Then Traddles and I played a game or two at 
 cribbage ; and Dora singing to the guitar the whUe, it seemed 
 to me as if our courtship and marriage were a tender dream 
 of mine, and the night when I first listened to her voice were 
 not yet over. 
 
 A City by Night. 
 
 It is a true sublimity to dwell here. These fringes of lamp- 
 hght, struggling up through smoke and thousandfold exhala- 
 tion, some fathoms into the ancient reign of Night, what thinks 
 Bootes of them, as he leads his Huntiag-Dogs over the Zenith 
 in their leash of sidereal fire ? That stifled hum of Midnight, 
 when Traffic has lain down to rest ; and the chariot- wheels of

 Vanity, still roUiag here and there through distant streets, are 
 bearing her to Halls roofed-in, and lighted to the due pitch 
 for her ; and only Vice and Misery, to prowl or to moan like 
 nightbirds, are abroad : that hum, I say, like the stertorous, 
 unquiet slumber of sick life, is heard in Heaven ! Oh, under 
 that hideous coverlet of vapours, and putrefactions, and un- 
 imaginable gases, what a Fermenting-vat lies simmering and 
 hid ! The joyful and the sorrowful are there ; men are dying 
 there, men are being born ; men are praying, — on the other 
 side of a brick partition, men are cursing ; and around them 
 all is the vast, void Night. The proud Grandee still lingers 
 in his perfumed saloons, or reposes within damask curtains ; 
 Wretchedness cowers under truckle-beds, or shivers hunger- 
 stricken into its lair of straw : in obscure cellars, Rouge-el 
 Noir languidly emits its voice-of-destiny to haggard hungry 
 VUlains ; while councillors of State sit plotting, and playing 
 their high chess-game, whereof the pawns are Men. The 
 Lover whispers his mistress that the coach is ready ; and she, 
 full of hope and fear, glides down, to fly with him over the 
 borders : the Thief, still more silently, sets-to his picklocks 
 and crowbars, or lurks in wait tUl the watchmen first snore 
 in their boxes. Gay mansions, with supper-rooms and dancing- 
 rooms, are full of light and music and high-swelling hearts ; 
 but, in the Condemned Cells, the pulse of life beats tremulous 
 and faint, and bloodshot eyes look out through the darkness, 
 which is around and within, for the light of a stern last morn- 
 ino-. Six men are to be hanged on the morrow : comes no 
 hammering from the Eabenstein? — their gallows must even 
 now be o' building. Upwards of five-hundred-thousand two- 
 legged animals without feathers Ke round us, in horizontal 
 positions; their heads all in nightcaps, and full of the fool- 
 ishest dreams. Riot cries aloud, and staggers and swaggers 
 in his, rank dens of shame; and the Mother, with streaming 
 hair, kneels over her pallid dying infant, whose cracked lips 
 only her tears now moisten. — AR these heaped and huddled 
 together, with nothing but a little carpentry and masonry 
 between them ; — crammed in, like salted fish in their barrel ; — 
 or weltering, shall I say, like an Egyptian pitcher of tamed 
 vipers, each struggling to get its head above the others : such 
 work goes on under that smoke counterpane !— But I sit above 
 it all ; I am alone with the Stars.

 Ooverley Hall. 
 
 Having often received an invitation from my friend Sir 
 Roger de Coverley to pass away a month with him in. the 
 country, I last week accompanied him thither, and am settled 
 with him for some time at his country house, where I intend 
 to form several of my ensuing speculations. Sir Roger, who 
 is very well acquainted with my humour, lets me rise and go 
 to bed when I please, dine at his own table or in my chamber 
 as I think fit, sit still and say nothing without bidding me be 
 merry. When the gentlemen of the country come to see him, 
 he only shows me at a distance : as I have been walking in 
 his fields I have observed them stealing a sight of me over an 
 hedge, and have heard the Knight desiring them not to let 
 me see them, for that I hated to be stared at. 
 
 I am the more at ease in Sir Roger's family, because it 
 consists of sober and staid persons ; for, as the Knight is the 
 best master in the world, he seldom changes his servants ; and 
 as he is beloved by all about him, his servants never care 
 for leaving him ; by this means his domestics are all in years, 
 and grown old with their master. You would take his valet 
 de chambre for his brother, his butler is gray-headed, his 
 groom is one of the gravest men that I have ever seen, and 
 his coachman has the looks of a privy counsellor. You see 
 the goodness of the master even in the old house-dog, and in 
 a gray pad that is kept in the stable with great care and 
 tenderness, out of regard to his past services, though he has 
 been useless for several years. 
 
 I could not but observe with a great deal of pleasure, the 
 joy that appeared in the countenances of these ancient 
 domestics upon my friend's arrival at his country seat. Some 
 of them could not refrain from tears at the sight of their old 
 master ; every one of them pressed forward to do something 
 for him, and seemed discouraged if they were not employed. 
 At the same time the good old Knight, with the mixture of 
 the father and the master of the family, tempei-ed the inquiries 
 after his own afiairs with several kind questions relatincr to 
 themselves. This humanity and good-nature engages every 
 body to him, so that when he is pleasant upon any of them

 all his family aie in good humour, and none so much as the 
 person whom he diverts himself with : on the contrary, if he 
 coughs, or betrays any infirmity of old age, it is easy for a 
 stander-by to observe a secret concern in the looks of all his 
 servants. 
 
 My worthy friend has put me under the particular care of 
 his butler, who is a very prudent man, and, as well as the rest 
 of his fellow-servants, wonderfully desirous of pleasing me, 
 because they have often heard their master talk of me as of 
 his particular friend. 
 
 My chief companion, when Sir Roger is diverting himself 
 in the woods or the fields, is a very venerable man who is 
 ever with Sir Roger, and has lived at his house in the nature 
 of a chaplain above thirty years. This gentleman is a person 
 of good sense and some learning, of a very regular life and 
 obliging conversation : he heartily loves Sir Roger, and knows 
 that he is very much ia the old Knight's esteem, so that he 
 Uves in the family rather as a relation than a dependent. 
 
 I have observed in several of my papers that my friend 
 Sir Roger, amidst all his good qualities, is something of an 
 humourist ; and that his virtues as well as imperfections, are, 
 as it were, tinged by a certaia extravagance, which makes 
 them particularly his, and distinguishes them from those of 
 other men. This cast of mind, as it is generally very innocent 
 in itself, so it renders his conversation highly agreeable, and 
 more delightful than the same degree of sense and virtue 
 would appear in their common and ordinary colours. As I 
 was walking with him last night, he asked me how I liked 
 the good man whom I have just now mentioned, and without 
 staying for my answer told me that he was afraid of being 
 insulted with Latin and Greek at his own table, for which 
 reason he desired a particular friend of his at the University, 
 to find him out a clergyman rather of plain sense than much 
 learnino-, of a good aspect, a clear voice, and sociable temper, 
 and if possible, a man that understood a httle of back-gammon. 
 My 'friend, says Sir Roger, found me out this gentleman, who, 
 besides the endowments required of him, is, they tell me, a 
 good scholar, though he does not show it : I have given hun 
 the parsonage of the parish; and, because I know his value, 
 have settled upon him a good annuity for hfe. If he outhves

 me, he shall find that he was higher in my esteem than perhaps 
 he thinks he is. He has now been with me thirty years, and, 
 though he does not know I have taken notice of it, has never 
 in all that time asked anything of me for himself, though he 
 is every day soliciting me for something in behalf of one or 
 other of my tenants his parishioners. There has not been a 
 lawsuit in the parish since he has lived among them : if any 
 dispute arises they apply themselves to him for the decision ; 
 if they do not acquiesce in his judgment (which I think never 
 happened above once or twice at most) they appeal to me. 
 At his first settling with me I made him a present of all the 
 good sermons which have been printed in English, and only 
 begged of him that every Sunday he would pronounce one of 
 them in the pulpit. Accordingly he has digested them into 
 such a series, that they follow one another naturally, and 
 make a continued system of practical divinity. 
 
 As Sir Roger was going on in his story, the gentleman we 
 were talking of came up to us ; and upon the Knight's asking 
 him who preached to-morrow (for it was Saturday night) told 
 us the Bishop of St. Asaph in the morning, and Dr. South in 
 the afternoon. He then showed us his list of preachers for 
 the whole year, where I saw with a great deal of pleasure 
 Archbishop Tillotson, Bishop Saunderson, Dr. Barrow, Dr. 
 Calamy, with several living authors who have published dis- 
 courses of practical divinity. I no sooner saw this venerable 
 man in the pulpit, but I very much approved of my friend's 
 insisting upon the qualifications of a good aspect and a clear 
 voice ; for I was so charmed with the gracefulness of his figure 
 and delivery, as well as with the discourses he pronounced, 
 that I think I never passed any time more to my satisfaction. 
 A sermon repeated after this manner is like the composition 
 of a poet in the mouth of a graceful actor. 
 
 I could heartily wish that more of our country clergy would 
 follow this example ; and, instead of wasting their spirits in 
 laborious compositions of their own, would endeavour after a 
 handsome elocution, and all those other talents that are proper 
 to enforce what has been penned by greater masters. This 
 would not only be more easy to themselves, but more edifyin" 
 to the people.

 The Coverley Sabbath. 
 
 ^^T-fZ^'^^- ^^77^1} Ple^^ed with a country Sunday, and 
 thuik, if keeping holy the seventh day were only a " human " 
 institution, it would be the best method that could have been 
 thought of for the pohshing and civilizing of mankind It is 
 certain the country people would soon degenerate into a kind 
 ot savages and barbarians, were there not such frequent re- 
 turns ot a stated time, in which the whole village meet too-ether 
 with their best faces, and in their cleanliest habits, to converse 
 with one another upon indifferent subjects, hear their duties 
 explained to them, and join together in adoration of the 
 Supreme Being. Sunday clears away the rust of the whole 
 week, not only as it refreshes in their minds the notions of 
 religion, but as it puts both the sexes upon appearing in their 
 most agreeable forms, and exerting all such qualities as are 
 apt to give them a figure in the eye of the village. A country 
 fellow distinguishes himself as much in the churchyard, as a 
 citizen does upon the 'Change, the whole parish politics being 
 generally discussed in that place, either after sermon or before 
 the bell rings. 
 
 My friend Sir Roger, being a good churchman, has beautified 
 the inside of his church with several texts of his own choosing ; 
 he has likewise given a handsome pulpit cloth, and railed in 
 the communion table at his own expense. He has often told 
 me that, at his coming to his estate, he found his parishioners 
 very irregular ; and that, in order to make them kneel and 
 join in the responses, he gave every 6ne of them a hassock and 
 a Common Prayer Book : and at the same time employed an 
 itinerant singing master, who goes about the country for that 
 purpose, to instruct them rightly in the tunes of the Psalms ; 
 upon which they now very much value themselves, and indeed 
 outdo most of the country churches that I have ever heard. 
 
 As Sir Roger is landlord to the whole congregation, he 
 keeps them in very good order, and will suffer nobody to sleep 
 in it besides himself ; for if by chance he has been surprised 
 into a short nap at sermon, upon recovering out of it he stands 
 up and looks about him, and, if he sees anybody else nodding, 
 either wakes them himself, or sends his servant to them. 
 Several other of the old Knight's particularities break out

 upon these occasions ; sometimes lie will be lengthening out .1 
 verse in the siuging Psalms half a minute after the rest of the

 with the matter of his devotion, he pronounces " Amen " three 
 or four times to the same prayer ; and sometimes stands up 
 when everybody else is upon their knees, to count the congre- 
 gation, or see if any of his tenants are missing. 
 
 I was yesterday very much surprised to hear my old friend, 
 in the midst of the service, calling out to one John Matthews 
 to mind what he was about, and not disturb the congregation. 
 This John Matthews, it seems, is remarkable for being an idle 
 fellow, and at that time was kicking his heels for his diversion. 
 This authority of the Knight (though exerted in that odd 
 manner which accompanies him in all circumstances of life), 
 has a very good effect upon the parish, who are not polite enough 
 to see anything ridiculous in his behaviour ; besides that the 
 general good sense and worthiness of his character make his 
 friends observe these Httle singularities as foils that rather set 
 off than blemish his good qualities. 
 
 As soon as the sermon is finished, nobody presumes to stir 
 tiU Sir Roger is gone out of the church. The Knight walks 
 down from his seat in the chancel between a double row of 
 his tenants, that stand bowing to him on each side, and every 
 now and then inquires how such an one's wife, or mother, or 
 son, or father do, whom he does not see at church, — which is 
 understood as a secret reprimand to the person that is absent. 
 
 The chaplain has often told me, that upon a catechising 
 day, when Sir Roger has been pleased with a boy that answers 
 well, he has ordered a Bible to be given him next day for his 
 encouragement, and sometimes accompanies it with a flitch of 
 bacon to his mother. Sir Roger has likewise added five 
 pounds a year to the clerk's place ; and that he may encourage 
 the young fellows to make themselves perfect in the church 
 service, has promised, upon the death of the present incum- 
 bent, who is very old, to bestow it according to merit. 
 
 The fair understanding between Sir Roger and his chaplain, 
 and their mutual concurrence in doing good, is the more re- 
 markable, because the very next village is famous for the 
 differences and contentions that rise between the parson and 
 the squire, who live in a perpetual state of war. The parson

 is always preaching at the squire, and the squire, to be revenged 
 on the parson, never comes to church. The squire has made 
 dl his tenants atheists and tithe-stealers ; while the parson 
 instructs them every Sunday in the dignity of his order, and 
 insinuates to them in almost every sermon that he is a better 
 man than his patron. In short, matters are come to such an 
 extremity, that the squire has not said his prayers either in 
 public or private this half year ; and that the parson threatens 
 him, if he does not mend his manners, to pray for him in the 
 face of the whole congregation. 
 
 Peuds of this nature, though too frequent in the country, 
 are very fatal to the ordinary people ; who are so used to be 
 dazzled with riches, that they pay as much deference to the 
 understanding of a man on an estate as of a man of learning ; 
 and are very hardly brought to regard any truth, how im- 
 portant soever it may be, that is preached to them, when they 
 know there are several men of five hundred a year who do 
 not believe it. 
 
 Skating Experiences. 
 
 " Now,'' said Wardle, " what say you to an hour on the ice ? 
 We shall have plenty of time." 
 
 " Capital ! " said Mr. Benjamin Allen. 
 
 " Prime ! " ejaculated Mr. Bob Sawyer. 
 
 "You skate, of course. Winkle?" said Wardle. 
 
 "Ye-yes; oh, yes," replied Mr. Winkle. "I — I — am. rather 
 out of practice." 
 
 " Oh, do skate, Mr. Winkle," said Arabella. " I like to see 
 it so much." 
 
 " Oh, it is so graceful," said another young lady. 
 
 A third young lady said it was elegant, and a fourth ex- 
 pressed her opinion that it was "swan-Uke." 
 
 "I should be very happy, I'm sure," said Mr. Winkle, 
 reddening ; "but I have no skates." 
 
 This objection was at once overruled. Trundle had a couple 
 of pairs, and the fat boy announced that there were half-a- 
 dozen more down stairs ; whereat Mr. Winkle expressed ex- 
 quisite delight, and looked exquisitely uncomfortable.

2i8 The Elements of Eloaition. 
 
 Old Wardle led the way to a pretty large sheet of ice ; 
 Mr. Bob Sawyer adjusted his skates with a dexterity which to 
 Mr. Winkle was perfectly marvellous, and described circles 
 with his left leg, and cut figures of eight, and inscribed upon 
 the ice, without once stopping for breath, a great many other 
 pleasant and astonishing devices, to the excessive satisfaction 
 of Mr. Pickwick, Mr. Tupman, and the ladies ; which reached 
 a pitch of positive enthusiasm when old Wardle and Benjamin 
 Allen, assisted by the aforesaid Bob Sawyer, performed some 
 mystic evolutions, which they called a reel. 
 
 All this time, Mr. Winkle, with his face and hands blue 
 with the cold, had been forcing a gimlet into the soles of his 
 feet, and putting his skates on, with the points behind, and 
 getting the straps into a very complicated and entangled state, 
 with the assistance of Mr. Snodgrass, who knew rather less 
 about skates than a Hindoo. At length, however, with the 
 assistance of Mr. Waller, the unfortunate skates weie firmly 
 screwed and buckled on, and Mr. Winkle was raised to his feet. 
 
 " Now, then, sir," said Sam, in an encouraging tone ; " off 
 with you, and show 'm how to do it." 
 
 " Stop, Sam, stop ! " said Mr. Winkle, trembling violently, 
 and clutching hold of Sam's arms with the grasp of a drowning 
 man. " How slippery it is, Sam ! " 
 
 "Not an uncommon thing upon ice, sir," replied Mr. Weller. 
 " Hold up, sir ! " 
 
 This last observation of Mr. Weller's bore referonce to a 
 demonstration Mr. Winkle made at the instant, of a frantic 
 desire to throw his feet in the air, and dash the back of his 
 head on the ice. 
 
 " These — these — are very awkward skates ; ain't they, Sam?" 
 inquired Mr. Winkle, staggering. 
 
 " I'm afeerd there's a orkard gen'l'm'n in 'em, sir," replied Sam. 
 
 "Now, Winkle," cried Mr. Pickwick, quite unconscious that 
 there was anything the matter. "Come; the ladies are all 
 anxiety." 
 
 "Yes, yes," replied Mr. Winkle, with a ghastly smile. 
 " I'm coming." 
 
 "Just a goin' to begin," said Sam, endeavouring to dis- 
 engage himself. " Now, sir, start off ! " 
 
 " Stop an instant, Sam," gasped Mr. Winkle, clinging most

 affectionately to Mr. Weller. « I find I've got a couple of coats 
 at home that I don't want, Sam. You may have them, Sam " 
 
 "Thank'ee, sir," replied Mr. Weller. 
 
 " Never mind touching your hat, Sam," said Mr. Winlde, 
 hastily. "You needn't take your hand away to do that. I 
 meant to have given you five shillings this morning for a 
 Christmas-box, Sam. I'll give it you this afternoon, Sam." 
 
 " You're very good, sir," replied Mr. Weller. 
 
 " Just hold me at first, Sam ; will you ? " said Mr. Winkle. 
 " There — that's right. I shall soon get in the way of it, Sam. 
 Not too fast, Sam ; not too fast." 
 
 Mr. Winkle stooping forward, with his body half doubled 
 up, was being assisted over the ice by Mr. Weller, in a very 
 singular and un-swan-like manner, when Mr. Pickwick most 
 innocently shouted from the opposite bank : 
 
 " Sam ! " 
 
 "Sir?" 
 
 " Here. I want you." 
 
 "Let go, sir," said Sam. "Don't you hear Mr. Pickwick 
 calling? Let go, sir." 
 
 With a violent effort, Mr. Weller disengaged himself from 
 the grasp of the agonised Pickwickian, and, in so doing, ad- 
 ministered a considerable impetus to the unhappy Mr. Winkle. 
 With an accuracy which no degree of dexterity or practice 
 could have insured, that unfortunate gentleman bore swiftly 
 down into the centre of the reel, at the very moment when 
 Mr. Bob Sawyer was performing a flourish of unparalleled 
 beauty. Mr. Winkle struck wildly against him, and with a 
 loud crash they both fell heavily down. Mr. Pickwick ran to 
 the spot. Bob Sawyer had risen to his feet, but Mr. Winkle 
 was far too wise to do anything of the kind, in skates. He 
 was seated on the ice, making spasmodic efforts to smile ; but 
 anguish was depicted on every lineament of his countenance. 
 
 Mr. Pickwick beckoned to Mr. Weller, and said in a stern 
 voice, " Take his skates off." 
 
 "No; but really I had scarcely begun," remonstrated 
 Mr. Winkle. 
 
 " Take his skates off," repeated Mr. Pickwick, firmly. 
 
 The command was not to be resisted. Mr. Winkle allowed 
 Sam to obey it in silence.

 " Lift him up," said Mr. Pickwick. Sam assisted him to 
 
 rise. 
 
 Mr. Pickwick retired a few paces apart from the bystanders; 
 and, beckoning his friend to approach, fixed a searching look 
 upon him, and uttered in a low, but distinct and emphatic 
 tone, these remarkable words : — 
 
 "You're an imposter, sir." 
 
 " A what ? " said Mr. Winkle, starting. 
 
 " I will speak plainer, if you wish it. An imposter, sir." 
 
 With those words, Mr. Pickwick turned slowly on his heel, 
 and rejoiaed his fiiends. 
 
 "Shdiag looks a nice warm exercise, doesn't it?" he in- 
 quired of Wardle, when that gentleman was thoroughly out 
 of breath, by reason of the indefatigable manner in which he 
 had converted his legs into a pair of compasses, and drawn 
 complicated problems on the ice. 
 
 "Ah, it does, indeed," replied Wardle. "Do you slide?" 
 
 "I used to do so, on the gutters, when I was a boy," replied 
 Mr. Pickwick. 
 
 "Try it now," said Wardle. 
 
 " Oh do, please, Mr. Pickwick ! " cried all the ladies. 
 
 " I should be very happy to afford you any amusement," 
 replied Mr. Pickwick, " but I haven't done such a thing these 
 thirty years." 
 
 " Pooh ! pooh ! Nonsense ! " said Wardle, dragging off his 
 skates with the impetuosity which characterised aU his pro- 
 ceedings. " Here ; I'll keep you company ; come along ! " 
 And away went the good tempered old fellow down the slide, 
 with a rapidity which came very close upon Mr. Weller, and 
 beat the fat boy all to nothing. 
 
 Mr. Pickwick paused, considered, pulled off his gloves, and 
 put them in his hat ; took two or three short runs, baulked 
 himseK as often, and at last took another run, and went 
 slowly and gravely down the sHde, with his feet about a yard 
 and a quarter apart, amidst the gratified shouts of all the 
 spectators. 
 
 The sport was at its height, the sliding was at the quickest, 
 the laughter was at the loudest, when a sharp smart crack 
 was heard. There was a quick rush towards the bank, a wild 
 scream from the ladies, and a shout from Mr. Tupman. A

 large mass of ice disappeared ; the water bubbled up over it ; 
 Mr. Pickwick's hat, gloves, and handkercliief were floating on 
 the surface ; and this was all of Mr. Pickwick that anybody 
 could see. 
 
 Dismay and anguish were depicted on every countenance, 
 the males turned pale, and the female's fainted. Mr. Snodgrass 
 and Mr. Winkle grasped each other by the hand, and gazed 
 at the spot where their leader had gone down, with frenzied 
 eagerness ; while Mr. Tupman, by way of rendering the 
 promptest assistance, and at the same time conveying to any 
 persons who might be within hearing the clearest possible 
 notion of the catastrophe, ran off across the country at his 
 utmost speed, screaming " Fire ! " with all his might. 
 
 It was at this moment that a face, head, and shoulders 
 emerged from beneath the water, and disclosed the features 
 and spectacles of Mr. Pickwick. 
 
 " Keep yourself up for an instant — ^for only one instant ! " 
 bawled Mr. Snodgrass. 
 
 "Yes, do; let me implore you — for my sake!" roared 
 Mr. Winkle, deeply affected. The abjuration was rather 
 unnecessary ; the probability being, that if Mr. Pickwick had 
 declined to keep himself up for anybody else's sake, it would 
 have occurred to him that he might as well do so for his own. 
 
 " Do you feel the bottom there, old fellow ? " said Wardle. 
 
 "Yes, certainly," rephed Mr. Pickwick, wringing the water 
 from his head and face, and gasping for breath. " I fell upon 
 my back. I couldn't get on my feet at first." 
 
 The clay upon so much of Mr. Pickwick's coat as was yet 
 visible bore testimony to the accuracy of this statement ; and 
 as the fears of the spectators were still further reheved by the 
 fat boy's suddenly recoUecting that the water was nowhere 
 more than five feet deep, prodigies of valour were performed 
 to get him out. After a vast quantity of splashmg, and 
 cracking, and strugghng, Mr. Pickwick was at length fairly 
 extricated from his unpleasant position, and once more stood 
 
 on dry land. . 1 t-. -i 
 
 " Oh he'll catch his death of cold," said Emily. 
 "Dear old thing!" said Arabella. "Let me wrap this 
 
 shawl round you, Mr. Pickwick." . , w ji << ^ 
 
 « Ah, that's the best thing you can do," said Wardle; "and

 when you've got it on, run home as fast as your legs can carry 
 you, and jump into bed directly." 
 
 A dozen shawls were offered on the instant. Three or 
 four of the thickest having been selected, Mr. Pickwick was 
 wrapped up, and started off, under the guidance of Mr. Weller; 
 presenting the singular phenomenon of an elderly gentleman, 
 dripping wet, and without a hat, with his arms bound down 
 to his sides, skimming over the ground, without any clearly 
 defined purpose, at the rate of six good English miles an hour, 
 pausing not an instant until lie was snug in bed. 
 
 The Death of Little Dombey. 
 
 Paul had never risen from his little bed. He lay there, 
 listening to the noises in the street, quite tranquilly ; not carin" 
 much how the time went, but watching it, and watching every- 
 thing about him, with observing eyes. When the sunbeams 
 struck into his room through the rustling blinds, and quivered 
 on the opposite wall like golden water, he knew that evening 
 was coming on, and that the sky was red and beautiful. As 
 the reflection died away, and a gloom went creeping up the 
 wall, he watched it deepen, deepen, deepen into night. Then 
 he thought how the long streets were dotted with lamps, and 
 how the peaceful stars were shining overhead. His fancy had 
 a strange tendency to wander to the river, which he knew was 
 flowing through the great city ; and now he thought how black 
 It was, and how deep it would look, reflecting the hosts of 
 stars— and more than all, how steadily it rolled away to meet 
 the sea. 
 
 His only trouble was, the swift and rapid river. He felt 
 forced, sometimes, to try to stop it— to stem it with his childish 
 hands— or choke its way with sand ; and when he saw it coming 
 on resistless, he cried out ! But a word from his sister Ploi^ 
 ence, who was always at his side, restored him to himself- 
 and leaning his poor head upon her breast, he told Ploy of his' 
 dream, and smiled. 
 
 The people round him changed unaccountably— except Plor 
 ence ; Plorence never changed— and what had been the doctors 
 was now his father, sitting with his head upon his hand And

 Paul was quite content to shut his eyes again, and see what 
 happened next without emotion. But this figure, with its head 
 upon its hand, returned so often, and remained so long, and 
 sat so still and solemn, never speaking, never being spoken to, 
 and rarely lifting up its face, that Paul began to wonder lan- 
 guidly if it were real ; and, in the night-time, saw it sitting 
 there, with fear. 
 
 "Floy," he said, "what is that!" "Where, dearest?" 
 " There ! at the bottom of the bed." " There's nothing there, 
 except papa ! " The figure lifted up its head, and rose, and 
 coming to the bedside, said — " My own boy, don't you know 
 me ? " Paul looked it in the face, and thought, Was this his 
 father ? But the face, so altered to his thinking, thrilled while 
 he gazed, as if it were in pain ; and, before he could reach out 
 both his hands to take it between them, and draw it towards 
 him, the figure turned away quickly irom the little bed, and 
 went out at the door. 
 
 How many times the golden water danced upon the wall ; 
 how many nights the dark, dark river rolled towards the sea in 
 spite of him ; Paul never sought to know. If their kindness, 
 or his sense of it, could have increased, they were more kind, 
 and he more grateful every day ; but whether they were many 
 days, or few, appeared of little moment now to the gentle boy. 
 One night he had been thinking of his mother, and her picture 
 in the drawing-room downstairs. The train of thought sug- 
 gested to him to inquire if he had ever seen his mother ; for he 
 could not remember whether they had told him yes or no — the 
 river running very fast, and confusing his mind. " Ploy, did 
 I ever see mamma?" "No, darling; why?" "Did I never 
 see any kind face, Hke a mamma's, looking at me when I was 
 a baby, Floy?" he asked, incredulously, as if he had some 
 vision of a face before him. " Oh yes, dear ! " " Whose, 
 Floy?" "Your old nurse's ; often." "And where is my old 
 nurse ? " said Paul. " Is she dead too ? Floy, are we all dead, 
 except you ? " 
 
 There was a hurry in the room, for an instant — longer, 
 perhaps ; but it seemed no more — then all was still again ; and 
 Florence, with her face quite colourless, but smiling, held his 
 head upon her arm. Her arm trembled very much. " Show

 me that old nurse, Floy, if you please ! " " She is not here, 
 darling. She shall come to-morro-n^." — " Thank you, Floy ! " 
 
 Little Dombey closed his eyes, and fell asleep. But he soon 
 awoke — woke mind and body, and sat upright in his bed. He 
 saw them now about him. There was no grey mist before 
 them, as there had been sometimes in the night. He knew 
 them every one, and called them by their names. 
 
 " And who is this ? Is this my old nurse ? " said the child, 
 regarding with a radiant smile a figure coining in. Yes, yes ! 
 No other stranger would have shed those tears at sight of him, 
 and called him her dear boy, her pretty boy, her own poor 
 blighted child. No other woman would have stooped down 
 by his bed, and taken up his wasted hand, and put it to her 
 lips and breast, as one who had some right to fondle it. No 
 other woman would have so forgotten everybody there but him 
 and Floy, and been so full of tenderness and pity. "Floy, 
 this is a kind good face," said Paul. " I am glad to see it 
 again. Don't go away, old nurse ! Stay here ! " 
 
 "Now lay me down," he said; "and, Floy, come close to 
 me, and let me see you ! " Sister and brother wound their 
 arms around each other, and the golden light came streaming 
 in, and fell upon them, locked together. " How fast the river 
 runs, between its green banks and the rushes, Floy ! But it's 
 very near the sea. I hear the waves ! They always said so." 
 Presently he told her that the motion of the boat upon the 
 stream was lulling him to rest. How green the banks were 
 now, how bright the flowers growing on them, and how tall the 
 rushes ! Now the boat was out at sea, but gliding smoothly 
 on ; and now there was a shore before them. Who stood on 
 the bank ? He put his hands together, as he had been used to 
 do at his prayers. He did not remove his arms to do it ; but 
 they saw him fold them so behind her neck. " Mamma is like 
 you, Floy ; I know her by the face ! But tell them that the 
 print upon the stairs is not divine enough. The light about 
 the head is shining on me as I go ! " 
 
 The golden ripple on the wall came back again, and nothing 
 else stirred in the room. . . . The old, old fashion ! The 
 fashion that came in with our first parents, and will last 
 unchanged until our race has run its course, and the wide 
 firmament is rolled up like a scroll. The old, old fashion—

 Death ! Oh, thank God, all who see it, for that older fashion 
 yet, of Immortality ! And look upon us, angels of young 
 children, with regards not quite estranged, when the swift 
 river bears us to the ocean ! 
 
 A Shipwreck at Yarmouth. 
 
 1. There was a dark gloom in my solitary chamber, when I 
 at length returned to it ; but I was tired now, and, getting 
 into bed again, fell — oft" a tower and down a precipice — into 
 the depths of sleep. I have an impression that for a long time, 
 though I dreamed of being elsewhere and in a variety of scenes, 
 it was always blowing in my dream. At length, I lost that 
 feeble hold upon reality, and was engaged with two dear 
 friends, but who they were I don't know, at the siege of some 
 town in a roar of cannonading. 
 
 2. The thunder of the cannon was so loud and incessant 
 that I could not hear something I much desired to hear, until 
 I made a great exertion and awoke. It was broad day — eight 
 or nine o'clock ; the storm raging, in lieu of the batteries, and 
 someone knocking and calling at my door. 
 
 " What is the matter 1 " 1 cried. 
 
 " A wreck ! close by ! " 
 
 I sprang out of bed, and asked, " What wreck ? " 
 
 " A schooner, from Spain or Portugal, laden with fruit and 
 wine. Make haste, sir, if you want to see her ! It's thought, 
 down on the beach, she'll go to pieces every moment." 
 
 The excited voice went clamouring along the staircase, and 
 I wrapped myself in my clothes as quickly as I could, and ran 
 into the street. 
 
 3. Numbers of people were there before me, all running in 
 one direction to the beach. I ran the same way, outstripping 
 a good many, and soon came facing the wild sea. 
 
 The wind might by this time have lulled a little, though not 
 more sensibly than if the cannonading I had dreamed of had 
 been diminished by the sUencing of half-a-dozen, guns out of 
 hundrieds. But the sea having upon it the additional agitation 
 of the whole night, was infinitely more terrific than when I 
 had seen it last. Every appearance it had then presented bore

 the expression of being swelled; and the height to which 
 the breakers rose, and, looking over one another, bore one 
 another down, and rolled in in interminable hosts, was most 
 appalling. 
 
 4r. In the difficulty of hearing anything but wind and waves, 
 and in the crowd, and the unspeakable confusion, and my first 
 breathless efforts to stand against the weather, I was so con- 
 fused that I looked out to sea for the wreck, and saw nothing 
 but the foaming heads of the great waves. A half-dressed 
 boatman, standing next to me, pointed with his bare arm (a 
 tattooed arrow on it, pointing in the same direction) to the 
 left. Then, O great Heaven, I saw it close in upon us ! 
 
 5. One mast was broken short off, six or eight feet from the 
 deck, and lay over the side, entangled in a maze of sail and 
 rigging ; and all that ruin, as the ship rolled and beat — which 
 she did without a moment's pause, and with a violence quite 
 inconceivable — beat the side as if it would stave it in. Some 
 efforts were even then being made to cut this portion of the 
 wreck away ; for as the ship, which was broadside on, turned 
 towards us in her rolUng, I plainly descried her people at work 
 with axes, especially one active figure with long curling hair, 
 conspicuous among the rest. But a great cry, which was 
 audible even above the wind and water, rose from the shore 
 at this moment ; the sea, sweeping over the rolling wreck, 
 made a clean breach, and carried men, spars, casks, planks, 
 bulwarks, heaps of such toys, into the boiling surge. 
 
 6. The second mast was. yet standing, with the rags of a 
 rent sail and a wild confusion of broken cordage flapping to and 
 fro. The ship had struck once, the same boatman hoarsely 
 said in my ear, and then lifted in and struck again. I under- 
 stood him to add that she was parting amidships ; and I could 
 readily suppose so, for the rolling and beating were too 
 tremendous for any human work to suffer long. As he spoke, 
 there was another great cry of pity from the beach ; four men 
 arose with the wreck out of the deep, clinging to the rigging 
 of the remaining mast ; uppermost, the active figure with the 
 curling hair, 
 
 7. There was a bell on board ; and as the ship rolled and 
 dashed, like a desperate creature driven mad, now showing us 
 the whole sweep of her deck, as she turned on her beam-ends

 towards the shore, now nothing but her keel as she sprung 
 wildly over and turned towards the sea, the bell rang, and its 
 sound, the knell of those unhappy men, was borne towards us 
 on the wind. Again we lost her, and again she rose. Two 
 men were gone. The agony on shore increased. Men groaned 
 and clasped their hands ; women shrieked and turned away 
 their faces. Some ran wildly up and down along the beach, 
 crying for help where no help could be. I found myself one 
 of these, frantically imploring a knot of sailors whom I knew, 
 not to let those two lost creatures perish before our eyes. 
 
 8. They were making out to me in an agitated way — I don't 
 know how, for the little I could hear I was scarcely composed 
 enough to understand — that the life-boat had been bravely 
 manned an hour ago, and could do nothing ; and that as no 
 man would be so desperate as to attempt to wade off with a 
 rope, and establish a communication with the shore, there was 
 nothing left to try ; when I noticed that some new sensation 
 moved the people on the beach, and saw them part, and Ham 
 come breaking through them to the front. 
 
 9. I ran to him — as well as I know, to repeat my appeal 
 for help. But, distracted though I was, by a sight so new to 
 me and terrible, the determination in his face and his look out 
 to sea — exactly the same look as I remembered in connection 
 with the morning after Emily's flight — awoke me to a know- 
 ledge of his danger. I held him back with both arms, and 
 implored the men with whom I had been speaking not to listen 
 to him, not to do murder, not to let him stir from off that 
 sand. 
 
 10. Another cry arose on shore ; and looking to the wreck, 
 we saw the cruel sail, with blow on blow, beat off the lower of 
 the two men, and fly up in triumph round the active figure 
 left alone upon the mast. 
 
 Against such a sight, and against such determmation as 
 that of the calmly-desperate man who was already accustomed 
 to lead half the people present, I might as hopefully have 
 entreated the wind. " Mas'r Davy," he said, cheerily grasping 
 me by both hands, "if my time is come, 'tis come. If't amt, 
 I'll bide it. Lord above bless you and bless all ! Mates, make 
 me ready. I'm a-going off." 
 
 11. I was swept away, but not unkindly, to some distance,

 ■where the people around me made me stay ; urging, as I con- 
 fusedly perceived, that he was bent on going, with help or 
 without, and that I should endanger the precautions for his 
 safety by troubling those with whom they rested. I don't 
 know what I answered or what they rejoined; but I saw 
 hurry on the beach, and men running with ropes from a cap- 
 stan that was there, and penetrating into a circle of figures 
 that hid him from me. Then I saw him standing alone, in a 
 seaman's frock and trowsers ; a rope in his hand or slung to 
 his wrist ; another round his body; and several of the best 
 men holding, at a little distance, to the latter, which he laid 
 out himself, slack upon the shore, at his feet. 
 
 12. The wreck, even to my unpractised eye, was breaking 
 up. I saw that she was parting in the middle, and that the 
 life of the solitary man upon the mast hung by a thread. Still 
 he clung to it. He had a singular red cap on — not unlike a 
 sailor's cap, but of a finer colour ; and as the few yielding 
 planks between him and destruction rolled and bulged, and 
 his anticipative death-knell rung, he was seen by all of us to 
 wave it. I saw him do it now, and thought I was going dis- 
 tracted, when his action brought an old remembrance to my 
 mind of a once dear friend. 
 
 13. Ham watched the sea, standing alone, with the silence 
 of suspended breath behind him, and the storm before, until 
 there was a great retiring wave, when, with backward glance 
 at those who held the rope which was made fast round his 
 body, he dashed in after it, and in a moment was bufieting 
 with the water — rising with the hills, falling with the valleys, 
 lost beneath the foam, then drawn again to land. They hauled 
 in hastily. 
 
 He was hurt. I saw blood on his face, from where I stood ; 
 but he took no thought of that. He seemed hurriedly to give 
 them some directions for leaving him more free — or so I judged 
 from the motion of his arm — and was gone as before. 
 
 14. And now he made for the wreck, rising with the hills, 
 falling with the valleys, lost beneath the rugged foam, borne in 
 toward the shore, borne on toward the ship, striving hard and 
 valiantly. The distance was nothing, but the power of the 
 sea and wind made the strife deadly. At length he neared 
 the wreck. He was so near, that with one more of his vigor-

 ous strokes he would be clinging to it, when, a high, green, 
 vast hill-side of water, moving on shoreward, from beyond the 
 ship, he seemed to leap up into it with a mighty bound, and 
 the ship was gone ! 
 
 15. Some eddying fragments I saw in the sea, as if a mere 
 cask had been broken, in running to the spot where they were 
 hauling in. Consternation was in every face. They drew him 
 to my very feet — insensible — dead ! He was carried to the 
 nearest house ; and, no one preventing me now, I remained 
 near him, busy, while every means of restoration were tried. 
 But he had been beaten to death by the great wave, and his 
 generous heart was stilled for ever. 
 
 16. As I sat beside the bed, when hope was abandoned and 
 all was done, a fisherman, who had known me when Emily and 
 I were children and ever since, whispered my name at the door. 
 
 " Sir," said he, with tears starting to his weather-beaten 
 face, which, with his trembling lips, was ashy pale, " will you 
 come over yonder ? " 
 
 The old remembrance that had been recalled to me was in 
 his look. I asked him, terror-stricken, leaning on the arm he 
 held out to support me, — 
 
 " Has a body come ashore % " 
 
 He said, "Yes." 
 
 " Do I know it?" I asked then. 
 
 He answered nothing. 
 
 17. But he led me to the shore. And on that part of it 
 where she and I had looked for shells, two children — on that 
 part of it where some lighter fragments of the old boat, 
 blown down last night, had been scattered by the wind, 
 among the ruins of the home he had wronged — I saw him 
 lying with his head upon his arm, as I had often seen him lie 
 at school : Steerforth. 
 
 A Rainy Sunday in an Inn. 
 
 From " Bracebridge Hall," Washington Irving's English novel. 
 
 1. It was a rainy Sunday in the gloomy month of Novem- 
 ber. I had been detained in the course of a journey by a 
 slight ijidisposition, from which I was recovering ; but I was

 still feverisli, and was obliged to keep within doors all day, in 
 an inn of the small town of Derby. A wet Sunday in a 
 coimtry inn ! whoever has had the luck to experience one can 
 alone judge of my situation. The rain pattered against the 
 casements, the bells tolled for church with a melancholy 
 sound. 
 
 2. I went to the windows in quest of something to amuse 
 the eye, but it seemed as if I had been placed completely out 
 of the reach of all amusement. The windows of my bed-room 
 looked out among tiled roofs and stacks of chimneys, while 
 those of my sitting-room commanded a full view of the stable- 
 yard. I know of nothing more calculated to make a man sick 
 of this world than a stable-yard on a rainy day. 
 
 3. The place was littered with wet straw, that had been 
 kicked about by travellers and stable-boys. In one corner was 
 a stagnant pool of water surrounding an island of muck ; there 
 were several half-drowned fowls crowded together under a cart, 
 among which was a miserable crest-fallen cock, drenched out 
 of all life and spirit, his drooping tail matted, as it were, into a 
 single feather, along which the water trickled from his back ; 
 near the cart was a half-dozing cow chewing the cud, and 
 standing patiently to be rained on, with wreaths of vapour 
 rising from her reeking hide ; a wall-eyed horse, tired of the 
 loneliness of the stable, was poking his spectral head out of a 
 window, with the rain dripping on it from the eaves ; an un- 
 happy cur, chained to a dog-house hard by, uttered something 
 every now and then between a bark and a yelp ; a drab of a 
 kitchen wench tramped backwards and forwards through the 
 yard in pattens, looking as sulky as the weather itself. Every- 
 thing, in short, was comfortless and forlorn, excepting a crew 
 of hard-drinking ducks, assembled, like boon-companions, round 
 a puddle, and making a riotous noise over their liquor. 
 
 4. I sauntered to the window, and stood gazing at the people 
 picking their way to church, with petticoats hoisted mid-leg high, 
 and dripping umbrellas. The bells ceased to toll, and the 
 streets became silent. I then amused myself with watching 
 the daughters of a tradesman opposite, who, being confined to 
 the house for fear of wetting their Sunday finery, played off 
 their charms at the front windows, to fascinate the chance ten- 
 ants of the inn. They at length were summoned away by a

The Elements of Elocution. 231 
 
 vigilant vinegar-faced mother, and I had nothing further from 
 without to amuse me. 
 
 5. The day continued lowering and gloomy : the slovenly, 
 ragged, spongy clouds drifted heavily along : there was no 
 variety even in the rain ; it was one dull, continued, monoton- 
 ous patter, patter, patter, excepting that now and then I was 
 enlivened by the idea of a brisk shower, from the rattling of 
 the drops upon a passing umbrella. It was quite refreshing — 
 if I may be allowed a hackneyed phrase of the day — when in 
 the course of the morning a horn blew, and a stage-coach 
 whirled through the street, with outside passengers stuck all 
 over it, cowering under cotton umbrellas, and seethed together, 
 and reeking with the steam of wet box-coats and upper ben- 
 jamins. 
 
 6. The sound brought out from their lurking-places a crew 
 of vagabond boys and vagabond dogs, and the carroty-headed 
 hostler and that nondescript animal yclept Boots, and all the 
 other vagabond race that infest the purlieus of an inn. But 
 the bustle was transient : the coach again whirled on its way ; 
 and boy and dog, and hostler and Boots, all slunk back again 
 to their holes ; the street again became silent, and the rain 
 continued to rain on. 
 
 7. The evening gradually wore away. The travellers read 
 the papers two or three times over. Some drew round the fire 
 and told long stories about their horses, about their adventures, 
 their overturns, and breakings-down. They discussed the 
 credits of different merchants and different inns, and the two 
 wags told several choice anecdotes. All this passed as they 
 were quietly taking what they called their nightcaps — that is 
 to say, strong glasses of brandy and water and sugar, or some 
 other mixture of the kind ; after which they one after another 
 rang for Boots and the chamber-maid, and walked off to bed in 
 old shoes cut down into marvellously uncomfortable slippers. 
 
 8. There was only one man left— a short-legged, long-bodied, 
 plethoric fellow, with a very large, sandy head. He sat by 
 himself with a glass of port-wine negus and a spoon, sipping 
 and stirring, and meditating and sipping, until nothing was left 
 but the spoon. He gradually fell asleep bolt upright in his 
 chair, with the empty glass standing before him ; and the candle 
 seemed to fall asleep too, for the wick grew long and black, and

 cabbaged at the end, and dimmed the little light that remained 
 in the chamber. The gloom that now prevailed was contagious. 
 Around hung the shapeless and almost spectral box-coats of 
 departed travellers, long since buried in deep sleep. I only 
 heard the ticking of the clock, with the deep-drawn breathings 
 of the sleeping toper, and the drippings of the rain- — drop, drop, 
 drop — from the eaves of the house. 
 
 The Sky. 
 
 1. It is a strange thing how little, in general, people know 
 about the sky. It is the part of creation in which Nature has 
 done more for the sake of pleasing man, more for the sole and 
 evident purpose of talking to him and teaching him, than in 
 any other of her works ; and it is just the part in which we 
 least attend to her. 
 
 2. There are not many of her other works in which some 
 more material or essential pui-pose than the mere pleasing of 
 man is not answered by every part of their organization ; but 
 every essential purpose of the sky might, so far as we know, 
 be answered if, once in three days or thereabouts, a great, 
 ugly, black rain-cloud were brought up over the blue, and 
 everything well watered, and so all left blue again till next time, 
 with perhaps a film of morning and evening mist for dew. And, 
 instead of this, there is not a moment of any day of our lives when 
 Nature is not producing, scene after scene, picture after picture, 
 glory after glory, and working still upon such exquisite and con- 
 stant principles of the most perfect beauty, that it is quite certain 
 that it is all done for us, and intended for our perpetual pleas- 
 ure. And every man, wherever placed, however far from 
 other sources of interest or of beauty, has this doing for him 
 constantly. 
 
 3. The noblest scenes of the earth can be seen and known 
 but by a few ; it is not intended that man should live always 
 in the midst of them ; he injures them by his presence ; he 
 ceases to feel them if he be always with them. But the 
 sky is for all; bright as it is, it is not "too bright nor 
 good for human nature's daily food ; " it is fitted, in all its 
 functions, for the perpetual comfort and exalting of the heart ; 
 for the soothing it, and purifying it from its dross and

 dust. Sometimes gentle, sometime capricious, sometimes 
 awful ; never the same for two moments together ; almost 
 human in its passions, almost spiritual in its tenderness, al- 
 most Divine in its infinity, its appeal to what is immortal in 
 us is as distinct as its ministry of chastisement or of blessing 
 to what is mortal is essential. 
 
 4. And yet we never attend to it ; we never make it a sub- 
 ject of thought, but as it has to do with our animal sensations ; 
 we look upon all by wliich it speaks to us more clearly than to 
 brutes, upon all which bears witness to the intention of the 
 Supreme, that we are to receive more from the covering vault 
 than the light and the dew which we share with the weed and 
 the worm, only as a succession of meaningless and monotonous 
 accidents, too common and too vain to be worthy of a moment 
 of watchfulness or a glance of admiration. 
 
 5. If, in our moments of utter idleness and insipidity, we 
 turn to the sky as a last resource, which of its phenomena do 
 we speak of ? One says it has been wet, and another it has 
 been windy, and another it has been warm. Who, among the 
 whole chattering crowd, can tell me of the forms and precipices 
 of the chain of tall white mountains that gilded the horizon at 
 noon yesterday ? "Who saw the narrow sunbeam that came 
 out of the south, and smote upon their summits, until they 
 melted and mouldered away in a dust of blue rain % Who saw 
 the dance of the dead clouds, when the sunlight left them last 
 night, and the west wind blew them before it, like withered 
 leaves % 
 
 6. All has passed unregretted or unseen ; or, if the apathy 
 be ever shaken off, even for an instant, it is only by what is 
 gross or what is extraordinary ; and yet it is not in the broad 
 and fierce manifestations of the elemental energies, not in the 
 clash of the hail, nor the drift of the whirlwind, that the 
 highest characters of the sublime are developed. God is not 
 
 , in the earthquake nor in the fire, but in the still small voice. 
 They are but the blunt and the low faculties of our nature, 
 which can only be addressed through lampblack and lightning. 
 
 7. It is in quiet and subdued passages of unobtrusive 
 majesty, the deep, and the calm, and the perpetual; that which 
 must be sought ere it is seen, and loved ere it is understood ; 
 things which the angels work out for us daUy, and yet vary

 eternally, which are never wanting, and never repeated ; which 
 are to be found always, yet each found but once; — it is through 
 these that the lesson of devotion is chiefly taught, and the 
 blessing of beauty given. 
 
 An M.P.'s Private Secretary. 
 
 " I brought this card from the General Agency Office, sir," 
 said Nicholas, "wishing to ofier myself as your Secretary." 
 
 "That's all you have come for, is it?" said Mr. Gregsbury. 
 "You have no connection with any of those rascally news- 
 papers, have you ? You didn't get into the room to hear what 
 was going forward, and put it in print, eh ? " 
 
 " I have no connection, I am sorry to say, with anything at 
 present," rejoined Nicholas, — politely enough, but quite at his 
 ease. 
 
 " Oh ! " said Mr. Gregsbury. " Sit down. — You want to be 
 my Secretary, do you ? " 
 
 " I wish to be employed in that capacity, sir." 
 
 " Well, now, what can you do ? " 
 
 " I suppose," replied Nicholas, smUing, " that I can do what 
 falls usually to the lot of other secretaries." 
 
 "What's that?" 
 
 " A secretary's duties are rather difficult to define, perhaps. 
 They include, I presume, correspondence ? " 
 
 " Good," interposed Mr. Gregsbury. 
 
 " The arrangement of papers and documents. Occasionally, 
 perhaps, the writing from your dictation ; and possibly, sir," 
 said Nicholas with a half-smile, " the copying of yotir speech 
 for some public journal, when you have made one of more than 
 usual importance." 
 
 " Certainly, certainly ! What else ? " 
 
 " Really, I am not able, at this instant, to recapitulate any 
 other duty of a Secretary, beyond the general one of making 
 himself as agreeable and useful to his employer as he can, con- 
 sistently with his own respectability ; without overstepping 
 that line of duties which he undertakes to perform, and which 
 the designation of his office is usually understood to imply." 
 
 " This is all very well, Mr. What is your name ? " 
 


## p. (#247) ################################################

 " Nickleby." 
 
 " This is all very well, Mr. Mckleby ; and very proper so 
 far as it goes — so far as it goes, — but it doesn't go far enough. 
 There are other duties, Mr. Nickleby, which a Secretary to a 
 Parliamentary Gentleman must never lose sight of. I should 
 require to be crammed, sir." 
 
 " May I beg your pardon, if I inquire what you mean, sir ? " 
 
 " My meaning, sir, is perfectly plain. My Secretary would 
 have to make himself master of the Foreign Policy of the world 
 as it is mirrored in the newspapers ; to run his eye over all 
 accounts of public meetings — all leading articles — and accounts 
 of the proceedings of public bodies ; and to make notes of any- 
 thing which it appeared to him might be made a poiat of, in 
 any little speech upon the question of some petition lying on 
 the table, or anything of that kind. Do you understand ? " 
 
 " I think I do, sir." 
 
 " Then, it would be necessary for him to make himself 
 acquainted, from day to day, with newspaper paragraphs on 
 passing events ; such as, ' Mysterious Disappearance and Sup- 
 posed Suicide of a Potboy, '-^or anything of that sort, upon 
 which I might found a question to the Secretary of State for 
 the Home Department. Then, he would have to copy the 
 question, and as much as I remembered of the answer (includ- 
 ing a little compliment about independence and good sense) ; 
 and to send the manuscript to the local paper, with perhaps 
 half-a-dozen lines of leader, to the effect that I was always to 
 be found in my place in Parliament, and never shrunk from 
 the responsible and arduous duties, and so forth. You see ? " 
 — Nicholas bowed. — " Besides which, I should expect him, now 
 " and then, to go through a few figures in the Printed Tables, 
 and to pick out a few results, so that I might come out pretty 
 well on Timber-duty questions, and Finance questions, and so 
 on ; and I should like him to get up a few little arguments 
 about the disastrous effects of a Keturn to Cash Payments and 
 a Metallic Currency, with a touch now and then about the 
 Exportation of Bullion, and the Emperor of Kussia,^ — and bank 
 notes, — and all that kind of thing ; which it's only necessary 
 to talk fluently about, because nobody understands it. Do 
 you take me ? " 
 
 " I think I understand."

236 The Elements of Elocution. 
 
 " "With regard to such questions as are not political, and 
 which one can't be expected to care about, beyond the natural 
 care of not allowing inferior people to be as v,'ell off as ourselves 
 — else where are our privileges ? — I should wish my Secretary 
 to get together a few little flourishing speeches of a patriotic 
 cast. For instance, if any preposterous Bill were brought 
 forward for giving poor grubbing authors a right to their own 
 property, I should like to say that I, for one, would never 
 consent to opposing an insurmountable bar to the diffusion of 
 literature among tlie 'people, — you understand ? — that the crea- 
 tions of the pocket, being man's, might belong to one man, or 
 one family ; but that the creations of the brain, being God's, 
 ought, as a matter of course, to belong to the people at large — 
 and, if I was pleasantly disposed, I should like to make a joke 
 about posterity, and say that those who wrote for posterity 
 should be content to be rewarded by the approbation of pos- 
 terity ; it might take with the House, and could never do me 
 any harm, because posterity can't be expected to know any- 
 thing about me, or my jokes either — do you see % " 
 
 " I see that, sir," replied Nicholas. 
 
 " You must always bear in mind, in such cases as this, where 
 our interests are not affected, to put it very strong about the 
 People, because it comes out very well at election-time ; and 
 you could be as funny as you liked about the Authors ; because 
 I believe the greater part of them live in lodgings, and are not 
 voters. This is a hasty outline of the chief things you'd have 
 to do, — except waiting in the Lobby every night, in case I 
 forgot anything, and should want fresh cramming ; and, now 
 and then, during great debates, sitting in the front row of the 
 gallery, and saying to the people about — ' You see that gentle- 
 man, with his hand to his face, and his arm twisted round the 
 pillar — that's Mr. Gregsbury — the celebrated Mr. Gregsbury,' 
 — with any other little eulogium that might strike you at the 
 moment. And for salary, I don't mind saying at once in round 
 numbers, to prevent any dissatisfaction — though it's more than 
 I've been accustomed to give — fifteen shillings a week, and 
 find yourself. There ! " 
 
 With this handsome offer, Mr. Gregsbury once more threw 
 himself back in his chair, and looked like a man who had been 
 most profligately liberal, but is determined not to repent of it 
 notwithstanding.

 " Fifteen shillings a week is not much," said Nicholas mildly. 
 
 " Not much ! Fifteen shillings a week not much, young 
 man ! Fifteen shillings a " 
 
 " Pray do not suppose that I quarrel with the sum, sir, for 
 I am not ashamed to confess that, whatever it may be in itself, 
 to me it is a great deal. But the duties and responsibilities 
 make the recompense small, and they are so very heavy that I 
 fear to undertake them." 
 
 " Do you decline to undertake them, sir % " inquired Mr. 
 Gregsbury, with his hand on the bell-rope. 
 
 " I fear they are too great for my powers, however good my 
 wUl may be, sir." 
 
 " That is as much as to say that you had rather not accept 
 the place, and that you consider fifteen shillings a week too 
 little. Do you decUne it, sir ? " 
 
 " I have no alternative but to do so." 
 
 " Door, Matthews ! " said Mr. Gregsbury, as his servant 
 appeared. 
 
 " I am sorry I have troubled you unnecessarily, sir." 
 
 " I am sorry you have," rejoined Mr. Gregsbury, turning his 
 back. " Door, Matthews ! " 
 
 " Good morning, sir." 
 
 " Door, Matthews ! " 
 
 The boy beckoned Nicholas, and, tumbling lazily downstairs 
 before him, opened the door, and ushered him into the street.
