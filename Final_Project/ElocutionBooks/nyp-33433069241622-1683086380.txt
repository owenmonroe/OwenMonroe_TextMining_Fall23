THE HERMIT.
BEATTIE.
Ar the close of the day, when the hamlet is still,
And mortals the sweets of forgetfulness prove,
When nought but the torrent is heard on the hill,
And nought but the nightingale's song in the grove;
It was thus, by the cave of the mountain afar,
While his harp rung symphonious, a hermit began;
No more with himself, or with nature at war,
He thought as a sage, tho’ he felt as a man.
“Ah why, all abandon'd to darkness and wo,
Why, lone Philomela, that languishing fall?
For spring shall return, and a lover bestow,
And sorrow no longer thy bosom enthral.
But, if pity inspire thee, renew the sad lay;
Mourn, sweetest complainer, man calls thee to mourn;
O sooth him, whose pleasures, like thine pass away;
Full quickly they pass:--but they never return.
“Now gliding remote, on the verge of the sky,
The moon, half extinguished, her crescent displays;
But lately I marked, when majestic on high,
She shone, and the planets were lost in the blaze.
Roll on, thou fair orb, and with gladness pursue
The path that conducts thee to splendour again.
But man's faded glory, what change shall renew?
Ah fool! to exult in a glory so vain !
« Tis night, and the landscape is lovely no more;
I
mourn, but ye woodlands, I mourn not for you;
For morn is approaching, your charms to restore,
Perfum'd with fresh fragrance, and glittering with dew.
Nor yet for the ravage of winter I mourn;
Kind Nature the embryo blossom will save;
But when shall Spring visit the mouldering urn !
O when shall day dawn on the night of the grave !"

“ It was thus, by the glare of false science betray'd'
That leads, to bewilder, and dazzles to blind,
My thoughts wont to roam, from shade onward to
shade,
Destruction before me, and sorrow behind.
“Oh pity, great father of light, then I cry'd,
Thy creature, who fain would not wander from thee;
Lo! humble in dust, I relinquish my pride:
From doubt and from darkness, thou only canst free.'
" And darkness and doubt are now flying away,
No longer I roam in dejection forlorn,
So breaks on the traveller, faint and astray,
The bright and the balmy effulgence of morn.
See truth, love and mercy, in triumph descending,
And nature all glowing in Eden's first bloom !
On the cold cheek of death, smiles and roses are
blending,
And beauty immortal awakes from the tomb.'
ON VISITING A SCENE IN ARGYLESHIRE.
CAMPBELL.
At the silence of twilight's comtemplative hour,
I have mus’d, in a sorrowful mood,
On the wind-shaken weeds that embosom the bower,
Where the home of my forefathers stood.
All ruin'd and wild is their roofless abode,
And lonely the dark raven's sheltering tree;
And travelld by few is the grass-covered road,
Where the hunter of deer and the warrior strode
To his hills that encircle the sea.
Yet wandering, I found on my ruinous walk,
By the dial-stone aged and green,
One rose of the wilderness left on its stalk,
To mark where a garden had been:
Like a brotherless hermit the last of its race,
All wild in the silence of nature, it drew
From each wandering sun-beam a lonely embrace;
For the night-weed and thorn overshadow'd the
place
Where the flower of my forefathers grew.

Sweet bud of the wilderness! emblem of all
That remains in this desolate heart!
The fabric of bliss to its centre may fall;
But patience shall never depart!
Tho' the wilds of enchantment, all vermil and bright,
In the days of delusion by fancy combin'd
With the vanishing phantoms of love and delight,
Abandon my soul, like a dream of the night,
And leave but a desert behind:
Be hush'd my dark spirit! for wisdom condemns
When the faint and the feeble deplore:
Be strong as the rock of the ocean that stems
A thousand wild waves to the shore !
Thro' the perils of chance, and the scowl of disdain,
May thy front be unaltered, thy courage elate;
Yea! even the name I have worshipp’d in vain
Shall awake not the sigh of remembrance again.
To bear is to conquer our fate.
THE EXILE OF ERIN.
T. CAMPBELL.
THERE came to the beach a poor exile of Erin,
The dew on his thin robe was heavy and chill;
For his country he sigh'd when at twilight repairing
To wander alone by the wind-beaten hill.
But the day-star attracted his eye's sad devotion;
For it rose on his own native isle of the ocean,
Where once, in the fervor of youth's warm emotion,
He sung the bold anthem of Erin go Bragh.
Sad is my fate! (said the heart-broken stranger)-
The wild-deer and wolf to a cover can flee;
But I have no refuge from famine and danger:
A home and a country remain not to me,
Never again in the green sunny bowers
Where my forefathers liv’d, shall I spend the sweet
hours,
Or cover my harp with the wild-woven flowers,
And strike to the numbers of Erin go bragh.
Erin ! my country! tho sad and forsaken,

In dreams, I revisit thy sea-beaten shore;
But, alas ! in a far foreign land I awaken,
And sigh for the friends that can meet me no more.
Oh ! cruel fate! wilt thou never replace me
In a mansion of peace, where no perils can chase me?
Never again shall my brothers embrace me !
They died to defend me, or live to deplore.
Where is my cabin-door, fast by the wild wood ?
Sisters and sire, did ye weep for its fall ?
Where is the mother that look'd childhood ?
And where is the bosom-friend, dearer than all ?
Ah ! my sad soul, long abandun'd by pleasure !
Why did it doat on a fast fading treasure ?
Tears, like the rain-drops may fall without measure,
But rapture and beauty they cannot recal.
Yet,—all its fond recollections suppressing,
One dying wish my lone bosom shall draw.-
Erin an exile bequeaths thee his blessing:
Land of my forefathers!-Erin go bragh !
Buried and cold, when my heart stills her motion,
Green be thy fields sweetest isle of the ocean,
And thy harp-striking bards sing aloud with devotion,
Erin mavournin! Erin go bragh!
THE CHEVALIER'S LAMENT.
BURNS.
The small-birds rejoice in the green leaves returning,
The murmuring streamlet winds clear thro' the
vale;
The hawthorn-trees blow in the dews of the morning,
And wild scatter'd cowslips bedeck the sweet dale.
But what can give pleasure, or what can seem fair,
While the lingering moments are number'd by care?
-No flowers gaily springing, nor birds sweetly sing-
ing,
Can sooth the sad bosom of joyless despair,
The deed that I dar'd, could it merit their malice?
A king and a father to place on his throne?

His right are these hills, and his right are these val-
lies,
Where the wild beasts find shelter, but I can find
none.
But 'tis not my sufferings,—thus wretched, forlorn!-
My brave gallant friends, 'tis your ruin I mourn:
Your deeds prov'd so loyal in hot bloody trial !--
Alas! can I make you no sweeter return!
GRAY'S ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCH-
YARD.
Reprinted according to the original copy.
The curfew tolls—the knell of parting day!
The lowing herd wind slowly o'er the lea,
The ploughman homeward plods his weary way,
And leaves the world to darkness and to me.
Now fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,
And all the air a solemn stillness holds
Save where the beetle wheels his droning flight,
And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds;
Save that, from yonder ivy-mantled tower,
The moping owl does to the moon complain
Of such as, wandering near her secret bower,
Molest her ancient solitary reign.
Beneath those rugged elms, that yew-tree's shade,
Where heaves the turf in many a mouldering heap,
Each in his narrow cell for ever laid,
The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.
The breezy call of incense-breathing Morn,
The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,
The cock's shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,
No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.
For them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,
Or busy housewife ply her evening care;
No children run to lisp their sire's return,
Or climb his knees, the envy'd kiss to share.

Oft did the harvest to their sickle yield;
Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke;
How jocund did they drive their team afield!
How bow'd the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!
Let not Ambition mock their useful toil,
Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;
Nor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile,
The short and simple annals of the poor;
The boast of heraldry, the pomp of pow'r,
And all that beauty, all that wealth, e'er gave,
Await, alike, the inevitable hour:
The paths of glory lead but to the grave.
Nor you, ye Proud! impute to these the fault,
If Memory o'er their comb no trophies raise,
Where, thro’ the long-drawn aisle, and fretted
vault,
The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.
Can storied urn, or animated bust,
Back to its mansion call the fleeted breath?
Can Honour's voice provoke the silent dust
Or Flattery sooth the dull, cold ear of death?
Perhaps, in this neglected spot, is laid
Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;-
Hands that the rod of empire might have sway'd,
Or wak'd to ecstacy the living lyre.
But Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,
Rich with the spoils of Time, did ne'er unroll;
Chill Penury repress'd their noble rage,
And froze the genial current of the soul.
Full many a gem
of purest ray serene
The dark, unfathom'd caves of ocean bear;
Full many a flower is born to blush unseen,
And waste its sweetness on the desert air.
Some village-Hampden,that, with dauntless breast,
The little tyrant of his fields withstood;
Some mute inglorious Milton here may rest,-
Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country's blood.

The applause of listening senates to command, -
The threats of pain and ruin to despise,
To scatter plenty o'er a smiling land, -
And read their bistory in a nation's eyes,
Their lot forbade: nor circumscrib'd, alone,
Their growing virtues,—but their crimes confin'd;
Forbade to wade thro' slaughter to a throne;
And shut the gate of mercy on mankind;
The struggling pangs of conscious Truth to hide;
To quench the blushes of ingenuous Shame;
Or heap the shrine of Luxury and Pride
With incense kindled at the Muse's flame!
Yet, even these bones from insult to protect,
Some frail memorial, still erected nigh,
With uncouth rhymes, and shapeless sculpture,
deck's,
Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.
Their
names,
their
years, spelt by the unletter'd
Muse,
The place of fame and elegy supply ;
And many a holy text around she strews-
That teach the rustic moralist to die.
For who, to dumb Forgetfulness a prey,
This pleasing, anxious being e'er resignd,
Left the warm precincts of the cheerful day,
Nor cast one longing-lingering look behind?
On some fond breast the parting soul relies ;
Some pious drops the closing eye requires;
Even from the tomb, the voice of Nature cries,
Even in our ashes, live their wonted fires.
For thee, who, mindful of the unhonor'd dead,
Dost, in these lines, their artless tale relate,
By chance and lonely Contemplation led,
To wander in the gloomy walks of fate ;
Hark! how the sacred calm that breathes around,
Bids every fierce tumultuous passion cease;
In still small accents whispering from the ground
A grateful earnest of eternal peace!

YOUNG'S NIGHT THOUGHTS.
Tir's Nature's sweet restorer, balmy Sleep!
He, like the world, his ready visit pays
Where Fortune smiles; the wretched he forsakes ;
Swift on his downy pinion flies from wo,
And lights on lids unsully'd with a tear.
From short, (as usual) and disturbed repose,
I wake : how happy they, who wake no more !
Yet that were vain, if dreams infest the grave.
I wake, emerging from a sea of dreams
Tumultuous; where my wreck'd desponding thought,
From wave to wave of fancy'd misery,
At random drove, her helm of reason lost.
Tho' now restored, 'tis only change of pain,
(A bitter change!) severer for severe.
The Day too short for my distress; and Night,
Even in the zenith of her dark domain,
Is sunshine to the colour of my fate.
Night, sable goddess! from her ebon throne,
In rayless majesty, now stretches forth
Her leaden sceptre o'er a slumbering world.
Silence, how dead: and darkness, how profound!
Nor eye, nor list’ning ear, an object finds;
Creation sleeps. "Tis as the general pulse
Of life stood still, and nature made a pause;
An awful pause! prophetic of her end.
And let her prophesy be soon fulfill’d;
Fate! drop the curtain; I can lose no more.
Silence and darkness! solemn sisters! twins
From ancient Night, who nurse the tender thought
To Reason, and on Reason build Resolve,

He scarce had ceas'd, when the superior fiend
Was moving tow’rd the shore; his ponderous shield
(Ethereal temper, massy, large, and round)
Behind him cast! the broad circumference
Hung on his shoulders, like the moon, whose orb,
Thro' optic glass, the Tuscan artist views,
At evening, from the top of Fiesolé,
Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands,
Rivers or mountains, in her spotty globe.
His spear to equal which the tallest pine
Hewn on Norwegian hills, to be the mast
Of some great ammiral, were but a wand)
He walk'd with to support uneasy steps
Over the burning marl-(not like those steps
On heaven's azure!)—and the torrid clim e
Smote on him sore besides, vaulted with fire.
Nathless he so endur'd, till on the beach
Of that inflamed sea he stood, and call’d
His legions, angel forms, who lay, entranc’d,
Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks
In Vallombrosa, where the Etrurian shades,
High over-arch'd, imbower; or scatter'd sedge
Afloat, when, with fierce winds, Orion, arm’d,
Hath vex'd the Red Sea Coast-whose waves o'er-
threw
Busiris and his Memphian chivalry,
While with perfidious hatred they pursu'd
The sojourners of Goshen,—who beheld,
From the safe shore, their floating carcases
And broken Chariot wheels: so, thick bestrown,
Abject, and lost, lay these, covering the flood,
Under amazement of their hideous change.

OTHELLO'S ADDRESS TO THE SENATE,
SHAKSPEARE.
Most potent, grave, and reverend signors,
My very noble and approv'd good masters;
That I have taken away this old man's daughter,
It is most true; true, I have married her;-
The very head and front of my offending
Hath this extent—no more. Rude am I in speech,
And little bless'd with the set phrase of peace;
For since these arms of mine had seven years pith,
'Till now, some nine moons wasted, they have us'd
Their dearest action in the tented field;
And little of this great world can I speak
More than pertains to feats of broil and battle;
And, therefore, little shall I grace my cause,

In speaking for myself; yet, by your patience,
I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
Of my whole course of love:—what drugs, what
charms,
What conjuration, and what mighty magic,
(For such proceeding I am charg'd withal)
I won his daughter with.
Her father lov'd me; oft invited me;
Still question'd me the story of my life,
From year to year; the battles, sieges, fortunes,
That I have past.
I run it thro', even from my boyish days,
To the very moment that he bade me tell it.
Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances;
Of moving accidents, by flood and field;
Of hair-breadth 'scapes in the imminent deadly
breach;
Of being taken by the insolent foe,
And sold to slavery; of my redemption thence;-)
Of battles bravely, hardly fought; of victories,
For which the conquerer mourn'd—so many fell!
Sometimes I told the story of a siege,
Wherein I had to combat plagues and famine:
Soldiers unpaid; fearful to fight, yet bold
In dangerous mutiny.
These things to hear
Would Desdemona seriously incline:
But still the house affairs would draw her thence;-
Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
She'd come again, and with a greedy ear
Devour up my discourse: which I observing,
Took once a pliant hour; and found good means
To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart,1
That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
But not distinctively. I did consent;
And often did beguile her of her tears,
When I did speak of some distressful stroke
That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
She gave me for my pains a world of sighs!
She
swore, “In faith 'twas strange, 'twas passing
strange;

'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:”.
She wish'd she had not heard it;-yet she wish'd
That heav'n had made her such a man;-She thank'd
me;
And bade me, if I had a friend that lov'd her,
I should but teach him how to tell my story,
And that would woo her. On this hint I spake.
She lov'd me for the dangers I had past;
And I lov'd her that she did pity them.
-This, only, is the witchcraft I have used.

HENRY V. BEFORE HARFLEUR.
SHAKSPEARE.
Once more unto the breach, dear friends! once more
Or close the wall up with our English dead.
In peace, there's nothing so becomes a man
As modest stillness and humility:
But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
Then imitate the action of the tiger:
Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood, -
Disguise fair nature with hard-favoured rage:
Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
Let it pry through the portage of the head,
Like the brass cannon;-let the brow o'erwhelm it
As fearfully, as doth a galled rock
O’erhang and jutty his confounded base,
Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.
Now set the teeth, and stretch the nostril wide ;
Hold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit
To his full height!-On, on, you noble English,
Whose blood is set from fathers of war-proof!
Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
Have, in these parts, from morn till even fought,
And sheath'd their swords for lack of argument.
Dishonour not your mothers. Now attest
That those whom you call’d fathers did beget you!
Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
And teach them how to war!--And you, good yeomer.
Whose limbs were made in England, shew us here
The mettle of your pasture; let us swear

For there is none of you so mean and base,

SATAN'S SOLILOQUY.
MILTON.
O THOU, that with surpassing glory crown'd,
Look'st from thy sole dominion like the God
Of this new world; at whose sight all the stars
Hide their diminish'd heads; to thee I call,
But with no friendly voice, and add thy name,
O sun, to tell thee how I hate thy beams,
That bring to my remembrance from what state
I fell, how glorious once above thy sphere;
Till pride and worse ambition threw me down,
Warring in Heav'n against Heav'n's matchless King:
Ah, wherefore! he deserv'd no such return
From me, whom he created what I was
In that bright eminence, and with his good
Upbraided none: nor was his service hard.
What could be less than to afford him praise,
The easiest recompense, and pay him thanks,
How due! yet all his good prov'd ill in me,
And wrought but malice; lifted up so high
I disdained subjection, and thought one step higher
Would set me highest, and in a moment quit
The debt immense of endless gratitude,
So burdensome, still paying, still to owe,
Forgetful what from him I still receiv'd,
And understood not that a grateful mind
By owing, owes not but still pays, at once
Indebted and discharg'd; what burden then?
0, had his powerful destiny ordain'd
Me some inferiour angel, I had stood
Then happy; no unbounded hope had rais'd

Ambition. Yet why not? some other power
As great might have aspir'd, and me, though mean,
Drawn to his part; but other powers as great
Fell not, but stand unshaken from within
Or from without, to all temptations arm'd.
Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?
Thou hadst : whom hast thou then or what t’ accuse,
But Heav'n's free love dealt equally to all?
Be then his love accurs'd, since love or hate,
To me alike, it deals eternal wo.
Nay curs'd be thou; since against his thy will
Chose freely what it now so justly rues.
Me miserable ! which way shall I fly
Infinite wrath, and infinite despair?
Which way I fly is hell ; myself am hell;
And in the lowest deep a lower deep
Still threat'ning to devour me opens wide,
To which the hell I suffer seems a heaven.
O then at last relent : is there no place
Left for repentance, none for pardon left?
None left but by submission; and that word
Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame
Among the spirits beneath, whom I seduc'd
With other promises and other vaunts
Than to submit, boasting I could subdue
Th' Omnipotent. Ah me, they little know
How dearly I abide that boast so vain,
Under what torments inwardly I groan,
While they adore me on the throne of Hell.
With diadem and sceptre high advanc’d,
The lower still I fall, only supreme
In misery ; such joy ambition finds.
But say I could repent, and could obtain
By act of grace my former state ; how soon
Would height recall high thoughts, how soon unsay
What feign'd submission swore? ease would recant
Vows made in pain, as violent and void :
For never can true reconcilement grow
Where wounds of deadly hate have pierc'd so deep ;
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse
And heavier fall : so should I purchase dear
Short intermission bought with double smart.

This knows my Punisher; therefore as far
From granting he, as I from begging peace :
All hope excluded thus, behold in stead
Of us oul-cast exild, his new delight,

So farewell hope, and with hope farewell fear;
Farewell remorse : all good to me is lost;

Whose hints shew'd meaning, whose allusions care,
-By one brave stroke to mark all human kind,
Call’d clear blank paper every infant mind;
Where still, as opening sense her dictates wrote,
Fair Virtue put a seal, or Vice a blot.
The thought was happy, pertinent and true !
Methinks a genius might the plan pursue.
1-(can you pardon my presumption?)—1,
No wit, no genius, yet, for once, will try.
Various the papers, various wants produce :
The wants of fashion, elegance and use.
Men are as various; and, if right I scan,
Each sort of paper represents some man.
Pray note the fop ;-half powder, and half lace!
Nice as a bandbox were his dwelling-place.
He's the gilt-paper which apart you store,
And lock from vulgar hands in the scrutoire.
Mechanics, servants, farmers, and so forth,
Are copy-paper of inferior worth ;
Less priz’d; more useful ; for your desk decreed;
Free to all pens, and prompt at every need.
The wretch whom avarice bids to pinch and spare,
Starve, cheat and pilfer, to enrich an heir,
Is coarse brown paper ; such as pedlars choose
To wrap up wares which better men will use.

Take next the miser's contrast ; who destroys
Health, fame and fortune in a round of joys.
Will any paper match him? Yes, throughout :
He's a true sinking paper, past all doubt.
The retail politician's anxious thought
Deems this side always right, and that stark naught :
He foams with censure ;. with applause he raves ;
A dupe to rumours, and a tool to knaves :

Say Slouch could hardly call his soul his own;
For if he went abroad too much, she'd use
To give him slippers, and lock up his shoes.
Talking he lov'd, and ne'er was more afflicted
Than when he was disturb’d or contradicted;
Yet still into his story she would break
With “ 'Tis not so-Pray give me leave to speak.”
His friends thought this was a tyrannic rule,
Not differing much from calling him a fool;
Told him he must exert himself, and be,
In fact, the master of his family.
He said “That the next Tuesday noon would shew
“Whether he were the lord at home, or no,
“When their good company he would entreat
“To well-brew'd ale, and clean, if homely, meat.”
With aching heart, home to his wife he goes,
And on his knees does his rash act disclose,
And prays dear Sukey-tbat, one day, at least,
He might appear as master of the feast.

Each bowsy farmer with his simpering dame,
“Ho, Sue !” cries Slouch, “why dost thou not ap-

“ Are these thy manners when aunt Snap is here ?"
“I pardon ask,” says Sue; “ I'd not offend
Any my dear invites ; much less his friend."
Slouch, by his kinsman Gruffy had been taught
To entertain his friends with finding fault,
And make the main ingredient of his treat
His saying "there was nothing fit to eat :
“The boil'd pork stinks—the roast beef's not enough,
“The bacon's rusty, and the hens are tough;
“The veal’s all rags; the butter's turn’d to oil;
“And thus I buy good meat for sluts to spoil.
"%Tis we are the first Slouches ever sat

Some things she own'd ; at other times she laid
The fault on chance; but oftener on the maid.
Then Cheese was brought. Says Slouch, “This

“ I'm sure 'tis hard enough to make a bowl.
“This is skimm'd milk; and, therefore, it shall go ;
“And this, because 'tis Suffolk, follow too."
But now Sue's patience did begin to waste ;
Nor longer could dissimulation last.
“ Pray let me rise,” says she, “my dear !—I'll find
“A cheese, perhaps, may be to Lovy's mind !
Then, in an entry standing close, where he
Alone, and none of all his friends might see,
And brandishing a cudgel he had felt,
And far enough, on this occasion smelt,
“I'll try, my joy !" she cried, “If I can please
“My dearest with a taste of his Old Cheese!"
Slouch, turning round, saw his wife's vigorous hand
Wielding her oaken saplin of command.
He knew the twang.

Shouts of applause along the shores resound.
Each from the yoke the smoking steeds unty'd,
And fix'd their headstalls to his chariot side.

With generous wine, and all-sustaining bread.

Ungrateful offering to the immortal
powers !
Whose wrath hung heavy o'er the Trojan towers ;
Nor Priam nor his sons obtain'd their grace ;
Proud Troy they hated, and her guilty race.
The troops exulting sat in order round,
And beaming fires illumin'd all the ground.
As when the Moon, refulgent lamp of night!
O'er heav'ns clear azure spreads her sacred light,
When not a breath disturbs the deep serene,
And not a cloud o'ercasts the solemn scene;
Around her throne the vivid planets roll,
And stars unnumber'd gild the glowing pole,
O'er the dark trees a yellower verdure shed,
And tip with silver every mountain's head;
Then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise,
A flood of glory bursts from all the skies :
The conscious swains, rejoicing in the sight,
Eye the blue vault, and bless the useful light.
So, many flames before proud Ilion blaze,
And lighten glimmering Xanthus with her rays;
The long reflection of the distant fires
Gleam on the walls, and tremble on the spires.
A thousand piles the dusky horrours gild,
And shoot a shady lustre o'er the field.
Full fifty guards each flaming pile attend,
Whose umber'd arms, by fits, thick flashes send,
Loud neigh the coursers o'er their heaps of corn,
And ardent warriours wait the rising morn.

REPLY OF MR. PITT,
(The late Earl of Chatham,)
TO THE CHARGE OF YOUTHFUL INEXPERIENCE,
AND THEATRICAL ANIMATION.
This illustrious father of English Oratory, having
expressed himself, in the House of Commons, with his
accustomed
energy, in opposition to one of the measures
then in agitation, his speech produced an answer from
Mr. WALPOLE, who, in the course of it, said, “ Formi-
dable sounds, and furious declamation, confident
assertions, and lofty periods, may affect the young

6 and inexperienced ; and perhaps, the honourable
gentleman may have contracted his habits of ora-
tory by conversing more with those of his own age,
than with such as have had more opportunities of
acquiring knowledge, and more successful methods
of communicating their sentiments.” And he made
use of some expressions, such as vehemence of gesture,
theatrical emotion, &c. applying them to Mr. Pitt's
manner of speaking. As soon as Mr. WALPOLE sat
doron, Mr. Pitt got up and replied :
The atrocious crime of being a young man, which
the honorable gentleman has, with such spirit and
decency, charged upon me, I shall neither attempt
to palliate nor deny : but content myself with wish-
ing--that I may be one of those whose follies cease
with their youth ; and not of that number who are
ignorant in spite of experience.
Whether youth can be imputed to any man as a re-
proach, I will not assume the province of determin-
ing—but, surely, age may become justly contempti-
ble,--if the opportunities which it brings have passed
away without improvement, and vice appears to pre-
vail when the passions have subsided. The wretch
that, after having seen the consequences of a thou-
sand errors, continues still to blunder,--and whose
age has only added obstinacy to stupidity, is surely
the object of either abhorrence or contempt; and de-
serves not that his grey head should secure him from
insults. Much more is he to be abhorred-who, as
he has advanced in age, has receded from virtue, and
becomes more wicked with less temptation : who
prostitutes himself for money which he cannot enjoy,,
and spends the remains of his life in the ruin of his
country.
But youth is not my only crime. I have been ac-
cused of acting a theatrical part.
A theatrical part, may either imply-some pecu.
liarities of gesture,—or a dissimulation of my real
sentiments, and the adoption of the opinions and
language of another man.
In the first sense, the charge is too trifling to be
confuted; and deserves only to be mentioned that it

may be despised. I am at liberty (like every other
man) to use my own language: and tho'l may, per-
haps, have some ambition,--yet to please this gentle-
man, I shall not lay myself under any restraint, or
very solicitously copy his diction, or his mien; howev-
er matured by age, or modelled by experience. If any
man shall, by charging me with theatrical behaviour,
imply that I utter any sentiments but my own, I shall
treat him as a calumniator and a villain: nor shall any
protection shelter him from the treatment which he
deserves. I shall, on such an occasion, without scru-
ple, trample upon all those forms with which wealth
and dignity entrench themselves; nor shall any thing
but age restrain my resentment: age, which always
brings one privilege—that of being insolent and su-
percilious without punishment.
But--with regard to those whom I have offended,
I am of opinion—that, if I had acted a borrowed part,
I should have avoided their censure. The heat that
offended them is the ardour of conviction, and that
zeal for the service of my country, which neither
hope, nor fear, shall influence me to suppress. I will
not sit unconcerned while my liberty is invaded; nor
look in silence upon public robbery. I will exert my
endeavours (at whatever hazard) to repel the aggres-
sor, and drag the thief to justice,—what power soev-
er may protect the villany, and whoever may partake
of the plunder.
APOSTROPHE TO THE QUEEN OF
FRANCE.
BURKE.
It is now, sixteen or seventeen years since I saw
the queen of France, then the dauphiness, at Versail-
les; and surely, never lighted on this orb, which she
hardly seemed to touch, a more delightful vision. I
saw her just above the horizon, decorating and cheere
ing the elevated sphere she just began to move in:
glittering, like the morning star; full of life, and
splendour, and joy.

Oh! what a revolution and what a heart must I
have, to contemplate without emotion that elevation:
and that fall!
Little did I dream-that, when she added titles of
veneration to those of enthusiastic, distant, respect-
ful love, that she should ever be obliged to carry the
sharp antidote against disgrace concealed in that bo-
som;little did I dream—that I should have lived to
see such disasters fallen upon her in a nation of gal-
lant men,-in a nation of men of honour and of cav-
aliers. I thought ten thousand swords must have
leaped from their scabbards to avenge even a look
that threatened her with insult. But the age of chiv-
alry is gone. That of sophisters, economists, and
calculators, has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is
extinguished for ever. Never, never more, shall we
behold that generous loyalty to rank and sex,--that
proud submission,--that dignified obedience, that
subordination of the heart, which kept alive, even in
servitude itself, the spirit of an exalted freedom. The
unbought grace of life, the cheap defence of nations,
the nurse of manly sentiment and heroic enterprise is
gone! It is gone,-that sensibility of principle that
chastity of honour, which felt a stain like a wound,-
which inspired courage whilst it mitigated ferocity,
which ennobled whatever it touched; and under
which vice itself lost half its evil, by losing all its
grossness.
PART OF THE BURIAL SERVICE.
(From the Book of Common Prayer.)
I am the resurrection and the life, saith the Lord;
he that believeth in me, tho' he were dead, yet shall
he live: and whosoever liveth, and believeth in me,
shall never die.
I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he
shall stand at the latter day upon the earth; and
tho' worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I
see God.

Behold, thou hast made my days, as it were, a
span long; and mine age is even as nothing in re-
spect of thee; and verily every man living is alto-
gether vanity: for man walketh in a vain shadow,
and disquieteth himself in vain: he heapeth up riches
and cannot tell who shall gather them.
A thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday:
seeing that is past as a watch in the night. As
soon as thou scatterest them, they are even as a
sleep: and fade away suddenly like the grass. In
the morning it is green, and groweth up; but in the
evening it is cut down, dried up, and withered.
We consume away in thy displeasure; and are
afraid at thy wrathful indignation: for when thou art
angry, all our days are gone, and we bring our years
to an end, as it were a tale that is told. So teach us
to number our days: that we may apply our hearts
unto wisdom.
Now is Christ risen from the dead, and become
the first fruits of them that slept: for since by man
came death, by man came, also, the resurrection of
the dead. As in Adam all die, even so in Christ
shall all be made alive. But some
man will say,
“How are the dead raised up? and with what body
do they come?” Thou fool, that which thou sowest
is not quickened except it die: and that which thou
sowest, thou sowest not that body that shall be, but
bare grain,-it may chance of wheat, or of some
other grain: but God giveth it a body, as it hath
pleased him; and to every seed his own body. So,
also, is the resurrection of the dead: It is sown in
corruption: it is raised in incorruption: It is sown in
dishonour; it is raised in glory: It is sown in weak-
ness; it is raised in power: It is sown a natural body;
it is raised a spiritual body. Now this I say,
breth-
ren, that flesh and blood cannot inherit the king-
dom of God: neither doth corruption inherit corrup-
tion.
Behold, I shew you a mystery. We shall not all
sleep: but we shall all be changed in a moment,-in
the twinkling of an eye, at the last trump: for the
trumpet shall sound, and the dead shall be raised in-

corruptible, and we shall be changed. For this cor-
ruptible must put on incorruption, and this mortal
must put on immortality. So when this corruptible
shall have put on incorruption; and this mortality
shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought
to pass the saying that is written—"Death is swal-
lowed up in victory.” O Death! where is thy sting?
O Grave! where is thy victory? The sting of death
is sin; and the strength of sin is the law. But thanks
be to God, who giveth us the VICTORY, through our
Lord Jesus Christ.
Man that is born of a woman hath but a short time
to live, and is full of misery. He cometh up, and is
cut down like a flower: he fleeth, as it were a shadow,
and never continueth in one stay. In the midst of
life we are in death: of whom may we seek for suc-
cour,
but of thee, O Lord! who for our sins art justly
displeased? Yet, O Lord God most holy! O Lord
most mighty! O holy and most merciful Saviour!
deliver us not into the bitter pains of eternal death.

REPORT OF AN ADJUDGED CASE
NOT TO BE FOUND IN ANY OF THE BOOKS.
COWPER.
Between Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose,,
The spectacles set them unhappily wrong ;
The point in dispute was, all the world knows,
To which the said spectacles ought to belong.
So the tongue was the lawyer, and argued the cause
With a great deal of skill, and a wig full of learn-
ing;
While chief baron Ear sat to balance the laws,
So fam'd for his talent in nicely discerning.
In behalf of the Nose, it will quickly appear,
And your lordship, he said, will undoubtedly find,
That the Nose has had spectacles always in wear,
Which amounts to possession time out of mind.
Then holding the spectacles up to the court,
Your lordship observes they are made with a strad-
dle,
As wide as the ridge of the Nose is ; in short,
Design'd to fit close to it, just like a saddle.
Again, would your lordship a moment suppose
('Tis a case that has happen'd, and may be again)
That the visage or countenance had not a Nose,
Pray who would or who could wear spectacles
then ?

On the whole it appears, and my argument shews,
With a reasoning the court will never condemn,
That the spectacles plainly were made for the Nose,
And the Nose was as plainly intended for them.
Then shifting his side, as a lawyer knows how,
He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes;
But what were his arguments few people know,
For the court did not think they were equally wise.
So his lordship decreed, with a grave solemn tone,
Decisive and clear, without one if or but-
That whenever the Nose put his spectacles on,
By day-light or candle-light--Eyes should be shut.

Low, sullen sounds, his grief beguild:

But thou, O Hope! with eyes so fair,

Still it whisper'd promis'd pleasure,
And bade the lovely scenes at distance hail!
Still would her touch the strain prolong,
And from the rocks, the wood, the vale,

A soft, responsive voice was heard at every close,
And Hope enchanted smil'd, and wav'd her golden

And longer had she sung—but, with a frown,
Revenge, impatient, rose:
He threw his blood-stain'd sword, in thunder, down
And, with a withering look,
The war-denouncing trumpet took,
And blew a blast so loud and dread-
Were ne'er prophetic sounds so full of wo!
And, ever and anon, he beat
The doubling drum, with furious heat:-
-And tho' sometimes, each dreary pause between,
Dejected Pity at his side,
Her soul-subduing voice apply'd,
Yet still he kept his wild, unalter'd mien,
While each strain’d ball of sight seem'd bursting

Thy beauty walks, thy tenderness and love.
Wide flush the fields—the softening air is balm-
Echo the mountains round—the forest smiles,
And every sense, and every heart is joy.
Then coines thy glory in the summer months,
With light and heat refulgent. Then thy sun
Shoots full perfection through the swelling year,
And oft thy voice in dreadful thunder speaks ;
And oft, at dawn, deep noon or falling eve,
By brooks and groves, in hollow whispering gales,
Thy bounty shines in Autumn unconfin'd,
And spreads a common feast for all that live.
In Winter awful thou ! with clouds and storms
Around thee thrown—tempest o'er tempest rolld:
Majestic darkness! on the whirlwind's wing
Riding sublime, thou bid'st the world adore,
And humblest nature with thy northern blast,
Mysterious round! what skill, what force divine,
Deep felt in these appear! a simple train-
Yet so delightful mix’d, with such kind art,
Such beauty and beneficence combin'd-
Shade, unperceiv’d, so softening into shade--
And all so forming an harmonious whole-
That, as they still succeed, they ravish still.
But wandering oft with brute unconscious gaze,
Man marks not thee, marks not the mighty hand,
That ever busy, wheels the silent spheres-
Works in the secret deep-shoots, teeming thence
The fair profusion that o'erspreads the spring-
Flings from the sun direct the flaming day :
Feeds
every creature-hurls the tempest forth :
And as on earth this grateful change revolves,
With transport touches all the springs of life.
Nature attend ! join every living soul,
Beneath the spacious temple of the sky,
In adoration join-and ardent raise
One general song! To him, ye vocal gales,
Breathe soft, whose Spirit in your freshness breathes
O talk of him in solitary glooms,
Where, o'er the rock, the scarcely waying pine
Fills the brown shade with a religious awe.

And, as each mingling flame increases each,
In one united ardor rise to heaven.
Or if you rather choose the rural shade,
And find a fane in every sacred grove
There let the shepherd's flute, the virgin's lay,
The prompting seraph, and the poet's lyre,
Still sing the God of Seasons as they roll.
For me, when I forget the darling theme,
Whether the blossom blows, the summer ray
Russets the plain, inspiring Autumn gleams,
Or winter rises in the blackening east-
Be my tongue mute, my fancy paint no more,
And dead to joy, forget my heart to beat !
Should fate command me to the furthest verge
Of the green earth, to distant barb’rous climes,
Rivers unknown to song ; where first the sun
Gilds Indian mountains, or his setting beam
Flames on the Atlantic isles; 'tis nought to me
Since God is ever present, ever felt,
In the void waste as in the city full-
And where He vital breathes, there must be joy.
When even at last the solemn hour shall come,
And wing my mystic flight to future worlds,
I cheerful will obey—there with new powers,
Will rising wonders sing—I cannot go,
Whose Universal Love smiles not around,
Sustaining all yon orbs, and all their suns
From seeming evil still educing good,
And better thence again, and better still,
In infinite progression_but I lose
Myself in Him, in Light Ineffable !
Come then, expressive Silence, muse His praise.
EXECUTION OF THE EARL OF ARGYLE.
FOX'S HISTORY OF JAMES II.--PAGE 148, Svo.
On the 30th of June, 1685, the Earl of Argyle
was brought from the castle, first to the Laigh Coun-
cil House, and thence to the place of execution.
Before he left the Castle, he had his dinner at the
usual hour, at which he discoursed, not only calmly,

but even cheerfully, with Mr. Chateris and others.
After dinner he retired, as was his custom, to his bed
chamber, where, it is recorded, he slept quietly for
about a quarter of an hour. While he was in bed,
one of the members of the council, came, and inti-
mated to the attendants, a desire to speak with him
upon being told that the Earl was asleep, and had
left orders not to be disturbed, the manager disbe-
lieved the account, which he considered as a device
to avoid further questionings. To satisfy him, the
door of the bed chamber was half opened, and then he
beheld, enjoying a sweet and tranquil slumber, the man
who by the doom of him and his fellows, was to die
within the short space of two hours! Struck with
the sight, he hurried out of the room, quitted the
castle with the utmost precipitation, and hid himself
in thé lodgings of an acquaintance who lived near,
where he threw himself upon the first bed that pre-
sented itself, and had every appearance of a man,
suffering the most excruciating torture. His friend,
who was apprised of the state he was in, and who
naturally concluded he was ill, offered him some wine.
He refused, saying, “no, no, that will not help me;
I have been to Argyle, and saw him sleeping as plea-
santly as ever man did, within one hour of Eternity,

to that degree of doubt, with which men of judgment

row, however, whose veracity is above suspicion,
says, he had it from the most unquestionable autho-
rity. It is not in itself unlikely, and who is there,
that would not wish it true? What a satisfactory
spectacle to a philosophical mind, to see the oppres-
sor in the zenith of his power, envying his victim!
What an acknowledgment of the superiority of vir-
tue! What an affecting and forcible testimony of
the value of that peace of mind, which Innocence
alone can confer! We know not who this man was,
but when we reflect that the guilt which agonized
him, was probably incurred for some vain title, or at

want, and possibly knew not how to enjoy, our dis-
gust is turned into something like compassion, for
that
very foolish class of men, whom the world calls
wise in their generation.
Soon after this short repose, Argyle was brought
according to order, to the Laigh Council House, from
which place is dated the letter to his wife, and from
thence to the place of execution. On the scaffold
he had some discourse, as well with Mr. Annand, a
minister appointed by government to attend him, as
with Mr. Chateris. He desired both of them to pray
for him, and prayed himself with much fervour and
devotion. The speech which he made to the people,
was such as might be expected from the passages
already related. The same mixture of firmness and
mildness is conspicuous in every part of it.
ought not,” said he, "to despise our afflictions, nor
to faint under them. We should not suffer ourselves
to be exasperated against the instruments of our trou-
bles, nor by fraudulent or pusillanimous compliance,
bring guilt upon ourselves--faint hearts are usually
false hearts, choosing sin, rather than suffering.”
He offers his prayers for the three Kingdoms of
England, Scotland and Ireland, and that an end may
be put to their present trials
. Having then asked
pardon for his own faults, both of God and man, he
would have concluded, but being reminded that he
had said nothing of the Royal Family, he adds, that
he refers, in this matter to what he had said at his
trial concerning the test; that he prayed there never
might be wanting one of the Royal Family to support
the Protestant Religion; and if any of them had
swerved from the true faith, he prayed God to turn
their hearts; but at any rate to save his people from
their machinations. When he had ended, he turned
to the south side of the scaffold and said, “gentle-
men, I pray you, do not misconstruct my behaviour
this day—I freely forgive all men, their wrongs and
injuries done against me, as I desire to be forgiven
of God.” He then embraced his friends, gave some
tokens of his remembrance to his son in law, Lord

Maitland, for his daughter and Grandchildren, stript
himself of part of his apparel, of which he likewise
made presents, and laid his head upon the block.
Having uttered a short prayer, he gave the signal to
the executioner, which was instantly obeyed, and his
head severed from his body.
Such were the last hours, and such the final close
of this great man's life. May the like happy sereni-
ty, in such dreadful circumstances, and a death
equally glorious, be the lot of all, whom tyranny of
whatever description or denomination, shall, in any

BATTLE OF WARSAW.
CAMPBELL.
When leagu'd Oppression pour'd to northern wars
Her whisker'd pandoors and her fierce hussars,
Wav'd her dread standard to the breeze of morn,
Peal'd her loud drum, and twang'd her trumpet horn;
Tumultuous horror brooded o'er her van,
Presaging wrath to Poland—and to man!
Warsaw's last champion, from her height survey'd,
Wide o'er the fields, a waste of ruin laid, -
Oh! Heav'n! he cried, my bleeding country save!
Is there no hand on high to shield the brave?
Yet, though destruction sweep these lovely plains,
Rise, fellow-men! our country yet remains!
By that dread name, we wave the sword on high,
And swear for her to live!_with her to die!
He said, and on the rampart-heights array'd
His trusty warriors, few, but undismay’d;
Firm pac'd, and slow, a horrid front they form,
Still as the breeze, but dreadful as the storm;
Low, murmuring sounds along their banners fly,
Revenge or death,--the watchword and reply;
Then peal’d the notes, omnipotent to charm,
And the loud tocsin toll’d their last alarm!

In vain, alas! in vain, ye gallant few!
From rank to rank your volley'd thunder flew:-
Oh! bloodiest picture in the book of Time,
Sarmatia fell, unwept, without a crime;
Found not a generous friend, a pitying foe,
Strength in her arms, nor mercy in her wo!
Dropp'd from her nerveless grasp the shatter'd spear,
Clos'd her bright eye, and curb’d her high career;-
Hope for a season, bade the world farewell,
And Freedom shriek'd as Kosciusko fell!
The sun went down, nor ceas'd the carnage there,
Tumultuous murder shook the midnight air-
On Prague's proud arch the fires of ruin glow,
His blood-dy'd waters murmuring far below;
The storm prevails, the rampart yields away,
Bursts the wild cry of horror and dismay!
Hark! as the smouldering piles with thunder fall,
A thousand shrieks for hopeless mercy call!
Earth shook-red meteors flash'd along the sky,
And conscious Nature shudder'd at the cry!
Departed spirits of the mighty dead!
Ye that at Marathon and Leuctra bled!
Friends of the world! restore your swords to man,
Fight in his sacred cause, and lead the van!
Yet for Sarmatia's tears of blood atone,
And make her arm puissant as your own!

Like a love-lighted watch-fire, all night at the gate.

Why flames the far summit? Why shoot to the blast
Those embers, like stars from the firmament cast?

From his eyrie, that beacons the darkness of heaven.

All bloodless lay the untrodden snow,

Each horseman drew his battle blade,
And furious every charger neigh'd,
To join the dreadful revelry.

ANTONY'S ORATION OVER CESAR'S BODY.
SHAKSPEARE.
Friends, Romans, Countrymen! Lend me your ears;
I come to bury Cesar, not to praise him.
The evil that men do, lives after them;
The good is oft interred with their benes:
So let it be with Cesar! Noble Brutus
Hath told you, Cesar was ambitious:
If it were so, it was a grievous fault;
And grievously hath Cesar answer'd it.
Here, under leave of Brutus, and the rest,
(For Brutus is an honourable man,
So are they all, all honourable men)
Come I to speak in Cesar's funeral-
He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
But Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honourable man.
He hath brought many captives home to Rome,
Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
Did this in Cesar seem ambitious?
When that the poor have cried, Cesar hath wept;

Ambition should be made of sterner stuff;
Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
And Brutus is an honorable man.
You all did see, that, on the Lupercal,
I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
Which he did thrice refuse: Was this ambition?
Yet Brutus says, he was ambitious;
And sure, he is an honourable man.
I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
But here I am to speak what I do know.
You all did love him once; not without cause:
What cause
withholds
you
then to mourn for him?
O judgment! Thou art fled to brutish beasts,
And men have lost their reason! Bear with me:
My heart is in the coffin there with Cesar;
And I must pause till it come back to me.
But yesterday, the word of Cesar might
Have stood against the world! now lies he there,
And none so poor to do him reverence.
O masters! If I were dispos’d to stir
Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong;
Who, you all know, are honorable men.
I will not do them wrong—I rather choose
To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
Than I will wrong such honourable men.
But here's a parchment with the seal of Cesar;
I found it in his closet; 'tis his will:
Let but the commons hear this testament,
(Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read)
And they would go and kiss dead Cesar's wounds.
And dip their napkins in his sacred blood
Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
And, dying, mention it within their wills,
Bequeathing it, as a rich legacy,
Unto their issue.
If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
You all do know this mantle: I remember
The first time ever Cesar put it on,
'Twas on a summer's evening in his tent;
That day he overcame the Nervii-
Look! in this place ran Cassius' dagger through

See, what a rent the envious Casca made:
Through this the well beloved Brutus stabb’d,
And, as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
Mark how the blood of Cesar follow'd it!
This, was the most unkindest cut of all!
For when the noble Cesar saw him stab,
Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
Even at the base of Pompey's statue,
(Which all the while ran blood) great Cesar fell.
O what a fall was there, my countrymen!
Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.
0, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel,
The dint of pity; these are gracious drops.
Kind suuls, what, weep you, when you but behold
Our Cesar's vesture wounded? Look
you
here!
Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.
Good friends, Sweet friends, let me not stir you up
To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
They, that have done this deed, are honourable;
What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
That made them do it; they are wise and honourable,
And, will no doubt, with reason answer you.
I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts;
I am no orator, as Brutus is;
But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
That love my friend—and that they know full well
That gave me public leave to speak of him.
For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
Action, nor utterance, nor power of speech,
To stir men's blood- I only speak right on:
I tell you that which you yourselves do know-
Show you sweet Cesar's wounds, poor, poor dumb
mouths,
And bid them speak for me. But, were I Brutus,
And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue
In every wound of Cesar, that should move
The stones of Rome to rise in mutiny.

THE COUNTRY BUMPKIN AND RAZOR
SELLER.
P. PINDAR,
A fellow, in a market-town,
Most musical, cried razors up and down,
And offer'd twelve for eighteen pence;
Which, certainly, seem'd wonderous cheap,
And, for the money, quite a heap,
That every man would buy, with cash and sense.
A country bumpkin the great offer heard;
Poor Hodge,who suffer'd by a broad black beard,
That seem'd a shoe-brush stuck beneath his nose,
With cheerfulness the eighteen-pence he paid,
And, proudly, to himself, in whispers said
« This rascal stole the razors, I suppose.
“No matter if the fellow be a knave,
« Provided that the razors shave;
" It certainly will be a monstrous prize."
So home the clown, with his good fortune, went, —
Smiling,-in heart and soul content,
And quickly soap'd himself to ears and eyes.
Being well lather'd, from a dish or tub,
Hodge now began, with grinning pain, to grub-
Just like a hedger cutting furze:
'Twas a vile razor!-then the rest he try'd;

All were impostors. "Ah!” Hodge sigh'd,
“ I wish my eighteen-pence was in my purse.
In vain, to chase his beard, and bring the graces,
He cut and dug and whind and stamp'd and swore;
Brought blood, and danc'd, blasphem'd, and made
wry faces,
And curs'd each razor's body, o'er and o'er.
His muzzle, form’d of opposition stuff,
Firm as a Foxite, would not lose its ruff;
So kept it-laughing at the steel and suds.
Hodge, in a passion, stretch'd his angry jaws,
Vowing the direst vengeance, with clench'd claws,
On the vile cheat that sold the goods.
“Razors! a vile, confounded dog! -
“Not fit to scrape a hog!”
Hodge sought the fellow_found him—and begun-
“P’rhaps, Master Razor-rogue! to you 'tis fun
“That people flay themselves out of their lives.
“ You rascal! for an hour have I been grubbing,
“Giving my crying whiskers here a scrubbing
“With razors just like oyster-knives.
“Sirrah! I tell you, you're a knave
To
cry up razors that can't shave.”
“Friend,” quoth the razor-man,“ I'm not a knave.
“As for the razors you have bought,-
Upon my soul, I never thought
“That they would shave.”
“ Not think they'd shave?" quoth Hodge, with wond'-
ing eyes
And voice not much unlike an Indian yell,
“What were they made for then, you dog?” he cries.
“ Made!” quoth the fellow, with a smile" to sell.”

ON HAPPINESS OF TEMPER.
GOLDSMITH.
Writers of every age
have endeavoured to shew
that pleasure is in us, and not in the objects offered
for our amusement. If the soul be happily disposed,

every thing becomes capable of affording entertain-
ment; and distress will almost want a name. Every
occurrence passes in review, like the figures of a
procession; some may be awkward, others ill dressed;
but none but a fool is, for this, enraged with the mas-
ter of the ceremonies.
I remember to have once seen a slave, in a forti-
fication in Flanders, who appeared no way touched
with his situation. He was maimed, deformed and
chained; obliged to toil from the appearance of day
till night-fall, and condemned to this for life; yet,
with all these circumstances of apparent wretched-
ness, he sung, would have danced, but that he want-
ed a leg, and appeared the merriest, happiest man of
all the garrison.
What a practical philosopher was here! a happy
constitution supplied philosophy; and though seem-
ingly destitute of wisdom, he was really wise. No
reading or study had contributed to disenchant the
fairy-land around him. Every thing furnished him
with an opportunity of mirth; and, though some
thought him, from his insensibility, a fool- he was
such an idiot as philosophers should wish to imitate:
for all philosophy is only forcing the trade of happi-
ness, when Nature seems to deny the means.
They who, like our slave, can place themselves on
that side of the world in which every thing appears
in a pleasing light, will find something in every oc-
currence to excite their good humour. The most
calamitous events, either to themselves or others, can
bring no new affliction; the whole world is, to them,
a theatre, on which comedies only are acted. All
the bustle of heroism, or the rants of ambition, serve
only to heighten the absurdity of the scene, and make
the humour more poignant. They feel, in short, as
little anguish at their own distress, or the complaints
of others, as the undertaker, though dressed in black,
feels sorrow at a funeral.
Of all the men I ever read of, the famous Cardinal
de Retz possessed this happiness of temper in the
highest degree. As he was a man of gallantry, and
despised all that wore the pedantic appearance of

philosophy, wherever pleasure was to be sold, he was
generally foremost to raise the auction.
Being a
universal admirer of the fair sex—when he found one
lady cruel, he generally fell in love with another,
from whom he expected a more favourable reception.
If she, too, rejected his addresses, he never thought
of retiring into deserts, or pining in hopeless distress:
he persuaded himself-that, instead of loving the
lady, he had only fancied that he had loved her;-
and so all was well again.
When Fortune wore her angriest look, and he at
last fell into the power of his most deadly enemy,
Cardinal Mazarine (being confined a close prisoner,
in the castle of Valenciennes) he never attempted to
support his distress by wisdom or philosophy; for he
pretended to neither. He only laughed at himself
and his persecutor; and seemed infinitely pleased at
his new situation. In this mansion of distress,-though
secluded from his friends,—though denied all the
amusements, and even the conveniences of life, he
still retained his good humour; laughed at the little
spite of his enemies: and carried the jest so far—as
to be revenged, by writing the life of his gaoler.
All that the wisdom of the proud can teach—is to
be stubborn, or sullen, under misfortunes. The Car-
dinal's example will instruct us to be merry, in cir-
cumstances of the highest affliction. It matters not
whether our good humour be construed, by others,
into insensibility; or even idiotism; it is happiness to
ourselves; and none but a fool would measure his
satisfaction by what the world thinks of it.
The happiest silly fellow I ever knew, was of the
number of those good-natured creatures that are said
to do no harm to any but themselves. Whenever he
fell into any misery, he called it, “ seeing life." If
his head was broke by a chairman, or his pocket
picked by a sharper, he comforted himself by imi-
tating the Hibernian dialect of the one, or the more
fashionable cant of the other. Nothing came amiss

His inattention to money matters had incensed his
father to such a degree, that all intercession of friends
in his favour, was fruitless.
The old gentleman was on his death bed. The
whole family (and Dick among the number) gathered
around him.
“I leave my second son Andrew,” said the expir-
ing miser, “my whole estate; and desire him to be
frugal.”
Andrew, in a sorrowful tone (as is usual on those
occasions) prayed Heaven to prolong his life and
health to enjoy it himself !
“I recommend Simon, my third son, to the care
of his elder brother; and leave hiin, beside, four thou-
sand pounds."
“Ah! father,” cried Simon (in great affliction to be
sure) “may Heaven give you life and health to enjoy
it yourself !”
At last--turning to poor Dick, “as for you, you
have always been a sad dog; you'll never come to
good; you'll never be rich; I leave you a shilling, to
buy a halter "
“Ah! father,” cries Dick, without any emotion,
' may Heaven give you life and health to enjoy it your-
self!"
THE APOSTROPHE TO LIGHT.
MILTON
Hail, holy Light, offspring of Heav'n first-born,
Or of th’ Eternal coeternal beam,
May I express thee unblam'd! Since God is light,
And never but in unapproached light
Dwelt from eternity, dwelt then in thee,
Bright effluence of bright essence increate.
Or hear'st thou rather, pure etherial stream,
Whose fountain who shall tell? before the sun,
Before the Heav'ns thou wert, and at the voice
Of God, as with a mantle, didst invest
The rising world of waters dark and deep,

Won from the void and formless infinite.
Thee I revisit now with bolder wing,
Escap'd the Stygian pool, though long detain'd
In that obscure sojourn, while in my flight
Through utter and through middle darkness borne,
With other notes than to th' Orphean lyre
I sung of Chaos and eternal Night;
Taught by the Heav'nly Muse to venture down
The dark descent, and up to re-ascend,
Though hard and rare, thee I revisit safe,
And feel thy sov'reign vital lamp; but thou
Revisit’st not these eyes, that roll in vain
To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn;
So thick a drop serene hath quench'd their orbs,
Or dim suffusion veil'd. Yet not the more
Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt,
Clear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,
Smit with the love of sacred song; but chief
Thee, Sion, and the flow'ry brooks beneath,
That wash thy hallow'd feet, and warbling flow,
Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget
Those other two equall’d with me in fate,
So were I equall'd with them in renown,
Blind Thamyris, and blind Mæonides,
And Tyresias, and Phineus, prophets old:
Then fed on thoughts, that voluntary move
Harmonious numbers; as the wakeful bird
Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid
Tunes her nocturnal note. Thus with the year
Seasons return, but not to me returns
Day, or the sweet approach of ev'n and morn,
Or sight of vernal bloom, or summer's rose,
Or flocks, or herds, or human face divine;
But cloud instead, and ever-during dark
Surrounds me, from the cheerful ways of men
Cut off, and for the book of knowledge fair
Presented with a universal blank
Of Nature's works to me expung’d and raz’d;
And wisdom, at one entrance, quite shut out.
So much the rather thou, celestial Light,
Shine inward, and the Mind through all her powers

WORDSWORTH.

Three years she grew in sun and shower,
Then nature said, “a lovelier flower
On earth was never sown;
This child I to myself will take;
She shall be mine, and I will make
A lady of my own.
“ Myself will to my darling be
Both law and impulse: and with me
The girl, in rock and plain,
In earth and heaven, in glade and bower,
Shall feel an overseeing power
To kindle and restrain.
“ She shall be sportive as the fawn
That wild with glee across the lawn
Or up the mountain springs;
And hers shall be the breathing balm
And hers the silence and the calm
Of mute insensate things.
« The floating clouds their state shall lend
To her; for her the willow bend;
Nor shall she fail to see
Even in the motions of the storm
Grace that shall mould the maiden's form
By silent sympathy.
“ The stars of midnight shall be dear
To her; and she shall lean her ear
In many a secret place
Where rivulets dance their wayward round;
And beauty, born of murmuring sound,
Shall pass into her face.

Shall rear her form to stately height,
Her virgin bosom swell;
Such thoughts to Lucy I will give
While she and I together live,
Here in this happy dell.”
Thus Nature spake.

How soon my Lucy's race was run!
She died, -and left to me
This health, this calm and quiet scene;
The memory of what has been,
And never more will be.

By Philip's warlike son:
Aloft, in awful state,
The godlike hero sat
On his imperial throne;
His valiant peer's were plac'd around,
Their brows with roses and with myrtle bound:
So should desert in arms be crown'd.
The lovely Thais, by his side,
Sat, like a blooming eastern bride,
In flower of youth, and beauty's pride.
Happy, happy, happy pair!
None but the brave,---none but the brave,-none but
the brave deserves the fair!
Timotheous, plac'd on high,
Amid the tuneful choir,
With flying fingers touch'd the lyre;
The trembling notes ascend the sky,
And heavenly joys inspire.
The song began from Jove!
Who left his blissful seats above-
Such is the power of mighty love! -
A dragon's fiery form bely'd the god:
Sublime, on radiant spires, he rode,

And, while he sought her snowy breast,
Around her slender waist he cu rl'd,
And stamp'd an image of himself, a sovereign of the
world!
The listening crowd admire the lofty sound;
A present deity! they shout around,
A present deity! the vaulted roofs rebound.
With ravish'd ears,
The monarch hears,
Assumes the God,
Affects to nod,
And seems to shake the spheres.
The praise of Bacchus, then, the sweet musician
sung:
Of Bacchus ever fair and ever young.
The jolly god, in triumph comes;
Sound the trumpets, beat the drums!
Flush'd with a purple grace,
He shows his honest face:
Now give the hautboys breath;-he comes!-he
comes!
Bacchus, ever fair and young,
Drinking joys did first ordain:
Bacchus blessings are a treasure,
Drinking is the soldier's pleasure!
Rich the treasure
Sweet the pleasure;-
Sweet is pleasure after pain.
Sooth'd with the sound, the king grew vain;
Fought all his battles o'er again:
And thrice he routed all his foes; and thrice he slew
the slain.
The master saw the madness rise,
His glowing cheeks, his ardent eyes;
And while he heaven and earth defy'd,
Chang'd his hand, and check'd his pride.
He chose a mournful muse,
Soft pity to infuse,

Fallen-fallen fallen !-fallen !-Fallen from his

And weltering in his blood.
Deserted, at his utmost need,
By those his former bounty fed,
On the bare earth, expos'd he lies,
With not a friend to close his eyes.
With downcast look the joyless victor sate,
Revolving, in his altered soul,
The various turns of fate below;
And, now and then, a sigh he' stole-
And tears began to flow.
The mighty master smil'd to see
That love was in the next degree.
'Twas but a kindred sound to move:
For pity melts the mind to love.
Softly sweet, in Lydian measures,
Soon he sooth'd his soul to pleasures.
War, he sung, is toil and trouble:
Honor but an empty bubble;
Never ending, still beginning,
Fighting still, and still destroying,
If the world be worth thy winning,
Think, O think it worth enjoying!
Lovely Thais sits beside thee.
Take the good the gods provide thee.
The many rend the skies with loud applause:
So Love was crown'd: but Music won the cause:
The prince, unable to conceal his pain,
Gaz'd on the fair,
Who caus'd his care,
And sigh’d, and look’d,--sigh’d, and look’d--sigh’dy

A louder yet, and yet a louder strain:
Break his bands of sleep asunder,
And rouse him with a rattling peal of thunder.
Hark! hark—the horrid sound

As awak'd from the dead,
And, amaz’d, he stares around.
Revenge! revenge! Timotheus cries:
See the Furies arise!-
See the snakes that they rear,
How they hiss in the air!-
And the sparkles that flash in their eyes!
Behold a ghastly band-
Each a torch in his hand:
These are Grecian ghosts, that in battle were slain
And unbury'd remain,
Inglorious on the plain:
Give the vengeance due
To the valiant crew.
Behold how they toss their torches un high!-
How they point to the Persian abodes,
And glittering temples of their hostile gods!
The princes applaud with a furious joy,
And the king seiz'd a flambeau, with zeal to destroy:
Thais led the way,
To light him to his prey,
And, like another Helen, fir'd another Troy.
Thus, long ago,
(Ere heaving bellows learn'd to blow,-
While organs yet were mute)
Timotheus, to his breathing flute
And sounding lyre,
Could swell the soul to rage, or kindle soft desire.
At last, divine Cecilia came,
Inventress of the vocal frame:
The sweet enthusiast, from her sacred store,
Enlarg’d the former narrow bounds,
And added length to solemn sounds,
With Nature's mother-wit, and arts unknown before.

BYRON
Night wanes, the vapours round the mountains curl'd
Melt into morn, and Light awakes the world;
Man has another day to swell the past,
And lead him near to little, but his last;
But mighty nature bounds as from her birth,
The sun is in the heavens, and life on earth;
Flowers in the valley, splendour in the beam,
Health on the gale, and freshness in the stream.
Immortal man! behold her glories shine,
And cry, exulting inly, they are thine!
Gaze on, while yet thy gladden'd eye may see;
A morrow comes when they are not for thee:
And grieve what may above thy senseless bier,
Nor earth nor sky will yield a single tear;
Nor cloud shall gather more, nor leaf shall fall,
Nor gale breathe forth one sigh for thee, for all;
But creeping things shall revel in their spoil,
And fit thy clay to fertilize the soil.

The rapture of repose that's there,
The fix'd yet tender traits that streak

Such is the aspect of this shore;
"Tis Greece, but living Greece no more!
So coldly sweet, so deadly fair,

That parts not quite with parting breath;
But beauty with that fearful bloom,
That hue which haunts it to the tomb;

Spark of that flame, perchance of heavenly birth,
Which gleams, but warms no more its cherish'd earth!

By the deep Sea, and music in its roar:
I love not Man the less, but Nature more,
From these our interviews, in which I steal
From all I may be, or have been before,
To mingle with the Universe, and feel
What I can ne'er express, yet cannot all conceal.
Roll on, thou deep and dark blue ocean,-roll!
Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;
Man marks the earth with ruin—his control
Stops with the shore;-upon the watery plain
The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain
A shadow of man's ravage, save his own,
When, for a moment, like a drop of rain,
He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan,
Without a grave, unknell'd, uncoffin'd, and unknown.

Are not a spoil for him,- thou dost arise
And shake him from thee; the vile strength he
wields
For earth's destruction thou dost all despise,
Spurning him from thy bosom to the skies,
And send'st him, shivering in thy playful spray
And howling to his Gods, where haply lies
His petty hope in some near port or bay,
Then dashest him again to earth:—there let him lay.

Of rock-built cities, bidding nations quake,
And monarchs tremble in their capitals,

Glasses itself in tempests; in all time,
(Calm or convulsed, in breeze, or gale, or storm,
Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime
Dark-heaving) --boundless, endless, and sublime-
The image of Eternity—the throne
Of the Invisible; even from out thy slime
The monsters of the deep are made; each zone
Obeysthee; thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone. ;
And I have loved thee, Ocean! and my joy
Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be
Borne, like thy bubbles, onward: from a boy
I wanton'd with thy breakers—they to me
Were a delight; and if the freshening sea
Made them a terror-'twas a pleasing fear,
For I was as it were a child of thee,
And trusted to thy billows far and near,
And laid my hand upon thy mane—as I do here.
ON SINCERITY.
FROM ABP. TILLOTSON, (ABRIDGED.)
Truth and sincerity have all the advantages of ap-
pearance, and many more. If the show of any thing
be good, I am sure the reality is better: for why does
any man dissemble, or seem to be that which he is
not,—but because he thinks it good to have the quali-
ties he pretends to? Now the best way for a man
to seem to be any thing, is to be in reality what he
would seem to be: besides,—it is often as trouble-
some to support the pretence of a good quality, as to
have it: and, if a man have it not, it is most likely he
will be discovered to want it; and, then, all his labour
to seem to have it, is lost. There is something un-
natural in painting, which a skilful eye will easily
discern from native beauty and complexion.


## p. 60 (#66) ##############################################

EXERCISES
Therefore, if any man think it convenient to seem
good, let him be sp indeed: and then his goodness
will appear to every one's satisfaction. Particularly,
as to the affairs of this world, integrity hath many
advantages over all the artificial modes of dissimula-
tion and deceit. It is much the plainer and easier,-
much the safer, and more secure way of dealing in
the world; it has less of trouble and difficulty, of en-
tanglement and perplexity, of danger and hazard in
The arts of deceit and cunning continually grow
weaker, and less serviceable to those that practice
them; whereas integrity gains strength by use; and
the more and longer any man practiseth it, the great-
er service it does him; by confirming his reputation,
and encouraging those with whom he hath to do, to
repose the greatest confidence in him: which is
an unspeakable advantage in business and the affairs
of life.
But insincerity is very troublesome to manage.
A hypocrite hath so many things to attend to, as
make his life a very perplexed and intricate thing.
A liar hath need of a good memory, lest he contra-
dict at one time what he said at another; but truth is
always consistent, and needs nothing to help it out:
it is always near at hand, and sits upon our lips;
whereas a lie is troublesome, and needs a great many
more to make it good.
In a word, whatsoever convenience may be thought
to be in falsehood and dissimulation, it is soon over:
but the inconvenience of it is perpetual; because it
brings a man under an everlasting jealousy and sus-
picion; so that he is not believed when he speaks
the truth; nor trusted when, perhaps, he means
honestly. When a man hath once forfeited the repu-
tation of his integrity, nothing will then serve his
turn: neither truth nor falsehood.
Indeed, if a man were only to deal in the world for
a day, and should never have occasion to converse
more with mankind, it were then no great matter (as
far as respects the affairs of this world) if he spent
his reputation all at once; or ventured it at one throw.
But if he be to continue in the world, and would have

61
the advantage of reputation whilst he is in it, let him
make use of truth and sincerity in all his words and
actions; for nothing but this will hold out to the
end. All other arts may fail; but truth and in-
tegrity will carry a man thro', and bear him out to
the last.

FALSTAFF'S RAGGED REGIMENT.

Henry iv. Part 1.-Act iv. Scene 4.,
If I be not asham'd of my soldiers, I am a souc'd
gurnet. I have misus'd the king's press damnably.
I have got in exchange of an hundred and fifty sol-
diers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me
none but good householders--yeomen's sons; inquire
me out contracted bachelors, such as had been ask'd
twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,
as had as lief hear the devil as a drum; such as fear
the report of a caliver, worse than a stuck fowl, or a
hurt wild duck. I press me none but such toasts and
butter, with hearts in their bellies no bigger than pins'
heads; and they have bought out their services. And
now my whole charge consists of ancients, corporals,
lieutenants, gentlemen of companies!-slaves as rag-
ged as Lazarus, in the painted cloth; and such as,
indeed, were never soldiers; but discarded unjust
servingmen, younger sons to younger brothers, re-
volted tapsters, and ostlers trade-fallen; the cankers
of a calm world and a long peace; and such have I
to fill up the room of them that have bought out their
services; that you would think, I had a hundred and
fifty tatter'd prodigals, lately come from swine-keep-

me on the way, and told me, I had unloaded all the
gibbets, and press'd the dead bodies. No eye has
seen such scare-crows. I'll not march through Co-
ventry with them, that's flat. Nay, and the villains
march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had gyves on;

ST. PAUL'S DEFENCE BEFORE KING
AGRIPPA.
ACTS XXXVI. I.
Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted
to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the
hand, and answered for himself:
I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall
answer for myself this day before thee, touching all
the things whereof I am accused of the Jews. Espe-
cially, because I know thee to be expert in all cug-
toms and questions which are among the Jews;
wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently. My
manner of life from my youth, which was at the first
among mine own nation at Jerusalem, know all the
Jews; which knew me from the beginning, if they
would testify, that after the most straitest sect of our
religion, I lived a Pharisee. And now I stand and
am judged for the hope of the promise made of God
unto our fathers: unto which promise our twelve
tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to
come. For which hope's sake, king Agrippa, I am
accused of the Jews. Why should it be thought a
thing incredible with you, that God should raise the
dead? I verily thought with myself, that I ought to
do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Na-
zareth. Which thing I also did in Jerusalem: and
many of the saints did I shut up in prison, having re-
ceived authority from the chief Priests; and when
they were put to death, I gave my voice against them.
And I punished them oft in every synagogue, and
compelled them to blaspheme; and being exceed-
ingly mad against them, 1 persecuted them even unto

strange cities. Whereupon as I went to Damascus,
with authority and commission from the chief Priests,
at mid-day, O king, I saw in the way a light from
heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining
round about me, and them which journeyed
with me.
And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a
voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew
tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? it is
hard for thee to kick against the pricks. And I said,
Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus, whom
thou persecutest. But rise and stand upon thy feet;
for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to
make thee a minister and a witness both of these
things which thou hast seen, and of those things in
the which I will appear unto thee; delivering thee
from the people, and from the Gentiles, unto whom
now I send thee; to open their eyes, and to turn them
from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan
unto God; that they may receive forgiveness of sins,
and inheritance among them which are sanctified, by
faith that is in me. Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I
was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision: but
shewed first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusa-
lem, and throughout all the coasts of Judea, and then
to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to
God, and do works meet for repentance. For these
causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went
about to kill me. Having therefore obtained help of
God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to
small and great, saying none other things than those
which the prophets and Moses did say, should come.
That Christ should suffer, and that he should be the
first that should rise from the dead, and should shew
light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.
he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud
voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning
doth make thee mad. But he said, I am not mad,
most noble Festus, but speak forth the words of truth
and soberness. For the king knoweth of these things,
before whom also I speak freely: for I am persuaded
that none of these things are hidden from him; for

this thing was not done in a corner. King Agrippa
believest thou the prophets?' I know that thou be-
lievest. Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Almost thou
persuadest me to be a Christian. And Paul said, I
would to God that not only thou, but also all that hear
me this day, were both almost, and altogether such
as I am, except these bonds.
SONG OF MOSES.

sang
Moses and the children of Israel this
song unto the Lord, and spake saying, I will sing un-

horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea.
The Lord is my strength and song, and he is
become my salvation: he is my God, and I will
prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and
I will exalt him. The Lord is a man of war: Jeho-
vah is his name. Pharaoh's chariots and his host
hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also
are drowned in the Red Sea. The depths have cov-
ered them: they sank into the bottom as a stone.
Thy right hand, O Lord, is become glorious in
power; thy right hand, O Lord, hath dashed in pieces
the enemy. And in the greatness of thine excellen-

Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by

WITHOUT GOD IN THE WORLD.
SERMON-REV. ROBERT HALL.
The exclusion of a Supreme Being, and of a su-
perintending providence, tends directly to the des-
iruction of moral taste. It robs the universe of all
finished and consummate excellence even in idea.
The admiration of perfect wisdom and goodness for
which we are formed, and which kindles such un-
speakable rapture in the soul, finding in the regions
of scepticism nothing to which it corresponds, droops
and languishes. In a world which presents a fair
spectacle of order and beauty, of a vast family nour-
ished and supported by an almighty Parent; in a world
which leads the devout mind, step by step, to the
contemplation of the first fair and the first good, the
sceptic is encompassed with nothing but obscurity,
meanness, and disorder.
When we reflect on the manner in which the idea
of Deity is formed, we must be convinced that such
an idea intimately present to the mind, must have a
most powerful effect in refining the moral taste.
Composed of the richest elements, it embraces, in the
character of a beneficent Parent, and almighty Ruler,
whatever is venerable in wisdom, whatever is awful
in authority, whatever is touching in goodness.

Human excellence is blended with many imper-
fections, and seen under many limitations. It is be-
held only in detached and separate portions, nor ev-
er appears in any one character whole and entire,
So that when, in imitation of the Stoics, we wish to
form out of these fragments the notion of a perfectly
wise and good man, we
know it is a mere fiction of
the mind, without any real being in whom it is em-
bodied and realized. In the belief of a Deity, these
conceptions are reduced to reality: the scattered rays
of an ideal excellence are concentrated, and become
the real attributes of that Being with whom we stand
in the nearest relation, who sits supreme at the head
of the universe, is armed with infinite power, and
pervades all nature with his presence.
The efficacy of these sentiments in producing and
augmenting a virtuous taste, will indeed be propor-
tioned to the vividness with which they are formed,
and the frequency with which they recur; yet some
benefit will not fail to result from them even in their
lowest degree.
The idea of the Supreme Being has this peculiar
property; that, as it admits of no substitute, so, from
the first moment it is impressed, it is capable of con-
tinual growth and enlargement. God himself is im-
mutable; but our conception of his character is con-
tinually receiving fresh accessions; is continually
growing more extended and refulgent, by having
transferred upon it new perceptions of beauty and
goodness; by attracting to itself, as a centre, what-
ever bears the impress of dignity, order, or happiness.
It borrows splendour from all that is fair, subordi-
nates to itself all that is great, and sits enthroned on
the riches of the universe.
SPEECH OF MR. PLUNKET
On the Competency of the Irish Parliament to
pass
the
Measure of Union.
Sir, I in the most express terms, deny the compe-
tency of Parliament to do this act. I warn you,

not dare to lay yonr hand on the constitution—I tell
you, that if, circumstanced as you are, you pass
this act, it will be a nullity, and that no man in Ire-
land will be bound to obey it. I make the assertion
deliberately-I repeat it, and I call on any man who
hears me, to take down my words;--you have not
been elected for this purpose—you are appointed to
make laws and not legislatures—you are appointed to
act under the constitution, not to alter it-you are
appointed to exercise the functions of legislators, and
not to transfer them—and if you do so your act is a
dissolution of the government-you resolve society
into its original elements, and no man in the land
is bound to obey you. Sir, I state doctrines which
are not merely founded in the immutable laws of jus-
tice and of truth. I state not merely the opinions of
the ablest men who have written on the science of
government, but I state the practice of our constitu-
tion as settled at the era of the revolution, and I
state the doctrine under which the house of Hanover
derives its title to the throne. Has the king a right
to transfer his crown? Is he competent to annex it to
the crown of Spain or any other country? No—but
he may abdicate it; and every man who knows the
constitution knows the consequence, the right reverts
to the next in succession--if they all abdicate, it re-
verts to the people. The man who questions this
doctrine, in the same breath, must arraign the sove-
reign on the throne as a usurper. Are you compe-
petent to transfer your legislative rights to the French
council of five hundred? Are you competent to trans-
fer them to the British parliament? I answer, no.
When you transfer you abdicate, and the great ori-
ginal trust results to the people from whom it issued.
Yourselves you may extinguish, but parliament you
cannot extinguish-it is enthroned in the hearts of
the people—it is enshrined in the sanctuary of the
constitution—it is immortal as the island which it pro-
tects—as well might the frantic suicide hope that
the act which destroys his miserable body should
extinguish his eternal soul. Again, I therefore warn

you, do not dare to lay your hands on the constitu-
tion; it is above your power. Sir, I do not say that
the parliament and the people, by mutual consent
and co-operation, may not change the form of the
constitution. Whenever such a case arises it must
be decided on its own merits—but that is not this
If government considers this a season pecul-
iarly fitted for experiments on the constitution, they
may call on the people. I ask you are you ready to
do so? Are you ready to abide the event of such
an appeal? What is it you must, in that event submit
to the people? Not this particular project, for if you
dissolve the present form of government, they become
free to choose any other-you_fling them to the fu-
ry of the tempest-you must call on them to unhouse
themselves of the established constitution, and to
fashion to themselves another. I ask again, is this
the time for an experiment of that nature? Thank
God, the people have manifested no such wish—so
far as they have spoken, their voice is decidedly
against this daring innovation.--You know that no
voice has been uttered in its favour, and you cannot
be infatuated enough to take confidence from the
silence which prevails in some parts of the kingdom;
if you know how to appreciate that silence it is more
formidable than the most clamorous opposition-you
may be rived and shivered by the lightning before
you hear the peal of the thunder! But, sir, we are
told we should discuss this question with calmness
and composure.—I am called on to surrender my
birth-right and my honour, and I am told I should
be calm, composed. National pride! Independence
of our country! These, we are told by the minister,
are only vulgar topics fitted for, the meridian of
the mbb, but unworthy to be mentioned in such an
enlightened assembly as this; they are trinkets and
gewgaws fit to catch the fancy of childish and un-
thinking people like you sir, or like your predecessor
in that chair, but utterly unworthy the consideration
of this house, or of the matured understanding of the
noble lord who condescends to instruct it! Gracious

Denunciation against the Men and Means by which the
Union was perpetrated.
PLUNKET.
Let me again ask you, how was the rebellion of
1798 put down? By the zeal and loyalty of the gen-
tlemen of Ireland rallying around—what ? a reed
shaken by the winds, a wretched apology for a min-
ister who neither knew how to give or where to seek
protection? No--but round the laws and constitution
and independence of the country. What were the
affections and motives that called us into action? To
protect our families, our properties and our liberties.
-What were the antipathies by which we were exci-
ted? Our abhorrence of French principles and
French ambition.- What was it to us that France
was a republic?-I rather rejoiced when I saw the
ancient despotism of France put down. What was
it to us that she dethroned her monarch? I admired
the virtue and wept for the sufferings of the man,
but as a nation it affected us not. The reason I
took up arms, and am ready still to bear them against
France, is because she intruded herself upon our do
mestic concerns—because, with the rights of man and
the love of freedom on her tongue, I see that she has
the lust of dominion in her heart-because wherever
she has placed her foot, she has erected her throne,
and that to be her friend or her ally is to be her tri-
butary or her slave. Let me ask, is the present con-
duct of the British minister calculated to augment or
to transfer that antipathy? No, sir, I will be bold to
say, that licentious and impious France, in all the

unrestrained excesses which anarchy and atheism
have given birth to, has not committed a more insid-
ious act against her enemy than is now attempted by
the professed champion of civilized Europe against a
friend and an ally in the hour of her calamity and
distress—at a moment when our country is filled with
British troops--when the loyal men of Ireland are
fatigued with their exertions to put down rebellion
efforts in which they had succeeded before these
troops arrived—whilst our Habeas Corpus Act is sus-
pended--Whilst trials by court martial are carrying
on in many parts of the kingdom-whilst the people
are taught to think that they have no right to meet or
deliberate, and whilst the great body of them are so
palsied by their fears, and worn down by their exer-
tions, that even the vital question is scarcely able to
rouse them from their lethargyat a moment when
we are distracted by domestic dissentions—dissentions
artfully kept alive as the pretext for our present sub-
jugation and the instrument of our future thraldom!!
Sir, I thank administration for this measure. They
are, without intending it, putting an end to our dis-
sentions--through this black cloud which they have
collected over us, I see the light breaking in upon
this unfortunate country. They have composed our
dissention—not by fomenting the embers of a lingering
and subdued rebellion--not by hallooing the Protestant
against the Catholic and the Catholic against the
Protestant-not by committing the north against the
south-not by inconsistent appeals to local or to par-
ty prejudices-no—but by the avowal of this atro-
cious conspiracy against the liberties of Ireland, they
have subdued every petty and subordinate distinction.
They have united every rank and description of men
by the pressure of this grand and momentous subject,
and I tell them that they will see every honest and
independent man in Ireland rally round her constitu-
tion and merge every consideration in his opposition
to this ungenerous and odious measure. For my own
part, I will resist it to the last gasp of my existence,
and with the last drop of my blood; and when I feel

the hour of my dissolution approaching, I will, like
the father of Hannibal, take my children to the al-

invaders of their country's freedom.—Sir, I shall not
detain you by pursuing this question through the top-
ics which it so abundantly offers.--I should be proud
to think my name might be handed to posterity in the
same roll with those disinterested patriots who have
successfully resisted the enemies of their country-
successfully I trust it will be—in all events I have my
“ exceeding great reward”-I shall bear in my heart
the consciousness of having done my duty, and in the
hour of death I shall not be haunted by the reflection
of having basely sold, or meanly abandoned, the lib-
erties of my native land. Can every man who gives
his vote on the other side this night lay his hand upon
his heart and make the same declaration? I hope so
-it will be well for his own peace—the indignation
and abhorrence of his countrymen will not accom-
pany him through life, and the curses of his children
will not follow him to his grave.
- THE WIDOW OF EPHESUS.
PINDAR.
At Ephesus (a handsome town of Greece)
There liv'd a LADY,-a most lovely piece!
In short, the charming toast of all the town.
In Wedlock's velvet bonds had liv'd the dame.-
Yes! brightly did the torch of Hymen flame,
When Death, too cruel, knock'd her Husband
down.
This was, indeed, a lamentable stroke.
PRUDENTIA's gentle heart was nearly broke!
Tears, pea-like, trickled; shrieks her face deform;
Sighs, sighs succeeding, heave her snowy breast;
Winds, call'd hysterical, expand her chest,
As tho’ she really had devour'd a storm.
Now, fainting, calls she on her poor dead Love:
How like the wailings of the widow'd dove.
All Ephesus upon the wonder gaz'd!
Men, women, children, really were amaz'd.

'Tis true a few old Maids abus'd the pother-
“Heav’n’s! if one husband dies,—why take another!"
Said they-contemptuous, cocking up the nose;
« Ridiculous enough!-and what about?
« To make for a dead husband such a rout!
“ There are as fine as he, one might suppose.
"A body would presume, by grief so mad,
« Another husband was not to be had;
“But men are not so very scarce, indeed:
“More than are good, there are: God mend the
breed!”
Such was the conversation of old Maids,
Upon this husband's visit to the shades.
At length her Spouse was carried to the tomb,
And poor PRUDENTIA mop'd amid the gloom.
One little lamp, with solitary beam,
Shew'd the dark coffin that contain'd her Dear,
And gave a beauteous sparkle to each tear,
That, rill-like, dropp'd;or, rather like a stream.
Resolv'd was she, amid this tomb, to sigh,
To
weep, and wail, and groan,
and starve and die!
No comfort! no! no comfort would she take,
Her friends beheld her anguish with great pain;
Begg'd her to try amusement; but in vain:
“No! she would perish! perish for his sake!”
Her flaxen tresses all dishevell’d flow'd;-
Her vestments loose,--her tucker all abroad,
Revealing such fair swelling orbs of wo!
Her lids, in swimming grief, now look?d on high,
Now downward droop'd; and now she pour'd a sigh,
How tuneful! on her dear pale Spouse below.
Who would not covet death for such sweet sighs?
And be bewail'd by such a pair of eyes?
It happen'd that a Rogue condemn'd to death,
Resign'a (to please the Law) his roguish breath;
And near the vault did this same felon swing.
For fear the Rogue's relations, or a friend,
Might steal him from the rope's disgraceful end,

This Son of Mars, upon his silent station,
Hearing, at night a dismal lamentation,
Stole to the place of wo-that is, the tomb-
And peeping in, beheld a beauteous face
That 'look'd with such a charming tragic grace,
Displaying sorrow for a husband's doom.
The Youth most naturally express’d surprise,
And scarcely could he credit his two eyes:
“Good God, MA’Am--pray Ma'am, what's the
matter here?
“Sweet Ma'am be comforted! you must! you
shall!
"At times misfortunes, even the best befal.-
Pray stop your grief, Ma'am, save that precious
tear.
“Go, Soldier, leave me!" sigh'd the Fair again,
In such a melting melancholy strain,
Casting her eyes of wo upon the Youth-
“I cannot, will not live without my love!”
And then she threw her glistening eyes above,
That swam in tears of constancy and truth.
“Madam!" rejoin'd the YOUTH,—and press'd her ,
hand,
“Indeed you shall not my advice withstand;
“For heav'n's sake dont stay here to weep and
howl:
“Pray take refreshment!" Off at once he set,
And quickly brought the MOURNER drink and meat;
A bottle of Madeira and'a fowl;
And bread and beer, her heart to cheer.
“Ah! gentle Youth, you bid me eat in vain!
“ Leave me! oh, leave me, SOLDIER, to complain,
“Yes, sympathizing youth, withdraw your wine:
“My sighs and tears shall be my only food.
“ Thou knewest not my Husband, kind and good,
“For whom this heart shall ever, ever pine!”
And then she cast upon the Youth an eye
All tender! saying, “Soldier, let me die!”
And then she press’d'his hand with friendship warm,
“You shall not die, by heav'n!” the Soldier swore
“No! to the world such beauty I'll restore,

“And give it back again its only charm!
Such was the effect of her delicious hand
That charm’d his senses like a wizard's wand!)
• What! howl forever for a breathless clod!
“Ma'am, you shall eat a leg of fowl by G~!!!
With that he clapp'd wine, fowl, bread, beer and all,
Without more ceremony, on the pall.
“Well, SOLDIER, if you do insist," quoth she,
All in a saint-like, sweet, complying tone,
“I'll try if Grief will let me pick a bone!
“Your health, Sir”_" Thank you kindly Ma'am,”
quoth he.
As grief absorbs the senses, the fair Dame
Scarce knew that she was eating, or yet drinking;
So hard it is a roaring grief to tame,
And keep the sighing, pensive soul from thinking!
So that the fowl and wine soon pass'd indeed:-
Quickly away too stole the beer and bread
All down her pretty little swelling throat.
And now,—whate'er philosophers may think,
Sorrow is much oblig'd to meat and drink,
Whose soothing virtues stop the plaintive note:
And, says the anatomic Art,
“The stomach's very near the heart.”
PRUDENTIA found it so: a gentler sigh
Stole from her lovely breast;a smaller tear,
Containing less of anguish, did appear
Within the pretty corner of her eye;
Her eye's dark cloud dispersing too apace,
(Just like a cloud that oft conceals the Moon,).
Let out a brighter lustre o'er her face;
Seerning to indicate dry weather soon.
Her tongue, too, somewhat lost its mournful style;
Her rose-bud lips expanded with a smile;
Which pleas'd the gallant Soldier, to be sure,-
Happy to think he sav'd the Dame from Death:-
Yes, from his hug preserv’d the sweetest breath,
And to a wounded heart prescribed a cure.
Now Mars' Son a minute left the Dame,

The knave had deemd it proper to elope!
In short, attendance on the Lady's grief
Had lost him his companion,--the hang'd Thief,
Whose friends had kindly filch'd him from the string.
Quick to the Lady did the Soldier run:
Madam, I shall be hang’d, as sure as a gun!
"U Lord! the thief's gone off, and I shall swing!
“Madam, it was the royal declaration,

Squeezing his hand, and smoothing down his face-

“Nought but a lump of clay can he be counted!

mounted;
Made a good thief;—nay, so complete,
The people never smelt the cheat.
Now from the Gibbet to the Tomb again,
Haste, arm-in-arm, the Soldier and the Fair,
To exchange for kisses and the Turtle strain,
Sad hymns of Death, and ditties of Despair.

ON CONCILIATION WITH AMERICA.
BURKE.
For that service, for all service, whether of re-
venue, trade, or empire, my trust is in her interest in
the British constitution. My hold of the colonies is
in the close affection which grows from common
names, from kindred blood, from similar privileges,
and equal protection. These are ties, which, though
light as air, are as strong as links of iron. Let the
colonies always keep the idea of their civil rights as-
sociated with your government; they will cling and
grapple to you; and no force under heaven will be of
power to tear them from their allegiance. But let it
be once understood, that your government may be
one thing, and their privileges another; that these
two things may exist without any mutual relation;
the cement is gone; the cohesion is loosened; and
every thing hastens to decay and dissolution. As
long as you have the wisdom to keep the sovereign
authority of this country as the sanctuary of liberty,
the sacred temple consecrated to our common faith,
wherever the chosen race and sons of England wor-
ship freedom, they will turn their faces towards you.
The more they multiply, the more friends you will
have. The more ardently they love liberty, the more
perfect will be their obedience. Slavery they can
have any where.
It is a weed that grows in every
soil. They may have it from Spain, they may have
it from Prussia. But until you become lost to all
feelings of your true interest and your national dig-
nity, freedom they can have from none but you.
This
is the commodity of price, of which you have the
monopoly. This is the true act of navigation, which
binds to you the commerce of the colonies, and
through them secures to you the wealth of the world.
Deny them this participation of freedom, and you
break that sole bond, which originally made, and
must still preserve the unity of the empire. Do not
entertain so weak an imagination, as that your regis-
ters and your bonds, your affidavits and your suffer-
ances, your cockets and your clearances, are what

form the great securities of your commerce. Do not
dream that your letters of office, and your instruc-
tions, and your suspending clauses, are the things
that hold together the great contexture of this mys-
terious whole. These things do not make your
government, dead instruments, passive tools as they
are; it is the spirit of the English constitution that
gives all their life and efficacy to them. It is the
spirit of the English constitution, which, infused
through the mighty mass, pervades, feeds, unites, in-
vigorates, vivifies, every part of the empire, even
down to the minutest member.
Is it not the same virtue which does every thing
for us here in England? Do you imagine then, that
it is the land tax which raises your revenue? that it
is the annual vote in the committee of supply, which
gives you your army? or that it is the mutiny bill
which inspires it with bravery and discipline? No!
surely no! It is the love of the people—it is their at-
tachment to their government from the sense of the
deep stake they have in such a glorious institution,
which gives you your army and your navy, and in-
fuses into both that liberal obedience, without which
your army would be a base rabble, and your navy
nothing but rotten timber.
All this, I know well enough, will sound wild and
chimerical to the profane herd of those vulgar and
mechanical politicians, who have no place among us;
a sort of people who think that nothing exists but
what is gross and material; and who therefore, far
from being qualified to be directors of the great move-
ment of empire, are not fit to turn a wheel in the ma-
chine. But to men truly initiated and rightly taught,
these ruling and master principles, which, in the
opinion of such men as I have mentioned, have no
substantial existence, are in truth every thing, and
all in all. Magnanimity in politics is not seldom the
truest wisdom; and a great empire and little minds
go ill together. If we are conscious of our situation,
and glow with zeal to fill our place as becomes our
station and ourselves, we ought to auspicate all our

of the church, Sursum corda! We ought to elevate
our minds to the greatness of that trust to which the
order of Providence has called us. By adverting to
the dignity of this high calling, our ancestors have
turned a savage wilderness into a glorious empire;
and have made the most extensive, and the only
honorable conquests; not by destroying, but by pro-
moting, the wealth, the number, the happiness, of the
human race.
Let us get an American revenue as
we have got an American empire. English privi-
leges have made it all that it is; English privileges
alone will make it all that it can be.
In full confidence of this unalterable truth, I now
(quod felix faustumque sit)--lay the first stone of the
temple of peace; and I move you,
“That the colonies and plantations of Great Bri-
tain in North America, consisting of fourteen sepa-
rate governments, and containing two millions and
upwards of free inhabitants, have not had the liberty
and privilege of electing and sending any knights
and burgesses, or others, to represent them in the
high court of parliament.

Breathe soft or loud! and wave your tops, ye pines
With every plant, in sign of worship, wave.

Melodious murmurs, warbling, tune his praise.
Join voices, all ye living souls. Ye birds,
That singing, up to heaven's gate ascend,
Bear on your wings, and in your notes his praise.
Ye that in waters glide, and ye that walk
The earth, and stately tread or lowly creep!

To hill or valley, fountain or fresh shade,
Made vocal by my song, and taught his praise
Hail, universal Lord! be bounteous still,

SPAIN.
BYRON.
Awake, ye sons of Spain! awake! advance!
Lo! Chivalry, your ancient goddess, cries,
But wields not, as of old, her thirsty lance,
Nor shakes her crimson plumage in the skies;
Now on the smoke of blazing bolts she flies,
And speaks in thunder through yon engine's roar:
In every peal she calls—W Awake! arise!"
Say, is her voice more feeble than of yore,
When her war song was heard on Andalusia's shore?
Hark! heard you not those hoofs of dreadful note?
Sounds not the clang of conflict on the heath?
Saw ye not whom the reeking sabre smote;
Nor saved your brethren ere they sank beneath
Tyrants and tyrants' slave?-the fires of death,
The bale-fires flash on high:—from rock to rock
Each volley tells that thousands cease to breathe;
Death rides upon the sulphury Siroc,
Red Battle stamps his foot, and nations feel the shock.
Lo! where the Giant on the mountain stands,
His blood-red tresses deep’ning in the sun,
With death-shot glowing in his fiery hands,
And eye that scorches all it glares upon;
Restless it rolls, now fix'd, and now anon
Flashing afar,—and at his iron feet
Destruction cowers to mark what deeds are done;
For on this morn three potent nations meet,
To shed before his shrine the blood he deems most
sweet.

is charged as part of the libel. If they had waited
another year, if they had kept this prosecution im-
pending for another year, how much would remain
for a jury to decide upon, I should be at a loss to
discover. It seems as if the progress of public re-
formation was eating away the ground of the prose-
cution. Since the commencement of the prosecu-
tion, this part of the libel has unluckily received the
sanction of the legislature. In that interval our ca-
tholic brethren have obtained that admission, which
it seems it was a libel' to propose; in what way to
account for this, I am really at a loss. Have any
alarms been occasioned by the emancipation of our
catholic brethren? Has the bigoted malignity of any
individuals been crushed? Or has the stability of the
government, or that of the country been weaken-
ed. Or is one million of subjects stronger than four
millions? Do
you
think that the benefit they receiv-
ed should be poisoned by the sting of vengeance? If
you
think
so, you must say to them, "you have de-
manded emancipation, and you have got it; but we
abhor your persons, we are outraged at your suc-
cess ; and we will stigmatize by a criminal prosecu-
tion the relief which you have obtained from the
voice of your country.' I ask you, gentlemen, do
you think, as honest men anxious for the public tran-
quillity, conscious that there are wounds not yet com-
pletely cicatrized, that you ought to speak this lan-
guage at this time, to men who are too much disposed
to think that in this very emancipation they have been
saved from their own Parliament by the humanity of
their sovereign? Or do you
wish to
prepare them for
the revocation of these improvident concessions? Do
you think it wise or humane at this moment to insult
them, by sticking up in the pillory, the man who
dared to stand forth their advocate? I put it to your
oaths, do you think, that a blessing of that kind, that
a victory obtained by justice over bigotry and oppres-
sion, should have a stigma cast upon it by an igno-
îninious sentence upon men bold and honest enough
to propose that measure? To propose the redeeming

ing of three millions of men from bondage, and giv-
ing liberty to all who had a right to demand it; giv-
say,
in the so much censured words of this
paper, giving ' universal emancipation!' I speak in
the spirit of the British law, which makes liberty
commensurate with and inseparable from British soil;
which proclaims even to the stranger and the sojourn-
er, the moment that he sets his foot upon British
earth, that the ground upon which he treads is holy,
and consecrated by the genius of universal emanci-
pation.' No matter in what language his doom may
have been pronounced;—no matter what complexion
incompatible with freedom, an Indian or an African
sun may have burnt upon him—no matter in what
disastrous battle his liberty may have been cloven
down;—no matter with what solemnities he may
have been devoted upon the altar of slavery; the first
moment he touches the sacred soil of Britain, the altar
and the god sink together in the dust; his soul walks
abroad in her own majesty; his body swells beyond
the measure of his chains, that burst from around
him, and he stands redeemed, regenerated and disen-
thralled, by the irresistable genius of universal
emancipation.”

ON AN ADDRESS TO THE THRONE.
CHATHAM.
In the course of the debate, Lord Suffolk, secretary,
for the northern department, undertook to defend the em-
ployment of the Indians in the war. His lordship con-
tended, that, besides its policy and necessity, the meas-
ures was also allowable on principle. For that it was
perfectly justifiable to use all the means that God and
nature put into our hands!"
I AM ASTONISHED! (exclaimed lord Chatham, as he
rose)-shocked! to hear such principles confessed
to hear them avowed in this house, or in this country:
principles equally unconstitutional, inhuman, and un-
christian!

My lords, I did not intend to have encroached a-
gain upon your attention; but I cannot repress my
indignation. I feel myself impelled by every duty.
My lords, we are called upon as members of this
house, as men, as Christian men, to protest against
such notions standing near the throne, polluting the
ear of majesty.-" That God and nature put into our
hands!" I know not what ideas that lord
may enter-
tain of God and nature; but I know that such abomi-
nable principles are equally abhorrent to religion and
humanity. What! to attribute the sacred sanction
of God and nature to the massacres of the Indian
scalping knife-to the cannibal savage, torturing,
murdering, roasting, and eating; literally, my lords,
eating the mangled victims of his barbarous battles!
Such horrible notions shock every precept of religion,
divine or natural, and every generous feeling of hu-
manity. And, my lords, they shock every sentiment
of honour; they shock me as a lover of honourable
war, and a detester of murderous barbarity.
These abominable principles, and this more abom-
inable avowal of them, demand the most decisive in-
dignation. I call upon that right reverend bench,
those holy ministers of the gospel, and pious pastors
of our church; I conjure them to join in the holy
work, and vindicate the religion of their God. I ap-
peal to the wisdom and the law of this learned bench,
to defend and support the justice of their country. I
call
upon the bishops, to interpose the unsullied sanc-
tity of their lawn; upon the learned judges, to inter-
pose the purity of their ermine, to save us from this
pollution. I call upon the honour of your lordships,
to reverence the dignity of your ancestors, and to
maintain your own. I call upon the spirit and hu-
manity of my country, to vindicate the national char-
acter. I invoke the genius of the British constitu-
tion. From the tapestry that adorns these walls, the

indignation at the disgrace of his country. In vain
he led your victorious fleets against the boasted Ar-
mada of Spain; in vain he defended and established
the honour, the liberties, the religion, the Protestant
religion, of this country, against the arbitrary cruel-
ties of popery and the inquisition, if these more than
popish cruelties and inquisitorial practices are let
loose
among us; to turn forth into our settlements,
among our ancient connexions, friends, and relations,
the merciless cannibal, thirsting for the blood of man,
woman, and child! to send forth the infidel
savage-
against whom? against your Protestant brethren; to
lay waste their country, to desolate their dwellings,
and extirpate their race and name, with these horri-
ble hell-hounds of savage war!-hell-hounds, I say, of
savage war. Spain armed herself with blood-hounds
to extirpate the wretched natives of America; and
we improve on the inhuman example even of Spanish
cruelty: we turn loose these savage hell hounds against
our brethren and countrymen in America, of the
same language, laws, liberties, and religion; endear-
ed to us by every tie that should sanctify humanity.
My lords, this awful subject, so important to our
honour, our constitution, and our religion, demands
the most solemn and effectual inquiry. And I again
call upon your lordships, and the united powers of
the state, to examine it thoroughly and decisively,
and to stamp upon it an indelible stigma of the public
abhorrence. And I again implore those holy pre-
lates of our religion, to do away these iniquities from
among us. Let them perform a lustration; let them
purify the house, and the country, from this deadly sin
My lords, I am old and weak and at present un-
able to say more; but my feelings and indignation
were too strong to have said less. I could not have
glept this night in my bed, nor reposed my head on
my pillow, without giving this vent to my eternal ab-
horrence of such preposterous and enormous princi-
ples.

HAMLET'S ADVICE TO THE PLAYERS.
SHAKSPEARE.
Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it
to you; trippingly on the tongue. But if you mouth
it, as many of our players do, I had as lief the town
crier had spoken my lines. And do not saw the air
too much with your hands; but use all gently: For
in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and be-
get a temperance that may give it smoothness. Oh!
it offends me to the soul, to hear a robustious, perri-
wig pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to very
rags, to split the ears of the groundlings; who (for
the most part) are capable of nothing but inexplica-
ble dumb shows and noise. Pray you avoid it.
Be not too tame, neither; but let your own discre-
tion be your tutor. Suit the action to the word, the
word to the action; with this special observance, that
you overstep not the modesty of nature; for any thing so
overdone is from the purpose of playing; whose end
is—to hold, as 'twere, the mirror up to nature; to
show virtue her own feature, scorn her own image,
and the very age and body of the time, his form and
pressure. Now, this overdone, or come tardy off,
though it make the unskilful laugh, cannot but make
the judicious grieve; the censure of one of which
must, in your allowance, overweigh a whole theatre
of others: Oh! there be players that I have seen
play, and heard others praise, and that highly, that,
neither having the accent of Christian, nor the gait
of christian, pagan nor man, have so strutted and
bellowed, that I have thought some of Nature's jour-
neymen had made men, and not made them well, they
imitated humanity so abominably.

Those lips are thine-ihy own sweet smile I see,
The
same,
that oft in childhood solac'd me;
Voice only fails, else how distinct they say,
Grieve not my child, chase all thy fears away!
The meek intelligence of those dear eyes
(Blest be the art that can immortalize,
The art that baffles Time's tyrannick claim
To quench it) here shines on me still the same.
Faithful remembrancer of one so dear,
O welcome guest, though unexpected here!
Who bidd'st me honour with an artless song,
Affectionate, a mother lost so long.
I will obey, not willingly alone,
But gladly, as the precept were her own:
And, while that face renews my filial grief,
Fancy shall weave a charm for my relief,
Shall steep me in Elysian reverie,
A momentary dream, that thou art she.
My mother! when I learn'd that thou wast doad,
Say, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed?
Hover'd thy spirit o’er thy sorrowing son,
Wretch even then, life's journey just begun?
Perhaps thou gav'st me, though unfelt, a kiss;
Perhaps a tear, if souls can weep in bliss
Ah that maternal smile-it answers -Yes.
I heard the bell toll’d on thy burial day,
I saw the hearse that bore thee slow away,
And, turning from my nursery window, drew
A long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu!
But was it such?-It was.-Where thou art gone,
Adieus and farewells are a sound unknown.
May I but meet thee on that peaceful shore,
The parting word shall pass my lips no more.
Thy maidens, griev'd themselves at my concern,
Oft gave me promise of thy quick return.
What ardently I wish'd, I long believ'd,
And, disappointed still, was still deceiv'd:
By expectation ev'ry day beguild,
Dupe of to-morrow even from a child,
Thus many a sad to-morrow came and went,

I learn'd at last submission to my lot,
But, though I less deplor'd thee, ne'er forgot.
Where once we dwelt our name is heard no more;
Children not thine have trod my nurs’ry floor;
And where the gard'ner Robin, day by day,
Drew me to school along the public way,
Delighted with my bauble coach, and wrapp'd
In scarlet mantle warm, and velvet capp'd,
'Tis now become a history little known,
That once we call’d the pastoral house our own.
Short-liv'd possession--but the record fair,
That memory keeps of all thy kindness there,
Still outlives many a storm, that has effac'd
A thousand other themes less deeply trac'd.
Thy nightly visits to my chamber made,
That thou might'st know me safe and warmly laid;
Thy morning bounties ere I left my home,
The biscuit, or confectionary plum;
The fragrant waters on my cheeks bestow'd
By thy own hand, till fresh they shone and glow'd;
All this, and more endearing still than all,
Thy constant flow of love, that knew no fall,
Ne'er roughen'd by those cataracts and breaks,
That humour interpos'd too often makes;
All this, still legible in memory's page,
And still to be so to my latest age,
Adds joy to duty, makes me glad to pay
Such honours to thee as my numbers may;
Perhaps a frail memorial, but sincere,
Not scorn'd in Heav'n, though little notic'd here.
Could Time, his flight revers'd, restore the hours,
When, playing with thy vesture's tissu'd flowers,
The violet, the pink, and jessamine,
I prick'd them into paper with a pin,
(And thou wast happier than myself the while,
Would'st softly speak, and stroke my head, and smile)
Could those few pleasant days again appear,
Might one wish bring them, would I wish them here?
I would not trust my heart—the dear delight
Seems so to be desir'd, perhaps I might. -

That I should ill requite thee to constrain
Thy unbound spirit into bonds-again.
Thou, as a gallant bark from Albion's coast
(The storms all weather'd and the ocean cross’d)
Shoots into port at some well-haven'd isle,
Where spices breathe, and brighter seasons smile,
There sits quiescent on the floods, that show
Her beauteous form reflected clear below,
While airs impregnated with incense play
Around her, fanning light her streamers gáy;
So thou, with sails how swift-hast reach'd the shore,
“Where tempests never beat nor billows roar,
And thy lov'd consort on the dangerous tide
Of life long since has anchor'd by thy side.
But me, scarce hoping to attain that rest,
Always from port withheld, always distress'd-
Me howling blasts drive devious, tempest-toss'd,
Sails ripp’d, seams opening wide, and compass lost,
And day by day some current's thwarting force
Sets me more distant from a prosperous course.
Yet O the thought, that thou art safe, and he!
That thought is joy, arrive what may to me.
My boast is not, that I deduce
my
birth
From loins enthron'd, and rulers of the earth;
But higher far my proud pretensions rise-
The son of parents pass'd into the skies.
And now, farewell-Time unrevok'd has run
His wonted course, yet what I wish'd is done.
By contemplation's help, not sought in vain,
I seem'd to have liv'd my childhood o'er again;
To have renew'd the joys that once were mine,
Without the sin of violating thine;
And, while the wings of Fancy still are free,
And I can view this mimick show of thee,
Time has but half succeeded in his theft
Thyself remov'd, thy power to soothe me left.

Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
O'er the grave where our Hero was buried.
We buried him darkly; at dead of night,
The sods with our bayonets turning;
By the struggling moon-beams' misty light,
And the lantern dimly burning.
No useless coffin enclosed his breast,
Nor in sheet nor in shroud we wound him;)
But he lay-like a warrior taking his resta
With his martial cloak around him!
Few and short were the prayers we said,
And we spoke not a word of sorrow;
But we steadfastly gazed on the face of the dead,
And we bitterly thought of the morrow
We thought—as we hollowed his narrow bed,
And smoothed down his lonely pillow-
How the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his
And we far away on the billow!

And o'er his cold ashes upbraid him;
But nothing he'll reck, if they let him sleep on
In the grave where a Briton has laid him."

When the clock tolled the hour for retiring,
And we heard the distant and random
gun,
That the fue was suddenly firing-
Slowly and sadly we laid him down,
From the field of his fame fresh and gory!
We carved not a line, we raised not a stone,
But we left him-alone with his glory!

Each mother held aloft her child
To bless the bow of God.
Methinks, thy jubilee to keep,
The first-made anthem rang
On earth deliver'd from the deep,
And the first poet sang.
Nor ever shall the muse's eye
Unraptured greet thy beam:
Theme of primeval prophecy,

The lark thy welcome sings,
Where glittering in the freshen’d fields
The snowy mushroom springs.
How glorious is thy girdle cast
O’er mountain, tower, and town,
Or mirror'd in the ocean vast,
A thousand fathoms down!
As fresh in yon horizon dark,
As young thy beauties seem,

First sported in thy beam.

Nor lets the type grow pale with age

And all went merry as a marriage bell;
But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising

To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet-
But hark!—that heavy sound breaks in once more,
As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!
Arm! Arm! it is it is the cannon's opening roar!

And caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear:

Which stretch'd his father on a bloody bier,
And rous'd the vengeance blood alone could quell:

And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,
And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago
Blush'd at the praise of their own loveliness;
And there were sudden partings, such as press
The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
Which ne'er 'might be repeated; who could guess
If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,
Since upon nights so sweet such awful morn could

And there was mounting in hot haste: the steed,
The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,
Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,
And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;

When be himself might his quietus make,
With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
To
groan
and sweat under a weary life,
But that the dread of something after death,
That undiscovered country, from whose bourne
No traveller returns!-puzzles the will;
And makes us rather bear those ills we have,
Than fly to others that we know not of.
Thus, conscience does make cowards of us all:
And thus, the native hue of resolution
Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought;
And enterprises of great pith and moment,
With this regard, their currents turn awry,
And lose the name of action!

ATHENÆUM.
[He fell in an attack upon the Turkish Camp at Laspi, the site of the
ancient Platae, August 20, 1823, and expired in the moment of
victory. His last words were~" To die for liberty is a pleasure
and not a pain.”]
At midnight, in his guarded tent,
The Turk was dreaming of the hour,
When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,
Should tremble at his
power;
In dreams, through camp and court, he bore
The trophies of a conqueror;
In dreams his song of triumph heard;
Then wore his monarch's signet ring,

Then pressed that monarch's throne,-a king;
As wild his thoughts, and gay of wing,
As Eden's garden bird.
An hour passed on-the Turk awoke:
That bright dream was his last;
He woke-to hear his sentry's shriek,
“To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!"
He woke-to die midst flame and smoke,
And shout, and groan, and sabre stroke,
And death shots falling thick and fast
As lightnings from the mountain cloud;
And heard, with voice as trumpet loud,
Bozzaris cheer his band;
“Strike-till the last armed foe expires,
Strike-for your altars and your fires,
Strike-for the green graves of your sires,
God—and your native land!”
They fought-like brave men, long and well,
They piled that ground with Moslem slain,
They conquered—but Bozzaris fell,
Bleeding at every vein.
His few surviving comrades saw
His smile when rang their proud hurrah,
And the red field was won;
Then saw in death his eyelids close
Calmly, as to a night's repose,
Like flowers at set of sun.
Come to the bridal chamber, Death!
Come to the mother, when she feels
For the first time her first-born's breath;-
Come when the blessed seals
Which close the pestilence are broke,
And crowded cities wail its stroke;
Come in consumption's ghastly form,
The earthquake shock, the ocean storm;-
Come when the heart beats high and warm,
With banquet-song, and dance, and wine,
And thou art terrible: the tear,
The groan, the kanell, the pall, the bier,

LAVINIA.
THOMPSON:
The lovely young Lavinia once had friends;
And fortune smil'd deceitful on her birth;
For, in her helpless years depriv'd of all
—
Of every stay-save innocence and Heaven,
She, with her widow'd mother, feeble, old,
And
poor, lived in a cottage, far retir’d
Among the windings of a woody vale:
By solitude and deep surrounding shades,
But more by bashful modesty conceald.
Together thus they shunn'd the cruel scorn
Which virtue, sunk to poverty, would meet
From giddy passion, and low-minded pride;
Almost on Nature's common bounty fed;
Like the gay birds that sung them to repose,
Content, and careless of to-morrow's fare.
Her form was fresher than the morning rose,
When the dew wets its leaves; unstain’d and pure,
As is the lily, or the mountain snow:
The modest virtues mingled in her eyes,
Still, on the ground dejected, darting all
Their humid beams into the blooming flowers:

Or, when the mournful tale her mother told,
Of what her faithless fortune promis'd once,
Thrill'd in her thought, they, like the dewy star
Of evening, shone in tears.
A native grace
Sat fair-proportion'd on her polish'd limbs,
Veil'd in a simple robe, their best attire,
Beyond the pomp of dress; for loveliness
Needs not the foreign aid of ornament,
But is, when unadorn'd, adorn’d the most.
Thoughtless of beauty, she was beauty's self,
Recluse amid the close-embowering woods.
As in the hollow breast of Appenine,
Beneath the shelter of encircling hills,
A myrtle rises, far from human eye,
And breathes its balmy fragrance o'er the wild;
So flourish'd, blooming, and unseen by all,
The sweet Lavinia; till at length compelld
By strong Necessity's supreme command,
With smiling patience in her looks, she went
To glean Palemon's fields. The pride of swains
Palemon was, the generous and the rich;
Who led the rural life in all its joy
And elegance, such as Arcadian song
Transmits from ancient uncorrupted times,
When tyrant custom had not shackled man,
But free to follow Nature was the mode.
He then his fancy with autumnal scenes
Amusing, chanc'd beside his reaper-train
To walk, when poor Lavinia drew his eye,
Unconscious of her power, and turning quick
· With unaffected blushes from his gaze:
He saw her charming, but he saw not half
The charms her downcast modesty conceal'd.
That very moment love and chaste desire
Sprung in his bosom, to himself unknown;
For still the world prevail’d, and its dread laugh,
Which scarce the firm philosopher can scorn,
Should his heart own a gleaner in the field;
And thus in secret to his soul he sigh’d:
“What pity, that so delicate a form,

And more than vulgar goodness seem to dwell,
Should be devoted to the rude embrace
Of some indecent clown! She looks, methinks,
Of old Acasto's line; and to my mind
Recals that patron of my happy life,
From whom my liberal fortune took its rise;
Now to the dust gone down; his houses, lands,
And once fair-spreading family, dissolv'd!
'Tis said that in some lone obscure retreat,
Urg'd by remembrance sad, and decent pride,
Far from those scenes which knew their better days,
His aged widow and his daughter live,
Whom yet my fruitless search could never find:
Romantic wish! would this the daughter were!”
When, strict inquiring, from herself he found
She was the same, the daughter of his friend,
Of bountiful Acasto! who can speak
The mingled passions that surpris'd his heart,
And through his nerves in shivering transport ran!
Then blaz'd his smother'd flame, avow'd, and bold;
And as he view'd her, ardent, o'er and o'er,
Love, gratitude, and pity, wept at once.
Confus’d, and frighten'd at his sudden tears,
Her rising beauties flush'd a higher bloom,
As thus Palemon, passionate and just,
Pour'd out the pious rapture of his soul:
"And art thou then Acasto's dear remains?
She, whom my restless gratitude has sought
So long in vain? O heavens! the very same,
The soften’d image of my noble friend,
Alive his every look, his every feature,
More elegantly touch'd. Sweeter than Spring!

Oh, let me now into a richer soil
Transplant thee safe! where vernal suns, and showers,

And of my garden be the pride and joy!
Ill it befits thee, oh it ill befits
Acasto's daughter-his, whose open stores,
Though vast, were little to his ampler heart-
The father of a country! thus to pick
The
very refuse of those harvest fields
Which from his bounteous friendship I enjoy.
Then throw that shameful pittance from thy hand,
But ill-applied to such a rugged task;
The fields, the master, all, my fair, are thine;
If to the various blessings which thy house
Has on me lavish'd, thou wilt add that bliss,
That dearest bliss, the power of blessing thee!”
Here ceas'd the youth: yet still his speaking eye
Express’d the sacred triumph of his soul,
With conscious virtue, gratitude, and love,
Above the vulgar joy divinely rais'd.
Nor waited he reply. Won by the charm
Of goodness irresistible, and all
In sweet disorder lost, she blush'd consent-
The news immediate to her mother brought,
While pierc'd with anxious thought, she pin'd away
The lonely moments for Lavinia's fate.
Amaz’d, and scarce believing what she heard,
Joy seiz'd her wither'd veins, and one bright gleam
Of setting life shone on her evening hours:
Not less enraptur'd than the happy pair;
Who flourish'd long in tender bliss, and rear'd
A numerous offspring, lovely like themselves,
And good, the grace of all the country round.

Then, in thy soul's deep silence, and the depth
Of Nature's silence, midnight, thus inquire,
As I have done; and shall inquire no more.
In Nature's channel, thus the questions run.
What am I? and from whence?-I nothing know,
But that I am; and, since I am, conclude
Something eternal: had there e'er been nought,
Nought still had been: eternal there must be.
But what eternal ?—Why not human race,
And Adam's ancestors without an end?-
That's hard to be conceiv'd; since every link
Of that long-chain'd succession is so frail;
Can
every part depend, and not the whole?
Yet grant it true, new difficulties rise;
I'm still quite out at sea, nor see the shore.
Whence earth and these bright orbs?-eternal too!
Grant matter was eternal; still these orbs
Would want some other father; much design
Is seen in all their motions, all their makes;
Design implies intelligence, and art:
That can't be from themselves—or man; that art
Man scarce can comprehend could man bestow?
And nothing greater, yet allow'd, than man.-
Who, motion, foreign to the smallest grain,
Shot through vast masses of enormous weight?
Who bade brute matter's restive lump assume
Such various forms and gave it wings to fly?
Has matter innate motion? then each atom,
Asserting its indisputable right
To dance, would form a universe of dust:
Has matter none? Then whence these glorious forms,
And boundless flights, from shapeless, and repos’d?
Has matter more than motion? Has it thought,
Judgment and genius? Is it deeply learned
In mathematics; Has it fram'd such laws,
Which, but to guess, a Newton made immortal?-
If art, to form, and counsel, to conduct
And that with greater far than human skill,
Resides not in each block;~a Godhead reigns.
And, if a God there is, that God how great!

THE TENT SCENE BETWEEN BRUTUS
AND CASSIUS.
SHAKSPEARE.
Cassius. That you have wronged me, doth appear
in this:
You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella,
For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
Wherein, my letters (praying on his side,
Because I knew the man) were slighted of.
Brutus. You wronged yourself, to write in such a
case.
Cas. At such a time as this, it is not meet
That every nice offence, should bear its comment.
Bru. Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
Are much condemned to have an itching palm;
To sell and mart your offices for gold,
To undeservers.
Cas. I an itching palm?
You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
Bru. The name of Cassius honours this corruption,
And chastisement doth therefore hide its head.
Cas. Chastisement!
Bru. Remember March, the ides of March re-
member!
Did not great Julius bleed for justice sake?
What villain touched his body, that did stab,
And not for justice?-What, shall one of us,
That struck the foremost man of all this world,
But for supporting robbers:-shall we now
Contaminate our fingers with base bribes?
And sell the mighty space of our large honours,
For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
Than such a Roman.
Cas. Brutus, bay not me:
I'll not endure it. You forget yourself,
To hedge me in: I am a soldier, I,
Older in practice, abler than yourself
To make conditions.
Bru. Go to! you're not, Cassius.
Cas. I am.

Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further:

Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
Cas. Oye Gods! ye Gods! must I endure all this!
Bru. All this? Ay, more. Fret till your proud
heart break:
Go, show your slaves how cholerick you are,
And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch
Under your testy humour? By the gods,
You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
Though it do split you; for, from this day forth;
I'll use you for my mirth; yea, for my laughter,
When you are waspish.
Cas. Is it come to this?
Bru. You say you are a better soldier;
Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
And it shall please me well. For mine own part,
I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
Cas. You wrong me every way; you wrong me,
Brutus;
I said an elder soldier, not a better.
Did I say better?
Bru. If you did, I care not.
Cas. When Cæsar lived, he durst not thus have
moved me.

A friend should bear a friend's infirmities;
But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
Bru. I do not, till you practise them on me.

Cas. A friendly eye could never see such faults.
Bru. A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
As huge as high Olympus.
Cas. Come Antony! and young Octavius, come!
Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius:
For Cassius is a-weary of the world:-
Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
Checked like a bondman; all his faults observed,
Set in a note book, learned and conned, by rote,
To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
My spirit from mine eyes!—There is my dagger,
And here my naked breast—within, a heart
Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold;
If that thou be’st a Roman take it forth:
I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart.

That carries anger, as the flint bears fire;
Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,

To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,

He brings to aid his murderous hand.
Sold. Bold words! But, though the beast of game
The privilege of chase may claim;
Though space and law the stag we lend,
Ere hound we slip, or bow we bend,
Who ever cared where, how, or when
The prowling fox was trapped or slain?
Thus treacherous scouts, yet sure they lie,
Who say thou com’st a secret spy.
James. They do, by heaven! Come Roderick Dhu,
And of his clan the boldest two,
And, let me but till morning rest,
I'll write the falsehood on their crest.
Sold. If by the blaze I mark aright,
Thou bear'st the belt and spur of knight.
James. Then by these tokens may'st thou know
Each proud oppressor's mortal foe,
Sold. Enough, enough; sit down and share
A soldier's couch, a soldier's ſare.
[They sit down and eat together, and in a few moments
the soldier continues the conversation.]
Sold. Stranger, I am to Roderick Dhu
A clansman born, a kinsman true;
Each word against his honour spoke
Demands of me avenging stroke.
It rests with me to wind my horn,
Thou art with numbers overborne;
It rests with me, here, brand to brand,
Worn as thou art, to bid thee stand;
But not for clan, nor kindred's cause,
Will I depart from honour's laws.
To assail a wearied man were shame,
And Stranger is a holy name.
Guidance and rest, and food and fire
In vain he never must require.
Myself will guide thee on the way,
Through watch and ward till break of day,
As far as Coilantogle ford;
From thence thy warrant is thy sword.

As freely as 'tis nobly given.

Without a pass from Roderick Dhu?
James. Brave man, my pass, in danger tried,
Hangs in my belt, and by my side.
Yet sooth to tell, though nought I dread,
I dreamed not now to claim its aid.
When here but three days since I came,
Bewildered in pursuit of game,
All seemed as peaceful and as still,
As the mist slumbering on yon hill.
Thy dangerous chief was then afar,
Nor soon expected back from war;
Thus said, at least, my mountain guidé,
Tho' deep, perchance, the villain lied.
Sold. Yet, why a second venture try?
James. A warrior thou and ask me why?
Perhaps I sought to drive away
The lazy hours of peaceful day; 6,
Slight cause will then suffice to guide
A knight's free footsteps far and wide;
A falcon flown, a grey-hound strayed,
The merry glance of mountain maid;
Or, if a path be dangerous known,
The danger's self is lure alone.
Sold. Thy secret keep; I urge thee not,
Yet, ere again you sought this spot,
Say, heard you not of lowland war,
Against Clan Alpine raised by Mar?
James. No, by my word; of bands prepared
To guard king James's sports I heard;
Nor doubt I aught, but, when they hear
This muster of the Mountaineer,
Their
pennons will abroad be flung,
Which else in Doune had peaceful hung.
Sold. Free be they flung! for we are loath
Their silken folds should feed the moth.
Free be they flung! as free shall wave
Clan Alpine's pine in banner brave.
But, stranger, peaceful since you came,

Whence the bold boast by which we know
Vich Alpine's vowed and mortal foe?
James. Warrior, but yester morn, I knew
Nought of thy chieftain, Roderick Dhu,
Save as an exild, desperate man,
The chief of a rebellious clan,
Who in the regent's court and sight,
With ruffian dagger stabbed a knight.
Yet this alone should from his part
Sever each true and loyal heart.
Sold. Frowning, and both rising hastily] And
heard'st thou why he drew his blade?
Heard'st thou, that shameful word and blow
Brought Roderick's vengeance on his foe?
What recked the chieftain, if he stood
On Highland heath or Holy Rood?
He rights such wrong where it is given,
Though it were in the court of heaven.
James. Still it was outrage; yet 'tis true,
Not then claimed sovereignty his due,
The young king, mewed in Šterling tower,
Was stranger to respect and power.
But then thy chieftain's robber life,
Winning mean prey by causeless strife,
Wrenching from ruined lowland swain
His flocks and harvest reared in vain
Methinks a soul, like thine, should scorn
The spoils from such foul conflict borne.
Sold. Saxon, from yonder mountain high,
I marked thee send delighted eye,
O'er waving fields and pastures green,
With gentle slopes, and groves between;
These fertile plains, that softened vale
Were once the birthright of the Gael.
The Saxons came with iron hand,
And from our fathers reft the land.

Free hadst thou been to come and go ,
But secret path marks secret foe.

Fresh cause of enmity avow,
To chafe thy mood and cloud thy brow.
Enough, I am by promise tied
To match me with this man of pride.
Twice have I sought Clan Alpine's glen
In peace; but, when I come again,

Nature's soft nurse! how have I frighted thee,
That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down,
And steep my senses in forgetfulness?
Why rather, Sleep, liest thou in oky cribs,
Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee,
And hushed with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,
Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,
Under the canopies of costly state,
And lulled with sounds of sweetest melody?
Othou dull god! why liest thou with the vile
In loathsome beds, and leav'st the kingly couch,
A watch-case to a common larum-bell?

Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast,
Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
In cradle of the rude imperious surge,
And, in the visitation of the winds,
Who take the ruffian billows by the top,
Curling their monstrous heads, and hanging them
With deafʼning clamours in the slippery shrouds,
That with the hurly, death itself awakes:
Canst thou, O partial Sleep! give thy repose
To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,
And in the calmest and the stillest night,
With all appliances and means to boot,
Deny it to a king ?-Then happy, lowly clown-
Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
DIALOGUE BETWEEN HAMLET AND HORATIO.

Horatio. Hail to your lordship!
Hamlet. I am glad to see you well:
Horatio—or I do forget myself

Hor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant
ever.
Ham. Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name
with you.
And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?
Hor. A truant disposition, good my lord.
Ham. I would not hear your enemy say so;
Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
To make it truster of your own report
Against yourself. I know, you are no truant.
But what is your affair in Elsinore?
We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
Hor. My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
Ham. I pray thee do not mock me, fellow-student;
I think it was to see my mother's wedding.

Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.

Hor. Two nights together had these gentlemen,
Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
In the dead waist and middle of the night,
Been thus encountered: a figure, like your father,
Armed at point exactly, cap-à-piè,
Appears before them, and, with solemn march,
Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walked
By their oppressed and fear-surprised eyes,
Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
Stand dumb, and speak not to him. This to me,
In dreadful secrecy, impart they did;
And I with them, the third night, kept the watch:
Where, as they had delivered, both in time,
Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
The apparition comes. I knew your father;
These hands are not more like.
Ham. But where was this?
Hor. My lord, upon the platform where we
watched.
Ham. Did you not speak to it?
Hor. My lord, I did;
But answer made it none. Yet once, methought,
It lifted
up its head, and did address
Itself to motion, like as it would speak:
But, even then, the morning cock crew loud;

To let

In sorrow than in anger.

Hor. I warrant 'twill.
Ham. If it assume my noble father's person,
I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape,
And bid me hold my peace. I pray you, Sir,
If you have hitherto concealed this sight,
Let it be tenable in your silence still;
And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
Give it an understanding, but no tongue;
I will requite your love: so, fare you well.

PARABLE OF THE PRODIGAL SON.
A certain man had two sons; and the younger of
them said unto his father, "Father, give me the por-
tion of goods that falleth to me.” And he divided
unto them bis living. And, not many days after, the
younger son gathered all together, and took his
journey into a far country, and there wasted his sub-
stance with riotous living. And, when he had spent
all, there arose a mighty famine in that land; and he
began to be in want. And he went and joined him-
self to a citizen of that country; and he sent him into
his fields to feed swine. And he would fain have
filled himself with the husks that the swine did eat;
but no man gave unto him.
And, when he came to himself, he said, “How
many hired servants of my father's have bread
enough, and to spare;—and I perish with hunger! -
I will arise, and go to my father, and will say unto
him-Father, I have sinned against heaven, and be-
fore thee, and am no more worthy to be called thy
son: make me as one of thy hired servants.
And he arose, and came to his father. But, when he
was yet a great way off, his father saw him, and had
compassion, and ran, and ſell on his neck, and kissed
him. And the son said unto him, “Father, I have
sinned against heaven, and in thy sight, and am no
more worthy to be called thy son.” But the father
said to his servants, “ Bring forth the best robe, and
put it on him; and put a ring on his hand, and shoes
on his feet;—and bring hither the fatted calf, and
kill it; and let us eat, and be merry: for this, my
son, was dead, and is alive again;-he was lost, and
is found.”
Now his elder son was in the field--and as he
came and drew nigh to the house, he heard music
and dancing And he called one of the servants,
and asked what these things meant. And he said

unto him, “ Thy brother is come; and thy father hath
killed the fatted calf, because he hath received him
safe and sound.
And he was angry; and would not go in: therefore
came his father out and entreated him. And he, an-
swering, said to his father, “Lo, these many years
have I served thee, neither transgressed I, at any
time, thy commandment; and yet-thou never gavest
me a kid, that I might make merry with my friends:
But, as soon as this thy son
was come, who hath
devoured thy living with harlots, thou hast killed for
him the fatted calf.”
And the father said unto him "Son, thou art
ever with me; and all that I have is thine. It was
meet that we should make merry and be glad; for
this—thy brother-was dead, and is alive again; and
was lost, and is found.”
Character of John Playfair, Professor of Natural Phi-
losophy in the University of Edinburgh.
JEFFREY.
It has struck many people, we believe, as very
extraordinary, that so eminent a man as Mr. Play-
fair should have been allowed to sink into his grave
in the midst of us, without calling forth almost so
much as an attempt to commemorate his merit, even
in a common newspaper; and that the death of a
man so celebrated and beloved, and at the same time
so closely connected with many who could well ap-
preciate and suitably describe his excellencies, should
be left to the brief and ordinary notice of the daily
obituary. No event of the kind certainly ever excited
more general sympathy; and no individual, we are
persuaded, will be longer or more affectionately re-
membered by all the classes of his fellow-citizens:
and yet it is to these very circumstances that we must
look for an explanation of the apparent ne glect with
which his memory has been followed.
We beg leave to assure our readers, that it is
merely from an anxiety to do something to gratify

C
this natural impatience, that we presume to enter at
all upon a subject, to which we are perfectly aware,
that we are incapable of doing justice. For, of Mr.
Playfair's scientific attainments—of his proficiency
in those studies to which he was peculiarly devoted,
we are but slenderly qualified to judge; but, we be-
lieve, we hazard nothing in saying that he was one
of the most learned mathematicians of his age, and
among the first, if not the very first, who introduced
the beautiful discoveries of the later continental geo-
meters to the knowledge of his countrymen,
and gave
their just and true place, in the scheme of European
knowledge, to those important improvements by
which the whole aspect of the abstract sciences has
been renovated since the days of our illustrious
Newton.
If he did not signalize himself by any brilliant or
original invention, he must at least be allowed to have
been a most generous and intelligent judge of the
achievements of others, as well as the most eloquent
expounder of that great and magnificent system of
knowledge which has been gradually evolved by the
successive labours of so many gifted individuals. He
possessed, indeed, in the highest degree, all the cha-
racteristics both of a fine and a powerful under-
standing—at once penetrating and vigilant—but more
distinguished, perhaps, for the caution and sureness
of its march, than for the brilliancy or rapidity of its
movements—and guided and adorned through all its
progress by the most genuine enthusiasm for all that
is grand, and the justest taste for all that is beautiful,
in the truth or the intellectual energy with which he
was habitually conversant.
Mr. Playfair was not merely a teacher; and has
fortunately left behind him a variety of works, from
which other generations may be enabled to judge of
some of those qualifications which so powerfully re-
commended and endeared him to his contemporaries.
It is, perhaps, to be regretted that so much of his
time, and so large a proportion of his publications,
should have been devoted to the subjects of the In-

dian Astronomy, and the Huttonian Theory of the
Earth. For though nothing can be more beautiful
or instructive than his speculations on those curious
topics, it cannot be dissembled that their results are
less conclusive and satisfactory than might have been
desired; and that his doctrines, from the very nature
of their subjects, are more questionable than we be-
lieve they could possibly have been on any
other
topic in the whole circle of the sciences.
A juster estimate of Mr. Playfair's talent, and a
truer picture of his genius and understanding, is to
be found in his other writings; in the papers, both
biographical and scientific, with which he has en-
riched the transactions of our Royal Society ;-his
account of De Laplace, and other articles which he
is said to have contributed to the Edinburgh Review
-the Outlines of his Lectures on Natural Philoso-
phy—and, above all, his Introductory Discourse to
the Supplement to the Encyclopædia Britannica,
with the final correction of which he was occupied up
to the last moments that the progress of disease al-
lowed him to dedicate to any intellectual exertion.
With reference to these works, we do not think we
are influenced by any national, or other partiality,
when we say that he was certainly one of the best
writers of his age; and even that we do not now re-
collect any one of his contemporaries who was so
great a master of composition. There is a certain
mellowness and richness about his style, which
adorns, without disguising the weight and nervous-
ness, which is its other great characteristic-a se-
date gracefulness and manly simplicity in the more
level passages—and a mild majesty and considerate
enthusiasm where he rises above them, of which we
scarcely know where to find any other example.
There is great equability, too, and sustained force,
in every part of his writings, He never exhausts
himself in flashes and epigrams, nor languishes into
tameness or insipidity; at first sight you would say,
that plainness and good sense were the predominat-
ing qualities; but, by the by, this simplicity is en-

riched with the delicate and vivid colours of a fine
imagination—the free and forcible touches of a pow-
erful intellect—and the lights and shades of an un-
erring, harmonizing taste. In comparing it with the
styles of his most celebrated contemporaries, we
would say that it was more purely and peculiarly a
written style—and, therefore, rejected those orna-
ments that more properly belong to oratory.
It had no impetuosity, hurry, or vehemence-no
bursts, or sudden turns, or' abruptness, like that of
Burke; and though eminently smooth and melodious,
it was not modulated to a uniform system of solemn
declamation, like that of Johnson, nor spread out in
the richer and more voluminous elocution of Stewart;
nor still less broken into that patch-work of scholas-
tic pedantry and conversational smartness , which
has found its admirers in Gibbon. It is a style, in
short, of great freedom, force, and beauty; but the
deliberate style of a man of thought and of learning;
and neither that of wit, throwing out his extempores
with an affectation of careless grace—nor of a rhe-
torician, thinking more of his manner than his mat-
ter, and determined to be admired for his expression,
whatever may be the fate of his sentiments.
But we need dwell no longer on qualities that may
be gathered hereafter from the works he has left be-
hind him. They who lived with him mourn the most
for those which will be traced in no such memorial;
and prize, far above these talents which gained him
his high name in philosophy, that personal charac-
ter which endeared him to his friends, and shed a
grace and dignity over all the society in which he
moved. The same admirable taste which is con-
spicuous in his writings, or rather, the higher princi-
ples from which that taste was but an emanation,
spread a similar charm over his whole life and con-
versation, and gave to the most learned philosopher
of his day, the manners and deportment of the most
perfect gentleman.
Nor was this in him the result merely of good
sense and good temper, assisted by an early famili-

arity with good company, and a consequent knowl-
edge of his own place and that of all around him. His
good breeding was of a higher descent; and his pow-
ers of pleasing rested on something better than mere
companionable qualities. With the greatest kindness
and generosity of nature, he united the most manly
firmness, and the highest principles of honour; and
the most cheerful and social dispositions, with the
gentlest and steadicst affections.
Towards women he had always the most chival-
rous feelings of regard and attention, and was, be-
yond almost all men, acceptable and agreeable in
their society--though without the least levity or pre-
tension unbecoming his age or condition. And such,
indeed, was the fascination of the perfect simplicity
and mildness of his manners, that the same tone or
deportment seemed equally appropriate to all socie-
ties, and enabled him to delight the young and the
gay with the same sort of conversation which in-
structed the learned and the grave. There never,
indeed, was a man of learning and talent who appear-
ed in society so perfectly free from every sort of pre-
tension or notion of his own importance, or so little
solicitous to distinguish himself, or so sincerely will-
ing to give place to every one else.
Even upon subjects which he had thoroughly
studied, he was never in the least impatient to speak,
and spoke at all times without any tone of authority;
while, so far from wishing to set off what he had to
say by any brilliancy or emphasis of expression, it
seemed generally as if he had tried to disguise the
weight and originality of his thoughts under the
plainest form of speech, and the most quiet and in-
different manner; so that the profoundest remarks
and subtlest observations were often dropped, not
only without any solicitude that their value should
be observed, but without any apparent consciousness
that they possessed any:
Though the most social of human beings, and the
most disposed to encourage and sympathize with the
gayety of others, his own spirits were in general

am
T
rather cheerful than gay, or at least never rose to
any
turbulence or tumult of merriment: and while he
would listen with the kindest indulgence to the more
extravagant sallies of his younger friends, and prompt
them by the heartiest approbation, his own satisfac-
tion might generally be traced in a slow and tem-
perate smile, gradually mantling over his benevolent
and intelligent features, and lighting up the counte-
nance of the sage with the expression of the mildest
and most gentle philanthropy.
It was wonderful, indeed, considering the measure
of his own intellect, and the rigid and undeviating
propriety of his own conduct, how tolerant he was of
the errours and defects of other men. He was too
indulgent, in truth, and favourable to his friends-
and made a kind and liberal allowance for the faults
of all mankind-except only faults of baseness or of
cruelty-against which he never failed to manifest
the most open scorn and detestation. Independent,
in short, of his high attainments, Mr. Playfair was
one of the most amiable and estimable of men.
De-
lightful in his manners-inflexible in his principles-
and generous in his affections, he had all that could
charm in society, or attach in private: and while his
friends enjoyed the free and unstudied conversation
of an easy and intelligent associate, they had at all
times the proud and inward assurance that he was a
being upon whose perfect honour and generosity
they might rely with the most implicit confidence, in
life and in death,—and of whom it was equally im-
possible, that, under any circumstances, he should
ever perform a mean, a selfish, or a questionable ac-
tion, as that his body should cease to gravitate, or
his soul to live !
If we do not greatly deceive ourselves, there is
nothing here of exaggeration or private feeling-and
nothing with which an indifferent and honest chroni-
cler would not concur. Nor is it altogether idle to
have dwelt so long on the personal character of this
distinguished individual; for we are ourselves per-
suaded, that this personal character has almost done

as much for the cause of science and philosophy
among us, as the great talents and attainments with
which it was combined—and has contributed, in a
very eminent degree, to give to the better society in
which he moved, that tone of intelligence and libe-
rality by which it is honorably distinguished.
It is not a little advantageous to philosophy that it
is in fashion—and it is still more advantageous, per-
haps, to the society which is led to confer on it this
apparently trivial distinction.
It is a great thing for
the country at large—for its happiness, its prosperity,
and its renown—that the upper and influencing part
of its population should be made familiar, even
in its untasked and social hours, with sound and libe-
ral information, and be taught to respect those who
have distinguished themselves by intellectual attain-
ments. Nor is it, after all, a slight or despicable
reward for a man of genius to be received with honour
in the highest and most elegant society around him,
and to receive in his living person that homage and
applause which is too often reserved for his memory.

Edw. Let me have no intruders, and above all
Keep Warwick from my sight.
War. Behold him here;
No welcome guest, it seems, unless I ask
My lord of Suffolk's leave—there was a time
When Warwick wanted not his aid to gain
Admission here.
Edw. There was a time, perhaps
When Warwick more desired and more -deserved it.
War. Never: I have been a foolish, faithful slave;
All
my
best years, the morning of my
life
Hath been devoted to your service: What
Are now the fruits? Disgrace and infamy;

Of calumny had tainted, made the mock

Edw. I thought, my lord, I had full well repaid
Your services with honours, wealth, and power
Unlimited; thy all-directing hand
Guided in secret every latent wheel
Of government, and moved the whole machine;
Warwick was all in all, and powerless Edward
Stood like a cipher in the great account.
War. Who gave that cipher worth, and seated thee
On England's throne? thy undistinquished name
Had rotted in the dust from whence it sprung,
And mouldered in oblivion, had not Warwick
Dug from its sordid mine the useless ore,
And stamped it with a diadem. Thou know'st
This wretched country, doomed perhaps like Rome
To fall by its own self-destroying hand,
Tossed for so many years in the rough sea
Of civil discord, but for me had perished.
In that distressful hour I seized the helm,
Bade the rough wave subside in peace; and steered
Your shattered vessel safe into the harbour.
You may despise perhaps, that useless aid
Which you no longer want; but know, proud youth,
He who forgets a friend, deserves a foe.
Edw. Know too, reproach for benefits received
Pays every debt, and cancels obligation.
War. Why, that indeed is frugal honesty,
A thrifty, saving knowledge; when the debt
Grows burdensome, and cannot be discharged.
A sponge will wipe out all, and cost you nothing.
Edw. When you have counted o'er the numerous
train
Of mighty gifts your bounty lavished on me,
You may remember next the injuries
Which I have done you; let me know them all,
And I will make you ample satisfaction.

Of venal statesmen, shall recal my name
To witness, that they want not an example,
And plead my guilt to sanctify their own.

That haunt your court, could none be found but
Warwick,
To be the shameless herald of a lie?
Edw. And wouldst thou turn the vile reproach on
me?
If I have broke my faith, and stained the name
Of England, thank thy own pernicious counsels,
That urged me to it, and extorted from me
A cold consent to what my heart abhorred.
War. I've been abused, insulted and betrayed;
My injured honour cries aloud for vengeance,-
Her wounds will never close!
Edw. These gusts of passion
Will but inflame them; if I have been right
Informed, my Lord, besides the dangerous fears
Of bleeding honour, you have other wounds
As deep, though not so fatal: such, perhaps,
As none but fair Elizabeth can cure.
War. Elizabeth!
Edw. Nay, start not, I have cause
To wonder most; I little thought indeed
When Warwick told me I might learn to love,
He was himself so able to instruct me.
But I've discovered all.
War. And so have I;
Too well I know thy breach of friendship there,
Thy fruitless, base endeavours to supplant me.
Edw. I scorn it Sir; Elizabeth hath charms,
And I have equal right with you to admire them:
Nor see I ought so godlike in the form,
So all-commanding in the name of Warwick,
That he alone should revel in the charms
Of beauty, and monopolize perfection.
I knew not of your love.

SHAKSPEARE.
Wol. (alone.) Farewell, a long farewell to all my
greatness!
This is the state of man;-to-day he puts forth
The tender leaves of hope, to-morrow blossoms,
And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
And when he thinks, good easy man, full surely,
His greatness is a ripening, nips his shoot,
And then he falls—as I do. I have ventured
Like little wanton boys, that swim on bladders,
These many summers in a sea of glory,
But far beyond my depth; my high-blown pride
At length broke under me, and now
Weary and old with service, to the mercy
Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
Vain pomp and glory of the world, I hate ye.
I feel my heart new opened. O, how wretched
Is that poor man who hangs on princes' favour!
There is betwixt that smile he would aspire to,
That sweet aspect of princes, and his ruin,
More pangs
and fears than war or women have;
And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
Never to hope again.

thy spirit wonder
A great man should decline? Nay, if you weep,

Too heavy for a man that hopes for Heaven!
Crom. I'm glad your grace has made that right use
of it.
Wol. I hope I have: I'm able now, methinks,
Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,
To endure more miseries, and greater far,
Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.
What news abroad?
Crom. The heaviest and the worst
Is your displeasure with the king.
Wol. God bless him.
Crom. The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen
Lord Chancellor in your place.
Wol. That's somewhat sudden-
But he's a learned man. May he continue
Long in his Highness' favour, and do justice
For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,
When he has run his course, and sleeps in blessings,
May have a tomb of orphan's tears wept on him!
What more?
Crom. That Cranmer is returned with welcome;
Installed Lord Archbishop of Canterbury.
Wol. That's news indeed.
Crom. Last that the Lady Anne,
Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,
This day was viewed in open as his queen,
Going to chapel; and the voice is now
Only about her coronation.
Wol. There was the weight that pulled me down,
O Cromwell!
The king has gone beyond me: all my glories
In that one woman I have lost forever!
No sun shall ever usher forth my honours,
Or gild again the noble troops that waited
Upon my smiles. Go get thee from me, Cromwell;
I am a poor, fallen man, unworthy now
To be thy Lord and master. Seek the king,
That sun I pray may never set; I've told him
What and how true thou art; he will advance thee:

Some little memory of me will stir him,
I know his noble nature, not to let
Thy hopeful service perish too. Good Cromwell,
Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
For thine own future safety.
Crom. O my Lord,
Must I'then leave you? Must I needs forego
So good, so noble, and so true a master?
Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,
With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.
The king shall have my service; but my prayers
Forever, and forever, shall be yours.
Wol. Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
In all my miseries, but thou hast forced
Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman-
Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell,
And when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
And sleep in dull, cold marble, where no mention
Of me must more be heard, say then I taught thee--,
Say, Wolsey, that once rode the waves of glory,
And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,
Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in:
A sure and safe one, though thy master missed it.
Mark but my fall, and that which ruined me:
Cromwell I charge thee, fling away ambition;
By that sin fell the angels; how can man then,
Though the image of his maker hope to win by't?
Love thyself last; cherish those hearts that wait thee;
Corruption wins not more than honesty.
Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not,
Let all the ends thou aim'st at, be thy Country's,
Thy God's, and Truth's; then if thou fallist, o Crom-
well,
Thou fall’st a blessed martyr. Serve the king-
And prithee lead me in--

To the last penny-'tis the king's. My robe,
And my integrity to Heaven, are all
I dare now call my own. O Cromwell, Cromwell,

CLARENCE'S DREAM.
SHAKSPEARE.
Brakenbury. Why looks your grace so heavily to-
day?
Clarence. O, I have passed a miserable night,
So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
That, as I am a Christian faithful
man,
I would not spend another such a night,
Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days;
So full of dismal terrour was the time.
Brak. What was your dream, my lord? I pray you
tell me.
Clar. Methought that I had broken from the tower,
And was embarked to cross to Burgundy,
And in my company my brother Gloucester,
Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
Upon the hatches. Thence we looked toward Eng-
land,
And cited up a thousand heavy times,
During the wars of York and Lancaster,
That had befallen us. As we passed along
Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
Methought that Gloucester stumbled, and in falling
Struck me (that sought to stay him) overboard,
Into the tumbling billows of the main.
Lord, Lord, methought, what pain it was to drown!
What dreadful noise of waters in my ears!
What sights of ugly death within mine eyes!
Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
A thousand men that fishes knawed upon;
Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels;
All scattered in the bottom of the sea.

Some lay in dead men's sculls; and in those holes
Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
That wooed the slimy bottom of the deep,
And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by.
Brak. Had you such leisure in the time of death,
To gaze upon
the secret of the deep?
Clar. Methought I had; and often did I strive
To yield the ghost; but still the envious flood
Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
To find the empty, vast, and wandering air;
But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
Brak. Awaked you not with this sore agony?
Clar. O, no, my dream was lengthened after life;
O, then began the tempest of my soul:
I passed, methought, the melancholy flood,
With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
The first that there did greet my stranger-soul,
Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick,
Who cried aloud-__- What scourge of perjury
Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?"
And so he vanished. Then came wandering by
A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
Dabbled in blood, and he shrieked out aloud-
“Clarence is come, false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
That stabbed me in the field by Tewksbury;
Seize on him, furies! take him to your torments!".
With that, methought a legion of foul fiends
Environed me, and howled into mine ears
Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
I trembling waked; and for a season after
Could not believe but that I was in hell;
Such terrible impression made my dream.
Brak. No marvel, lord, that it affrighted you;
I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.
Clar. 0, Brakenbury, I have done those things
That now give evidence against my soul,
For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!

Interview between Waverly and Fergus Mac-Ivor, at
Carlisle, prerious to the execution of the latter.
WAVERLY.
After a sleepless night, the first dawn of morning
found Waverly on the esplanade in front of the old
Gothic gate of Carlisle castle. But he paced it long
in every direction, before the hour when, according
to the rules of the garrison, the gates were opened,
and the drawbridge lowered. He produced his order
to the sergeant of the guard, and was admitted. The
place of Fergus' confinement was a gloomy and
vaulted apartment in the central part of the castle; a
huge old tower, supposed to be of great antiquity,
and surrounded by outworks, seemingly of Henry
VIII's time, or somewhat later. The grating of the
huge old-fashioned bars and bolts, withdrawn for the
purpose of admitting Edward, was answered by the
clash of chains, as the unfortunate chieftain, strongly
and heavily fettered, shuffled along the stone floor of
his prison, to fling himself into his friend's arms.
"My dear Edward,” he said, in a firm and even
cheerful voice, “this is truly kind. I heard of your
approaching happiness with the highest pleasure;
and how does Rose? and how is our old whimsical
friend the Baron? Well, I am sure, from your looks
and how will you settle precedence between the
three ermines passant, and the bear and boot-jack?"
“How, O how, my dear Fergus, can you talk of such
things at such a moment?”—“Why, we have en-
tered Carlisle with happier auspices, to be sure-on
the 16th of November last, for example, when we
marched in, side by side, and hoisted the white flag
on these ancient towers. But I am no boy, to sit

the game boldly, and the forfeit shall be paid man-

you are generous; when you hear of these poor Mac-
Ivors being distressed about their miserable posses-
sions by some harsh overseer or agent of govern-
ment, remember you have worn their tartan, and are
an adopted son of their race. The Baron, who
knows our manners, and lives near our country, will
apprize you of the time and means to be their protec-
tor. Will you promise this to the last Vich lan
Vohr?”–Edward, as may well be believed, pledged
his word; which afterwards he so amply redeemed,
that his memory still lives in these glens by the name
of the Friend of the Sons of Ivor.-"Would to God,”
continued the chieftain, “ I could bequeath to you
my rights to the love and obedience of this primitive
and brave race: or at least, as I have striven to do,
persuade poor Evan to accept of his life upon their
terms; and be to you what he has been to me, the
kindest--the bravest-the most devoted”
The tears which his own fate could not draw forth,
fell fast for that of his foster-brother. “But,” said
he, drying them, “that cannot be. You cannot be
to them Vich Ian Vohr; and these three magic
words," said he, half smiling, “are the only Open
Sesame to their feelings and sympathies; and poor
Evan must attend his foster-brother in death, as he
has done through his whole life.”—“And I am
sure,” said Maccombich, raising himself from the
floor, on which, for fear of interrupting their conver-
sation, he had lain so still, that, in the obscurity of
the apartment, Edward was not aware of his pre-
sence,
“ I am sure Evan never desired norde-
served a better end than just to die with his chief-
tain."
A tap at the door now announced the arrival of
the priest; and Edward retired while he adminis-

An officer appeared, and intimated that the high
sheriff and his attendants waited before the gate of
the castle, to claim the bodies of Fergus Mac-Ivor
and Evan Maccombich: "I come,” said Fergus.
Accordingly, supporting Edward by the arm, and
followed by Evan Dhu and the priest, he moved
down the stairs of the tower, the soldiers bringing
up the rear. The court was occupied by a squad-
ron of dragoons and a battalion of infantry, drawn up
in a hollow square.
Within their ranks was the sledge or hurdle, on
which the prisoners were to be drawn to the place of
execution, about' a mile distant from Carlisle. · It
was painted black, and drawn by a white horse. At
one end of the vehicle sat the executioner, a horrid
looking fellow, as beseemed his trade, with the broad
axe in his hand; at the other end, next the horse,
was an empty seat for two persons. Through the deep
and dark Gothic archway that opened on the draw-
bridge, were seen on horseback the high sheriff and
his attendants, whom the etiquette betwixt the civil
and military power did not permit to come farther.
“ This is well got up for a closing scene,
Fergus, smiling disdainfully as he gazed around
upon the apparatus of terrour. Evan Dhu exclaim-
ed with some eagerness, after looking at the dra-
goons, “These are the very chields that gallopped
off at Gladsmuir ere we could kill a dozen of them.
They look bold enough now, however.” The priest
entreated him to be silent.
The sledge now approached, and Fergus turning
round embraced Waverly, kissed him on each side
of the face, and stepped nimbly into his place.' Evan
sat down by his side. The priest was to follow in
a carriage belonging to his patron, the Catholick
gentleman at whose house Flora resided. As Fer-
gus waved his hand to Edward, the ranks closed
around the sledge, and the whole procession began
to move forward.
There was a momentary stop at the gateway, while
the governour of the castle and the high sheriff went

through a short ceremony, the military officer there
delivering over the persons of the criminals to the
civil power.
“God save King George!” said the
high sheriff. When the formality concluded, Fer-
gus stood erect in the sledge, and with a firm and
steady voice, replied, “God save King James_!”
These were the last words which Waverly heard
him speak.
The procession resumed its march, and the sledge
vanished from beneath the portal, under which it had
stopped for an instant. The dead march, as it is
called, was instantly heard ; and its melancholy
sounds were mingled with those of a muffled peal,
tolled from the neighbouring cathedral. The sound
of the military music died away as the procession
moved on; the sullen clang of the bells was soon
heard to sound alone.
The last of the soldiers had now disappeared from
under the vaulted archway through which they had
been filing for several minutes; the court-yard was
now totally empty, but Waverly still stood there as if
stupified, his eyes fixed upon the dark pass where he
had so lately seen the last glimpse of his friend.At
length, a female servant of the governour, struck
with surprise and compassion at the stupified misery
which his countenance expressed, asked him if he
would not walk into her master's house and sit down?
She was obliged to repeat her question twice ere he
comprehended her; but at length it recalled him to
himself. Declining the courtesy, by a hasty gesture,
he pulled his hat over his eyes, and, leaving the cas-
tle, walked as swiftly as he could through the empty
streets, till he regained his inn; then threw himself
into an apartment and bolted the door.
In about an hour and a half, which seemed an age
of unutterable suspense, the sound of the drums and
fifes, performing a lively air, and the confused mur-
mur of the crowd which now filled the streets, so
lately deserted, apprised him that all was over, and
that the military and populace were returning from
the dreadful scene. I will not attempt to describe
his sensations.

DEATH OF A SPY.
ROB ROY.*
i I shall never forget the delightful sensation with
which I exchanged the dark, smoky, smothering at-
mosphere of the Highland hut, in which we had
passed the night so uncomfortably, for the refresh-
ing fragrance of the morning air, and the glorious
beams of the rising sun, which, from a tabernacle of
purple and golden clouds, were darted full on such a
scene of natural romance and beauty as had never
before greeted my eyes. To the left lay the valley,
down which the Forth wandered on its easterly
course, surrounding the beautiful detached hill, with
all its garland of woods. On the right, amid a pro-
fusion of thickets, knolls, and crags, lay the bed of a
broad mountain lake, lightly curling into tiny waves
by the breath of the morning breeze, each glittering
in its course under the influence of the sunbeams.
High hills, rocks and banks, waving with natural
forests of birch and oak, formed the borders of this
enchanting sheet of water; and, as their leaves rus-
tled to the wind and twinkled in the sun, gave to the
depth of solitude a sort of life and vivacity. Man
alone seemed to be placed in a state of inferiority, in
a scene where all the ordinary features of nature
were raised and exalted.
It was under the burning influence of revenge that
the wife of MacGregor commanded that the hostage,
exchanged for her husband's safety, should be brought
into her presence. I believe her sons had kept this
unfortunate wretch out of her sight, for fear of the
consequences; but if it was so, their humane pre-
caution only postponed his fate. They dragged for-
ward, at her summons, a wretch, already half dead
with terrour, in whose agonized features, I recog-
nised, to my horrour and astonishment, my old ac-
quaintance Morris,
• At the time the celebrated Highland Chieftain, Rob Roy, was
taken prisoner, Morris had been sept as a hostage for his personal
safety, which being violated, excited the wrath so powerfully den

He fell prostrate before the female chief with an
effort to clasp her knees, from which she drew back,
as if his touch had been pollution, so that all he could
do in token of the extremity of his humiliation, was to
kiss the hem of her plaid. I never heard entreaties
for life poured forth with such agony of spirit. The
ecstasy of fear was such, that instead of para-
lyzing his tongue, as on ordinary occasions, it even
rendered him eloquent, and, with cheeks as pale as
ashes, hands compressed in agony, eyes that seemed
to be taking their last look of all mortal objects, he
protested, with the deepest oaths, his total ignorance
of any design on the life of Rob Roy, whom he
swore he loved and honoured as his own soul.-In
the inconsistency of his terrour, he said he was but
the agent of others, and "he muttered the name of -
Rashleigh.--He prayed but for life—for life he would
give all he had in the world;—it was but life he ask-
ed-life, if it were to be prolonged under tortures
and privations;-he asked only breath, though it
should be drawn in the damps of the lowest caverns
of their hills.
It is impossible to describe the scorn, the loathing,
and contempt, with which the wife of MacGregor re-
garded this wretched petitioner for the poor boon of
existence.
"I could have bid you live,” she said, “ had life
been to you the same weary and wasting burden that
it is to me—that it is to every noble and generous
mind.—But you—wretch! you could creep through
the world unaffected by its various disgraces, its in-
effable miseries, its constantly accumulating masses
of crime and sorrow,—you could live and enjoy
yourself, while the noble-minded are betrayed,
while nameless and birthless villains tread on the
neck of the brave and long-descended, you could
enjoy yourself, like a butcher's dog in the shambles,
battening on garbage, while the slaughter of the
brave went on around you! This enjoyment you
shall not live to partake of; you shall die, base
dog, and that before yon cloud has passed over the
sua."

She gave a brief command, in Gaelic, to her at-
tendands, two of whom seized upon the prostrate
suppliant, and hurried him to the brink of a cliff
which overhung the flood. He set up the most pierc-
ing and dreadful cries that fear ever uttered—İ may
well term them dreadful, for they haunted my
sleep for years afterwards. As the murderers,
or executioners, call them as you will, dragged him
along, he recognized me even in that moment of
horrour, and exclaimed, in the last articulate words
I ever heard him utter, “0, Mr. Osbaldistone, save
me!-save me!"
I was so much moved by this horrid spectacle,
that, although in momentary expectation of sharing
his fate, I did attempt to speak in his behalf, but, as
might have been expected, my interference was sternly
disregarded. The victim was held fast by some, while
others, binding a large heavy stone in a plaid, tied
it round his neck, and others again eagerly stripped
him of some part of his dress. Half-naked, and thus
manacled, they hurried him into the lake, there about
twelve feet deep, drowning his last death-shriek with
a loud halloo of vindictive triumph, over which, how-
ever, the yell of mortal agony was distinctly heard.
The heavy burden splashed in the dark-blue waters
of the lake, and the Higblanders, with their pole-
axes and swords, watched an instant, to guard, lest,
extricating himself from the load to which he was
attached, he might have struggled to regain the
shore. But the knot had been securely bound; the
victim sunk without effort; the waters, which his fall
had disturbed, settled calmly over him, and the unit
of that life for which he had pleaded so strongly,
was for ever withdrawn from the sum of human ex-
istence.

On which, (for far the day was spent,)
The western sunbeams now were bent.
The cry they heard, its meaning knew,
Could plain their distant comrades view;
Sadly to Blount did Eustace say,
« Unworthy office here to stay!
No hope of gilded spurs to-day-
But see! look up-on Flodden bent,
The Scottish foe has fired his tent.!!
And sudden, as he spoke,
From the sharp ridges of the hill,
All downward to the bank of Till,
Was wreathed in sable smoke;
Volumed, and vast, and rolling far,
The cloud enveloped Scotland's war,
As down the hill they broke:
Nor martial shout, nor minstrel tone,
Announced their march; their tread alone,
At times one warning trumpet blown,
At times a stifled hum,
Told England, from his mountain throne
King James did rushing come.
Scarce could they hear, or see their foes,
Until at weapon point they close.
They close, in clouds of smoke and dust,
With sword-sway, and with lances thrust;
And such a yell was there,
Of sudden and portentious birth,
As if men fought upon the earth,
And fiends in upper air.
Long looked the anxious squires; their eye
Could in the darkness nought decry.
At length the freshening western blast
Aside the shroud of battle cast;
And, first, the ridge of mingled spears
Above the brightening cloud appears;
And in the smoke the pennons flew,
As in the storm the white sea-mew:
Then marked they dashing broad and far,
The broken billows of the war,
And plumed crests of chieftains brave,

Floating like foam upon the wave;
But nought distinct they see:
Wide raged the battle on the plain;
Spears shook, and falchions flashed amain;
Fell England's arrow-flight like rain;
Crests rose, and stooped, and rose again,
Wild and disorderly:
Yet still Lord Marmion's falcon flew
With wavering flight, while fiercer grew
Around the battle yell.
The Border slogan rent the sky:
A Home! a Gordon! was the cry;
Loud were the clanging blows;
Advanced,- forced back,
-now low, now high,
The pennon sunk and rose:
As bends the bark's mast in the gale,
When rent are rigging, shrouds and sail,
It wavered mid the foes.
No longer Blount the view could bear:
“By heaven, and all its saints! I swear,
I will not see it lost!
Fitz-Eustace, you with lady Clare
May bid your beads, and patter prayer,
I gallop to the host.”
And to the fray he' rode amain,
Followed by all the archer train.
The fiery youth with desperate charge,
Made, for a space, an opening large,
-
The rescued banner rose:-
But darkly closed the war around;
Like pine-tree, rooted from the ground,
It sunk among the foes.
Then Eustace mounted too;-yet staid,
As loath to leave the helpless maid,
When, fast as shaft can fly,
Blood-shot his eyes, his nostrils spread,
The loose rein dangling from his head,
Housing and saddle bloody red,
Lord Marmion's steed rushed by;
And Eustace, maddening at the sight,
A look and sign to Clara cast,

Then plunged into the fight.
Ask me not what the maiden feels,
Left in that dreadful hour alone:
Perchance her reason stoops, or reels;
Perchance a courage, not ber own,
Braces her mind to desperate tone.-
The scattered van of England wheels;
She only said, as loud in air
The tumult roared, “ Is Wilton there?”
They fly, or, maddened by despair,
Fight but to die.—“Is Wilton there?”.
With that, straight up the hill there rode
Two horsemen, drenched with gore,
And in their arms, a helpless load,
A wounded knight they bore.
His hand still strained the broken brand;
His arms were smeared with blood, and sand;
Dragged from among the horses' feet,
With dinted shield, and helmet beat,
The falcon-crest and plumage gone;
Can that be haughty Marmion!....
Young Blount his armour did unlace,
And, gazing on his ghastly face,
Said—“ By Saint George, he's gone!

And see the deep cut on his head!
Good night to Marmion.”-

Of blessed water, from the spring,
To slake my dying thirst?'—

Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,
And variable as the shade
By the light quivering a pen made;
When pain and anguish wring the brow,
A ministering angel thui!-
Scarce were the piteous accents said,
When, with the Baron's casque, the maid
To the nigh streamlet ran:
Forgot were hatred, wrongs, and fears;
The plaintive voice alone she hears,
Sees but the dying man.
She stooped her by the rinnel's side,
She filled the helm, and back she hied,....
And with surprise and joy espied
A Monk supporting Varmion's head;
A pious man, whom duty brought
To dubious verge of battle fought,
To shrive the dying, bless the dead.
Deep drank Lord Marmion of the wave,
And, as she stooped his brow to lave-

I would the Fiend, to whom belongs
The vengeance due to all her wrongs,
Would spare me but a day!
For, wasting fire, and dying groan,
And priests slain on the altar-stone,
Might bribe him for delay.
It may not be!-this dizzy trance-
Curse on yon base marauder's lance,
And doubly cursed my failing brand!
A sinful heart makes feeble hand.”-
Then, fainting, down on earth he sunk,
Supported by the trembling Monk.
The war, that for a space did fail,
Now trebly thundering swelled the gale,
And-Stanley! was the cry;
A light on Marmion's visage spread,
And fired his glazing eye:
With dying hand, above his head
He shook the fragment of his blade,
And shouted “Victory!-
“Charge, Chester, charge! On, Stanley, on!"
Were the last words of Marmion.

GOLDSMITH.
As some lone miser, visiting his store,
Bands o'er his treasure, counts, recounts it o'er;
Hoards after hoards his rising raptures fill;
Yet still he sighs, for hoards are wanting still:
Thus to my breast alternate passions rise,
Pleased with each good that Heaven to man supplies;
Yet oft a sigh prevails, and sorrows fall,
To see the hoard of human bliss so small;
And oft I wish, amidst the scene, to find
Some spot to real happiness consigned,
Where my worn soul, each wandering hope at rost,
Nay gather bliss to see my fellows blest.

But where to find that happiest spot below,
Who can direct, when all pretend to know?
The shivering tenant of the frigid zone
Boldly proclaims that happiest spot his own;
Extols the treasures of his stormy seas,
And his long nights of revelry and ease;
The naked negro, panting at the line,
Boasts of his golden sands and palmy wine,
Basks in the glare, or stems the tepid wave,
And thanks his gods for all the good they gave.
Such is the patriot's boast, where'er we roam;
His first, best country, ever is at home;
And yet, perhaps, if countries we compare,
And estimate the blessings which they share,
Though patriots flatter, still shall wisdom find
An equal portion dealt to all mankind:
As different good, by art or nature given,
To different nations makes their blessings even.
Nature, a mother kind alike to all,
Still grants her bliss at labour's earnest call;
With food as well the peasant is supplied
On Idra's cliffs as Arno's shelvy side;
And though the rocky crested summits frown,
Those rocks, by custom, turn to beds of down.

Bru. Cassius,
Be not deceived; if I have veiled my look,
I turn the trouble of my countenance
Merely upon myself. Vexed I am,
Of late, with passions of some difference,
Conceptions only proper to myself,
Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviours:
But let not therefore my good friends be grieved;
Among which number, Cassius, be you one;
Nor construe any further my neglect,
Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
Forgets the shows of love to other men.
Cas. Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your
passion.
By means whereof, this breast of mine hath buried
Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
Bru. No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
But by reflection by some other things.
Cas. 'Tis just:
And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
That you have no such mirrors as will turn
Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
Where many of the best respect in Rome,
(Except immortal Cæsar,) speaking of Brutus,
And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
Bru. Into what dangers would you lead me, Cas-
sius,
That you would have me seek into myself
For that which is not in me?
Cas. Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
And since
you
know
you cannot see yourself
So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
Will modestly discover to yourself
That of yourself which you yet know not of.
And be not jealous of me, gentle Brutus:

To stale with ordinary oaths my love

That I do fawn on men, and hug them hard,
And after scandal them; or if you know
That I profess myself in banqueting
To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
Bru. What means this shouting? I do fear the
people
Choose Cæsar for their king.
Cas. Ay, do you fear it?
Then must I think you would not have it so.
Bru. I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well:-
But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
What is it that you would impart to me?
If it be aught toward the general good,
Set honour in one eye, and death in the other,
And I will look on both indifferently;
For, let the gods so speed me, as I love
The name of honour more than I fear death.
Cas. I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
As well as I do know your outward favour.
Well, honour is the subject of my story:
I cannot tell what you and other men
Think of this life; but for my single self,
I had as lief not be, as live to be
In awe of such a thing as I myself.
I was born free as Cæsar; so were you:
We both have fed as well; and we can both
Endure the winter's cold as well as he.
For once upon a raw and gusty day,
The troubled Tyber chafing with his shores,
Cæsar
says to me, Darest thou, Cassius, now
Leap in with me into this angry flood,
And swim to yonder point?-Upon the word,
Accoutred as I was, I plunged in,
And bade him follow: so, indeed, he did.
The torrent roared, and we did buffet it
With lusty sinews; throwing it aside,
And stemming it with hearts of controversy.
But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
Cæsar cried, Help me, Cassius, or I sink.

I, as Æneas, our great ancestor,
Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tyber
Did I the tired Cæsar: and this man
Is now become a god; and Cassius is
A wretched creature, and must bend his body,
If Cæsar carelessly but nod on him.
He had a fever when he was in Spain,
And, when the fit was on him, I did mark
How he did shake. 'Tis true, this god did shake:
His coward lips did from their colour fly;
And that same eye, whose bend doth awe the world,
Did lose its lustre: I did hear him groan:
Ay, and that tongue of his, that bade the Romans
Mark him, and write his speeches in their books,
Alas! it cried--Give me some drink, Titinius-
As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me,
A man of such a feeble temper should
So get the start of the majestick world,
And bear the palm alone.
Bru. Another general shout!
I do believe that these applauses are
For some new honours that are heaped on Cæsar.
Cas. Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
Like a Colossus: and we petty men
Walk under his huge legs, and peep about
To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
Men at sometimes are masters of their fates:
The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
Brutus—and Cæsar-what should be in that Cæsar?
Why should that name be sounded, more than your's?
Write them together; your's is as tair a name:
Sound them; it doth become the mouth as well:
Weigh them; it is as heavy: conjure with them;
Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Cæsar.
Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
Upon what meats doth this our Cæsar feed,
That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed:

Be any further moved. What you have said,

THE VOYAGE OF LIFE; AN ALLEGORY.
DR. JOHNSON.
“Life,” says Seneca, “is a voyage, in the pro-
gress of which we are perpetually changing our
scenes. We first leave childhood behind us, then
youth, then the years of ripened manhood, then the
better or more pleasing part of old age.'
rusal of this passage having excited in me a train of
reflections on the state of man, the incessant fluctu-
ation of his wishes, the gradual change of his dispo-
sition to all external objects, and the thoughtlessness
with which he floats along the stream of time, I sunk
into a slumber amidst my meditations, and, on a-sud-
den, found my ears filled with the tumult of labour,
the shouts of alacrity, the shrieks of alarm, the whis-
13*

tle of winds, and the dash of waters. My astonish-
ment for a time repressed my curiosity; but soon
recovering myself so far as to inquire whither we
were going, and what was the cause of such clamour
and confusion, I was told that we were launching out
into the ocean of life; that we had already passed the
straits of Infancy, in which multitudes had perished,
some by the weakness and fragility of their vessels,
and more by the folly, perverseness, or negligence,
of those who undertook to steer them; and that we
were now on the main sea, abandoned to the winds
and billows, without any other means of security than
the care of the pilot, whom 'it was always in our pow-
er to choose, among great numbers that offered their
direction and assistance.
I then looked round with anxious eagerness: and,
first turning my eyes behind me, saw a stream flowing
through flowery islands, which every one that sailed
along seemed to behold with pleasure; but no sooner
touched them, than the current, which, though not
noisy, or turbulent, was yet irresistible, bore him
away. Beyond these islands, all was darkness; nor
could any of the passengers describe the shore at
which he first embarked.
Before me, and on each side, was an expanse of
waters violently agitated, and covered with so thick
a mist, that the most perspicacious eyes could see
but a little way. It appeared to be full of rocks and
whirlpools; for many sunk unexpectedly while they
were courting the gale with full sails, and insulting
those whom they had left behind. So numerous, in-
deed, were the dangers, and so thick the darkness,
that no caution could confer security. Yet there
were many, who, by false intelligence betrayed their
followers into whirlpools, or by violence pushed those
whom they found in their way against the rocks.
The current was invariable and insurmountable:
but though it was impossible to sail against it, or to
return to the place that was once passed, yet it was
not so violent as to allow no opportunities for dexte-
rity or courage; since, though none could retreat

151
back from danger, yet they might often avoid it by an
oblique direction.
It was, however, not very common to steer with
much care or prudence; for, by some universal in-
fatuation, every man appeared to think himself safe,
though he saw his consorts every moment sinking
round him; and no sooner had the waves closed over
them, than their fate and their misconduct were for-
gotten; the voyage was pursued with the same jo-
cund confidence; every man congratulated himself
upon the soundness of his vessel, and believed him-
self able to stem the whirlpool in which his friend
was swallowed, or glide over the rocks on which he
was dashed: nor was it often observed that the sight
of a wreck made any man change his course.-
If he turned aside for a moment, he soon forgot
the rudder, and left himself again to the disposal of
chance.
This negligence did not proceed from indiffer-
ence, or from weariness of their present condition;
for not one of those who thus rushed upon destruc-
tion, failed, when he was sinking, to call loudly upon
his associates for that help which could not now be
given him: and many spent their last moments in
cautioning others against the folly by which they
were intercepted in the midst of their course. Their
benevolence was sometimes praised, but their admo-
nitions were unregarded.
The vessels in which we had embarked, being
confessedly unequal to the turbulence of the stream
of life, were visibly impaired in the course of the voy-
age, so that every passenger was certain, that
how long soever he might, by favourable accidents,
or by incessant vigilance, be preserved, he must sink
at last.
This necessity of perishing might have been ex-
pected to sadden the gay, and intimidate the daring;
at least to keep the melancholy and timorous in per-
petual torments, and hinder them from any enjoy-
ment of the varieties and gratifications which nature
offered them as the solace of their labours; yet in

effect none seemed less to expect destruction
than those to whom it was most dreadful; they
all had the art of concealing their danger from them-
selves; and those who knew their inability to bear
the sight of the terrors that embarrassed their way,
took care never to look forward; but found some
amusement of the present moment, and generally
entertained themselves by playing with Hope, who
was the constant associate of the Yoyage of Life.
Yet all that Hope ventured to promise, even to
those whom she favoured most, was, not that they
should escape, but that they should sink last; and
with this promise every one was satisfied, though he
laughed at the rest for seeming to believe it. Hope,
indeed, apparently mocked the credulity of her com-
panions; for, in proportion as their vessels grew
leaky, she redoubled her assurances of safety; and
none were more busy in making provisions for a
long voyage, than they whom all but themselves saw
likely to perish soon by irreparable decay.
In the midst of the current of Life, was the gulph
of Intemperance, a dreadful whirlpool, interspersed
with rocks, of which the pointed crags were conceal-
ed under water, and the tops covered with herbage,
on which Ease spread couches of repose; and with
shades, where Pleasure warbled the song of invita-
tion. Within sight of these rocks, all who sailed on
the ocean of Life must necessarily pass. Reason,
indeed, was always at hand, to steer the passengers
through a narrow outlet, by which they might es-
cape; but very few could, by her entreaties or re-
monstrances, be induced to put the rudder into her
hand, without stipulating that she should approach
80 near the rocks of Pleasure, that they might solace
themselves with a short enjoyment of that delicious
region, after which they always determined to pursue
their course without any deviation.
Reason was too often prevailed upon so far by
these promises, as to venture her charge within the
eddy of the gulph of Intemperance, where, indeed,
the circumvolution was weak, but yet interrupted the

153
course of the vessel, and drew it, by insensible rota-
tions, towards the centre. She then repented her
temerity, and with all her force endeavoured to re-
treat; but the draught of the gulph was generally
too strong to be overcome: and the passenger, hav-
ing danced in circles with a pleasing and giddy velo-
city, was at last overwhelmed and lost. Those few
whom Reason was able to extricate, generally suf-
fered so many shocks upon the points which shot out
from the rocks of Pleasure, that they were unable to
continue their course with the same strength and fa-
cility as before; but floated along timorously and fee-
bly, endangered by every breeze, and shattered by
every ruffle of the water, till they sunk, by slow de-
grees, after long struggles, and innumerable expe-
dients, always repining at their own folly, and warning
others against the first approach towards the gulph
of Intemperance.
There were artists who professed to repair the
breaches, and stop the leaks of the vessels which had
been shattered on the rocks of Pleasure. Many ap-
peared to have great confidence in their skill; and
some, indeed, were preserved by it, who had receiv-
ed only a single blow: but I remarked that few ves-
sels lasted long which had been much repaired: nor
was it found that the artists themselves continued
afloat longer than those who had least of their assis-
tance.
The only advantage which, in the voyage of Life,
the cautious had above the negligent, was, that they
sunk later, and more suddenly; for they passed for-
ward till they had sometimes seen all those in whose
company they had issued from the straits of Infancy,
perish in the way; and at last were overset by a cross
breeze, without the toil of resistance, or the anguish
of expectation. But such as had often fallen against
the rocks of Pleasure, commonly subsided by sensi-
ble degrees: contended long with the encroaching
waters; and harrassed themselves by labours that
scarcely Hope herself could flatter with success.
As I was looking upon the various fates of the

multitude about me, I was suddenly alarmed with an
admonition from some unknown power:
« Gaze not
idly upon others, when thou thyself art sinking.
Whence is this thoughtless tranquillity, when thou
and they are equally endangered?” I looked, and
seeing the gulph of Intemperance before me, started
and awaked.
THE VILLAGE PREACHER.
GOLDSMITH.
Near yonder copse, where once the garden smild,
And still where many a garden flower grows wild,
There where a few torn shrubs the place disclose,
The village preacher's modest mansion rose.
A man he
was, to all the country dear,
And passing rich, with forty pounds a year;
Remote from towns he ran his godly race,
Nor e'er had chang'd, nor wish'd to change, his
place.
Unskilful he to fawn, or seek for pow'r,
By doctrines fashion'd to the varying hour; :
Far other aims his heart had learn’d to prize,
More bent to raise the wretched, than to rise.
His house was known to all the vagrant train;
He chid their wand'rings, but reliev'd their pain.
The long-remember'd beggar was his guest,
Whose beard descending swept his aged breast;
The ruin'd spendthrift, now no longer proud,
Claim'd kindred there, and had his claims allow'd:
The broken soldier, kindly bade to stay,
Sat by his fire, and talk'd the night away;
Wept o'er his wounds, or tales of sorrow done,
Shoulder'd his crutch, and show'd how fields were
won.
Pleas'd with his guests, the good man learn’d to glow,
And quite forgot their vices in their wo;
Careless their merits or their faults to scan,
His pity gave ere charity began.
Thus to relieve the wretched was his pride,
And e’en his failings lean'd to virtue's side:

But, in his duty prompt at every call,
He watch'd and wept, he pray'd and felt for all:
And, as a bird each fond endearment tries,
To tempt her new-fledg’d offspring to the skies,
He tried each art, reprov'd each dull delay,
Allur'd to brighter worlds, and led the way.
Beside the bed, where parting life was laid,
And sorrow, guilt, and pain, by turns dismay'd,
The reverend champion stood. At his control
Despair and anguish fled the struggling soul;
Comfort came down the trembling wretch to raise,
And his last faltering accents whisper'd praise.
At church, with meek and unaffected
grace,
His looks adorn'd the venerable place;
Truth from his lips prevail'd with double sway:
And fools who came to scoff, remain’d to pray.
The service past, around the pious man,
With ready zeal each honest rustic ran;
Even children follow'd with endearing wile,
And pluck'd his gown, to share the good man's smile.
His ready smile a parent's warmth express'd;
Their welfare pleas'd him, and their cares distress'd.
To them his heart, his love, his griefs were given,
But all his serious thoughts had rest in heav'n:
As some tall cliff that lifts its awful form,
Swells from the vale, and midway leaves the storm,
Tho'round its breast, the rolling clouds are spread,
Eternal sunshine settles on its head.

whole jurisdiction is founded upon the solemn belief
and practice of what is here denied as falsehood, and

reprobated as impiety, to deal with such an anomalous
defence? Upon what principle is it even offered to
the court, whose authority is contemned and mocked
at? If the religion proposed to be called in question,
is not previously adopted in belief, and solemnly act-
ed upou, what authority has the Court to pass any
judgment at all of acquittal or condemnation? Why
am I now, or upon any other occasion, to submit
to your Lordship's authority? Why am I now, or
at any time, to address twelve of my equals, as I am
now addressing you, with reverence and submission?
Under what sanction are the witnesses to give their
evidence, without which there can be no trial? Un-
der what obligations can I call upon you, the jury,
representing your country, to administer justice?
Surely upon no other than that you are sworn to ad-
minister it under the oaths you have taken. The
whole judicial fabric, from the king's sovereign au-
thority to the lowest office of magistracy has no other
foundation. The whole is built, both in form and sub-
stance, upon the same oath of every one of its min-
isters, to do justice,“ as God shall help them hereafter.”
What God? and what hereafter? That God, undoubt-
edly, who has commanded kings to rule, and judges
to decree with justice; who has said to witnesses,
not by the voice of nature, but in revealed command-
ments, “thou shalt not bear false testimony against
thy neighbour;” and who has enforced obedience to
them by the revelation of the unutterable blessings
which shall attend their observances, and the awful
punishments which shall await upon their transgres-
sions.
But it seems this course of reason, and the time
and the person are at last arrived, that are to dissi-
pate the errours that have overspread the past gene-
rations of ignorance! The believers in christianity
are many, but it belongs to the few that are wise to
correct their credulity! Belief is an act of reason; and
superior reason may therefore dictate to the weak.
In running the mind along the numerous list of sin-
cere and devout christians, I cannot help lamenting

that Newton had not lived to this day, to have had
his shallowness filled up with this new flood of light.
But the subject is too awful for irony... I will speak
plainly and directly. Newton was a Christian! New-
ton, whose mind burst forth from the fetters cast by
nature upon our finite conceptions: Newton, whose
science was truth, and the foundation of whose
knowledge of it was philosophy. Not those vision-
ary and arrogant assumptions which too often usurp
its name, but philosophy resting upon the basis of
Mathematics, which, like figures, cannot lie. Newton,
who carried the line and rule to the utmost barriers
of creation, and explored the principles by which, no
doubt, all created matter is held together and exists.
But this extraordinary man, in the mighty reach of
his mind, overlooked, perhaps, the errours which a
minuter investigation of the created things on this
earth might have taught him, of the essence of his
Creator. What shall then be said of the great Mr.
Boyle, who looked into the organic structure of all
matter, even to the brute inanimate substances
which the foot treads on. Such a man may be sup-
posed to have been equally qualified with Mr. Paine,
to “ look through nature up to nature's God.”. Yet
the result of all his contemplation was the most con-
firmed and devout belief in all which the other holds
in contempt as despicable and drivelling superstition.
But this errour, might, perhaps, arise from a want of
due attention to the foundations of human judgment,
and the structure of that understanding which God
has given us for the investigation of truth. Let that
question be answered by Mr. Locke, who was to the
highest pitch of devotion and adoration a Christian,
Mr. Locke, whose office was to detect the errours
of thinking, by going up to the fountain of thought,
and to direct into the proper track of reasoning the
devious mind of man, by showing
him its whole pro-
cess, from the first perceptions of sense, to the last
conclusions of ratiocination; putting a rein besides
upon false opinion, by practical rules for the conduct
of human judgment.

But these men were only deep thinkers, and lived
in their closets, unaccustomed to the traffic of the
world, and to the laws which partially regulate man-
kind. Gentlemen, in the place where you now sit to
administer the justice of this great country, above a
century ago the never to be forgotten sir Matthew
Hale presided, whose faith in christianity is an exalt-
ed commentary upon its truth and reason, and whose
life was a glorious example of its fruits in man; ad-
ministering human justice with a wisdom and purity
drawn from the pure fountain of the christian dispen-
sation, which has been, and will be, in all ages, a sub-
ject of the highest reverence and admiration. But
it is said by Mr. Paine, that the christian fable is but
the tale of the more ancient superstitions of the world
and may be easily detected by a proper understand-
ing of the mythologies of the heathens. Did Milton
understand those mythologies? Was he less versed
than Mr. Paine in the superstitions of the world?
No: they were the subject of his immortal song; and
though shut out from all recurrence to them, he
poured them forth from the stores of a memory rich
with all that man ever knew, and laid them in their
order as the illustration of that real and exalted faith,
the unquestionable source of that fervid genius, which
cast a sort of shade upon all the other works of man.
Thus you find all that is great, or wise, or splendid,
or illustrious, amongst created beings, all the minds
gifted_beyond ordinary nature, if not inspired by
their Universal Author for the advancement and dig-
nity of the world, though divided by distant ages, and
by the clashing opinions distinguishing them from one
another, yet joining as it were, in one sublime chorus
to celebrate the truths of christianity, and laying up-
on its holy altars the never fading offerings of their
immortal wisdom.
Gentlemen, I cannot conclude without expressing the
deepest regret at all attacks upon the christian relig-

Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the

SPEECH OF CURRAN FOR HEVEY.
About the year 17
it seems, a man of the name
of M Guire was prosecuted for some offence against
the state. Mr. Hevey, the plaintiff, by accident
was in court: he was then a citizen of wealth and
credit, a brewer in the first line of that business.
Unfortunately for him, he had heretofore employed
the witness for the prosecution, and found him a man
of infamous character. Unfortunately for himself,
he mentioned this circumstance in court.
The coun-
sel for the prisoner insisted on his being sworn: he
The jury were convinced, that no credit
was due to the witness for the crown, and the pris-
oner was accordingly acquitted. In a day or two
after, Major Sirr met the plaintiff in the street, asked
how he dared to interfere in his business? and swore
he would teach him how to meddle with “his peo-
ple.” Gentlemen, there are two sorts of prophets;
one that derives its knowledge from real or fancied
inspiration, and is sometimes mistaken. But there is
another class, who prophesy what they are determin-
ed to bring about themselves. Of this second, and
by far the most authentic class, was the Major; for
heaven, you see, has no monopoly of prediction. On
the following evening, poor Hevey was dogged in the
dark into some lonely alley: there he was seized, he
knew nat by whom, nor by what authority; and be-

came in a moment, to his family and friends, as if he
had never been. He was carried away in equal ig-
norance of his crime, and of his destiny, whether to
be tortured, or hanged, or transported. His crime
he soon learned; it was the treason he had commit-
ted against the majesty of Major Sirr. He was im-
mediately conducted to a new place of imprisonment
in the castle-yard, called the Provost. Of this man-
sion of misery, of which you have since heard so
much, Major Sandys was, and I believe yet is, the
keeper,-a gentleman of whom I know how dan-
gerous it is to speak, and of whom every prudent
man will think and talk with all due reverence. He
seemed a twin-star of the defendant-equal in honor
and in confidence,-equal also for who could be su-
perior?) in probity and humanity. To this gentle-
man was my client consigned, and in his custody he
remained about seven weeks, unthought of by the
world, as if he had never existed. The oblivion of
the imprisoned is as profound as the oblivion of the
dead. His family may have mourned his absence, or
his probable death. But why should I mention so
paltry a circumstance? The fears or the sorrows of
the wretched give no interruption to the general pro-
gress of things. The sun rose, and the sun set, just
as it did before: the business of the government, the
business of the castle,—of the feast or the torture,-
went on with their usual exactness and tranquillity.
At last, Mr. Hevey was discovered among the sweep-
ings of the prison, and was at last to be disposed of.
He was now honored with the personal notice of Ma-
jor Sandys.—“Hevey, (says the major,) I have seen
you ride, I think, a smart sort of a mare; you can't
use her here; you had better give me an order for
her.” The plaintiff, you may well suppose, by this
time, had a tolerable idea of his situation. He
thought he might have much to fear from a refu-
sal, and something to hope from compliance; at all
events, he saw it would be a means of apprizing
his family that he was not dead: he instantly gave
the order required. The major graciously accepted

it, saying, your courtesy will not cost you much; you
are to be sent down to-morrow to Kilkenny, to be
tried for your life; you will most certainly be hanged;
and you can scarcely think that your journey to the
other world will be performed on horseback. The
humane and honourable major was equally a prophet
with his compeer. The plaintiff, on the next day,
took leave of his prison, as he supposed for the last
time, and was sent under a guard to Kilkenny.
At Kilkenny, evidence was sought for against him
by proclamation, and on the testimony of an adjudged
felon, he was condemned to death. The sentence,
however, came to the eye of Lord Cornwallis;--with
shame and indignation he dashed his pen across the
record, and ordered Mr. Hevey to be instantly set at
liberty.
Hevey was now a man again; he shook the dust
off his feet against the prison gate: his heart beat
the response to his anticipated embrace of his fami-
ly and his friends, and he returned to Dublin. On
his arrival here, one of the first persons he met with
was his old friend Major Sandys. In the eye of
poor Hevey, justice and humanity had shorn the
Major of his beams. He no longer regarded him
with respect or terror; he demanded his mare; ob-
serving, that though he might have travelled to
heaven on foot, he thought it more comfortable to
perform his earthly journeys on horseback. Un-
grateful villain! says the Major; is this the gratitude
you show to his Majesty and to me for our clemency
to you?-You shan't get possession of the beast,
which you have forfeited by your freason; nor can I
suppose, that a noble animal, that had been honored
with conveying the weight of duty and allegiance,
could condescend to load her loyal loins with the vile
burden of a convicted traitor.
On the 8th of September last, Mr. Hevey was sit-
ting in a public coffee-house. Major Sirr was there.
Mr. Hevey was informed that the Major had at that
moment said,.that he (Hevey,) ought to have been
hanged. The plaintiff was fired at the charge; be

fixed his eye on Sirr, and asked if he had dared to say
so? Sirr declared that he had, and had said truly.
Hevey answered that he was a slanderous scoundrel.
At that instant, Sirr rushed upon him, and assisted by
three or four of his satellites, who had attended him
in disguise, secured him and sent him to the castle
guard, desiring that a receipt might be given for the
villain. He was sent thither. The officer of the
guard chanced to be an Englishman, but lately ar-
rived in Ireland; he said to the bailiffs, if this was
in England, I should think this gentleman entitled
to bail, but I don't know the laws of this country.-
However, I think you had better loosen those irons
on his wrist, or I think they may kill him.
Here he was flung into a room of about thirteen
feet by twelve ; it was called the hospital of the pro-
vost; it was occupied by six beds, in which were to
lie fourteen or fifteen miserable wretches, some of
them sinking under contagious diseases. Here he
passed the first night without bed or food. The next
morning his humane keeper, the Major, appeared.
The plaintiff demanded " why he was imprisoned ?”
complained of hunger, and asked for the gaol allow-
ance. Major Sandys replied with a torrent of abuse
which he concluded by saying—“Your crime is your
insolence to Major Sirr; however, he disdains to
trample upon you; you may appease him by proper
and contrite submission; but unless you do so, you
shall rot where you are.-I tell you this, that if Gov-
ernment will not protect us, by Heaven we will not
protect them. You will probably, attempt to get out
by an habeas corpus; but in that you will find your-
self mistaken as such a rascal deserves."

LORD CHATHAM'S SPEECH
In the House of Lords, on the Address to the Throne,
at the opening of Parliament, on the 18th of Novem-
ber, 1777.
I rise, my lords, to declare my sentiments on this
most solemn and serious subject. It has imposed a
load upon my mind, which, I fear, nothing can re-
move; but which impels mé to endeavour its allevia-
tion, by a free and unreserved communication of my
sentiments.
In the first part of the address, I have the honour
of heartily concurring with the noble earl who moved
it. No man feels sincerer joy than I do; none can
offer more genuine congratulation on every acces-
sion of strength to the succession of the house of
Brunswick I therefore join in every congratula-
tion on the birth of another princess and the happy
recovery of her majesty. But I must stop here. My
courtly complaisance will carry me no further. I
will not join in congratulation on misfortune and dis-
grace. I cannot concur in a blind and servile ad-
dress, which approves, and endeavours to sanctify
the monstrous measures which have heaped disgrace
and misfortune upon us. This, my lords, is a peril-
ous and tremendous moment! It is not a time for
adulation. The smoothness of flattery cannot now
avail; cannot save us in this rugged and awful crisis.
It is now necessary to instruct the throne in the lan-
guage of truth.
We must dispel the delusion and
the darkness which envelope it; and display, in its
full danger and true colours, the ruin that is brought
to our doors.
This, my lords, is our duty. It is the proper func-
tion of this noble assembly, sitting, as we do, upon
our honours in this house, the hereditary council of
the crown. Who is the minister--where is the min-
ister, that has dared to suggest to the throne the con-
trary unconstitutional language this day delivered
from it?--The accustomed language from the
throne has been application to parliament for advice,

par-
and a reliance on its constitutional advice and assist-
ance, As it is the right of parliament to give, so it
is the duty of the crown to ask it. But on this day,
and in this extreme momentous exigency, no reliance
is reposed on our constitutional counsels! no advice
is asked from the sober and enlightened care of
liament! but the crown, from itself, and by itself, de-
clares an unalterable determination to pursue mean
sures—and what measures, my lords? --The mea-
sures that have produced the imminent perils that
threaten us; the measures that have brought ruin to
our doors.
Can the minister of the day now presume to expect
a continuance of support, in this ruinous infatuation?
Can parliament be so dead to its dignity and its duty,
as to be thus deluded into the loss of the one and the
violation of the other? -To give an unlimited credit
and support for the steady perseverance in measures
not proposed for our parliamentary advice, but dictated
and forced upon us-in measures,
I
say, my lords,
which have reduced this flourishing empire to ruin
and contempt!—“But yesterday, and England might
have stood against the world: now none so poor as
to do her reverence.” I use the words of a poet;
but though it be poetry it is no fiction. It is a shame-
ful truth, that not only the power and strength of this
country are wasting away and expiring; but her well
earned glories, her true honour, and substantial dig-
nity are sacrificed. France, my lords, has insulted
you; she has encouraged and sustained America;
and whether America be wrong or right, the dignity
of this country ought to spurn at the officious insult
of French interference. The ministers and ambas-
sadors of those who are called rebels and enemies,
are in Paris; in Paris they transact the reciprocal
interests of America and France. Can there be a
more mortifying insult? Can even our ministers
sustain a more humiliating disgrace! Do they dare
to resent it? Do they presume even to hint a vin-
dication of their honour, and the dignity of the state
by requiring the dismission of the plenipotentiaries of

America? Such is the degradation to which they
have reduced the glories of England! The people
whom they affect to call contemptible rebels, but
whose growing power has at last obtained the name
of enemies; the people with whom they have engaged
this country in war, and against whom they now com-
mand our implicit support in every measure of des-
perate hostility: this people, despised as rebels, or
acknowledged as enemies, are abetted against you,
supplied with every military store, their interests
consulted, and their ambassadors entertained, by your
inveterate enemy! and our ministers dare not inter-
pose with dignity or effect. Is this the honour of a
great kingdom? Is this the indignant spirit of Eng-
land, who, “but yesterday,” gave law to the house
of Bourbon? My lords, the dignity of nations de-
mands a decisive conduct in a situation like this.
Even when the greatest prince that perhaps this
country ever saw, filled our throne, the requisition of
a Spanish general on a similar subject, was attended
to, and complied with. For, on the spirited remon-
strance of the Duke of Alva, Elizabeth found herself
obliged to deny the Flemish exiles all countenance,
support, or even entrance into her dominions; and
the Count le Marque, with his few desperate follow-
ers, were expelled the kingdom. Happening to ar-
rive at the Brille, and finding it weak in defence, they
made themselves masters of the place: and this was
the foundation of the United Provinces.
My lords, this ruinous and ignominious situation,
where we cannot act with success, nor suffer with
honour, calls upon us to remonstrate in the strongest
and loudest language of truth, to rescue the ear of
majesty from the delusions which surround it. The
desperate state of our army abroad is in part known:
no man thinks more highly of it than I do. I love
and honour the English troops. I know their vir-
tues and their valour. I know they can achieve any
thing except impossibilities; and I know that the
conquest of English America is an impossibility. You

I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided;
and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no
way of judging of the future but by the past. And
judging by the past, I wish to know what there has
been in the conduct of the British ministry for the
last ten years, to justify those hopes with which gen-
tlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and
the house? Is it that insidious smile with which our
petition has been lately received? Trust it not, sir:
it will prove a snare to your feet.
Suffer not your-
selves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves
how this gracious reception of our petition comports
with those warlike preparations which cover our
waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies
necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have
we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled,
that force must be called in to win back our love?
Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the
implements of war and subjugation—the last argu-
ments to which kings resort. I ask gentlemen, sir,
what means this martial array, if its purpose be not
to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign
any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain
any enemy in this quarter of the world, to call for
all this accumulation of navies and armies? No,
sir, she has none. They are meant for us: they can
be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind
and rivet upon us those chains, which the British
ministry have been so long forging. And what have
we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument?
Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years.

plication? What terms shall we find, which have
not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech
you, sir, deceive ourselves longer. Sir, we have

storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned

have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have
implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical

have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced
additional violence and insult; our supplications
have been disregarded; and we have been spurned,
with contempt, from the foot of the throne. În vain,
after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of
peace and reconciliation.
There is no longer any
room for hope. If we wish to be free—if we mean
to preserve in violate those inestimable privileges for
which we have been so long contending—if we mean
not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we

solution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means
of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs,

enemies shall have bound us hand and foot ? Sir,

enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall

presides over the destinies of nations; and who will
raise
up friends to fight our battles for us. The bat-
tle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigi-
lant, the active, the brave. Besides, sir, we have
no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it

are forged. Their clanking may be heard on the
plains of Boston! The war is inevitable—and let it

sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash

so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the
price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty

The armoury of Winter; where his troops,
The gloomy clouds, find weapons, arrowy sleet,
Skin piercing volley, blossom bruising hail,

And wraps him in an unexpected tomb.
Silently as a dream the fabric rose;
No sound of hammer or of saw was there:
Ice upon ice, the well-adjusted parts
Were soon conjoined, nor other cement ask'd
Than water interfused to make them one.
Lamps gracefully disposed, and of all hues,
Illumined every side: a watery light
Gleamed through the clear transparency, that seem'd
Another moon new risen, or meteor fallen
From Heaven to Earth, of lambent flame serene.
So stood the brittle prodigy; though smooth
And slippery the materials, yet frost-bound
Firm as a rock. Nor wanted aught within
That royal residence might well befit
For grandeur or for use. Long wavy wreaths
of flowers, that feared no enemy but warmth,
Blush'd on the pannels. Mirror needed none
Where all was vitreous; but in order due
Convivial table and commodious seat,
(What seem'd at least commodious seat) were there;
Sofa and couch, and high built throne august.
The same lubricity was found in all,
And all was moist to the warm touch; a scene
Of evanescent glory, once a stream,
And soon to slide into a stream again.
Alas! 'was but a mortifying stroke
Of undesigned severity, that glanced,

On human grandeur and the courts of kings.

'Twas durable; as worthless as it seem'd
Intrinsically precious; to the foot
Treacherous and false; it smiled, and it was cold.

MEETING OF SATAN AND THE ANGELS.
PARADISE LOST.-Book IV.
Now had night measured with her shadowy cone
Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault,
And from their ivory port the cherubim,
Forth issuing at the accustomed hour, stood armed
To their night watches in warlike parade,
When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake.
“Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the south
With strictest watch; these other wheel the north;
Our circuit meets full west.” As flame they part,
Half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear.
From these, two strong and subtle spirits he called
That near him stood, and gave them thus in charge.

Search through this garden, leave unsearched no

Büt chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge,
Now laid perhaps asleep, secure of harm.
This evening from the sun's decline arrived
Who tells of some infernal spirit seen
Hitherward bent (who could have thought?) escaped
The bars of hell, on errand bad no doubt:
Such where ye find, seize fast and hither bring.”
So saying, on he led his radiant files,
Dazzling the moon; these to the bower direct
In search of whom they sought: him there they found
Squat like a toad, close at the ear of Eve,
Assaying by his devilish art to reach
The organs of her fancy, and with them forge
Illusions as he list, phantasms and dreams;
Or if, inspiring venom, he might taint
The animal spirits, that from pure blood arise
Like gentle breaths from rivers pure, thence raise
At least distempered, discontented thoughts,
Vain hopes, vain aims, inordinate desires,
Blown up with high conceits engendering pride.

With sudden blaze diffused, inflames the air:

Yet thus, unmoved with fear, accost him soon.

For you, there sitting where ye
durst not soar;
Not to know me argues yourselves unknown,
The lowest of your throng; or, if ye know,
Why ask ye, and superfluous begin
Your message, like to end as much in vain?”
To whom thus Zephon, answering scorn with scorn.
" Think not, revolted spirit, thy shape the same,
Or undiminished brightness to be known,
As when thou stood'st in Heaven upright and pure;
That glory then, when thou no more wast good,
Departed from thee; and thou resemblest now
Thy sin and place of doom, obscure and foul.
But come, for thou, be sure, shalt give account
To him who sent us, whose charge is to keep
This place inviolable, and these from harm."

Severe in youthful beauty, added grace
Invincible, abashed ihe devil stood,
And felt how awful goodness is, and saw
Virtue in her own shape how lovely; saw, and pined
His loss; but chiefly to find here observed
His lustre visibly impaired; yet seemed
Undaunted. “If I must contend," said he,
“ Best with the best, the sender, not the sent,
Or all at once; more glory will be won,

Or less be lost.” “Thy fear,” said Zephon bold,
6. Will save us trial what the least can do
Single against thee wicked, and thence weak.”
The fiend replied not, overcome with rage;
But, like a proud steed reined, went haughty on,
Champing his iron curb: to strive or fly
He held it vain; awe from above had quelled
His heart, not else dismayed. Now drew they nigh
The western point, where those half-rounding guards
Just met, and closing stood in squadron joined,
Awaiting next command. To whom their chief,
Gabriel, from the front thus called aloud.
“O friends! I hear the tread of nimble feet
Hasting this way, and now by glimpse discern
Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade;
And with them comes a third of regal port,
But faded splendour wan; who, by his gait
And fierce demeanour, seems the prince of Hell,
Not likely to part hence without contest;
Stand firm, for in his looks defiance lowers.”
He scarce had ended, when those two approached,
And brief related whom they brought, where found,
How busied, in what form and posture couched.
To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake.
“Why hast thou, Satan, broke the bounds pre-
scribed
To thy transgressions, and disturbed the charge
Of others, who approve not to transgress
By thy example, but have power and right
To question thy bold entrance on this place;
Employed, it seems, to violate sleep, and those
Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss?"
To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow.
“ Gabriel, thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise,
And such I held thee; but this question asked
Puts me in doubt. Lives there who loves his pain?
Who would not, finding way, break loose from hell,
Though thither doomed? Thou wouldst thyself no
doubt,
And boldly venture to whatever place

Farthest from pain, where thou might'st hope to
change
Torment with ease, and soonest recompense
Dole with delight, which in this place I sought;
To thee no reason, who knowest only good,
But evil hast not tried: and wilt object
His will who bound us? let him surer bar
His iron gates, if he intends our stay
In that dark durance: thus much what was asked.
The rest is true, they found me where they say,
But that implies not violence or harm.”
Thus he in scorn. The warlike angel, moved,
Disdainfully half smiling, thus replied.
"O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise,
Since Satan fell, whom folly overthrew,
And now returns him from his prison ’scaped,
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
Or not, who ask what boldness brought him hither,
Unlicensed, from his hounds in hell prescribed;
So wise he judges it to fly from pain,
However, and to escape his punishment !
So judge thou still, presumptuous! till the wrath
Which thou incurrest by flying, meet thy flight
Sevenfold, and scourge that wisdom back to hell,
Which taught thee yet no better, that no pain
Can equal anger infinite provoked.
But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee
Came not all hell broke loose? Is pain to them
Less pain, less to be fled? or thou than they
Less hardy to endure? courageous chief!
The first in flight from pain! hadst thou alleged
To thy deserted host this cause of flight,
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive."
To which the fiend thus answered, frowning stern,
“Not that I less endure or shrink from pain,
Insulting angel! well thou knowest I stood
Thy fiercest, when in battle to thy aid
The blasting vollied thunder made all speed,
And seconded thy else not dreaded spear.
But still thy words at random, as before,

From hard assays and ill successes past,
A faithful leader, not to hazard all
Through ways of danger by himself untried:
I therefore, I alone, first undertook
To wing the desolate abyss, and spy
This new created world, whereof in hell
Fame is not silent, here in hope to find
Better abode,
and
my
afflicted powers
To settle here on earth, or in mid air;
Though for possession put to try once more
What thou and thy gay legions dare against;
Whose easier business were to serve their Lord
High up in Heaven, with songs to hymn his throne
And practised distances to cringe, not fight.”
To whom the warrior angel soon replied.
“To say and straight unsay, pretending first
Wise to fly pain, professing next the spy,
Argues no leader but a liar traced;
Satan, and couldst thou faithful add? O name,
O sacred name of faithfulness profaned!
Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?
Army of fiends, fit body to fit head.
Was this your discipline and faith engaged,
Your military obedience, to dissolve
Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme?
And thou, sly hypocrite, who now wouldst seem
Patron of liberty, who more than thou
Once fawned, and cringed, and servilely adored
Heaven's awful monarch? wherefore, but in hope
To dispossess him, and thyself to reign?
But mark what I arreed thee now, avaunt;
Fly thither whence thou fledst! if from this hour
Within these hallowed limits thou appear,
Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained,
And seal thee so, as henceforth not to scorn
The facile gates of hell too slightly barred."
So threatened he: but Satan to no threats
Gave heed, but waxing more in rage, replied.
" Then when I am thy captive talk of chains,
Proud limitary cherub! but ere then
Far heavier load thyself expect to feel

From my prevailing arm, though Heaven's King
Ride on thy wings, and thou with thy compeers,
Used to the yoke, drawest his triumphant wheels
In progress through the road of Heaven star-paved.”
While thus he spake, the argelic squadron bright
Turned fiery red; sharpening in mooned horns
Their phalanx, and began to hem him round
With ported spears, as thick as when a field
Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
Her bearded grove of ears, which way the wind
Sways them; the careful ploughman doubtful stands,
Lest on the threshing-floor his hopeful sheaves
Prove chaff. On the other side, Satan, alarmed,
Collecting all his might, dilated stood,
Like Teneriff or Atlas, unremoved:
His stature reached the sky, and on his crest
Sat horror plumed; nor wanted in his grasp
What seemed both spear and shield: now dreadful
deeds
Might have ensued, nor only Paradise
In this commotion, but the starry cope
Of Heaven perhaps, or all the elements
At least had gone to wrack, disturbed and torn
With violence of this conflict, had not soon
The Eternal, to prevent such horrid fray,
Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales, yet seen,
Betwixt Astrea and the scorpion sign,
Wherein all things created first he weighed,
The pendulous round earth with balanced air
In counterpoise, now ponders all events,
Battles and realms: in these he put two weights,
The sequel each of parting and of fight;
The latter quick up flew, and kicked the beam;
Which Gabriel spying, thus bespake the fiend.
“Satan I know thy strength, and thou knowest
mine,
Neither our own, but given; what folly then
To boast what arms can do! since thine no more
Than Heaven permits, nor mine, though doubled now
To trample thee as mire: for proof look up,
And read thy lot in yon celestial sign,

If thou resist.” The fiend looked up, and knew
His mounted scale aloft; nor more; but fled
Murmuring, and with him fled the shades of night.
THE WIFE'S ADIEU.
I soar to the realms of the bright and the blest,
Where the mourners are solaced, the weary at rest;
I rise to my glories, while thou must remain
In this dark vale of tears, to dejection and pain.
And hence, though my heart thrubs exulting to die,
And visions of glory expand to my eye,
The bosom that struggles and pants to be free,
Still beats with regret and affection for thee.
I fear not another, more fond and more fair,
When I am forgotten, thy fortunes should share;
Oh! find but a bosom devoted as mine
And my heart's latest blessing forever be thine.
I fear--lest the stroke that now rends us apart,
From the faith of the Christian, should sever thy heart,
Lest seeking in anguish, relief from despair,
The vain world should lure thee to look for it there.
But oh! should it tempt thee awhile to resign
A treasure so precious, a hope so divine;
Should the light of his glory be hidden from thee
In the hour of darkness, oh! think upon me.
Remember the hope that enlivens me now,
Though the dews of the damp grave are cold on my
brow;
The faith that has nerved me with transport to see
The hour of my doom, though it bears me from thee.

O Griffith, sick to death:
My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,
Willing to leave their burden: Reach a chair;-
So,—now, methinks, I feel a little ease.
Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led’st me,
That the great child of Honour, Cardinal Wolsey,
Was dead?
Grif. Yes, Madam; but, I think, your grace,
Out of the pain you suffered, gave no ear to it.
Kath. Pr’ythee, good Griſüth, tell me how he died:
If well, he stepped before me, happily,
For
my example.
Grif.
Well, the voice goes, Madam:
For after the stout Earl Northumberland
Arrested him at York, and brought him forward
(As a man sorely tainted) to his answer,
He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill,
He could not sit his mule.
Kath.
Alas! poor man!
Grif. At last, with easy roads, he came to Lei-
cester,
Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,
With all his convent, honorably received him;
To whom he gave these words;— father abbot
An old man, broken with the storms of state,
Is come to lay his weary
bones
among ye;
Give him a little earth for charity!
So went to bed: where eagerly his sickness
Pursued him still; and three nights after this,
About the hour of eight (which he himself
Foretold, should be his last,) full of repentance,
Continual meditations, tears and sorrows,
He gave his honours to the world again,
His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.
Kath. So
may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!
Yet thus far Griffith give me leave to speak him,
And yet with charity, - He was a man
of an unbounded stomach, ever rauking
Himself with princes; one, that by suggestion
Ty'd all the kingdom: simony was fair play;
His own opinion was his law: In the presence

He would say untruths; and be ever double,
Both in his words and meaning: He was never
But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:
His promises were, as he then was, mighty;
But his performance, as he is now, nothing.
Of his own body he was ill; and gave
The clergy ill example.
Grif.
Noble Madam,
Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues
We write in water. May it please your highness
To hear me speak his good now?
Kath.
Yes, good Griffith;
I were malicious else.
Grif.
This Cardinal,
Though from a humble stock, undoubtedly
Was fashion'd to ch honour. From his cradle,
He was a scholar, and a ripe, and good one;
Exceeding wise, fair spoken, and persuading:
Lofty and sour, to them that loved him not;
But, to those men that sought him, sweet as summer.
And though he were unsatisfied in getting,
(Which was a sin) yet in bestowing, madam,
He was most princely: Eyer witness for him
Those twins of learning, that he raised in you,
Ipswich and Oxford! One of which fell with him,
Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;
The other, though unfinished, yet so famous,
So excellent in art, and still so rising,
That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.
His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;
For then, and not till then, he felt himself,
And found the blessedness of being little:
And, to add greater honours to. his age
Than man could give him, he died, fearing God.
Kath. After my death I wish no other herald,
No other speaker of my living actions,
To keep mine honour from corruption,
But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.
Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,

SONG OF THE ANGELS.
PARADISE LOST.-Book III.
No sooner had the Almighty ceased, but all
The multitude of Angels, with a shout
Loud as from numbers without number, sweet
As from blest voices uttering joy, Heaven rung
With jubilee, and loud hosannas filled
The eternal regions: lowly reverent
Towards either throne they bow, and to the ground
With solemn adoration down they cast
Their crowns inwove with amaranth and gold;
Immortal amaranth, a flower which once
In Paradise, fast by the tree of life,
Began to bloom; but soon for man's offence
To Heaven removed, where first it grew,
there
grows,
Apd flowers, aloft, shading the fount of life,
And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven
Rolls o’er Elysian flowers her amber stream:
With these that never fade the spirits elect
Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams;
Now in loose garlands thick thrown off, the bright
Pavement, that like a sea of Jasper shone,
Impurpled with celestial roses smiled.
Then, crowned again, their golden harps they took,
Harps ever tuned, that, glittering by their side,
Like quivers hung, and with preamble sweet
Of charming symphony they introduce
Their sacred song, and waken raptures high;
No voice exempt, no voice but well could join
Melodious part, such concord is in Heaven.
Thee, Father, first they sung, omnipotent,
Immutable, immortal, infinite,
Eternal King; the Author of all being,

Fountain of light, thyself invisible
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sittest
Throned inaccessible, but when thou shadest
The full blaze of thy beams, and through a cloud
Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine,
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear,
Yet dazzle Heaven, that brightest seraphim
Approach not, but with both wings veil their eyes.
Thee next they sang, of all creation first,
Begotten Son, divine similitude,
In whose conspicuous countenance, without cloud
Made visible, the Almighty Father shines,
Whom else no creature can behold; on thee
Impressed the effulgence of his glory bides,
Transfused on thee his ample spirit rests.
He, Heaven of Heavens, and all the powers therein,
By thee created, and by thee threw down
The aspiring dominations: thou that day
Thy Father's dreadful thunder didst not spare,
Nor stop thy flaming chariot wheels, that shook
Heaven's everlasting frame, while o'er the necks
Thou drov'st of warring angels disarrayed.
Back from pursuit thy powers with loud acclaim
Thee only extolled, Son of thy Father's might,
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes.
. Not so on man; him, through their malice fallen,
Father of mercy and grace, thou didst not doom
So strictly, but much more to pity incline:
No sooner did ihy dear and only Son
Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail man
So strictly, but more to pity inclined,
He, to appease thy wrath, and end the strife
Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned,
Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat
Second to thee, offered himself to die
For man's offence. O unexampled love,
Love no where to be found less than divine!
Hail, Son of God, Saviour of men! thy name
Shall be the copious matter of my song,
Henceforth, and never shall my harp thy praise
Forget, nor from thy Father's praise disjoin.

EXTRACT FROM THE TASK.-BOOK II.
COWPER.
In colleges and halls in ancient days,
When learning, virtue, piety, and truth,
Were precious, and inculcated with care,
There dwelt a sage called Discipline. His head,
Not yet by time completely silvered o'er,
Bespoke him past the bounds of freakish youth,
But strong for service still, and unimpaired.
His eye was meek and gentle, and a smile
Play'd on his lips, and in his speech was heard
Paternal sweetness, dignity and love.
The occupation dearest to his heart
Was to encourage goodness. He would stroke
The head of modest and ingenious worth,
That blushed at its own praise; and press the youth
Close to his side that pleased him. Learning grew
Beneath his care a thriving vigorous plant;
The mind was well informed, the passions held
Subordinate, and diligence was choice.
If e'er it chanced, as sometimes chance it must,
That one among so many overleaped
The limits of control, his gentle eye
Grew stern, and darted a severe rebuke:
His frown was full of terror, and his voice
Shook the delinquent with such fits of awe,
As left him not, till penitence had won
Lost favour back again, and closed the breach.
But Discipline, a faithful servant long,
Declined at length into the vale of years:
A palsy struck his arm; his sparkling eye
Was quench'd in rheums of age; his voice, unstrung,
Grew tremulous, and moved derision more
Than rev'rence, in perverse rebellious youth.
So colleges and halls neglected much
Their good old friend; and Discipline at length,
O’erlook’d and unemploy’d, fell sick and died.
Then Study languish’d. Emulation slept,
And Virtue fled. The schools became a scene
Of solemn farce, where Ignorance in stilts,
His cap well lined with logic not his own,

With parrot tongue perform’d the scholar's party
Proceeding soon a graduated dunce.
Then compromise had place, and scrutiny
Became stone blind; precedence went in truck,
And he was competent whose purse was so:
A dissolution of all bonds ensued;
The curbs invented for the mulish mouth
Of headstrong youth were broken; bars and bolts
Grew rusty by disuse; and massy gates
Forgot their office, opening with a touch;
Till gowns at length are found mere masquerade,
The tassel'd cap and the spruce band a jest,
A mockery of the world. What was learned,
If aught was learned in childhood, is forgot;
And such expense, as pinches parents blue,
And mortifies the liberal hand of love,
Is squandered in pursuit of idle sports
And vicious pleasures; buys the boy a name,
That sits a stigma on his father's house,
And cleaves thro’ life inseparably close
To him that wears it.
Now blame we most the nurslings or the nurse?
The children crook’d, and twisted, and deformed,
Through want of care; or her, whose winking eye
And slumbering oscitancy mars the brood?
The nurse, no doubt. Regardless of her charge,
She needs herself correction; needs to learn,
That it is dangerous sporting with the world,
With things so sacred as a nation's trust,
The nurture of her youth, her dearest pledge.
All are not such. I had a brother once-
Peace to the memory of a man of worth,
A man of letters and of manners too!,
Of manners sweet as Virtue always wears,
When gay good nature dresses her in smiles.
He graced a college, in which order yet
Was sacred; and was honoured, loved and wept,
By more than one, themselves conspicuous there.

Of what is excellent in man, they thirst
With such a zeal to be what they approve,
That no restraints can circumscribe them more
Than they themselves by choice, for wisdom's sake.
Nor can example hurt them: what they see
Of vice in others but enhancing more
The charms of virtue in their just esteem.
If such escape contagion, and emerge
Pure from so foul a pool to shine abroad,
And give the world their talents and themselves,
Small thanks to those whose negligence or sloth
Exposed their inexperience to the snare,
And left them to an undirected choice.
ODE TO DISAPPOINTMENT.

Come, Disappointment, come.
Not in thy terrors clad;
Come in thy meekest, saddest guise;
Thy chastening rod but terrifies
The restless and the bad.
But I recline
Beneath thy shrine,
And round my brow resign'd, thy peaceful cypress
twine.
Though Fancy flies away
Before thy hollow tread,
Yet meditation, in her cell,
Hears with faint eye, the lingering knell,
That tells her hopes are dead;
And though the tear
By chance appear,
Yet she can smile and say, my all was not laid here.
Come Disappointment, come.
Though from Hope's summit hurl'd
Still rigid nurse thou art forgiven
For thou severe wert sent from heaven

To turn my eye
From vanity
And point to scenes of bliss that never,
What is this passing scene?
A peevish April day!
A little sun, a little rain,
And then night sweeps along the plain,
And all things fade away.
Man (soon discuss'd)
Yields up his trust,
And all his hopes and fears lie with him in the dust.
Oh! what is Beauty's power
It flourishes and dies;
Will the cold earth its silence break,
To tell how soft, how smooth a cheek
Beneath its surface lies?
Mute, mute is all
O'er Beauty's fall;
Her praise resounds no more when mantled in her
pall.
The most beloved on earth
Not long survives to day;
So music past is obsolete,
And yet 'twas sweet 'twas passing sweet,
But now tis gone away.
Thus does the shade
In memory fade,
When in forsaken tomb the form beloved is laid.
Then since this world is vain,
And volatile and fleet,
Why should I lay up earthly joys
Where rust corrupts, and moth destroys,
And cares and sorrows eat?
Why fly from ill
With anxious skill,
When soon this hand will freeze, this throbbing heart
be still.

MEETING OF SATAN AND DEATH AT
THE GATE OF HELL.
MILTON.
Meanwhile the adversary of God and man,
Satan, with thoughts inflamed of highest design,
Puts on swift wings, and towards the gates of Hell
Explores his solitary flight: sometimes
He scours the right hand coast, sometimes the left,
Now shaves with level wing the deep, then soars
Up to the fiery concave towering high.
As when far off at sea a fleet descried
Hangs in the clouds, by equinoctial winds
Close sailing from Bengala, or the isles
Or Tennate and Tidore, whence merchants bring
Their spicy drugs; they, on the trading flood,
Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape,
Ply stemming nightly toward the pole: so seemed
Far off the flying fiend. At last appear
Hell hounds, high reaching to the horrid roof,
And thrice three fold the gates: three folds were brass,
Three iron, three of adamantine rock
Impenetrable, impaled with circling fire,
Yet unconsumed. Before the gates there sat
On either side a formidable shape;
The one seemed woman to the waist, and fair,
But ended foul in many a scaly fold
Voluminous and vast, a serpent armed
With mortal sting; about her middle round
A cry of hell-hounds, never ceasing, barked
With wide Cerberean mouths full loud, and rung

A hideous peal. Far less abhorr'd than these
Vexed Scylla, bathing in the sea that parts
Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore:
Nor uglier follow the night hag, when, called
In secret,. riding through the air she comes,
Lured with the smell of infant blood, to dance
With Lapland witches, while the labouring moon
Eclipses at their charms. The other shape,
If shape it might be called that shape had none
Distinguishable in member, joint or limb;
Or substance might be called that shadow seemed;
For each seemed either; black it stood as night,
Fierce as ten furies, terrible as Hell,
And shook a dreadful dart; what seemed his head
The likeness of a kingly crown had on.
Satan was now at hand; and from his seat
The monster moving, onward came as fast
With horrid strides; Hell trembled as he strode.
The undaunted fiend what this might be admired,
Admired, not feared: God and his son except
Created thing naught valued he, nor shunned.
And with disdainful look thus first began.
“ Whence and what art thou, execrable shape!
That dar’st, though grim and terrible, advance
Thy miscreated front athwart my way
To yonder gates? through them I mean to pass,
That be assured, without leave asked of thee:
Retire, or taste thy tolly; and learn by proof,
Hell-born! not to contend with spirits of Heaven!"
To whom the goblin, full of wrath replied.
« Art thou that traitor angel, art thou he,
Who first broke peace in heaven, and faith, till then
Unbroken, and in proud rebellious arms
Drew after him the third part of Heaven's sons
Conjured against the Highest, for which both thou
And they, outcast from God, are here condemned
To waste eternal days in woe and pain?
And reckonest thou thyself with spirits of Heaven,
Hell-doomed! and breath'st defiance here and scorn,
Where I reign king, and, to inflame thee more,
Thy king and lord! Back to thy punishment,

False fugitive! and to thy speed add wings,
Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue
Thy lingering, or with one stroke of this dart
Strange horror seize thee, and pangs unfelt before.”
So spake the grisly terror, and in shape,
So speaking and so threat’ning, grew tenfold
More dreadful and deformed: on the other side,
Incensed with indignation, Satan stood
Unterrified, and like a comet burned,
That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge
In the arctic sky, and from his horrid hair
Shakes pestilence and war. Each at the head
Levelled his deadly aim; their fatal hands
No second stroke intend; and such a frown
Each cast at the other, as when two black clouds
With heaven's artillery fraught, come rattling on
Over the Caspian, then stand front to front
Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow
To join their dark encounter in mid air:
So frowned the mighty combatants, that hell
Grew darker at their frown; so matched they stood;
For never but once more was either like
To meet so great a foe: and now great deeds
Had been achieved, whereof all Hell had rung,
Had not the snaky soceress that sat
Fast by Hell gate, and kept the fatal key,
Risen, and with hideous outcry rushed between.

self to be well remembered) of an Indian Chief called
Hyder Ali Khan. This man possessed the western,
as the company under the Nabob of Arcot does thé
eastern division of the Carnatick. It was among the
leading measures in the design of this cabal (accord-
ing to their own emphatic language) to extirpate this
Hyder Ali. They declared the Nabob of Arcot to
be his sovereign, and himself to be a rebel, and pub-
licly invested their instrument with the sovereignty
of the kingdom of Mysore. - But their victim was not
of the passive kind. They were soon obliged to con-
clude a treaty of peace and close alliance with this
rebel, at the gates of Madras. Both before and since
that treaty, every principle of policy pointed out
this power as a natural alliance; and on his part,
it was courted by every sort of amicable office. But
the cabinet council of English creditors would not
suffer their Nabob of Arcot to sign the treaty, nor
even to give to a prince, at least his equal, the ordi-
nary
titles of respect and courtesy. From that time
forward, a continued plot was carried on within the
divan, black and white, of the Nabob of Arcot,
for
the destruction of Hyder Ali. As to the outward
members of the double, or rather treble government

of Madras, which had signed the treaty, they were
always prevented by some over-ruling influence
(which they do not describe, but which cannot be
misunderstood) from performing what justice and in-
terest combined so evidently to enforce.
When at length Hyder Ali found that he had to do
with men who either would sign no convention, or
whom no treaty, and no signature could bind, and who
were the determined enemies of human intercourse
itself, he decreed to make the country possessed by
these incorrigible and predestinated criminals a memo-
rable example to mankind. He resolved, in the
gloomy recesses of a mind capacious of such things,
to leave the whole Carnatick an everlasting monu-
ment of vengeance, and to put perpetual desolation
as a barrier between him and those, against whom
the faith which holds the moral elements of the world
together, was no protection. He became, at length,
so confident of his force, and so collected in his
might, that he made no secret whatever of his dread-
ful resolution. Ilaving terminated his disputes with
every enemy, and every rival, who buried their mu-
tual animosities in their common interest against the
creditors of the Nabob of Arcot, he drew from every
quarter whatever a savage ferocity could add to his
new rudiments in the arts of destruction; and com-
pounding all the materials of fury, havoc and desc-
lation, into one black cloud, he hung for a while on
the declivities of the mountains. Whilst the authors
of all these evils were idly and stupidly gazing on this
menacing meteor, which blackened all the horizon,
it suddenly burst and poured down the whole of its
contents upon the plains of the Carnatick. Then
ensued a scene of woe, the like of which no eye had
seen, no heart conceived, and which no tongue can
adequately tell. All the horrors of war before known
or heard of, were mercy to that new havoc. A storm
of universal fire blasted every field, consumed every
house, and destroyed every temple. The miserable
inhabitants, flying from their flaming villages, in part
were slaughtered; others, without regard to sex to

age, to rank, or sacredness of function, fathers torn
from children, husbands from wives, enveloped in a
whirlwind of cavalry, and amidst the goading spears
of drivers, and the trampling of pursuing horses, were
swept into captivity, in an unknown and hostile land.
Those who were able to evade this tempest, fled, to
the walled cities. But escaping from fire, sword and
exile, they fell into the jaws of famine.
The alms of the settlement, in this dreadful ex-
igency, were certainly liberal; and all was done by
charity that private charity could do: but it was a
people in beggary; it was a nation which stretched
out its hands for food. For months together, these
creatures of sufferance, whose very excess and luxu-
ry in their most plenteous days, had fallen short of
the allowance of our austerest fasts, silent, patient,
resigned, without sedition or disturbance, almost
without complaint, perished by a hundred a day in
the streets of Madras; every day seventy at least
laid their bodies in the streets, or in the glacis of
Tanjore, and expired of famine in the granary of
India.
For eighteen months, without intermission, this
destruction raged from the gates of Madras to the
gates of Tanjore; and so completely did these mas-
ters in their art, Hyder Ali, and his more ferocious
son, absolve themselves of their impious vow, that
when the British armies traversed, as they did, the
Carnatick for hundreds of miles in all directions,
through the whole line of their march they did not
see one man, not one woman, not one child, not one
four footed beast of any description whatever. One
dead uniform silence reigned over the whole region.

They one day shall not drivel; and their pride
On this reversion takes up ready praise,
At least their own: their future selves applaud;
How excellent that life they ne'er will lead!
Time lodged in their own hands is folly's vails;
That lodged in fate's, to wisdom they consign;
The thing they can't but purpose, they postpone;
'Tis not in Folly, not to scorn a fool;
And scarce in human wisdom, to do more.
All promise is poor dilatory man,
And that through every stage: when young, indeed,

In full content we sometimes nobly rest
Unanxious for ourselves; and only wish,
As duteous sons, our fathers were more wise.
At thirty man suspects himself a fool;
Knows it at forty, and reforms his plan;
At fifty chides his infamous delay,
Pushes his prudent purpose to resolve;
In all the magnanimity of thought
Resolves; and re-resolves; then dies the same.

ON THE REGULATION OF THE THOUGHTS.
PALEY.
Perhaps almost every man living has a particular
train of thought, into which his mind falls, when at
leisure from the impressions and ideas that occasion-
ally excite it: perhaps also, the train of thought here
spoken of, more than any other thing, determines the
character. It is of the utmost consequence,
there-
fore, that this property of our constitution be well
regulated.
17

EXERCISES
In a moral view, I shall not, I believe, be contre-
dicted when I say, that, if one train of thinking be
more desirable than another, it is that which regards
the phenomena of nature with a constant reference to
their Supreme intelligent author. To have made
this the ruling, the habitual sentiment of our minds,
is to have laid the foundation of every thing that is
religious. The world from thenceforth becomes a
temple, and life itself one continued act of adoration.
The change is no less than this, that, whereas for-
merly God was seldom in our thoughts, we can now
scarcely look upon any thing without perceiving its
relation to him. Every organized natural body, in
the provisions it contains, testifies the Creator's care.
We are on all sides surrounded by such bodies; ex-
amined in their parts, wonderfully curious, compared
with one another, no less wonderfully diversified.
So that the mind, as well as the eye, may either ex-
patiate in variety and multitude, or fix itself down to
the investigation of a particular division of sci-
ence. And, in either case it will rise
up
from
its occupation, possessed by the subject in a ve-
ry different manner, and with a very different de-
gree of influence, from what a mere assent to any
verbal proposition which can be formed concerning
the existence of the Deity, (at least that merely com-
plying assent with which those about us are satisfied
and with which we are too apt to satisfy ourselves,)
can or will produce on our minds. More especially
may this difference be perceived, in the degree of ad-
miration and awe, with which the Divinity is regard-
ed, when represented to the understanding, by its
own remarks, its own reflections, and its own reason-
ings, compared with what is excited by any language
that can be used by others. The works of nature
require only to be contemplated. When contempla-
ted, they have every thing in them which can aston-
ish by their greatness: for of the vast scale of opera-
tion, through which our discoveries carry us, at one
end, we see an intelligent power arranging planetary
systems, fixing, for instance, the trajectory of sa-

turn, or constructing a ring of one hundred thou-
sand miles diameter to surround his body, and be
suspended like a magnificent arch over the heads of
his inhabitants; and, at the other bending a hooked
tooth, concerting and providing an appropriate mech-
anism, for the clasping and reclasping of the fila-
ments of the feather of a humming bird. We have
proof, not only of both these works proceeding from
an intelligent agent, but of their proceeding from the
same agent: for, in the first place, we can trace an
identity of plan, a connection of system, from Saturn
to our own globe; and when arrived upon our own
globe, in the second place, pursue the connection
through all the organized, especially the animated,
bodies, which it supports. We can observe marks
of a common relation, as well to one another, as to
the elements of which the habitation is composed.-
Therefore one mind hath planned, or at least pre-
scribed a general plan for all these productions,
One Being has been concerned in all.
Under this stupendous Being we live. Our happi-
ness, our existence are in his hands. All we expect
must come from him. Nor ought we to feel inse-
In every nature, and in every portion of na-
ture, which we can descry, we find attention be-
stowed even on the minutest parts. The hinges in the
wings of an earwig, and the joints of its antennæ, are
as highly wrought as if the Creator had nothing else
to finish.
We see no signs of diminution of care by
multiplicity of objects, or of distraction of thought
by variety. We have no reason to fear, therefore,
our being forgotten, or overlooked or neglected.

Who durst defy the omnipotent to arms.

To mortal men, he with his horrid crew
Lay vanquished, rolling in the fiery gulf,
Confounded, though immortal: but his doom
Reserved him to more wrath; for now the thought
Both of lost happiness, and lasting pain,
Torments him; round he throws his baleful eyes,
That witnessed huge affliction and dismay,
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate:
At once, as far as angels ken, he views
The dismal situation waste and wild;
A dungeon horrible on all sides round,
As one great furnace flamed; yet from those flames
No light, but rather darkness visible
Served only to discover sights of wo,
Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes.
That comes to all; but torture without end
Still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed
With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed:
Such place eternal Justice had prepared
For these rebellious; here their prison ordained
In utter darkness, and their portion set
As far removed from God and light of heaven,
As from the centre thrice to the utmost pole.
NINTH CHAPTER OF ST. JOHN.
And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was
blind from his birth. And his disciples asked him, say-
ing, Master, who did sin, this man or his parents, that he
was born blind? Jesus answered, Neither hath this man
sinned nor his parents: but that the works of God should
be made manifest in him. I must work the works of
him that sent me, while it is day: the night cometh
when no man can work. As long as I am in the
world, I am the light of the world.

thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay

of the spittle, and he anointed the eyes of the blind
man with the clay, and said unto him, Go wash in
the pool of Siloam (which is by interpretation, Sent.)
He went his way therefore, and washed, and came
seeing.
The neighbours therefore and they which before
had seen him, that he was blind, said, Is not this he
that sat and begged? Some said, This is he, others
said, He is like him: but he said I am he. There-
fore said they unto him, How were thine eyes opened?
He answered and said, A Man that is called Jesus,
made clay, and anointed mine eyes, and said unto me
Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I went and
washed and I received sight. Then said they unto
him Where is he? He said, I know not.
They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime
was blind. And it was the sabbath day, when Jesus
made the clay, and opened his eyes. "Then again
the Pharisees also asked him how he had received
He said unto them, He put clay upon
mine eyes, and I washed and do see. Therefore
said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God,
because he keepeth not the sabbath day. Others
said, How can a man that is a sinner, do such mira-
cles? And there was a division among them. They
say unto the blind man again, What sayest thou of
him that he hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is
a Prophet.
But the Jews did not believe concerning him that
he had been blind, and received his sight, until they
called the parents of him that had received his sight.
And they asked them, saying, Is this your Son, who
ye say was born blind? how then doth he now see?
His parents answered them and said, We know that
this is our son, and that he was born blind: But by
what means he now seeth, we know not, or who hath
opened his eyes we know not: he is of
age,
he shall speak for himself.
These words spake his parents because they feared
the Jews: for the Jews had agreed already that if
any man did confess that he was Christ, he should

be put out of the synagogue.
Therefore said his
parents, He is of age, ask him.
Then again called they the man that was blind,
and said, Give God the praise: we know that this
man is a sinner. He answered and said, Whether he
be a sinner or no, I know not: one thing I know,
that whereas I was blind now I see. Then said they
to him again, What did he to thee? How opened he
thine eyes? He answered them, I have told you
already, and ye did not hear: wherefore would ye
hear it again? Will ye also be his disciples? Then
they reviled him and said, Thou art his disciple; but
we are Moses' disciples. We know that God spake
unto Moses: As for this fellow, we know not from
whence he is. The man answered and said unto
them, Why herein is a marvellous thing, that ye know
not from whence he is and yet he hath opened mine
eyes. Now we know that God heareth not sinners:
but if any man be a worshipper of God, and doeth
his will, him he heareth. Since the world began was
it not heard that any man opened the eyes of one
that was born blind. If this man were not of God,
he could do nothing. They answered and said unto
him, Thou wast altogether born in sins, and dost thou
teach us? And they cast him out.
Jesus heard that they had cast him out; and when
he had found him, he said unto him, Dost thou be-
lieve on the Son of God? He answered and said
Who is he Lord? that I might believe on him! and
Jesus said unto him, Thou hast both seen him, and it
is he that talketh with thee. And he said, Lord, I
believe. And he worshipped him.
And Jesus said, For judgment I am come into
this world: that they which see not, might see; and
that they which see, might be made blind. And
some of the Pharisees which were with him heard
these words, and said unto him, Are we blind also?
Jesus said unto them, If ye were blind, ye should
have no sin: but now ye say, We see; Therefore
your sin remaineth.

A STATE OF PROBATION CONSIDERED,
With reference to Divine Goodness.
PALEY.
Of all views under which human life has been
considered, the most reasonable, in my judgment, is
that which regards it as a state of probation.--It is
not a state of unmixed happiness simply: it is not a
state of designed misery, or of misery simply: it is
not a state of retribution: it is not a state of punish-

ment. It suits with none of these suppositions. It
accords much better with the idea of its being a con-
dition calculated for the production, exercise and im-
provement, of moral qualities, with a view to a future
state, in which, these qualities, after being so pro-
duced, exercised, and improved, may, by a new and
more favourable constitution of things receive their
final reward.
If it be said that this is to enter upon a religious,
rather than a philosophical consideration, I answer
that the name of religion ought to form no objection,
if it shall appear, that the more religious our views
are, the more probable they become.
It
may be observed that a future state, alone rec-
tifies all disorders; and if it can be shewn that the
appearance of disorder, is consistent with the uses of
life as a preparatory state, and that, in some respects
it promotes these uses, then so far as this hypothe-
sis may be accepted, the ground of the difficulty is
removed.
In the wide scale of human condition, there is not
perhaps one of its manifold diversities which does not
bear upon the design here suggested. Virtue is in-
finitely various. There is no situation in which a
rational being is placed, from that of the best in-
structed christian, down to the condition of the rudest
barbarian, which affords not room for moral agency,
for the acquisition, exercise, and display of voluntary
qualities, good and bad. Health and sickness, en-
joyment and suffering, riches and poverty, knowl-
edge and ignorance, power and subjection, liberty
and bondage, civilization and barbarism, have all
their offices and duties, all serve for the formation of
character. The best dispositions may subsist under
the most depressed the most afflicted fortunes. A
West-Indian slave, who amidst his wrongs, retains
his benevolence, is among the foremost of human
candidates for the rewards of virtue. The kind mas-
ter of such a slave, he who in the exercise of an
inordinate authority postpones his own interest to his
slave's comfort, is likewise a meritorious character:

205
but he is inferiour to his slave. But what we con-
tend for is that these destinies, opposite as they may
be in other respects, are both trials.
Now, if it be true that our ultimate and eternal
happiness will depend not on the temporary condition
in which we are cast, but our behaviour in it, then
it is a much more fit subject of chance, than we us-
ually allow or apprehend it to be, in what manner
the variety of external circumstances which subsist
in the human world, is distributed amongst the in-
dividuals of the species. Of two agents who stand
indifferent to the moral governor of the universe one
may be exercised by riches, the other by poverty:
both have their duties and temptations, not less ar-
duous or dangerous in one case than the other; but
if the final award follow the character, the original
distribution of the circumstances under which that
character is formed, may be defended upon princi-
ples of justice.
The appearance of casualty which attends the oc-
currences and events of life, not only does not inter-
fere with its uses, as a state of probation, but pro-
motes them.
Passive virtues, of all others, the severest and the
most sublime, of all others, perhaps, the most accep-
table to the deity, would, it is evident, be excluded
from a constitution, in which happiness and misery al-
ways followed virtue and vice. Patience and com-
posure under distress, affliction and pain; a stead-
fast keeping up of our confidence in God, and
of our reliance upon his final goodness, when every
thing is adverse and discouraging; and (what is no
less difficult to retain) a cordial desire for the hap-
piness of others, even when we are deprived of our
own: these dispositions which constitute, perhaps,
the perfection of our moral nature, would not have
found their proper object and office in a state of avow-
ed retribution; and in which, consequently, endu-
rance of evil would be only submission to punishment.

distress. But," misery, to be the proper object of
mitigation, or of that benevolence which endeavours
to relieve must be really or apparently casual. It is
upon such sufferings alone that benevolence can ope-
rate. Were there no evils in the world, but what were
punishments, properly and intelligibly such, benevo-
fence would only stand in the way of justice. Such
evils, consistently with the administration of moral
government, could not be prevented or alleviated;
that is to say could not be remitted in whole or in
part, except by the authority which inflicted them,
or by an appellate, or superior, authority. This con-
sideration, which is founded in our most acknowl-
edged apprehensions of the nature of penal justice,
may possess its weight in the divine counsels. Vir
tue is, perhaps, the greatest of all ends. In human
Beings, relative virtues form a large part of the whole.
But, relative virtue presupposes, not only the exist-
ence of evil, without which it could have no object,
no material to work upon, but that evils be, apparent-
ly at least, misfortunes.
I have already observed that, when we let in
religious considerations, we often let in light upon
the difficulties of nature. So in the fact now to
be accounted for, the usual degree of human happi-
ness, that degree may be better suited to a state of
trial and probation than a greater portion. The
truth is, we are rather too much delighted with the
world than too little. Imperfect, broken and preca-
rious, as our pleasures are, they are more than suffic-
ient to attach us to the eager pursuit of them. A re-
gard to a future state, can hardly keep its place as
it is. Designed, as we are, to be influenced by that
regard, might not a more indulgent system, a higher
or more uninterrupted state of gratification have inter-
fered with such design? In a religious view, then,
privation, disappointment and satiety, are not without
the most salutary tendencies.

Coriolanus, in mean apparel, disguised and mufled.
Cor. A goodly city in this Antium. City,
Tis I that made thy widows; many an heir
Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
Have I heard groan, and drop: then know me not;
Lest that thy wives with spits, and boys with stones,
Enter a Citizen.
In puny battle slay me.—Save you, sir.

Direct me, if it be your will,
Where great Aufidius lies; Is he in Antium?
Cit. He is, and feasts the nobles of the state,
At his house this night.

Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
Whose hours, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
Are still together, who twin, as 'twere in love
Unseparable, shall within this hour,
On a dissention of a doit, break out
To bitterest enmity: So fellest foes,
Whose passions and whose plots have broke their
sleep
To take the one the other, by some chance,
Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends,
And interjoin their issues. So with me:
My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
This enemy town.—I'll enter: if he slay me,
He does fair justice; if he give me way,
I'll do his country service.

Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
A heart of wreak in thee, that will revenge
Thine own particular wrongs, and stop these maims
Of shame seen through thy country, speed thee

And make my misery serve thy turn; so use it,
That my revengeful services may prove
As benefits to thee; for I will fight
Against my canker'd country with the spleen
Of all the under fiends. But if so be

Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,

Or lose mine arm for it: Thou hast beat me out

That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!

That ever lived in the tide of times.
Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!

Which like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue;-
A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
Domestic fury, and fierce civil strife,
Shall cumber all the parts of Italy:
Blood and destruction shall be so in use,
And dreadful objects so familiar,
That mothers shall but smile, when they behold
Their infants quartered by the hands of war;
All pity choked with custom of fell deeds;
And Cæsar's spirit, raging for revenge,
With Até by his side, come hot from hell,
Shall in these confines, with a monarch's voice,
Cry, Havoc! and let slip the dogs of war!

THE GOODNESS OF THE DEITY.
PALEY.
The proof of the divine Goodness, rests upon two
propositions, each capable of being sustained by ob-
servations drawn from the appearances of nature.
The first is that in a vast plurality of instances, in
which contrivance is perceived, the design of the
contrivance is beneficial.


## p. 213 (#219) ############################################

213
The second “that the Deity has superadded plea-
sure to animal sensations, beyond what was neces-
sary
for any other purpose; or, when the purpose, so
far as it was necessary, might have been effected by
the operation of pain.
First, No productions of nature display contri-
vance so manifestly as the parts of animals: and the
parts of animals, have, I believe, universally, a real,
and, with very few exceptions, a known and intelli-
gent, subserviency to the use of the animal. Now,
when the multitude of animals is considered, the num-
ber of parts in each, their figure and fitness, the fa-
culties depending upon them, the variety of species,
the complexity of structure, we can never reflect,
without the profoundest adoration, upon the charac-
ter of that Being from whom all these things have
proceeded: we cannot help acknowledging what an
exertion of benevolence creation was, how minute
in its care, how vast in its comprehension.
When we appeal to the parts and faculties of ani-
mals, we state, I conceive, the proper medium of
proof for the conclusion which we wish to establish.
The benevolence of the Deity, can only be considered
in relation to sensitive being. The parts therefore,
especially the limbs and senses, of animals, although
they constitute in mass and quantity, a small portion
of the material creation, yet, since they alone are
instruments of perception, they compose the whole
of visible nature estimated with a view to the dispo-
sition of its Author. Consequently, it is by these
that we are to prove, that the world was made with a
benevolent design.
Nor is the design abortive. It is, after all, a happy
world. The air, the earth, the water teem with de-
lighted existence.
In a spring noon, or a summer evening on which
ever side I turn my eyes, myriads of happy beings
crowd upon my view. i The insect youth are on
the wing." i Swarms of new born flies are trying
their pinions in the air. Their sportive motions, their
wanton images, their gratuitous activity, their con-

tinual change of place without use or purpose, testify
their joy, and the exultation which they feel in their
lately discovered faculties. A bee among the flowers,
in spring, is one of the cheerfullest objects that can
be looked upon. Its life appears to be all enjoy-
ment; so busy, so pleased it seems: yet it is only a
specimen of insect life, with which, because the ani-
mal is half domesticated, we are better acquainted
than with that of others. The whole winged insect
tribe, it is probable, are equally intent upon their
proper employments, and under every variety of con-
stitution, gratified, and perhaps equally, by the offices
which the Author of their nature has assigned to
them.
Nor are the waters less peopled with active and
happy inhabitants. The margins of rivers, of lakes
and of the sea itself produce shoals of the fry of fish.
These are so happy that they know not what to do
with themselves. Their attitudes, their vivacity,
their wanton frolics, their leaps out of the water shew
their excess of spirits and are simply the effects of
that excess.
What scene can present a finer picture of calm
enjoyment than large herds of cattle when grazing
and reposing in the meadows; intermingled with
flocks of sheep accompanied by their frisking young.
If, moreover, we reflect that each individual of the
numerous species which cover the earth or fill the
air and the waters, is in a state of positive enjoyment,
what a scene of gratification and pleasure is brought
before our view when we consider the whole collec-
tively.
The
youug of all animals appear to me to receive
pleasure, simply from the exercise of their limbs and
bodily faculties. A child is delighted with speaking
without having any thing to say, and with walking
without knowing where to go. And, prior to both
these, I am disposed to believe the waking hours
of infancy are agreeably taken up with the exercise
of vision, or, perhaps, more properly speaking with
learning to see.

But it is not for youth alone that the great parent of
creation hath provided. Happiness is found in the
arm chair of dozing age, as well as in the sprightli-
ness of the dance, and the animation of the chace.
To novelty, to acuteness of sensation, to hope, to
ardour of pursuit, succeeds, what is, in no consider-
able degree, and equivalent for them all,“ perception
of ease.”
This perception" often times renders old age a
condition of great comfort; especially when riding
at its anchor, after a busy and tempestuous liſe.
The appearance of satisfaction, with which most ani-
mals, as their activity subsides, seek and enjoy rest,
affords reason to believe, that this source of gratifica-
tion is appointed to advanced life, under all, or most,
of its varied forms. In the species with which we
are best'acquainted, namely our own, I am far, even
as an observer of human life, from thinking, that
youth is its happiest season, much less the only hap-
py one; as a christian, I am willing to believe that
there is a great deal of truth, in the following repro-
sentation given by a very pious writer as well as ex-
cellent man. “To the intelligent and virtuous, old
age presents a scene of tranquil enjoyments, of obe-
dient appetites, of well regulated affections, of ma-
turity in knowledge, and of calm preparation for
immortality. In this serene and dignified state, pla-
ced, as it were, on the confines of two worlds, the
mind of a good man, reviews what is past with the
complacency of an approving conscience, and looks
forward with humble confidence in the mercy of God
and with devout aspirations, towards his eternal and
ever increasing Favor.
What is seen in different stages of the same life
is still more exemplified in the lives of different ani-
mals. Animal enjoyments are infinitely diversified.
The modes of life, to which the organization of dif-
ferent animals respectively determines them, are not
only of various, but of opposite kinds. Yet each is
happy in its own. For instance, animals of prey
live much alone; those of milder constitution in so-

sheep which lives in flocks, are not more happy in a

than is the pike or the lion, with the deep solitudes
of the pool or the forest.

With few associates, and not wishing more.
Here much I ruminate, as much I may,
With other views of men and manners now
Than once, and others of a life to come.
I see that all are wanderers, gone astray
Each in his own delusions; they are lost
In chase of fancied happiness, still woo'd
And never won. Dream after dream ensues;
And still they dream that they shall still succeed,
And still are disappointed Rings the world -
With the vain stir. I sum up half mankind,
And add two thirds of the remaining half,
And find the total of their hopes and fears
Dreams, empty dreams. The million flit as gay,
As if created only like the fly,
That spreads his motly wings in the eye of noon,
To sport their season,
and be seen no more.
The rest are sober dreamers, grave and wise,
And frequent with discoveries new and rare,
Some write a narrative of wars, and feats
Of heroes little known; and call the rant
A history: describe the man, of whom
His own coevals took but little note,
And paint his person, character, and views,
As they had known him from his mother's womb.
They disentangle from the puzzled skein,

The threads of politic and shrewd design,
That ran through all his purposes and charge

Or having, kept concealed. Some drill and bore

That he who made it, and revealed its date
To Moses, was mistaken in its age.

GENESIS, CHAPTER VII.
And the Lord said unto Noah, come thou, and all
thy house into the ark: for thee have I seen right-
eous before me in this generation. Of every clean
beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and
his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two,
the male and his female. Of fowls also of the air by
sevens, the male and his female; to keep seed alive
upon the face of all the earth. For yet seven days
and I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days
and forty nights: and every living substance that I
have made, will I destroy from off the face of the
earth.
And Noah did according unto all that the Lord
commanded him. And Noah was six hundred years
old, when the flood of waters was upon the earth.
And Noah went in and his sons, and his wife, and
his sons wives with him, into the ark, because of the
waters of the floud. Of clean beasts and of beasts

that are not clean, and of fowls, and of every thing
that creepeth upon the earth, there went in two and
two unto Noah into the ark, the male and the female
as God had commanded Noah.
And it came to pass
after seven days, that the waters of the flood were
upon the earth.
In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the
second month, the seventeenth day of the month, the
same day were all the fountains of the great deep
broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.
And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty
nights.
In the self same day entered Noah, and Shem,
and Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's
wife, and the wives of his sons with them, into the
ark: They, and every beast after his kind, and all
the cattle after their kind, and every creeping thing
that creepeth upon the earth after his kind, and ev-
ery fowl after his kind, every bird of every sort.
And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and
two of all flesh, wherein is the breath of life. And
they went in male and female of all flesh as God had
commanded him. And the Lord shut him in.
And the flood was forty days upon the earth: and
the waters increased, and bare up the ark, and it
above the earth. And the waters prevailed
and were increased greatly upon the earth; and the ark
went up on the face of the waters. And the waters
prevailed exceedingly upon the earth, and all the
high hills that were under the whole heaven, were
covered. Fifteen cubits upward did the waters pre-
vail; ard the mountains were covered. And all flesh
died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of
cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that
creepeth upon the earth, and every man. All in
whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in
the dry land died. And every living substance was
destroyed which was upon the face of the ground,
both man and cattle, and the creeping things, and
the fowl of the heaven. And they were destroyed
from the earth: and Noah only remained alive and
they that were with him in the ark. And the waters

CHARACTER OF HOWARD.
FOSTER.
In decision of character no man ever exceeded, or
ever will exceed, the late illustrious Howard.
The energy of his determination was so great, that
if instead of being habitual, it had been shewn only
for a short time on particular occasions, it would have
appeared a vehement impetuosity;' but by being un-
intermitted, it had an equability of manner which
scarcely appeared to exceed the tone of a calm con-
stancy, it was so totally the reverse of any thing like
turbulence or agitation. It was the calmness of an
intensity, kept uniform by the nature of the human
mind forbidding it to be more, and by the character
of the individual forbidding it to be less. The habit-
ual passion of his mind was a measure of feeling al-
most equal to the temporary extremes and paroxisms
of common minds: as a great river, in its customary
state, is equal to a small or moderate one when swol-
len to a torrent.
The moment of finishing his plans in deliberation
and commencing them in action, was the same. I
wonder what must have been the amount of that bribe
in emolument or pleasure, that would have detained
him a week inactive after their final adjustment.
The law which carries water down a declivity was
not more unconquerable and invariable than the de-
termination of his feelings toward the main object.
The importance of this object held his faculties in a
state of excitement which was too rigid to be affected
by lighter interests and on which therefore the beau-
ties of nature and of art had no power.
He had no
leisure feeling which he could spare to be diverted
among the innumerable varieties of the extensive
scene which he traversed: all his subordinate feel-
ings lost their separate existence and operation, by
falling into the grand one. There have not been
wanting trivial minds, to mark this as a fault in his
character. But the mere men of taste ought to be
silent respecting such a man as Howard; he is above
their sphere of judgment. The invisible spirits, who

fulfil their commissions of philanthropy among mor-
tals, do not care about pictures, statues, and sumptu-
ous buildings; and no more did he, when the time in
which he must have inspected and admired them,
would have been taken from the work to which he
had consecrated his life. The curiosity which he
might feel, was reduced to wait till the hour should
arrive, when its qualification should be presented by
conscience, which kept a scrupulous charge of all
his time, as the most sacred duty of that hour. If
he was still at every hour, when it came, fated to feel
the attractions of the fine arts but the second claim,
they might be sure of their revenge; for no other
man will ever visit Rome under such a despotic con-
sciousness of duty as to refuse himself time for sur-
veying the magnificence of its ruins. Such a sin
against taste is very far beyond the reach of common
saintship to commit. It implied an inconceivable
severity of conviction, that he had one thing to do, and
that he who would do some one great thing in this
short life, must apply himself to the work with such
a concentration of his forces, as to idle specta-
tors, who live only to amuse themselves, looks like
insanity.
His attention was so strongly and tenaciously fixed
on his object, that even at the greatest distance, like
the Egyptian pyramids to travellers, it appeared to
him with a luminous distinctness as if it had been
nigh, and beguiled the toilsome length of labour and
enterprise by which he was to reach it.
It was so
conspicuous before him, that not a step deviated from
the direction, and every moment and every day was
an approximation.
As his method referred every
thing he did and thought to the end, and as his exe-
cution did not relax for a moment, he made the trial,
so seldom made, what is the utmost effect which may
be granted to the last possible efforts of a human
agent: and therefore what he did not accomplish, he
might conclude to be placed beyond the sphere of
mortal activity, and calmly leave to the immediate
disposal of Omnipotence,

THE GASCON PEASANT AND THE FLIES.
At Neuchatel, in France, where they prepare
Cheeses, that set us longing to be mites,
There dwelt a farmer's wife, famed for her rare
Skill in these small quadrangular delights.
Where they were made they were sold for the im-
mense
Price of three sous apiece,
But as salt water made their charms increase,
In England, the fixed rate was eighteen pence.
This damsel had, to keep her in her farm,
To milk her cows, and feed her hogs,
A Gascon peasant, with a sturdy arm
For digging, or for carrying logs:
But in his noddle, weak as any baby,
In fact a gaby:
And such a glutton when you came to feed him,
That Wantley's dragon, who“ ate barns and churches
As if they were geese and turkeys,”
(Vide the ballad) scarcely could exceed him.
One morn she, had prepared a monstrous bowl
Of cream, like nectar!
And would'nt go to church (good careful soul)
Till she had left it safe with a protector:
So she gave strict injunctions to the Gascon,
To watch it, while his mistress was to mass gone.
Watch it he did; he never took his eyes off
But licked his upper, then his under lip,
And doubled
up
his fist to drive the flies off,
Begrudging them the smallest sip,
Which if they got,
Like my Lord Salisbury, he heaved a sigh,
And cried, “Oh happy, happy fly!
How I do envy you your lot.”
Each moment did his appetite grow stronger;
His bowels yearned;
At length he could not bear it any longer,
But, on all sides his looks he turned,
And, finding that the coast was clear, he quaffed
The whole up at a draught.

Scudding from church, the farmer's wife
Flew to the dairy;
But stood aghast, and could not, for her life,
One sentence mutter,
Until she summoned breath enough to utter
"Holy St. Mary”
And shortly with a face of scarlet,
The vixen (for she was a vixen) flew
Upon the varlet;
Asking the when, and where, and how, and who
Had gulped her cream, nor left an atom?
To which he made not separate replies,
But with a look of excellent digestion
One answer made to every question.

The flies, you rogue!—the flies, your guttling dog!
Behold your
whiskers still are covered thickly;
Thief! Liar! Villain! Gormandizer! Hog!
I'll make you tell another story quickly.”
So out she bounced, and brought with loud alarms,
Two stout Gens d'Armes,
Who bore him to the Judge:-a little prig
With angry bottle nose,
Like a red-cabbage-rose,
While lots of white ones flourish'd on his wig.
Looking ot once both stern and wise,
He turned to the delinquent
And ’gan to question him, and chatechise
As to which way the drink went.
Still the same dogged answers rise,
“ The Flies, my lord,—the flies, the flies.”
“Psha” quoth the Judge, half peevish, and half
pompous,
“Why you're non-compos;
You should have watched the bowl, as she desired
And killed the flies, you stupid clown.”
6. What is it lawful then, the dolt inquired,
“To kill the flies in this here town."?
“The man's an ass!—What question's this?
Lawful! you booby,—to be sure it is:

Constable, catch that thief! may I go hang
If yonder blue bottle (I know his face)
Is not the very leader of the gang
That stole the cream; let me come near it.”
This said, he darted from his place,
And aiming one of his sledge-hammer blows
At a large fly upon the Judge's nose-
The luckless blue bottle he smashed;
And gratified a double grudge,
For the same catapult completely smashed
The bottle nose belonging to the Judge!
EXTRACT FROM FOSTER'S ESSAYS.
I will imagine only one case more, on which you
would eniphatically express your compassion, though
for one of the most daring beings in the creation, a
contemner of God, who explodes his laws by denying
his existence.
If you were so unacquainted with mankind, that
this character might be announced to you as a rare
and singular phenomenon, your conjectures, till you
saw and heard the man, at the nature and extent of
the discipline thro' which he must have advanced,
would be led toward something extraordinary. And
you might think that the term of that discipline must
have been very long; since a quick train of impres-
sions, a short series of mental gradations, within the
little space of a few months and years, would not
seem enough to have matured such supreme and
awful heroism. Surely the creature that thus lifts
his voice, and defies all invisible power within the
possibilities of infinity, challenging whatever unknown
being may hear him, and may appropriate that title
of Almighty which is pronounced in scorn, to evince
his existence, if he will, by his vengeance, was not
as yesterday a little child, that would tremble and cry
at the approach of a diminutive reptile.

But indeed it is heroism no longer, if he knows that
there is no God. The wonder then turns on the
great process, by which a man could grow to the im-
mense intelligence that can know that there is no
God. What ages and what lights are requisite for
THIS attainment! This intelligence involves the
very attributes of Divinity, while a God is denied.
For unless this man is omnipresent, unless he is at
this moment in every place in the universe, he can-
not know but there may be in some place manifesta-
tions of a Deity by which even he would be over-
powered. If he does not know absolutely every
agent in the universe, the one that he does not know
may be God. If he is not himself the chief agent in
the universe, and does not know what is so, that
which is so may be God. If he is not in absolute
possession of all the propositions that constitute uni-
versal truth, the one which he wants may be, that
there is a God. If he cannot with certainty assign
the cause of all that he perceives to exist, that cause
may be a God. If he does not know every thing
that has been done in the immeasurable
ages
that are
past, some things may have been done by a God.
Thus, unless he knows all things, that is, precludes
another Deity by being one himself, he cannot know
that the Being whose existence he rejects, does not
exist. But he must know that he does not exist, else
he deserves equal contempt and compassion for the
temerity with which he firmly avows his rejection
and acts accordingly. And yet a man of ordinary
age and intelligence may present himself to you with
the avowal of being thus distinguished from the
crowd; and if he would describe the manner in which
he has attained this eminence, you would feel a
melancholy interest in contemplating that process of
which the result is so portentous.
If you did not know that there are more than a
few such examples, you would say, in viewing this
result, I should hope this is the consequence of some
malignant intervention só occasional that ages may
pass away before it return among men; some pecu-

liar conjunction of disastrous influences must have

by that energy of evil which acted upon the spirits of
Pharaoh and Epiphanes. But give your own des-
cription of what you have met with in a world which
has been deemed to present in every part the indi-

which have spoken to you from the deeps of crea-

You would find however that those circumstances,
by which even a man who had been presented from
his infancy with the ideas of religion, could be elated
into a contempt of its great object, were far from be-
ing extraordinary. They might have been met by
any man, whose mind had been cultivated and ex-
ercised enough to feel interested about holding any
system of opinions at all, whose pride had been
gratified in the consciousness of having the liberty of
selecting and changing opinions, and whose habitual
assent to the principles of religion had neither the
firmness resulting from decisive arguments, nor the
warmth of pious affection. Such a person had only,
in the first place to come into intimate acquaintance
with a man, who had the art of alluding to a sacred
subject in a manner which, without appearing like
intentional contempt, divested it of its solemnity; and
who had possessed himself of a few acute observa-
tions or plausible maxims, not explicitely hostile to
revealed religion, but which, when opportunely
brought into view in connexion with some points of
it, tended to throw a slight degree of doubt on their
truth and authority. Especially if either or both of
these men had any decided moral tendencies and

pursuits of a kind which Christianity condemned, the
friend of intellectual and moral freedom was assiduous
to insinuate, that according to the principles of reason
and nature at least, it would be difficult to prove the
wisdom or the necessity of some of those dictates of
religion, which must however, he admitted, be re-
vered because Divine. Let the mind have once ac-
quired a feeling, as if the sacred system might in
some points be invalidated, the involuntary inference
would be rapidly extended to other parts, and to the
whole. Nor was it long, probably, before this new
instructor plainly avowed his own entire emancipa-
tion from a popular prejudice, to which he was kindly
sorry to find a sensible young man still in captivity.
But he had no doubt that the deductions of enlight-
ened reason would successfully appeal to every libe-
ral mind. And accordingly, after perhaps a few
months of frequent intercourse, with the addition of
two or three books, and the obvious aid of all the re-
collected vices of pretended Christians and pretended
Christian churches, the whole venerable magnifi-
cence of Revelation was annihilated. Its illumina-
tions respecting the Divinity, its miracles, its Messiah,
its authority of moral legislation, its regions of im-
mortality and retribution, the sublime virtues and de-
votion of its prophets, apostles, and martyrs, together
with the reasonings of so many accomplished advo-
cates, and the credibility of history itself, were van-
ished all away; while the convert, exulting in his dis-
enchantment, felt a strange pleasure to behold no-
thing but a dreary train of impostures and credulity,
stretching over those past ages which lately were
gilded with so divine a vision, and the thickest Egyp-
tian shades fallen on that total vast futurity which
the spirit of inspiration had illuminated.

his disciples, he left Judea, and departed again into
Galilee. And he must needs go through Samaria.
Then cometh he to a city of Samaria, which is called
Sychar, near to the parcel of ground that Jacob gave
to his son Joseph. Now Jacob's well was there.
Jesus therefore being wearied with his journey, sat
thus on the well: and it was about the sixth hour.
There cometh a woman of Samaria to draw water,
Jesus saith unto her give me to drink, for his disci-
ples were gone away into the city, to buy meat.-
Then saith the woman of Samaria unto him, How is
it that thou, being a Jew, askest drink of me, who
am a woman of Samaria? for the Jews have no deal-
ings with the Samaritans. Jesus answered and said
unto her, If thou knewest the gift of God, and who
it is that saith unto thee, give me to drink; thou
wouldest have asked him, and he would have given
thee living water. The woman saith unto him, Sir,
thou hast nothing to draw with, and the well is deep:
from whence then hast thou that living water. Art
thou greater than our father Jacob, who gave us the
well, and drank thereof, himself, and his children, and
his cattle? Jesus answered and said unto her, whoso-
ever drinketh of this water, shall thirst again: but
whosoever drinketh of the water that I shall give
him, shall never thirst; but the water that I shall give
him shall be in him, a well of water springing up in-
to everlasting life. The woman saith unto him, Sir,
give me this water, that I thirst not, neither come
hither to draw. Jesus saith unto her, go, call thy
husband, and come hither. The woman answered
and said, I have no husband. Jesus said unto her,
thou hast well said, I have no husband: for thou
hast had five husbands; and he whom thou now hast,
is not thy husband; in that saidst thou truly. The
woman saith unto him, Sir, I perceive that thou art a
prophet. Our fathers worshipped in this mountain;
and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where
men ought to worship. Jesus saith unto her, wo-
man,

ship the Father. Ye worship ye know not what:
We know what we worship; for salvation is of the
Jews. But the hour cometh, and now is when the
true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and
in truth: for the Father seeketh such to worship him.
God is a spirit: and they that worship him, must wor-
ship him in spirit and in truth. The woman saith
unto him, I know that Messias cometh, which is
called Christ: when he is come, he will tell us all
things. Jesus saith unto her, I that speak unto thee
am he. And upon this came his disciples, and mar-
velled that he talked with the woman: Yet no man
said, what seekest thou? or why talkest thou with
her. The woman then left her water pot, and went
her way into the city, and saith to the men, come
see a man that told me all things that ever I did: Is
not this the Christ? Then they went out of the city,
and came unto him. In the mean while his disciples
prayed him, saying, master, eat; but he said unto
them, I have meat to eat that ye know not of.
Therefore said the disciples one to another, hath
any man brought him aught to eat? Jesus saith un-
to them, My meat is to do the will of him that sent
me, and to finish his work. Say not ye, there are
yet four months, and then cometh the harvest? be-
hold I say unto you, lift up your eyes, and look on
the fields; for they are white already to harvest.-
And he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth
fruit unto life eternal; that both he that soweth and,
he that reapeth may rejoice together. And herein is
that saying true, One soweth, and another reapeth.
I sent you to reap that whereon ye bestowed rio la-
bour: Other men laboured, and ye are entered into
their labours. And many of the Samaritans of that
city believed on him for the saying of the woman,
which testified, he told me all that ever I did. So
when the Samaritans were come unto him, they be-
sought him that he would tarry with them: and he
abode there two days. And many more believed on
him because of his own words; and said unto the
woman, Now we believe, not because of thy saying:

THE MILLENNIUM.
COWPER'S TASK.
Sweet is the harp of prophecy; too sweet
Not to be wronged by a mere mortal touch:
Nor can the wonders it records be sung
To meaner music, and not suffer loss.
But when a poet, or when one like me,
Happy to rove among poetic flowers,
Though poor in skill to rear them, lights at last
On some fair theme, some theme divinely fair,
Such is the impulse and the spur he feels,
To give it praise proportioned to its worth,
That not to attempt it, arduous as he deems
The labour, were a task more arduous still.
O scenes surpassing fable, and yet true,
Scenes of accomplished bliss! which who can see,
Though but in distant prospect, and not feel
His soul refreshed with foretaste of the joy?
Rivers of gladness water all the Earth,
And clothe all climes with beauty: the reproach
Of barrenness is past. The fruitful field
Laughs with abundance; and the land, once lean,
Or fertile only in its own disgrace,
Exults to see its thistly curse repealed.
The various seasons woven into one,
And that one season an eternal spring,
The garden fears no blight; and needs no fence,
For there is none to covet, all are full.

Graze with the fearless flocks; all bask at noon
Together, or all gambol in the shade
Of the same grove, and drink one common stream.

Lurks in the serpent now: the mother sees
And smiles to see, her infant's playful hand
Stretched forth to dally with the crested worm,
To stroke his azure neck, or to receive

All creatures worship man, and all mankind
One Lord, one Father. Error has no place:
That creeping pestilence is driven away:
The breath of Heaven has chased it. In the heart
No passion touches a discordant string,
But all is harmony and love. Disease
Is not: the pure and uncontaminate blood
Holds its due course, nor fears the frost of age.
One song employs all nations; and all cry,
“Worthy the Lamb, for he was slain for us.”
The dwellers in the vales and on the rocks
Shout to each other, and the mountain tops
From distant mountains catch the flying joy;
Till, nation after nation taught the strain,
Earth rolls the rapturous Hosannah round.
Behold the measure of the promise filled;
See Salem built, the labour of a God!
Bright as a sun the sacred city shines;
All kingdoms and all princes of the earth
Flock to that light; the glory of all lands
Flows into her; unbounded is her joy,
And endless her increase. Thy rams are there
Nebaioth, and the flocks of Kedar there:
The looms of Ormus, and the mines of Ind,
And Saba's spicy groves, pay tribute there.
Praise is in all her gates: upon her walls,
And in her streets, and in her spacious courts,
Is heard salvation. Eastern Java there
Kneels with the native of the farthest west;
And Ethiopia spreads abroad the hand,
And worships. Her report has travelled forth
Into all lands. From every clime they come
To see thy beauty, and to share thy joy,
O Sion! an assembly such as Earth
Saw
never, such as Heaven stoops down to see.

Unbarr'd the gates of light. There is a cave
Within the mount of God, fast by his throne,
Where light and darkness in perpetual round
Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through
Heaven
Grateful vicissitudes, like day and night;
Light issues forth, and at the other door
Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour
To veil the Heaven, though darkness there might
well
Seem twilight here: And now went forth the Morn
Such as in highest Heaven, array'd in gold
Empyreal; from before her vanish?d Night,
Shot through with orient beams; when all the plain
Cover'd with thick embattled squadrons bright,
Chariots, and flaming arms, and fiery steeds,
Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:
War he perceived, war in procinct; and found
Already known what he for news had thought
To have reported: Gladly then he mix'd
Among those friendly Powers, who him received
With joy and acclamations loud, that one,
That of so many myriads fallen, yet one
Returned not lost. On to the sacred hill
They led him high applauded, and present
Before the seat supreme; from whence a voice,
From midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard:
Servant of God, well done; well hast thou fought
The better fight, who single hast maintain'd
Against revolted multitudes the cause
Of truth, in word mightier than they in arms;
And for the testimony of truth hast borne
Universal reproach, far worse to bear
Than violence; for this was all thy care
To stand approved in sight of God, though worlds
Judged thee perverse: The easier conquest now
Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,
Back on thy foes more glorious to return
Than scorn'd thou didst depart; and to subdue
By force, who reason for their law refuse,

Messiah, who by right of merit reigns.
Go, Michæl, of celestial armies prince,
And thou, in military prowess next,
Gabriel, lead forth to battle these my sons
Invincible; lead forth my armed Saints,
By thousands and by millions, ranged for fight,
E qual in number to that godless crew
Rebellious: Them with fire and hostile arms
Fearless sssault: and, to the brow of Heaven
Pursuing, drive them out from God and bliss,
Into their place of punishment, the gulf
Of Tartarus, which ready opens wide
His fiery Chaos to receive their fall.
So spake the Sovereign Voice, and clouds began
To darken all the hill, and smoke to roll
In dusky wreaths, reluctant flames, the sign
Of wrath awaked; nor with less dread the loud
Ethereal trumpet from on high 'gan blow:
At which command the Powers militant,
That stood for Heaven, in mighty quadrate join'd
Of union irresistible, moved on
In silence their bright legions, to the sound
Of instrumental harmony, that breathed
Heroic ardour to adventurous deeds,
Under their Godlike leaders, in the cause
Of God and his Messiah. On they move
Indissolubly firm; nor obvious hill,
Nor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream divides
Their perfect ranks; for high above the ground
Their march was, and the passive air upbore
Their nimble tread: as when the total kind
Of birds, in orderly array on wing,

Of heaven they march'd, and many a province wide,
Tenfold the length of this terrene: At last,

To set the Envier of his state, the proud

Came towering, arm'd in adamant and gold;
Abdiel that sight endured not, where he stood
Among the mightiest, bent on highest deeds,
And thus his own undaunted heart explores!
O Heaven! that such resemblance of the Highest
Should yet remain, where faith and realty
Remain not: Wherefore should not strength and might
There fail where virtue fails, or weakest prove
Where boldest, though to sight unconquerable?
His puissance, trusting in the Almighty's aid,
I mean to try, whose reason I have tried
Unsound and false; nor is it aught but just,
That he, who in debate of truth hath won,
Should win in arms, in both disputes alike

Victor; though brutish that contest and foul
When reason hath to deal with force, yet so
Most reason is that reason overcome.
So pondering, and from his armed peers
Forth stepping opposite, half way he met
His daring foe, at this prevention more
Incensed, and thus securely him defied.
Proud, art thou met? thy hope was to have reach'd
The height of thy aspiring unopposed,
The throne of God unguarded, and his side
Abandon’d, at the terror of thy power
Or potent tongue: Fool! not to think how vain
Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms;
Who out of smallest things could, without end,
Have raised incessant armies to defeat
Thy folly; or with solitary hand
Reaching beyond all limit, at one blow,
Unaided, could have finish'd thee, and whelm'd
Thy legions under darkness: but thou seest
All are not of thy train: there be, who faith
Prefer, and piety to God, though then
To thee not visible, when I alone
Seem'd in thy world erroneous to dissent
From all: My sect thou seest; now learn too late
How few sometimes may know, when thousands err.
Whom the grand foe, with scornful eye askance,
Thus answerd: Ill for thee, but in wish'd hour
Of my revenge, first sought for, thou return'st
From flight, seditious Angel! to receive
Thy merited reward, the first assay
of this right hand provoked, since first that tongue,
Inspired with contradiction, durst oppose
A third part of the Gods, in synod met
Their deities to assert; who, while they feel
Vigour divine within them, can allow
Omnipotence to none. But well thou comest
Before thy fellows, ambitious to win
From me some plume, that thy success may show
Destruction to the rest; This
pause between
(Unanswer'd lest thou boast,) to let thee know
At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven

To heavenly souls had been all one; but now
I see that most through sloth had rather serve;
Ministering Spirits, train'd up in feast and song!
Such hast thou arm’d, the minstrels of Heaven,
Servility with freedom to contend,
As both their deeds compared this day shall prove.
To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied:
A postate! still thou err'st, nor end wilt find
Of erring, from the path of truth remote:
Unjustly thou depravest it with the name
Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains
Or Nature: God and Nature bid the same,
When he who rules is worthiest, and excels
Them whom he governs. This is servitude,
To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebellid
Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,
Thyself not free, but to thyself enthrall'd;
Yet lewdly darest our ministering upbraid.
Reign thou in Hell, thy kingdom; let me serve
In Heaven God ever bless'd, and his divine
Behests obey, worthiest to be obey’d;
Yet chains in Hell, not realms, expect; Meanwhile
From
me, return’d, as erst thou saidst, from flight,
This greeting on thy impious crest receive.
So saying, a noble stroke he lifted high,
Which hung not, but so swift with tempest fell
On the proud crest of Satan, that no sight,
Nor motion of swift thought, less could his shield,
Such ruin intercept: Ten paces huge
He back recoil'd; the tenth on bended knee
His massy spear upstaid: as if on earth
Winds under ground, or waters forcing way,
Sidelong had push'd a mountain from his seat,
Half sunk with all its pines. Amazement seized
The rebel Thrones, but greater rage, to see
Thus foild their mightiest; ours joy fill'd, and shout,
Presage of victory, and fierce desire
Of battle: Whereat Michael bid sound
The Archangel trumpet; through the vast of Heaven
It sounded, and the faithful armies rung
Hosanna to the Highest: Nor stood at gaze

The adverse legions, nor less hideous join'd
The horrid shock. Now stormy fury rose,
And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now
Was never; arms on armour clashing bray'd
Horrible discord, and the madding wheels
Of brazen chariots raged; dire was the noise
Of conflict; overhead the dismal hiss
Of fiery darts in flaming volleys flew,
And, flying, vaulted either host with fire.
So under fiery cope together rush'd
Both battles main, with ruinous assault
And inextinguishable rage. All Heaven
Resounded; and had Earth been then, all Earth
Had to her centre shook. What wonder? when
Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought
On either side, the least of whom could wield
These elements, and arm him with the force
Of all their regions: How much more of Power
Army against army numberless to raise
Dreadful combustion warring, and disturb,
Though not destroy, their happy native seat;
Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent,
From his strong hold of Heaven, high overruled
And limited their might; though number'd such
As each divided legion might have seem'd
A numerous host; in strength each armed hand
A legion; led in fight, yet leader seem'd
Each warrior single as in chief, expert
When to advance, or stand, or turn the sway
Of battle, open when, and when to close
The ridges of grim war; No thought of flight,
None of retreat, no unbecoming deed
That argued fear; each on himself relied,
As only in his arm the moment lay
Of victory; Deeds of eternal fame
Were done, but infinite; for wide was spread
That war, and various; sometimes on firm ground
A standing fight, then, soaring on main wing,
Tormented all the air; all air seem'd then
Conflicting fire. Long time in even scale
The battle hung; till Satan, who that day

Prodigious power had shown, and met in arms
No equal, raging through the dire attack
Of fighting Seraphim confused, at length
Saw where the sword of Michael smote, and felld
Squadrons at once; with huge two-handed sway
Brandish'd aloft, the horrid edge came down
Wide wasting; such destruction to withstand
He hasted, and opposed the rocky orb
Of tenfold adamant, his ample shield,
A vast circumference. At his approach
The great Archangel from his warlike toil
Surceased, and glad as hoping here to end
Intestine war in Heaven, the archfoe subdued
Or captive dragg’d in chains, with hostile frown
And visage all inflamed first thus began.
Author of evil, unknown till thy revolt,
Unnamed in Heaven, now plenteous as thou seest
These acts of hateful striſe, hateful to all,
Though heaviest by just measure on thyself,
And thy adherents: How hast thou disturb’d
Heaven's blessed peace; and into nature brought
Misery, uncreated till the crime
Of thy rebellion! how hast thou instill'd
Thy malice into thousands, once upright
And faithful, now proved false! But think not here
To trouble holy rest; Heaven casts thee out
From all her confines. Heaven, the seat of bliss,
Brooks not the works of violence and war.
Hence then, and evil go with thee along,
Thy offspring, to the place of evil, Hell;
Thou and thy wicked crew! there mingle broils,
Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom,
Or some more sudden vengeance, wing'd from God,
Precipitate thee with aumented pain.
So spake the Prince of Angels; to whom thus
The Adversary. Nor think thou with wind
Of airy threats to awe whom yet with deeds
Thou canst not. Hast thou turn’d the least of these
To flight, or if to fall, but that they rise
Unvanquish’d, easier to transact with me
That thou shouldst hope, imperious, and with threats

To chase me hence? err not, that so shall end
The strife which thou call'st evil, but we style
The strife of glory; which we mean to win,
Or turn this teaven itself into the Hell
Thou fablest; here however to dwell free,
If not to reign: Meanwhile thy utmost force,
And join him named Almighty to thy aid,
I fly not, but have sought thee far and nigh.
They ended parle, and both address’d for fight
Unspeakable; for who, though with the tongue
Of Angels, can relate, or to what things
Liken on earth conspicuous, that may lift
Human imagination to such height
Of Godlikepower? for likest Gods they seem'd,
Stood they or moved, in stature, motion, arms,
Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven.
Now waved their fiery swords, and in the air
Made horrid circles; two broad suns their shields
Blazed opposite, while Expectation stood
In horror: From each hand with speed retired,
Where erst was thickest fight, the angelic throng,
And left large field, unsafe within the wind
Of such commotion; such as, to set forth
Great things by small, if, nature's concord broke,
Among the constellations war were sprung,
Two planets, rushing from aspéct malign
Of fiercest opposition, in mid sky
Should combat, and their jarring spheres confound.
SPEECH OF MR. BURKE ON DECLINING
THE POLL.
GENTLEMEN, I decline the election.—It has ever
been my rule through life, to observe a proportion
between my efforts and my objects. I have not can-
Vassed the whole of this city in form. But I have
taken such a view of it as satisfies my own mind,
that your choice will not ultimately fall upon me.
Your city, gentlemen, is in a state of miserable dis-
traction; and I am resolved to withdraw whatever

The repo
share my pretensions have had in its unhappy divi-
sions. I have not been in haste; I have tried all
prudent means; I have waited for the effects of all
contingencies.
I am not in the least surprised, nor in the least
angry at this view of things. I have read the book
of life for a long time, and I have read other books a
little. Nothing has happened to me, but what has
happened to men much better than me, and in times
and in nations full «as good as the age and the coun-
try that we live in. To say that I am no way con-
cerned, would be neither decent nor true.
resentation of Bristol was an object on many accounts
dear to me; and I certainly should very far prefer it
to any other in the kingdom. My habits are made
to it; and it is in general more unpleasant to be re-
jected after long trial, than not to be chosen at all.
But, gentlemen, I will see nothing except your
former kindness, and I will give way to no other sen-
timents than those of gratitude. From the bottom of
my
heart I thank you for what you have done to me:
You have given me a long term, which is now ex-
pired. I have performed the conditions, and enjoy-
ed all the profits to the full; and I now surrender
your estate into your hands without being in a single
tile, or a single stone impaired or wasted by my use.
I have served the public for fifteen years.
I have
served you in particular for six.
What is passed is
well stored. It is safe, and out of the power of for-
tune, What is to come, is in wiser hands than ours;
and He, in whose hands it is, best knows whether it
is best for you and me that I should be in parliament,
or even in the world.
Gentlemen, the melancholy event of yesterday
reads to us an awful lesson against being too much
troubled about any of the objects of ordinary ambi-
tion. The worthy gentleman,* who has been snatch-
ed from at the moment of the election, and in the
middle of the contest, while his desires were as warm,
and his hopes as eager as ours, has feelingly told us

what shadows we are, and what shadows we pursue.
It has been usual for a candidate who declines, to
take his leave by a letter to the sheriffs; but I re-
ceived your trust in the face of day; and in the face
of day I accept your dismission. I am not,-I am
not at all ashamed to look upon you; nor can my
presence discompose the order of business here. I
humbly and respectfully take my leave of the sheriffs,
the candidates, and the electors; wishing heartily
that the choice may be for the best, at a time which
calls, if ever time did call, for service that is not
nominal. It is no plaything you are about. I trem-
ble when I consider the trust I have presumed to ask.
I confided too much in my intentions. They were
really fair and upright; and I am bold to say, that I
ask no ill thing for you, when on parting from this
place, I pray that, whoever you choose to succeed
me,
he
may resemble me exactly in all things, ex-
cept in my abilities to serve, and my fortune to please
you.
LODGINGS FOR SINGLE GENTLEMEN.
Who has e'er been in London, that overgrown place,
Has seen
“ Lodgings to Let” stare him full in the
face:
Some are good, and let dearly; while some, 'tis well
known,
Are so dear, and so bad, they are best let alone.-
Will Waddle, whose temper was studious and lonely,
Hired lodgings that took Single Gentlemen only;
But Will was so fat he appear'd like a tun;-
Or like two Single Gentlemen rolled into One.
He enter'd his rooms, and to bed he retreated:
But all night long he felt fever'd and heated;
And, though heavy to weigh, as a score of fat sheep,
He was not, by any means, heavy to sleep.-
Next night, 'twas the same!-and the next!--and the
next!
He perspir'd like an ox; he was nervous, and vex'd

Week pass'd after week, till, by weekly succession,
His weakly condition was past all expression.-
In six months his acquaintance began much to doubt
him;
For his skin like a lady's loose gown, hung about him!
So he sent for a doctor, and cried, like a ninny,
“I've lost many pounds—make me well—there's a
guinea.
The Doctor look'd wise:-“A slow fever,” he said:
Prescrib'd sudorifics--and going to bed. -
“ Sudorifics in bed!” exclaimed Will,“ are humbugs!
I've enough of them there, without paying for drugs!”
Will kick'd out the Doctor:-but, when ill, indeed,
E’en dismissing the Doctor, don't always succeed;
So, calling his host, he said—“Sir, do you know,
I'm the fat Single Gentleman, six months ago?
“Look ye, landlord, I think,” argued Will, with a
grin,
1. That with honest intentions you first took me in:
But from the first night-and to say it I'm bold—
I've been so very hot, that I'm sure I've caught cold!”
Quoth the landlord,_“Till now I ne'er had a dis-
pute;
I've let lodgings ten years,—I'm a baker to boot;
In airing your sheets, Sir, my wife is no sloven;
And
your bed is immediately over my oven.
“The oven!!!”-says Will;--says the host, “ Why
this passion?
In that excellent bed died three people of fashion!
Why so crusty, good Sir?”—“ Żounds!” cried Will
in a taking,
“Who would not be crusty, with half a year's bak-
ing?"
Will paid for his rooms;-cried the host, with a sneer,
“Well, I see you've been going away half-a-year,”
“Friend, we cant well agree;-Yet no quarrel” Will
said;
“But I'd rather not perish, while you make your
bread!”

CHARACTER OF MR. PITT, EARL OF
CHATHAM,
GRATTAN.
The secretary stood alone. Modern degeneracy
had not reached him. Original and unaccommodat-
ing, the features of his character had the hardihood
of antiquity. His august mind overawed majesty,
and one of his sovereigns thought royalty so impaired
in his presence, that he conspired to remove him, in
order to be relieved from his superiority.
No state
chicanery, no narrow system of vicious politics, no
idle contest for ministerial victories, sunk him to the
vulgar level of the great; but, overbearing, persua-
sive, and impracticable, hịs object was England, his
ambition was fame. Without dividing, he destroyed
party; without corrupting, he made a venal age una-
nimous. France sunk beneath him. With one hand
he smote the house of Bourbon, and wielded in the
other the democracy of England. The sight of his
mind was infinite; and his schemes were to affect,
not England, not the present age, but Europe and
posterity. Wonderful were the means by which these
schemes were accomplished; always seasonable, al-
ways adequate, the suggestions of an understanding
animated by ardour, and enlightened by prophecy.
The ordinary feelings which make life amiable and
indolent were unknown to him. No doməstic diffi-
culties, no domestic weakness reached him; but
aloof from the sordid occurrences of life, and unsul-
lied by its intercourse, he came occasionally into our
system, to counsel and to decide.
À character so
exalted, so strenuous, so various, so authoritative, as-
tonished a corrupt age, and the treasury trembled at
the name of Pitt through all her classes of venality.
Corruption imagined, indeed, that she had found de-
fects in this statesman, and talked much of the incon-
sistency of his glory, and much of the ruin of his vic-
tories; but the history of his country and the calami-
ties of the enemy, answered and refuted her.
Nor were his political abilities his only talents; his

eloquence was an æra in the senate, peculiar and
spontaneous, familiarly expressing gigantic senti-
ments and instinctive wisdom; not like the torrent of
Demosthenes, or the splendid conflagration of Tully;
it resembled sometimes the thunder, and sometimes
the music of the spheres. Like Murray, he did not
conduct the understanding through the painful sub-
tilty of argumentation; nor was he like Townsend, for-
ever on the rack of exertion; but rather lightened
upon the subject, and reached the point by the flash-
ings of the mind, which like those of his eye, were
felt, but could not be followed. Upon the whole,
there was in this man something that could create,
subvert, or reform; an understanding, a spirit, and
an eloquence, to summon mankind to society, or to
break the bonds of slavery asunder, and to rule the
wilderness of free minds with unbounded authority;
something that could establish or overwhelm empire,
and strike a blow in the world that should resound
through the universe.
FROM LORD BYRON'S CHILDE HAROLD.

Oh Time! the beautifier of the dead,
Adorner of the ruin, comforter
And only healer when the heart hath bled

The test of truth, love,--sole philosopher,
For all beside are sophists, from thy thrift,
Which never loses tho it doth defer
Time, the avenger! unto thee I lift
My hands, and eyes, and heart, and crave of thee a
gift:
Amidst this wreck, where thou hast made a shrine
And temple more divinely desolate,
Among thy mightier offerings here are mine,
Ruins of years—tho' few-yet full of fate:
If thou hast ever seen me too elate,
Hear me not; but if calmly I have borne

Good, and reserved my pride against the hate
Which shall not whelm me, let me not have worn
This iron in my soul in vain-shall they not mourn?
And thou, who never yet of human wrong
Lost the unbalanced scale, great Nemesis!
Here where the ancient paid thee homage long-
Thou, who didst call the Furies from the abyss,
And round Orestes bade them howl and hiss
For that unnatural retribution-just,
Had it but been from hands less near-in this
Thy former realm, I call thee from the dust!
Dost thou not hear my heart?--Awake thou shalt
and must.
It is not that I may not have incurr'd
For my ancestral faults or mine the wound
I bleed withal, and had it been conferr'd
With a just weapon, it had flowed unbound;
But now my blood shall not sink in the ground;
To thee I do devote it—thou shalt take
The vengeance which shall yet be sought and found,
Which if I have not taken for the sake-
But let that pass—I sleep, but thou shalt yet awake.
And if my voice break forth, 'tis not that now
I shrink from what is suffered: let him speak
Who hath beheld decline upon my brow,
Or seen my mind's convulsion leave it weak;
But in this page a record will I seek.
Not in the air shall these my words disperse,
Tho' I be ashes; a far hour shall wreak
The deep prophetic fulness of this verse,
And pile on human heads the mountain of my curse!
That curse shall be forgiveness.—Have I not-
Hear me, my mother Earth! behold it Heaven!
Have I not had to wrestle with
my
lot?
Have I not suffered things to be forgiven?
Have I not had my brain seared, my heart riven,
Hopes sapp'd, name blighted, Life's life lied away?
And only not to desperation driven,

Because not altogether of such clay
As rots into the souls of those whom I survey.
From mighty wrongs to petty perfidy
Have I not seen what human things could do?
From the loud roar of foaming calumny
To the small whisper of the as paltry few,
And subtler venom of reptile crew,
The Janus glance of whose significant eye,
Learning to lie with silence, would seem true,
And without utterance, save the shrug or sigh,
Deal round to happy fools its speechless obloquy.
But I have lived, and have not lived in vain:
My mind may lose its force, my blood its fire,
And my frame perish even in conquering pain,
But re is that within me whi shall tire
Torture and Time, and breathe when I expire;
Something unearthly, which they deem not of,
Like the remembered tone of a mute lyre,
Shall on their softened spirits sink, and move
In hearts all rocky now the late remorse of love.
